i heard people talking about china and also i talked to friends about china
and chinese internet something is very challenging to me i want to make my friends understand
china is complicated so i always want to tell the story like one hand it is that the other hand is that
you can 't just tell a one sided story i 'll give an example china is a bric country bric country means brazil russia india and china this emerging economy really is helping the revival of the world economy but at the same time
on the other hand china is a sick country
so basically china is a sick bric country
so if you are a fan of the game of thrones you definitely know how important a big wall is for an old kingdom
it prevents weird things from the north same was true for china
that 's the biggest digital boundary in the whole world it 's not only to defend the chinese regime from overseas from the universal values but also to prevent china 's own citizens to access the global free internet and even separate themselves into blocks not
united so basically the internet
but we also use a very simple metaphor the cat and the mouse game to describe in the past fifteen years the continuing fight between chinese censorship government censorship the cat
and the chinese internet users that means us the mouse
but sometimes this kind of a metaphor is too simple so today i want to upgrade it to two point zero version
in china we have five hundred million internet users that 's the biggest population of netizens internet users in the whole world so even though china 's is a totally censored internet but still chinese internet
every single international web two point zero service and we chinese copycat every one
because we have three hundred million microbloggers in china it 's the entire population of the united states
so when these three hundred million people microbloggers even they block the tweet in our censored platform but itself the chinanet but itself can create very powerful energy which has never happened in the chinese history
ten million criticisms of the posting
and also recently very funny debate between the beijing environment ministry and the american embassy in beijing
because the ministry blamed the american embassy for intervening in chinese internal politics by disclosing the air quality data of beijing
so the up is the embassy data the pm two point five he showed one hundred and forty eight they showed it 's dangerous for the sensitive group so a suggestion it 's not good to go outside
ministry 's data he shows fifty he says it 's good it 's good to go outside
but ninety nine percent of chinese microbloggers stand firmly on the embassy 's side i live in beijing every day i just watch the american embassy 's data to decide whether i should open my window but
chinese is always cheating right
so because of this the chinese really regard this microblogging as a media not only a headline to media and also
the clone sina company is the guy who cloned twitter it even has its own name with weibo weibo is the chinese translation for microblog
it has its own innovation at the commenting area it makes the chinese weibo more like facebook rather than the original twitter so these innovations and clones as the weibo and microblogging when it came to china in two thousand
to exist for the chinese public
but also chinese social media is really changing chinese mindsets and chinese life for example they give the voiceless people a channel to make your voice heard we had a petition system it 's a remedy outside
the judicial system because the chinese central government wants to keep a myth the emperor is good the old local officials are thugs so that 's why the petitioner the victims the peasants want to take the train to beijing to petition to the central government they want the emperor to settle the problem
so your sad stories by some chance your story will be picked up by reporters professors or celebrities one of them is yao chen she is the most popular microblogger in china who has about twenty one million followers they 're almost like a
for three hundred million people every day chatting together talking together it 's like a big ted right
but also it is like the first time a public sphere
it is automatically recorded and data mined
and reported to a poll for further political analyzing even if you want to have some gathering before you go there the police are already waiting for you
why because they have the data they have everything in their hands so they can use the one thousand nine hundred and eighty four scenario data mining of the dissident so the crackdown is very serious
without bribing the central cats he can do nothing only apologize
so these three years in the past three years social movements about microblogging really changed local government became more and more transparent because they can 't access the data the server is in beijing
the story about the train crash
maybe the question is not about why ten million criticisms in five days but why the chinese central government allowed the five days of freedom of speech online it 's never happened before
but if you dare to retweet or mention any fake coup about beijing you definitely will be arrested
so this kind of freedom is a targeted and precise window so chinese in china censorship is normal something you find is freedom is weird something will happen behind
millions of chinese people in the cultural revolution to destroy every local government it 's very simple because chinese central government doesn 't need to even lead the public opinion they just give them a target window to not censor people
a political tool so that 's the update about this game
it 's like a training of their citizenship preparing for future democracy but it didn 't change the chinese political system and also the chinese central government utilized this centralized
so what 's the future
and also like facebook and google they claim they are friends of the mouse but sometimes we see them dating the cats
so my conclusion is very simple we chinese fight for our freedom you just watch your bad cats don 't let them hook up with the chinese cats
only in this way in the future we will achieve the dreams of the mouse that we can tweet anytime anywhere without fear the past several days
