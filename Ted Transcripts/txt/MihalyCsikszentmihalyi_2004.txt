grew up in europe and
world war ii caught me when i was between seven and ten years old and
i realized how few of the grown ups that i able to withstand the
tragedies that the war visited on them how few of them could
even resemble a normal contented satisfied happy life once
once job their home their
and i tried as a child as a teenager to read philosophy and to get involved in art and religion and many other
ways that i could see as a possible answer to that question and finally i ended up psychology by
chance actually i was at a
ski resort in switzerland without any money to actually enjoy myself because the
snow had melted and there was i didn't have money to go to a movie but i found that on the i read in the newspapers that there was to be
in the center of zurich and it was
about flying saucers he was going to talk and i thought well since i can't go to the movies at least i will go
for free to listen to flying saucers
and the man who talked at that evening lecture
was very interesting and it actually instead of talking about little green men he talked about how the psyche of the europeans had been traumatized by the war and now they're projecting
flying saucers into the sky kind of
he talked about how the mandalas of ancient hindu religion were kind of projected into the sky
as an attempt to regain some sense of order after the chaos of war
and this seemed very interesting to me and i started reading his books after that lecture and that was carl jung whose name or work i had no idea about
then i came to this country to study psychology and i started trying to understand
these roots of happiness this is a typical result that many people have presented and there are many variations on it but
their life is very happy and that hasn't changed at all whereas the personal income on a scale that has been held constant
for inflation has more than doubled almost tripled in that period
but you find essentially the same results namely that after a certain basic point which corresponds more or less to just a few one thousand dollars above the minimum
poverty level increases in material well being don't seem to affect how happy people are
and in fact you can find that the lack of basic resources material resources
the increase in material resources do not increase
so my research has been focused more
after finding out these things that actually
do we feel really happy and to
start that those studies about forty years ago i began to look at creative
people first artists and scientists and so forth trying to understand
what made them feel that it was
doing things for which many of them didn't expect either fame or fortune but which made their life meaningful and
doing this was one of the leading composers of american music back in the seventies and the interview was forty pages long but
this little excerpt is a very good summary of what he was saying during the interview and it describes how he feels
when composing is going well and he says by describing it as an ecstatic state now ecstasy in greek meant simply to stand to the side of something and then it became
essentially an analogy for a mental state where you feel that you are not doing your ordinary everyday routines
so ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative reality
and it's interesting if you think about it how
when we think about the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement whether it's
china greece hindu civilization or
what we know about them is really about their ecstasies not about their everyday life we know the temples they built so where people could come to experience a different reality
we know about the circuses the arenas the theaters
these are the remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went to
experience life in a more concentrated
ordered form now this man doesn't need to go
to a place like this which is also this place this arena which is built like a greek amphitheatre is a place for ecstasy also
we are participating in a reality which is different from that of everyday life that we're used to but this man doesn't need to go to there he needs just a piece of paper
he can put down little marks and as he does that he can imagine sounds that had not existed before in that particular combination
once he gets to that point of beginning to create like jennifer did in her improvisation a new reality that is
moment of ecstasy he enters that different reality
now he says also that this is so intense an experience that it feels almost as if he didn't exist
in order to hear me and understand what i'm saying you need to process about sixty bits per second that's why you can't hear more than two people you can't understand more than two people talking to you
well when you are really involved in this
completely engaging process of creating something new as this man does he doesn't have enough
attention left over to monitor how his body feels or his problems at home
he can't feel even that he 's hungry or tired
his body disappears his identity disappears from his consciousness because he doesn't have enough
attention like none of us do to really do well something that requires a lot of
and at the same time to feel that he exists so existence is temporarily suspended
and he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself
i could look at my hand for two weeks and i wouldn't feel any awe or wonder because i can't compose so what is that telling you here but in other parts of the interview is that obviously this
process that he 's describing can only happen to someone who is
well trained and who has developed technique and it has become a kind of
with less than ten years of to be able to
begin to change something in a way that it's better than what was there before now when that happens
the music just flows out and because all of these people i started interviewing this was an interview which is over thirty years old
so many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow that i called this type of experience the flow experience and it happens in different a poet describes it
in this form this is by a student of mine who interviewed some of the leading writers and poets in the united states and it describes
the same effortless spontaneous feeling that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state this poet describes it as opening a door that floats up in the sky
very similar description to what albert einstein gave as to how he imagined the forces of relativity when he was
but it happens in other activities for instance this is another student of mine
susan jackson from australia who
work with some of the leading athletes in the world and
you see here in this description of an olympic skater the same essential description of the phenomenology of the inner state of the person
you don't think it goes automatically if you merge yourself with the music and so forth
it happens also actually in the most recent book i wrote called good business where i interviewed some of the ceos
who had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful and very ethical very socially responsible you see that these people define success as
something that helps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it and like all of these successful and responsible ceos say you can't
have just one of these things to be successful
if you want a meaningful
job and successful job anita roddick is another one of these ceos
we interviewed she is the founder of body shop the cosmetic kind of natural cosmetic king it's kind of a passion that comes from doing the best and having flow while you're working
this is an interesting little quote from masaru ibuka who was at that time
where engineers can feel the joy of technological innovation
be aware of their mission to society
and work to their heart 's content i couldn't improve on this as a good example of how flow enters the workplace now when we do studies
we have with other colleagues around the world done over eight thousand interviews of people from dominican monks to blind nuns to himalayan climbers
navajo shepherds who enjoy their work and regardless of the culture regardless of education or whatever there are these seven
conditions that seem to be there when a person is in flow there's this focus that once it becomes intense leads to a sense of ecstasy a sense of clarity
you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other you get immediate feedback you know that what you need to do is possible to do even though difficult
and sense of time disappears you forget yourself you feel part of something larger and once those conditions are present what you are doing becomes
doing for its own sake in our studies we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme
and we can measure this very precisely actually because we give people electronic pagers that go off ten times a day and whenever they go off you say what you're doing how you feel
where you are what you're thinking about and two things that we measure is the amount of challenge people
average which is the center of the diagram that would be your mean level of challenge and skill which will be different from that of anybody else but you have a kind of a set point there
which would be in the middle
if we know what that set point is we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow and it will be when your challenges
skills are higher than average and you may be doing things very differently from other people
but for everyone that flow channel that area there will be when you are doing what you really like to do play the piano
probably be with your best friend
perhaps work if work is what provides flow for you and then the other areas become less and less positive arousal is still good because you are over
your skills are not quite as high as they should be but you can move into flow fairly easily by just developing a little more skill
so arousal is the area where most people learn from because that's where they're pushed beyond
their comfort zone and that to enter going back to flow then they develop higher skills
control is also a good place to be because
there you feel comfortable but not very excited it's not very challenging any more
and if you want to enter flow from control you have to increase the
so those two are ideal and complementary areas from which flow is easy to go into
the other combinations of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal relaxation is fine you still feel ok boredom begins to be very
and apathy becomes very negative you don't feel that you're doing anything you don't use your skills there's no challenge unfortunately a lot of
to that experience is watching television the next one is being in the bathroom sitting and
even though sometimes watching television about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow but that's when you choose a program you really want to watch and you get
feedback from it so the question we are trying to address and i'm way over time is how to put more and more
everyday life in that flow channel and that is the kind of challenge that we're trying to
understand and some of you obviously know how to do that spontaneously without any advice but unfortunately a lot of people don 't and that's what
mandate is in a way to do
