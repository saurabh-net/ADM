when i knew i was going to come and speak to you
that big four feet nothing larger than the sum of her figurative parts you still with me
i called her up hello how 're you doing baby hey ma i got to talk to you you 're talking to me already what's the matter i said i 've got to talk to a bunch of nice people
nice people except when you went to the white house
it's technology entertainment and design
you design a story when you make it up it's entertainment when you tell it and you're going to use a microphone
pearls of wisdom leaping from my lips like lemmings is no good for you my pop
he grew up in a bohio of dirt floors and the structure was the kind used by the tainos our old arawak ancestors
my father is at once quick witted
i already heard your mother i think she's right
after what i just told you
good storytelling is crafting a story that someone wants to listen to great story is the art of letting go
from the mists of avalon back in time but further still
we were doing the pictographs on walls in moist damp caves
moist damp caves been watching the commercials
because every one of us has this desire for once just once to tell our story and have it heard
late at night to a friend
maybe once in your life
and then there are stories
we whisper into a stygian darkness it's about human connection
my cuban mother which i just briefly introduced you to in that short character sketch
a small southern town and in that little southern town i grew up and grew up hearing these stories but this story only happened a few years ago
i called my mom it was a saturday morning and i was calling about how to make ajiaco it's a cuban meal it's delicious it's savory it makes spit froth in the little corners of your mouth it makes your armpits juicy you know
food yeah this is the sensory part of the program people
i called my mother and she said carmen i need you to come please i need to go to the mall and you know your father now he takes a nap in the afternoon and i got to go i got an errand to run let me
esther my mother had stopped driving several years ago to the collective relief of the entire city of atlanta
any vehicular outing with that woman from the time i was a young child guys naturally included flashing blue lights but she'd become adept at dodging
the boys in blue and when she did meet them oh she had wonderful
did you know that was you don't speak english
and that meant that everyone in the family had to sign up to take her to have her hair dyed you know that peculiar color of blue that matches her polyester pants suit
this is the woman that wants me to come on a saturday morning when i have a lot to do but it doesn't take long because cuban guilt is a weighty thing
political on you but and so i go to my mother 's i show up she's in the carport of course they have a carport the kind with the corrugated roof you know the buick 's parked outside and she's jingling jangling a pair of keys i got a surprise
she gets into the car she's sitting on two phone books i can't even make this part up because she's that tiny she's engineered an umbrella so she can bam slam the door
and so we left my father fast asleep down because
they expect you to use them and there she goes
she has been out and not been stopped so
we can talk it'll be a diversion it'll help my breathing it'll do something for my pulse maybe mommy i know you have been stopped
ok so i stopped at a light and there's a guy you know in the back would this guy have like a blue uniform
and a terrified look on his face
i have to tell you as she did because it loses something if i
and he does a thing like this you
you i
like a cat batting back a mouse batting back a mouse left paw right paw left paw right
the mall now you all have all been at a mall during the holidays yes talk to
so first i say ma why are we here you mean like in the are we here today
because i have to exchange your father
do i want to walk in because unless i have ariadne 's thread to anchor enough metaphors for you somewhere
i may not get out but you know
why do we have to take pop 's underwear back now and why what is wrong with
he 's supposed to buy the
why i read it on the internet you cannot have
now we have now crawled another four feet
my mother finally says to me i knew it i knew it i'm an immigrant we make a space what i tell you right there and she points out the passenger window and i look out and three three aisles down
three aisles down look the
look the know that honey
get out of the car and go stand in the parking space
this is you know you'd think by now i'm and
the car knocks out the phone books and then she walks around she's carrying her cheap kmart purse with her around the front of the car
speed for a woman her age too before i know it she has skiddled across the parking lot and in between the cars and people behind me with that kind of usual religious charity that the holidays bring us
a brevity brevity of everything with this child you know she eats small portions language is something to be meted out in small phonemes you know just
but she pauses occasionally and says how do you spell that
she writes the expose in about twenty years don't believe a word of it but this is my daughter lauren my remarkable daughter my borderline asperger 's kid she says ma
she says ma now when this
i look in bewildered awe she's standing those rockports slightly apart but grounded she's holding out that cheap kmart purse and she is wielding it she's of steel
of steel with the sheer force
with the sheer force saying things like
saying things like it
ready brace yourselves here it comes no my daughter she's coming in the buick honey sit up so they can see you
i finally come and now it's the south i don't know what part of the country you live in
but in the south we love a good story people have pulled aside i mean they've come out of that queue line they have popped their trunks pulled out lawn chairs and cool drinks bets are placed i 'm with the little lady damn
i'm thinking accelerator break accelerator break like you've never thought that in your life right yeah i pull in i put the car in park engine 's still running mine not the car
some of them you've got to make up people some
some to
to after i say
i gave it up with pantyhose they're both
i turn around but it's not a child it's a young woman a little taller than i pale green amused eyes with her is a young man husband brother lover
it's not my job and she says pardon me ma 'am that's how we talk down there is that your mother
women around parking lots to see if they'll stop yes it's my mother the boy now he says well what my sister meant they look at each other it 's a knowing glance god
i said look please let me take care of her ok because i know her and believe me she's like a small atomic weapon you know you just want to handle her really gingerly
and the girl goes i know but i mean i swear to god she reminds us of our mother
he turns to her on the heel of his shoe it's a half whisper
they turn then shoulder to shoulder and walk away lost in their own reverie
you crazy probably for about fourteen fifteen more years if you're lucky but after that honey
but after that honey going
