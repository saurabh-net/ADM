tell you about a project which i started about sixteen years ago and it's about making new forms of life
and these are made of this kind of
electricity tube we call it in holland and we can start a film about that
about that i want
forms of life on the beaches and they should survive over there on their own in the future
to live on their own walk on their own
the mechanical beasts will not get their energy from food but from the wind
the wind will move feathers on their back which will drive their feet
the beast walks sideways on the wet sand of the beach with its nose pointed into the wind
and walks in the opposite direction is a herd and
it is built according genetical codes and it is a sort of race and each and every animal is different and the winning codes
this is the wave going from left to right you can see this one
and now it goes from yes now it goes from left to right this is a new generation a new family which is able to store
so the wings pump up air in lemonade bottles which are on top of that and they can use that energy
in case the wind falls away and the tide is coming up and there is still a little bit of energy to reach the dunes and save their lives
because they are drowned very easily
i could show you this animal
the proportion of the tubes in this animal is very important for the walking
there are eleven numbers which i call the eleven holy numbers these are the distances of the tubes which makes it walk that way in fact it's a new invention of the wheel
it works the same as a wheel the axis of a wheel is staying on the same level and this hip is staying on the same level as well
better than a wheel because when you try to drive with your bicycle on the beach you will notice it's very hard to do and
the feet just step over the sand
to touch every piece of the ground in between
so five thousand years after the invention of the wheel
very heavy loads can be the
on the stored winds in the bottles it has a feeler where it can feel obstacles and turn around and that stuff you see is going to it the other way have the feeler here
they have to survive all the dangers of the beach
big dangers is the sea this is the sea and it must
and it must the water
this is the water feeler and what's very important is this
it sucks in air normally
but when it swallows water it feels the resistance of it so imagine that the animal is walking
as soon as it touches the water you should hear a sort of
so if it doesn't feel it will be drowned ok
we have the brain of the animal
in fact it is a step counter and it counts the steps it's a binary step counter so as soon it has been to the
it changes the pattern of zeroes and ones here
it knows always where it is on the beach so it's very simple brain the biggest
the biggest the storms
this is a part of the nose of
and when the nose is fixed of the animal the whole animal is fixed
when the storm is coming
the whole animal is fixed the wind may turn but the animal will turn always its nose into the wind
now another couple of years and these animals will survive on their own i still have to help them a lot thank you very much i would like to
