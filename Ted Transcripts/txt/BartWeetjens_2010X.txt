i'm here today to share with you an extraordinary journey extraordinarily rewarding journey actually which brought me into
training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis
as a child i had two passions one was a passion for rodents
all kinds of rats mice hamsters gerbils squirrels you name it i bred it and i sold them to
i also had a passion for africa growing up in a multicultural environment we had african students in the house and i learned about their stories
different backgrounds dependency on imported know how goods services exuberant cultural diversity
i started working in the industry but i wasn't really happy to contribute to a material consumer society
in a linear extracting and manufacturing mode i quit my job to focus on the real world problem
talking ninety five now princess diana is announcing on tv that landmines form a structural barrier
to any development which is really true as long as these devices are there or there is suspicion of landmines you can't really enter into the land actually there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors sustainable
because aren't they vermin well actually rats are contrary to what most people think about them rats are
left and right there the animal finds a mine it scratches on the soil and the animal comes back for a food reward very very simple
very sustainable in this environment here the animal gets its food reward and that's how it works very very simple
now why would you use rats rats have been used since the fifties last century in all kinds of experiments rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species
they're extremely sensitive to smell moreover they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about
how do we communicate with rats well don't talk rat but we have a clicker a standard method for animal training which you see there
a clicker which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behaviors first of all we associate the click sound with a food reward which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe
once the animal knows click food click food click food so click is food we bring it in a cage with
and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed and to do that for five seconds five seconds which is long for a rat once the animal knows this we make the task a bit more difficult
it learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes up to ten holes then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets in the next step
there's a number of mines placed blindly and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the
just like dogs by the way maybe one slight difference we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog
this is our team in mozambique one tanzanian trainer who transfers the skills to these three mozambican fellows and you should see the pride in the eyes of these people they have a skill
which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid moreover this small team together with of course you need the heavy vehicles and the manual deminers to follow up
with this small investment in a rat capacity we have demonstrated in mozambique that we can reduce the cost price per sq meter
up to sixty percent of what is currently normal two dollars per sq meter we do it at one point one eight and we can still bring that price down question of scale
if you can bring in more rats we can actually make the output even bigger we have a demonstration site in mozambique
eleven african governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology they have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the great lakes region and
they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines but let me bring you to a very different problem and there's about six thousand people last year that walked on a landmine but
last year almost one point nine million died from tuberculosis as a first cause of infection especially in africa where t b and hiv are strongly linked there is a huge
common problem microscopy the standard who procedure reached from forty to sixty percent reliability
in tanzania the numbers don't lie forty five percent of people t b patients b secondary infections and
if however you are detected very early diagnosed early treatment can start and even in hiv positives
it makes sense you can actually cure t b even in hiv positives
so in our common language dutch the name for
which etymologically refers to the smell of tar already the old chinese and
actually published documented that t b can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from
patients so what we did is we collected some samples just as a way of testing from hospitals trained rats on them and
this works and wonder well we can reach eighty nine percent sensitivity eighty six percent specificity using
how it works and really this is a generic technology
how does it work you have a cassette with
of a second to discriminate the scent so it goes extremely fast here it's already at the third sample
which patients are positive which are
like this provided that you have rats and we have now currently twenty five tuberculosis rats
a cage like this operating throughout the day can process one thousand six hundred and eighty samples
five clinics in dar es salaam on a population of five hundred thousand people where fifteen thousand reported to get
we were able to increase case detection rates by over thirty percent throughout last year we've been
depending on which intervals you take we've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in dar es salaam between thirty and forty percent
so this is really considerable knowing that a missed patient by microscopy infects up to fifteen people healthy people per year
you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives at least our hero rats have saved lots of lives the way forward for us is now to standardize this technology
and there are simple things like for instance we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds so to standardize this also to standardize the
and to semi automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people
to conclude there are also other applications at the horizon here is a first prototype of our camera rat which is a rat with a rat backpack
with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on this is in a prototype stage we don't have a working system here yet
to conclude i would actually like to say you may think this is about rats these projects but in the end it is about people it is about empowering vulnerable communities
to tackle difficult expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks and
doing that with a local resource plenty available so something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about
the resources surrounding you whether they are environmental technological animal or human and to respectfully harmonize with them in order
to foster a sustainable work thank you very much
