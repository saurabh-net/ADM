it's wonderful to be in the presence of an organization
really making a difference in the world and i'm intensely grateful for the opportunity to speak to you today
and i'm also rather surprised because when i look back
on my life the last thing i ever wanted to do was write or be in any way involved in religion
after i left my convent i'd finished with religion frankly i thought that was it and for thirteen years i kept clear of it i wanted to be an english literature professor
and i certainly didn't even want to be a writer particularly but then i suffered a series of career catastrophes one after the other and finally found myself in television
i said that to bill moyers and he said oh we take anybody
and i was doing some rather controversial religious programs this went down very well in the u k
where religion is extremely unpopular and so for once for the only time in my life i was finally in the mainstream
but i got sent to jerusalem to make a film about early christianity and there for the first time i encountered the other religious traditions judaism and islam
sister religions of christianity and while i found i knew nothing about these faiths at all despite my own intensely religious background
i'd seen judaism only as a kind of prelude to christianity and i knew nothing about islam at all
but in that city that tortured city where you see the three faiths jostling so uneasily together you also become aware
the profound connection between them and it has been the study of other religious traditions that brought me back to a sense of what religion can be and actually enabled me to look at my own faith in a different light
and i found some astonishing things in the course of my study that had never occurred to me frankly in the days that when i thought i'd had it with religion i just found the whole thing absolutely incredible
these doctrines seemed unproven abstract and
to my astonishment when i began seriously studying other traditions i began to realize that
belief which we make such a fuss about today is only a very recent religious
surfaced only in the west in about the seventeenth century the word belief itself originally meant to love
to prize to hold dear in the seventeenth century it narrowed its focus for reasons that i'm exploring in a book i'm writing at the moment
to include to mean an intellectual assent to a set of propositions
i believe it did no mean i accept certain creedal articles of faith it meant i commit myself i engage myself
indeed some of the world traditions think very little of religious orthodoxy in the
if religion is not about believing things what is it about what i've found across the board is that religion is about behaving differently
and religious doctrines are meant to be summons to action you only understand them when you put them into practice now pride of place
in this practice is given to compassion and it is an arresting fact that right across the board in every single one
of the major world faiths compassion the ability to feel with the other in the way we've been thinking about this evening
not only the test of any true religiosity it is also what will bring us into the presence of what jews christians and muslims call god or the divine
it is compassion says the buddha which brings you to nirvana
why because in compassion when we feel with the other we dethrone ourselves from the center of our world and we put another person there
and once we get rid of ego then we're ready to see the divine and in particular every single one of the major world traditions
has highlighted has said and put at the core of their tradition what's become known as the golden rule
first propounded by confucius five centuries before christ do not do to others what you would not like them to do to you that he said was the central
thread which ran through all his teaching and that his disciples should put into practice all day and every day and it was
the golden rule would bring them to the transcendent value that he called ren human heartedness which was a transcendent experience in itself
this is absolutely crucial to the monotheisms too there's a famous story about the great rabbi hillel the older contemporary of jesus
a pagan came to him and offered to convert to judaism if the rabbi could recite the whole of jewish teaching while he stood on one leg
hillel stood on one leg and said that which is hateful to you do not do to your neighbor that is the torah the rest is
it was what he meant he said in your exegesis you must make it clear that every single verse of the torah
is a commentary a gloss upon the golden rule the great rabbi meir said that
scripture he says teaches nothing but charity and we must not leave an interpretation of scripture until we have found a compassionate interpretation of it
and this struggle to find compassion in some of these rather rebarbative texts is a good dress rehearsal for doing the same in ordinary life
now look at our world
and we are living in a world that is where religion has been hijacked
where terrorists cite qur 'anic verses to justify their atrocities
where instead of taking jesus words love your enemies
don't judge others we have the spectacle of christians endlessly judging other people
religion has been used to oppress others and this is because of human ego human greed
we have a talent as a species for messing up wonderful things so the traditions also insisted
and this is an important point i think that you could not and must not confine your compassion to your own group
your own nation your own co religionists your own fellow countrymen you must have what one of the chinese sages called jian ai concern for everybody
we formed you says the qur 'an into tribes and nations so that you may know one another
and this again this universal outreach is getting subdued in the strident use of religion abuse of religion for
do for a living inform me that religion has been the cause of all the major world wars in history wrong
the cause of our present woes are political
make no mistake about it religion is a kind of fault line
and when a conflict gets ingrained in a region
religion can get sucked in and become part of the problem
seventy million people died in europe alone as a result of armed conflict and so many of
institutions even football which used to be a pleasant pastime
causes riots where people even die and it's not surprising that religion too has been affected by this violent ethos
there's also a great deal i think of religious illiteracy around people seem to think now equate religious faith with believing things
as though that we call religious people often believers as though that were the main thing that they do and very often
secondary goals get pushed into the first place in place of compassion and the golden rule because the golden rule is difficult i sometimes when i'm speaking to
because religion a lot of religious people prefer to be right rather than
that's not the whole story since september the eleventh when my work on islam suddenly propelled me into public life in a way that i'd never imagined
i've been able to sort of go all over the world and finding everywhere i go a yearning for change i've just come back from pakistan
where literally thousands of people came to my lectures because they were yearning first of all to hear a friendly western voice
and especially the young people were coming
and were asking me the young people were saying what can we do what can we do to change things
hosts in pakistan said look don't be too polite to us tell us where we're going wrong let 's talk together
about where religion is failing because it seems to me that with our current situation is so serious at the moment
any ideology that doesn't promote a sense of global understanding and global appreciation
of each other is failing the test of the time and religion with its wide following
here in the united states people may be being religious in a different way as a report has just shown but they still want to be religious
only western europe that has retained its secularism which is now beginning to look rather endearingly old fashioned
but people want to be religious and religion should be made to be a force for harmony in the world which it can and should be
because of the golden rule do not do to others what you would not have them do to you an ethos that should now be applied globally
we should not treat other nations as we would not wish to be treated ourselves and these whatever our wretched beliefs
is a religious matter it's a spiritual matter it's a profound moral matter that engages and should engage us all
and as i say there is a hunger for change out there here in the united states i think you see it in this election campaign
longing for change and people in churches all over and mosques all over this continent
september eleventh coming together locally to create networks of understanding with the mosque with the synagogue
saying we must start to speak to one another i think it's time that we moved beyond the idea of toleration and move toward appreciation
of the other i'd there's one story i'd just like to mention this comes from the iliad
it tells you what this spirituality should be you know the story of the iliad the ten year war between greece and troy in one incident achilles the famous warrior of greece takes his troops out of the war
and the whole war effort suffers and in the course of the ensuing muddle his beloved friend patroclus is killed and killed in single combat by one of the trojan princes hector
and achilles goes mad with grief and rage and revenge and he mutilates the body he kills
hector he mutilates his body and then he refuses to give the body back for burial to the family
which means that in greek ethos hector 's soul will wander eternally lost
then one night priam king of troy an old man comes into the greek camp incognito makes his way to achilles tent
to ask for the body of his son
and everybody is shocked when the old man takes off his head covering and shows himself and achilles looks at him and thinks of his father and he starts to weep
and priam looks at the man who has murdered so many of his sons
and he too starts to weep
and the sound of their weeping filled the house the greeks believed that weeping together created a bond between people
and then achilles takes the body of hector he hands it very tenderly to the father
the two men look at each other and see each other as divine
that is the ethos found too in all the religions it's what is meant by overcoming the horror that we feel when we
under threat of our enemies and beginning to appreciate the other it's of great importance that the word for holy in hebrew applied to god is kadosh separate other
and it is often perhaps the very otherness of our enemies which can give us intimations of that utterly mysterious transcendence which is god
and now here 's my wish
i wish that you would help with the creation launch and propagation
of a charter for compassion
crafted by a group of inspirational thinkers from the three abrahamic traditions of judaism christianity and islam and based on the fundamental principle of the golden rule
we need to create a movement among all these people that i meet in my travels you probably meet too who want to join up
in some way and reclaim their faith which they feel as i say has been hijacked we need
to empower people to remember the compassionate ethos and to give guidelines this charter would not be a massive document i'd like to see it
to give guidelines as to how to interpret the scriptures these texts that are being abused
and the idea too of jews christians and muslims these traditions now so often at loggerheads working together
to create a document which we hope will be signed by a thousand at least of major religious leaders from all the traditions of the world
and you are the people i'm just a solitary scholar despite the idea that i love a good time which i was rather amazed to see coming up
i actually spend a great deal of time alone studying and i'm not very you're the people with media knowledge to explain to me how we can get this to everybody everybody on the planet
the imam in new york city also i would be working with
the alliance of civilizations at the united nations i was part of that united nations
to avoid the escalation of further extremism and the alliance has told me that they are very happy to work with it the importance of this is
this is i can see some of you starting to look worried because you think it's a slow and cumbersome body but what the united nations can do is give us some neutrality
so that this isn't seen as a western or a christian initiative but that it's coming as it were from the united nations from the world who would help with the sort of
bureaucracy of this and so i do urge you to join me in making in this charter
to building this charter launching it and propagating it
so that it becomes i'd like to see it in every college every church every mosque every synagogue in the world
so that people can look at their tradition reclaim it
and make religion a source of peace in the world which it can and should be
thank you very much well this is such
