a very fundamental change that is going on in the very fabric of the modern economy and to talk about that i'm going to go back to the beginning
because in the beginning were
but then along came the industrial revolution
well what then happened over the last fifty or sixty years is that goods have become commoditized
they just care about three things and three things only price price and price
now there's an antidote to commoditization and that is customization
my first book was called mass customization it came up a couple of times yesterday and how i discovered this progression of economic value was realizing that customizing a good
the past ten or twenty years what's happened is that services are being commoditized as well
long distance telephone service sold on price price price fast food restaurants with all their value pricing
what that means is that it's time to move to a new level of economic value time to go beyond the goods and the services
and use in that same heuristic what happens when you customize a service what happens when you design a service that is so appropriate for a particular person that's exactly what they need at this
in time then you can't help but make them go wow you can't help but turn it into a memorable event you can't help but turn it into an experience
so we're shifting to an experience economy where experiences are becoming the predominant economic offering now most places that i talk to when i talk about experience i talk about disney
the world 's premier experience stager i talk about theme restaurants and experiential retail and boutique hotels and las vegas the experience capital of the world
but here when you think about experiences think about thomas dolby and his group playing music think about meaningful places
think about drinking wine about a journey to the clock of the long now those are all experiences think about ted itself
the experience capital in the world of conferences
all of these are experiences
and the question isn't really so much a question as an accusation
and the dutch when they usually put it it always starts with the same two words you know the words i mean we like real
so much has that happened that i've developed a fairly praticed response which is
i point out that first of all you have to understand that there is no such thing as an inauthentic experience
why because the experience happens inside of us it's our reaction to the events that are staged in front of us
so as long as we are in any sense authentic human beings then every experience we have is authentic
now there may be more or less natural or artificial stimuli for the experience but even that is a matter of degree not
there is a company that manufactured the car that delivered you to the edge of the woods there's a company that manufactured the shoes that you have to protect yourself from the ground of the woods there's a company that provides a cell phone service you have in case you get lost in the woods
all of those are man made artificiality brought into the woods by you and by the very nature of being there
but nonetheless not just the dutch but everyone has this desire for the authentic and authenticity is therefore becoming the new consumer sensibility
you can look at how each of these economies developed that each one has their own business imperative matched with a consumer sensibility we're the agrarian economy and we're supplying commodities it's about supply and availability getting the commodities to market
getting the costs down as low as possible so we can offer them to the masses
with the service economy it is about improving quality
that has the whole quality movement has risen with the service economy over the past twenty or thirty years and now with the experience economy it's about rendering authenticity
rendering authenticity and the keyword is rendering
right rendering because you have to get your consumers as business people to percieve your offerings as authentic
there is a basic paradox
no one can have an inauthentic experience
but no business can supply one
because all businesses are man made objects all business is involved with money all business is a matter of using machinery
and all those things make something rendering authenticity
at which authenticity entered the lexicon if you will
and that is to no surprise in shakespeare
and in his play hamlet says something profoundly real
says something profoundly real and this above all
to thine own self be true
that thou canst not then be false to
and those three verses are the core of authenticity
there are two dimensions to authenticity one being true to yourself which is very self directed
other directed being what you say you are to others like that
you think about that you do in fact get a two by two
where on one dimension it's a matter of being true to yourself as businesses are the economic offerings you are providing are they true to themselves
and the other dimension is are they what they say they are to others
you have is not true to itself and is not what it says it is
yielding a two by two matrix and of course if you are both true to yourself and are what you say you are then you're real real
the opposite of course is
a general rule if you don't like it
if you do like it it's
now the other two sides
of the coin are being a real fake
is what it says it is but is not true to itself or being a fake real
true to itself but not what it says it is you can think about those two you know both of these better than being fake fake not quite as good as being real real you can contrast them by thinking about
right because you can see behind the facade right it is what it says it is it's universal studio it's in the city of los angeles you're going to walk a lot right you don't tend to walk a lot in los angeles well here 's a place where you are going to walk a lot outside in this city
but is it really true to itself
is it really in the city is
you can see behind all of it and see what is going on in the facades of it so she calls it a real fake
disney world on the other hand is a fake real or a fake reality but it is
we won 't talk about santa claus
but disney world is wonderfully true to itself right just wonderfully true to itself when you are there you are just immersed in this wonderful environment
so it's a fake real now the easiest way
to fall down in this and not be real real right the easiest way not to be true to yourself is not to understand your heritage
and thereby repudiate that heritage to understand that
to understand that think about disney again
ten or fifteen years ago right the disney the company that is probably best known for family values out there disney bought the abc network
the t a network then it bought miramax known for its nc seventeen fare and all of a sudden families everywhere couldn't really trust what they were getting from disney it was no longer true to its heritage
no longer true to walt disney that's one of the reasons why they're having such trouble today and why roy disney is out to get michael eisner
because it is no longer true to itself
when it comes to being what you say you are the easiest mistake that companies make is that they advertise things that they are not
that's when you're perceived as fake as a phony company advertizing things that you're not think about any hotel any airline any hospital
but unfortunately you have to experience the actual hotel airline and hospital and then you have that disconnect then you have that perception that you are phony
so the number one thing to do when it comes to being what you say you are
is to provide places for people to experience who you are
for people to experience who you are
not advertising does it that's why you have companies like starbucks
that doesn't advertise at all they said you want to know who we are you have to come experience us
and think about the economic value they have provided by that experience
right coffee at its core is what
it's beans right it's coffee beans you know how much coffee is worth when treated as a commodity as
two or three cents per cup that's what coffee is worth
but grind it roast it package it put it on a grocery store shelf and now it'll cost five ten fifteen cents when you treat it as a good
take that same good and perform the service of actually brewing it for a customer in a corner diner in a bodega a kiosk somewhere you get fifty cents maybe a buck per cup of coffee
but surround the brewing of that coffee with the ambiance of a starbucks with the authentic cedar that goes inside of there and now because of that authentic experience you can charge two three four five dollars
for a cup of coffee
so authenticity is becoming the new consumer sensibility let me summarize it for the business people in the audience with three rules three basic rules
one don't say you're authentic
it's easier to be authentic if you don't say you're authentic
and three if you say you're authentic you better be authentic
what we what will make us happy
satisfying the desire for authenticity thank you
