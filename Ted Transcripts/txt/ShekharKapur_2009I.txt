we went around the table with the studio and the producers and the writer and they came to me and said shekhar what do you think and i said i think she's dancing
and i could see everybody looked at me somebody said bollywood the other said how much did we hire him for and the third said
i thought i had better change so we had a lot of discussion on how to introduce elizabeth and i said okay maybe i am too bollywood maybe
so she was dancing so how many people who saw the film did not get that here was a woman in love that she was completely innocent and saw great joy in her life and she was youthful and
you did not get that that's the power of visual storytelling that's the power of dance that's the power of music the power of not knowing when i go out to direct a film
rid of this mind that says hey you know what you're doing you know exactly what you're doing you're a director you've done it for years
so i've got to get there and be in complete panic so it's a symbolic gesture i tear up the script i go on i
panic myself i get scared i'm doing it right now you can watch me i'm getting nervous i don't know what to say i don't know what i'm doing i don't want to go there and as i go there of course my ad says
you know what you're going to do
and the studio executives they would say hey look at shekhar he 's all prepared and
he 's chaotic i'm allowing myself to go into chaos because out of chaos i'm hoping some moments of truth will come all
and if you get five great moments of great organic stuff in your storytelling in your film your film audiences will get it so i'm looking for those moments and i'm standing there and
so ultimately everybody 's looking at you two hundred people at seven in the morning who got there at quarter to seven and you arrived at seven and everybody 's saying hey
what's the first thing what's going to happen and you put yourself into a state of panic where you don't know and so you don't know and so because you don't know you're praying to the universe because your praying to the universe
something i'm going to try and access the universe the way einstein say a prayer accessed his equations the same source
i'm looking for the same source because creativity comes from absolutely the same source that you meditate somewhere outside yourself outside the universe you're looking for something that comes and hits you until that hits you you're not going to do the first shot
so what do you do so kate says shekhar what do you want me to do and i say kate what do you want to
great actor and i like to give to my actors why don't you show me what you
doing i'm trying to buy time i'm trying to buy time so the first thing about storytelling that i learned and i follow all the time is
panic panic is the great access of creativity because that's the only way to get rid of your mind get rid of your mind
you said that yesterday i'm just repeating it because that's what i follow constantly to find the shunyata somewhere the emptiness out of the emptiness comes a moment of creativity so that's what i do when i was a kid
you remember how india was there was no pollution in delhi we used to
or the khota now become a bad word it means their terrace and we used to sleep out at night at school i was being just taught about physics
and i was told that if there is something that exists then it is measurable if it is not measurable it does not exist
and at night i would lie out at the unpolluted sky as delhi used to be at that time when i was a kid and i used to stare at the universe and say how far does this universe go my father was a doctor and i
go and he said son it goes on forever so i said please measure forever
because in school they're teaching me that if i cannot measure it it does not exist i doesn't come into my frame of reference
so how far does eternity go what does forever mean and i would lie there crying at night because my imagination could not touch creativity so what did i do
at that time at the tender age of seven i created a story what was my story and i don't know why
but i remember the story there was a woodcutter who 's about to pick his ax and chop a piece of wood and the whole galaxy is one atom of
and when that ax hits that piece of wood that's when everything will destroy and the big bang will happen again but all before that there was a woodcutter and then when i would run out of that story i would imagine that woodcutter 's universe
is one atom in the ax of another woodcutter so every time i could tell my story again and again and get over this problem
and so i got over the problem how did i do it tell a story so what is a story
a story is our all of us we are the stories we tell ourselves in this universe and this existence
where we live with this duality of whether we exist or not and who are we the stories we tell ourselves are the stories that define the potentialities of our existence
we are the stories we tell ourselves so that's as wide as we look at stories a story is the relationship that you develop between
who you are or who you potentially
and the infinite world and that's our mythology we tell our stories and a person without a story does not exist so
einstein told a story and followed his stories and came up with theories and came up with theories and then came up with his equations
alexander had a story that his mother used to tell him and he went out to conquer the world we all everybody has a story that they follow we tell ourselves stories so i will go further and i say
i tell a story and therefore i exist i exist because there are stories and if there are no stories we don't exist we create stories to define our existence if we do not create the stories we
i don't know i'm not sure but that's what i've done all the time now a film
a film tells a story i often wonder when i make a film i'm thinking of making a film of the buddha and i often wonder if buddha had all the elements that are given to a director
if he had music if he had visuals if he had a video camera would we get buddhism better but that puts some kind of burden on me i have to tell a story in a much more elaborate way
and i look for stories on each level now it is not necessary that these stories agree with each other what is wonderful is at many times the stories will contradict with each other so when i work with so
threatened by philip ii and was going to war and was going to war fell in love with walter
here 's the story i was telling the
but the divine one was unjust so the gods said okay what we need to do is help the just one
and so they helped the just one and what they did was they sent walter raleigh down to physically separate her mortal self from her spirit self and the mortal self was the girl that walter
was sent and gradually he separated her so she was free to be divine and the two divine people fought
and the gods were on the side of divinity of course all the british press got really upset they said we won the armada
i said but the storm won the armada the gods sent the storm so what was i doing i was trying to find a mythic reason to make the film
of course when i asked kate blanchett i said what 's the film about she said the film 's about a woman coming to
growing older psychological the writer said it's about history plot i said it's about mythology the gods so
let me show you a film a piece from that film and how a camera also so this is a scene where in my mind she was at the depths of mortality
she was discovering what mortality actually means and if she is at the depths of mortality what really happens and she's recognizing
the dangers of mortality and why she should break away from mortality remember in the film to me both her and her lady in waiting were parts of the same body
one the mortal self and one the spirit self so can we have that second my
this is not the queen i love and
this man has seduced a ward of the queen
what am i trying to
elizabeth has realized and she's coming face to face with her own sense of jealousy her own sense of mortality
the architecture is telling a story the architecture is telling a story about how even though she's the most powerful woman in the world at that time there is the other the architecture
the stone is bigger than her because stone is inorganic it'll survive her so it's telling you to me stone is part of
not only that why is the camera looking down the camera 's looking down at her because she's in the well she's in the absolute well of her own sense of
being mortal that's where she has to pull herself out from the depths of mortality come in release her spirit
and that's the moment where in my mind both elizabeth and bess are the same person but that's the moment she's surgically removing herself from
so the film is operating on many many levels in that scene and how we tell stories visually with music with actors and at each level it's a different sense and sometimes contradictory to each other so how do
start all this what's the process of telling a story about ten years ago i heard this little thing from a politician not a politician that was very well respected in india
and he said that these people in the cities in one flush expend as much water as you people in the rural areas don't get for two days
true i went to see a friend of mine and he made
in his apartment in malabar hill on the twentieth floor which is a really really upmarket area in mumbai and he was having a shower for twenty minutes i got bored and left and as i drove out i drove past the slums of bombay as you always do
and i saw lines and lines in the hot midday sun of women and children with buckets waiting for a tanker to come and give them water
and an idea started to develop so how does that become a story i suddenly realized that we are heading towards disaster so my next film is called paani which means water
and now out of the mythology of that i'm starting to create a world what kind of world do i create and where does the
to build flyovers to get from a to b faster but they effectively went from one area of relative wealth to another
and then what they did was they created a city above the flyovers and the rich people moved to the upper city and left the poorer people in the lower cities about ten to twelve percent
of the people have moved to the upper city now where does this upper city and lower city come there's a mythology in india about where they say
and i'll say it in hindi right
says the rich are always sitting on the shoulders and survive on the shoulders of the poor so from that mythology the upper city and lower city come so the design has a story
and they drip feed the lower city and if there's any revolution they cut off the water and because democracy still exists
democratic way in which you say well if you we'll give you water so okay
but i can go on about telling you how we evolve stories and how stories effectively are who we are and how these get translated into the particular discipline that i am in which is film but ultimately what is
it's a contradiction everything 's a contradiction the universe is a contradiction and all of us are constantly looking for harmony
when you get up the night and day is a contradiction but you get up at four am that first blush of blue is where the night and day are trying to find harmony with
it's the effect of looking for harmony in the contradiction that exists in a poet 's mind a contradiction that exists in a storyteller 's mind
in a storyteller 's mind is a contradiction of moralities in a poet 's mind is a conflict of words in the universe 's mind between day and night in the mind of a man and a woman
looking constantly at the contradiction between male and female we're looking for harmony with each other the whole idea of contradiction but the acceptance of contradiction is the telling of a story not the resolution
the problem with a lot of the storytelling in hollywood and many films and as was saying in his that we try to resolve the contradiction harmony
not resolution harmony is the suggestion of a thing that is much larger that resolution harmony is the suggestion of something that is embracing and universal and of eternity and of the moment
is looking for harmony and infinity in moral resolutions resolving one but letting another go letting another go and creating a question that is really important thank you very much
