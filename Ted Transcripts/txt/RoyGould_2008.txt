less than a year from now the world is going to celebrate the international year of astronomy which marks the four hundredth anniversary of
galileo 's first glimpse of the night sky through a telescope in a few months the world is also going to celebrate
the launch of a new invention from microsoft research which i think is going to have as profound an impact on the way we view the universe as galileo did four centuries ago
it's called the worldwide telescope
and i want to thank ted and microsoft for allowing me to bring it to your attention and i want to urge you when you get a chance to give it a closer look at the ted lab downstairs the worldwide telescope
to produce a holistic view of the universe
it's going to change the way we do astronomy it's going to change the way we teach astronomy and i think most importantly it's going to change the way we see ourselves in the universe
if we were having this ted meeting in our grandparent 's day that might not be so big a claim
you weren't allowed to drink if you were a woman you weren't allowed to vote
looked up at the stars and the milky way on a summer night
was thought to be the entire universe in fact the head of harvard 's observatory back then gave a great debate in which he argued that the milky way galaxy was the entire universe harvard was wrong big time of course we know today
that galaxies extend far beyond our own galaxy we can see all the way out to the edge of the observable universe all the way back in time almost to the moment of the big bang itself
we can see across the entire spectrum of light revealing worlds that had previously been invisible
we see these magnificent star nurseries where nature has somehow arranged for just the right numbers and just the right sizes of stars to be born for life to arise alien worlds we see
we see black holes at the heart of our galaxy in the milky way and elsewhere in the universe where time itself seems to stand still
our view of the universe has been disconnected and fragmented and i think that many of the marvelous stories that nature has to tell us have fallen through the cracks and that's changing
i want to just briefly mention three reasons why my colleagues and i in astronomy and in education are so excited about the worldwide telescope and why we think it's truly
it enables you to experience the universe
you can tour the universe
with astronomers as your guides and i'm not talking here about just experts who are telling you what you're seeing but
people who are passionate about the various nooks and crannies of the universe who can share their enthusiasm and can make the universe a welcoming place
and third you can create your own tours you can share them with friends you can create them with friends and that's the part that i think i'm most excited about because i think that at heart we are all storytellers and in telling stories
each of us is going to understand the universe in our own way
we're going to have a personal universe
i think we're going to see a community of storytellers evolve and emerge when i ask people
how does the night sky make you feel they often say oh tiny i feel tiny and insignificant
well our gaze fills the universe
and thanks to the creators of the worldwide telescope
we can now start to have a dialogue with the universe
i think the worldwide telescope will convince you that we may be tiny i
so what you're seeing here is a wonderful presentation but it's one of the tours and actually this tour is one that was created earlier
and the tours are all totally interactive so that if i were to go somewhere you may be watching a tour and you can pause anywhere along the way pull up other information
microsoft this is a project that worldwide telescope is dedicated to jim gray who 's our colleague and a lot of his work that he did is really what makes this project possible
a free download thank you craig mundie and it'll be available at the website
which is something new and so
what you've seen today is less than a fraction of one percent of what is in here and in the ted lab we have a tour that was created by a six year old named benjamin that will knock your socks off so we'll see you there thank you
