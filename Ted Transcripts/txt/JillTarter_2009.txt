are we alone the story of humans is the story of ideas scientific ideas that shine light
in history and ideas that have been set in dogma
and of conflicts among them carried out every book
every laugh every tear they've all happened here here here
is a very powerful thing
perspectives can change perspectives can be altered
questions about naturalism and transcendence about who we are and why we are and of course who else might be out there
are we alone in this vast universe of energy and matter and chemistry and physics well
it's an awful waste of space
but what if we're not what there others are
would the discovery of an older us
we're born in san francisco or sudan or close to the heart of the milky way galaxy we are the products of
billion year lineage of wandering star dust we all of us years ago
the journey to find answers
took a different path and seti the search for extra terrestrial intelligence began so what exactly is
seti uses the tools of astronomy to try and find evidence of someone else's technology out there
our own technologies are visible over interstellar distances and theirs might be as well
it might be that some massive network of communications or some shield against asteroidal impact or some huge
that a determined program of searching might detect for millennia we've actually turned to the priests and the philosophers
for guidance and instruction on this question of whether there's intelligent life out there now we can use the tools of the twenty one st century
to try and observe what is rather than ask what should be believed
seti doesn't presume the existence of extra terrestrial intelligence it merely notes the possibility if not the probability in this vast universe
the numbers suggest a universe of possibilities our sun is one
of four hundred billion stars in our galaxy and we know that many other stars have planetary systems we've discovered
has a radius just twice the size of the earth and
if even all of the planetary systems in our galaxy were devoid of life there's still one hundred billion other galaxies out there altogether ten to the twenty two stars
one billion stars now up there twenty feet above the stage
ten trillion well what about ten to the twenty two where's the line that marks that
times farther away than the moon or four percent of the distance to the sun so there are many possibilities
and much of this vast universe much more may be habitable than we once thought as we study extremophiles on earth organisms that can live in conditions
totally inhospitable for us in the hot high pressure
thermal vents at the bottom of the ocean frozen in ice in boiling battery
takes a full eight minutes for its radiation to reach us and the nearest star is four point two light years away which means its light takes four point two a long time
a signal would give us a glimpse of their past not their present which is why phil morrison calls seti
the archaeology of the future it tells us about their past but detection of a signal tells us it's possible
for us to have a long future i think this is what david deutsch meant in two thousand and five when he ended his oxford tedtalk
by saying he had two principles he'd like to share for living and he would like to carve them on stone tablets the first is
the second is that problems are soluble
so ultimately what's going to determine the success or failure of seti is the longevity of technologies
and the mean distance between technologies in the cosmos distance over space and distance over time
if technologies don't last and persist we will not succeed and we're a very young technology in an old galaxy
up until now i've been talking to you about really large numbers let me talk about a relatively small number and that's the length of time that the earth
taken from the jack hills of western australia tell us that within a few hundred million years of the origin of the planet there was abundant water
and perhaps even life so our planet has spent the vast majority of
life not anticipating its emergence life happened very quickly and that
bodes well for the potential of life elsewhere in the
the other thing that one should take away from this chart
is the very narrow range of time over which humans can claim to be the dominant intelligence on the planet the
we are not the determined product of
billions of years of evolutionary plotting and planning we are one outcome of
are residents of one small planet in a corner of the milky way galaxy
and homo sapiens are one small leaf on a very extensive tree of life that's densely populated by organisms
millions of years we misuse language and talk about the ascent of man
we understand the scientific basis for the interrelatedness of life but our ego
that one does not meet oneself until one catches the reflection from an eye other than human
one day that eye may be that of an intelligent alien and the sooner we eschew our narrow view of evolution the sooner we can are a small part
we are going to be
the earth out of the center and putting the sun in the center of the solar system he opened our eyes to a much larger universe
of which we are just a small part and that copernican revolution continues today to influence science and philosophy and technology and theology
conducted the first seti observation looking at two stars tau ceti and epsilon eridani for about one hundred and fifty hours now doctorake did not discover extraterrestrial intelligence
but he learned a very valuable lesson from a passing aircraft and that's that terrestrial technology can interfere with the search for extraterrestrial technology
bigger glasses much bigger glasses in northern california we're beginning to take observations with the first forty two telescopes of the allen telescope array and i've got to take a moment right
paul allen and nathan myhrvold and all the teamseti members in the ted community who have so generously supported this research
is the first telescope built from a large number of small dishes and hooked together with computers it's making silicon as important as aluminum
our signal detection algorithms can find very simple artifacts and noise if you look very hard here you can see the signal from
voyager one spacecraft the most distant human object in the universe one hundred and six times as far away from us as the sun is and
over those long distances its signal is very faint when it reaches us it may be hard for your eye to see it but it's easily found with our efficient algorithms
but this is a simple signal and tomorrow we want to be able to find more complex signals this is a very good year
the fiftieth anniversary of seti as a science the twenty fifth anniversary of the incorporation of the seti institute as a non profit and of course
the twenty fifth anniversary of ted and next month the kepler spacecraft will launch and will begin to tell us just how frequent earth like planets are us residents of
our cosmic origins and our place in the universe and in two thousand and nine change has come to washington
a promise to put science in its rightful position so what would change everything
well this is the question the edge foundation asked this year and four of the respondents said seti why well
the discovery of intelligent life beyond earth would eradicate the loneliness and solipsism that has plagued our species since its inception and it wouldn't simply change everything it would change everything all at once
so if that's right why did we only capture four out of those one hundred and fifty one minds i think it's a problem
so we have a fulfillment problem we need bigger glasses and more hands in the water
and then working together maybe we can all live to see
the detection of the first extraterrestrial signal
that brings me to my wish
i wish that you would empower earthlings everywhere
to become active participants in the ultimate search for cosmic company the first step would be to tap into the global brain trust
to build an environment where raw data could be stored and where
perspective of people who worked on it like to augment
like to augment the
get them out to students everywhere students that can't come and visit us at the ata we'd like to tell our story better and engage young people and thereby change their perspective
i'm sorry seth godin but over the millennia we've seen where tribalism leads we've seen what happens when we divide an already small planet
into smaller islands and ultimately we actually all belong to only
earthlings and seti is a mirror a mirror that can show us ourselves from an extraordinary perspective
it will be one of the most profound endeavors in history so in the opening days of two thousand and nine
a visionary president stood on the steps of the u s capitol and said
we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass
that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve that as the world grows smaller our common humanity
shall reveal itself so i look forward to working with the ted community to hear about your ideas about how to fulfill this
wish and in collaborating with you
