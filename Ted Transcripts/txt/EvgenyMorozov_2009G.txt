good morning i think as a grumpy eastern european i was brought in to play the pessimist this morning so bear with
well i come from the former soviet republic of belarus which as some of you may know is not exactly an oasis of liberal democracy
so that's why i've always been fascinated with how technology could actually reshape and open up authoritarian societies like ours
so i'm graduating college and feeling very idealistic i decided to join the ngo which actually was using new media to promote democracy and media reform in much of the former soviet union
to my surprise i discovered that dictatorships do not crumble so easily in fact some of them actually survived through the challenge and some got even more
so this is when i ran out of my idealism and decided to quit my ngo job and actually study how the internet could impede democratization
united states who somehow thought that new media would be able to do what missiles
that is promote democracy in difficult places where everything else has already been tried and failed
and i think by two thousand and nine this news has finally reached britain so i should probably add gordon brown to this list as well
however there is an underlying argument about logistics which has driven so much of this debate
close enough you'll actually see that much of this is about economics the cybertopians say much like fax machines and xerox machines
blogs and social networks have radically transformed the economics of protest so people would inevitably rebel
put it very simply the assumption so far has been that if you give people enough connectivity if you give them enough devices democracy will inevitably follow
i never really bought into this argument in part because i never saw three american presidents agree on anything else in the past
even beyond that if you think about the logic underlying it is something i call
we assume that every single iranian or chinese who happens to have and love his ipod will also love liberal democracy
and again i think this is kind of false but i think a much bigger problem
this logic that we should be dropping ipods not bombs i mean it would make a fascinating title for thomas friedman 's new book
but this is rarely a good sign right so the bigger problem with this logic is that it confuses the intended versus the actual uses of technology
think that new media of the internet could somehow help us avert genocide
should look no further than rwanda where in the nineties it was actually two radio stations which were responsible for fueling much of the ethnic hatred in the first place
but even beyond that coming back to the internet what you can actually see is that certain governments have mastered the use of cyberspace for propaganda purposes right and they are building what i call the
the combination of spin on the one hand and the internet on the other so governments from russia to china to iran are actually hiring training and paying bloggers
in order to leave ideological comments and create a lot of ideological blog posts to comment on sensitive political issues right so you may wonder why on earth are they doing it why are they engaging with cyberspace
my theory is that it's happening because censorship actually is less effective than you think it is in many of those places
the moment you put something critical in a blog even if you manage to ban it immediately it will still spread around thousands and thousands of other
so the only way to control this message is actually to try to spin it and accuse anyone who has written something critical of being for example a cia agent
and again this is happening quite often just to give you an example of how it works in china for example there was a big case in february two thousand and nine
and for those of you who didn't know i'll just give a little summary so what happened is that a twenty four year old man a chinese man died in prison custody
which was not an explanation which sat well with many chinese bloggers so they immediately began posting a lot of critical comments
in fact qq com which is a popular chinese website had thirty five thousand comments on this issue within hours
so five hundred people applied and four were selected to actually go and tour the facility in question and thus inspect it and then blog about it
within days the entire incident was forgotten which would have never happened if they simply tried to block the content people would keep talking about it for weeks
it happens when governments are actually reaching out to their critics and letting them engage with each other online
think that somehow this is going to harm these dictatorships but in many cases it only strengthens them and you may wonder why
i'll just give you a very short list of reasons why authoritarian deliberation may actually help the dictators and first it's quite simple
most of them operate in a complete information vacuum they don't really have the data they need in order to identify emerging threats facing the regime
so encouraging people to actually go online and share information and data on blogs and wikis is great because otherwise
low level apparatchiks and bureaucrats will continue concealing what's actually happening in the country right so from this perspective having blogs and wikis produce knowledge has been great
and finally the purpose of any authoritarian deliberation efforts is usually to increase the legitimacy of the regimes both at home and abroad so inviting people to all sorts of public forums having them participate in decision making
it's actually great because what happens is that then you can actually point to this initiative and say well we are having a democracy we are having
actually see that many of the networks and blogs and twitter and facebook were actually operational they may have become slower
but the activists could still access it and actually argue that having access to them is actually great for many authoritarian states and it's great simply because
they can gather open source intelligence in the past it would take you weeks if not months to identify how iranian activists connect to each other
i think the biggest conceptual pitfall that cybertopians made is when it comes to digital natives people who have grown up
we often hear about cyber activism how people are getting more active because of the internet rarely hear about cyber hedonism for example how people are becoming passive why because they somehow assume
that the internet is going to be the catalyst of change that will push young people into the streets while in fact it may actually be the new opium for the masses which will keep the same people in their rooms downloading pornography that's not a option being considered too strongly
so for every digital renegade that is revolting in the streets of tehran there may as well be two digital captives who are actually rebelling only in the world of warcraft
the internet actually broadens their sex life is three times more than in the united states so it does play a social role
however it may not necessarily lead to political engagement so the way i tend to think of it is like a hierarchy of cyberneeds in space a total rip off from
but the point here is that when we get the remote russian village on line what will get people to the internet is not going to be the reports from human rights watch
going to be pornography sex in the city or maybe watching funny videos of cats so this is something you have to recognize so what should we do about it well i say we have to stop thinking about the number of ipods per capita
and start thinking about ways in which we can empower intellectuals dissidents ngos and then the members of civil society
