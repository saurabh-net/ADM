i joined forces with many other libyans inside and outside libya to call for a day of rage
and to initiate a revolution against the tyrannical regime of gaddafi
and there it was a great revolution
young libyan women and men were at the forefront
calling for the fall of the regime
they have shown an exemplary bravery in confronting the brutal dictatorship of gaddafi they have shown a great sense of solidarity from the far east to the far west
and a toll rate of almost fifty thousand dead
we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant
a legacy of tyranny corruption for four decades
for four decades i was keen among
many other women to rebuild the libyan civil society
almost two hundred organizations were established in benghazi during and immediately after the fall of gaddafi almost three hundred in tripoli
after a period of thirty three years in exile i went back to libya and with unique enthusiasm i started organizing workshops on capacity building on human development of leadership
of women leaders from different walks of life
to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women and to lobby for our right for equal participation in building democracy and peace
environment in the pre elections an environment which was increasingly polarized
an environment which was shaped
by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion the alternation
the euphoria of the elections
for every day we were waking up to the news of violence
one day we wake up to the news of the desecration of ancient mosques and sufi tombs on another day we wake up to the news of the murder of the american ambassador and the attack on the consulate
on another day we wake up to the news of the assassination of army officers and every day every day we wake up with the rule of the militias and their continuous violations of human rights of prisoners
and their disrespect of the rule of law
our society shaped by a revolutionary mindset became more polarized and has driven away
from the ideals and the principles freedom
dignity social justice that we first held intolerance exclusion
i 'm rather here today to confess that we as a nation
took the wrong choice made the wrong decision
we did not prioritize right and exclusion by both
needs the numerical quantitative representation of the feminine we need to stop
acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage we need to start acting
as agents of compassion and mercy we need to develop instead of revenge
instead of revenge collaboration instead of competition
collaboration instead of competition inclusion instead of
in order to achieve peace for peace
has an alchemy and this alchemy is about the intertwining
peace is the word of the all merciful god
which is known in all abrahamic traditions has the same root in arabic as the word rahem womb which grows within it
thus we are told that my mercy takes precedence over my
may we all be granted a grace of mercy
