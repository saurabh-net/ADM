and i 'd like to share
a forty five year old love story
i went to a very elitist snobbish expensive education in india
and that almost destroyed me
i was all set to be a diplomat teacher doctor
and then i thought out of curiosity i 'd like to go and live and work and just see what a village is like
so in one thousand nine hundred and sixty five and i saw starvation
people dying of hunger for the first time
mother went into a coma
and i wanted to give something back
no job no money no security no prospect i said i want to live
and dig wells for five years
dig wells for five years you went to the most expensive school and college in india and you want to dig wells for five years
she didn 't speak to me for but then
i was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills that very poor people have
which is never identified respected applied on a large scale and i thought i 'd start a barefoot college
college only for the poor
what the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college
and said are you running from the police
i said no i want to actually start a college only for the poor
what the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college so the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice they said please
don 't bring anyone with a degree and qualification into your college
so it 's the only college in india where if you should have a ph d or a master 's you are disqualified to come
you have to be a cop out or a wash out
you have to have a dignity of labor you have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community and provide a service to the community so we started
who is a professional a professional is someone
who has a combination of competence confidence and belief
a water diviner is a professional a traditional midwife
is a professional these are professionals all over the world you find them in any inaccessible village around the world and we thought that these people should come into the mainstream and show
that the knowledge and skills that they have
and no one can get more than dollar one hundred a month you come for the money
work and the challenge you 'll come to the barefoot
the teacher is the learner
and the learner is the teacher
and it 's the only college where we don 't give a certificate
you are certified by the community you serve
you don 't need a paper to hang on the wall to show
that you are an engineer
so when i said that they said well show us what is possible what are you doing this is all mumbo jumbo if you can 't show it on the ground so we built the first
it was built by twelve barefoot architects who can 't read and write
they got the aga khan award for architecture in two thousand and two
we are the only ones who actually returned the award i asked a forester
high powered paper qualified expert i said what can you
build in this place he had one look at the soil and said forget it no way not even worth it no water rocky soil
i was in a bit of a spot and i said okay i 'll go to the old man in village and say what should i grow in this spot
he looked quietly at me and said you build this you build this you put this and it 'll work this is what it looks like today went to the roof
and all the women said clear out
all the power comes from the sun
by a priest a hindu priest who 's only done eight years of primary schooling
never been to school never been to college he knows more about solar than
anyone i know anywhere in the world
who actually fabricate the most sophisticated solar cooker it 's a parabolic scheffler solar cooker
unfortunately they 're almost half german
absolutely to the last inch they can make that cooker and we have sixty meals twice a day of solar cooking
very little water is wasted all the roofs are connected underground to a four hundred thousand liter tank
and no water is wasted
sixty percent of children don 't go to school
because they have to look after animals sheep goats
at night for the children
because the night schools of tilonia over seventy five thousand children
have gone through these night schools because it 's for the convenience of the child it 's not for the convenience of the teacher and what do we teach in these schools democracy citizenship how you should measure your land what you should do if you 're arrested what you should do if your animal is sick
this is what we teach in the night schools but all the schools are solar lit every five years
participate in a democratic process
the prime minister is twelve years old she has a cabinet
and they actually monitor and supervise one hundred and fifty schools for seven thousand children
she got the world 's children 's prize
five years ago and she went to sweden first time ever going out of her village never seen
and the queen of sweden who 's there turned to me and said can you ask this child where she got her confidence from she 's only twelve years old and she 's not dazzled by anything
turned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye
he is my psychoanalyst he is my teacher
he 's my donor he actually raises money solves my disputes
so this decentralized demystified approach of solar electrifying villages
because there 's no place it was all snowed up on both sides
and she thought for a minute and said
one lesson we learned in india men are compulsively mobile
and they all want a certificate
because they want to leave the village
and go to a city looking for a job
so we came up with a great solution train grandmothers
train grandmothers telegraph no
i said i 'll make a concession i 'll take the husbands along as well so i took the husbands along of course the women were much more intelligent than the men
you don 't choose the spoken word you use sign language
they go back and solar electrify their own village
and there was this minister driving down in the dead of night comes across this village comes back goes into the village says well what 's the story they said difficult husband not possible
called the husband the husband came swaggering politician mobile in his hand not possible why not
the woman look how beautiful she is i said yeah she is very beautiful what happens if she runs off with an indian
she went like a grandmother
national press and she was a star and when i went back six months later i said where 's your husband oh somewhere it doesn 't matter wind up by saying
look for solutions within and listen to people they have the solutions in front
don 't even worry don 't listen to the world bank listen to the people on the ground first they ignore you
first they ignore you and
