some of the greatest innovations and developments in the world often happen at the intersection of two fields so tonight i'd like to tell you about the intersection that i'm most excited about at this very moment which is entertainment and robotics
so if we're trying to make robots that can be more expressive and that can connect better with us in society maybe we should look to some of the human professionals of artificial emotion and personality that occur in the
so we're based in new york city and if you're a performer who wants to collaborate with an adorable robot or if you have a robot that needs entertainment representation please contact me the bot agent
the bot our rising celebrity also has his own twitter account at robotinthewild so i'd like to introduce you to one of our first robots data he 's named after the star trek character i think he 's going to be super popular
so it can also learn from you about the quality of its jokes and cater things sort of like netflix style over longer term to different communities or audiences children versus adults different cultures you can learn something
from the robot about the community that you're in and also i can use each one of you as the acting coach to our future robot companions
like what's going on show the green if you don't like the subject or the performance you can hold the red now don't be shy it's just a robot it doesn't have feelings yet
it's an honor to be here
here 's the first one
right so a doctor says to his patient i have bad news and worse news
the bad news is that you only have twenty four hours
trying to contact you since yesterday
see that little swiss army knife they have to right here
me the guy behind me has
he gasps to the operator my friend what can i do
and the operator hears a shot the anyone
anyone because it's neither
turns it on i go into the other room
this is actually the first time we've ever done live audience feedback to a performance so thank you all for being a part of it there's a lot more to come
and we hope to learn a lot about robot expression thank you very much
