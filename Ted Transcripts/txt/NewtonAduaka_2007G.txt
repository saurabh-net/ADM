this is very strange for me because i a m not used to doing this i usually stand on the other side of the light and now i'm feeling the pressure i put other people into
and it's hard the previous speaker has been i think has really painted a very good background as to
what really the impulse behind my work and what drives me and my sense of loss and trying to find the answer to the big questions
but this for me i mean coming here to do this feels like feels like there a s this sculptor that i like very much
giacometti who after many years of living in france and learning you know studying and
working he returned home and he was asked what did you produce what have you done with so many years of being away and he sort of he showed a handful of figurines
and obviously they were is this what you spent years doing and we expected you know huge masterpieces
you know but what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces was the culmination of a man
life search thought and everything just in a reduced small version
in a way i feel like that i feel like i a m coming home to talk about what i a ve been out away doing for twenty years now
and i will start with a brief taster of what i a ve been about a handful of films nothing much two feature films and a handful of short films so we a ll go with the first and
and you
feed no one and it particularly don't feed your spliff habit it feeds my
my soul arguing with you is a waste of time you
you a
a i
you recruited to fight this to express
to express i
i a
a the
the really
for me and where i'm coming from in terms of cinema the first piece was really there's a young woman talking about nigeria that she has a feeling she'll be happy there
the sentiments of someone that's been away from home and that was something that i went through you know and i'm still going through
been home for quite a while for about five years now i've been away twenty years in total
which is the time of abacha the military dictatorship the worst part of nigerian history this post colonial history
so for this girl to have these dreams is simply how we preserve a sense of what home is how
perhaps romantic but i think beautiful because you
living as a black person in europe the glass ceiling that we all know about that we all talk about you know
and coming you know and his reality again this was my this was me talking about this was again the time of multiculturalism in
what does a child like jamie the young boy think i mean with all this anger that's built up inside of him and what does happens with that
what of course happens with that is violence which is which we see when we you know we talk about the ghettos and we talk about you know south central l a and this kind of stuff which eventually sometimes when channeled becomes
i lived in england for eighteen years i've lived in france for about four and i feel actually thrown back twenty years living in france
and then the third piece the third piece for me is the question what is cinema to you what do you do with cinema there's a young the
so that whole thing that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece and
and ninety nine
ninety nine a
a that
more than that begin a healing process my name is
my name is she
trial here for any crimes you committed
we were fighting for our freedom if killing
then you have to charge every soldier
crime yes but i did not
you too are a retired general not so so
so our government was
lack of education was their way to
if i may ask do you pay for school in your country we
we about
you support corrupt governments like my own why because anyone in this room
anyone in this room no
no i can't do that
i can't do that so you are
thank you just very quickly
my point really here is that while we a re making all these huge advancements what we're doing which for me you know i think we should africa should move forward but
we should remember so we do not go back
of the themes that comes through very strongly in the piece we just watched is this sense of
the psychological trauma of the young that have to play this role of child being child soldiers and
considering where you are coming from and when we consider the extent to which it a s not taken as seriously as it should be what would you have to say about that
in the process of my research i went i actually spent a bit of time in sierra leone researching this and i met i remember i met a lot of child soldiers ex combatants as
like to be called i met psychosocial workers who worked with them
time with them aid workers ngos the whole lot but i remember on the flight back on my last trip i remember breaking down in tears and thinking to myself
if these kids if any kid in the west in the western world
of what any of those kids have gone through they will be on therapy for the rest of their natural lives
so for me the thought
we have all these children it a s a generation we have a whole generation of children who have been put through so much psychological trauma
damage and africa has to live with that but i a m just saying to factor that in factor that in with all this great advancement all this pronouncement of great achievement that a s really my thinking eo well
thank you again for coming to the ted stage that was a very moving piece na thank you eo thank you
