creativity for me is something that 's absolutely critical and i think it 's something that you can teach i think the technicities of creativity can be taught and shared
and i think you can find out things about your own personal physical signature your own cognitive habits and use that as a point of departure to misbehave beautifully
i was born in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s and john travolta was big in those days grease saturday night fever and he provided a fantastic kind of male role model for me to start dancing my parents were very up for me going they absolutely encouraged me to take risks to go to try to try
i had an opportunity an access to a local dance studio and i had an enlightened teacher
who allowed me to make up my own and invent my own dances so what she did was let me make up my own ballroom and latin american dances to teach to my peers
and that was the very first time that i found an opportunity to feel that i was able to express my own voice and that 's what 's fueled me then to become a choreographer i feel like i 've got something to say and something to share
and i guess what 's interesting is is that i am now obsessed with the technology of the body i think it 's the most technologically literate thing that we have
and i 'm absolutely obsessed with finding a way of communicating ideas through the body to audiences that might move them touch them help them think differently about things
so for me choreography is very much a process of physical thinking it 's very much in mind as well as in body and it 's a collaborative process it 's something that i have to do with other people
economists anthropologists neuroscientists cognitive scientists people really who come from very different domains of expertise where they bring their intelligence to bear on a different kind of creative process
what i thought we would do today a little bit is explore this idea of physical thinking
and we 're all experts in physical thinking yeah you all have a body right and we all know what that body is like in the real world so one of the aspects of physical thinking that we think about a lot is this notion of proprioception the sense of my own body in the space in the real world so we all understand what it feels like
to know where the ends of your fingers are when you hold out your arms yeah you absolutely know that when you 're going to grab a cup or that cup moves and you have to renavigate it so we 're experts in physical thinking already we just don 't think about our bodies very much we only think about them when they go wrong
so when there 's a broken arm or when you have a heart attack then you become really very aware of your bodies but how is it that we can start to think about using choreographic thinking kinesthetic intelligence to arm the ways in which we think about things more generally
they have no idea what we 're going to do so this is not the type of choreography where i already have in mind what i 'm going to make where i 've fixed the routine in my head
and i thought i 'd take something simple ted logo we can all see it it 's quite easy to work with and i 'm going to do something very simply where you take one idea from a body and it happens to be my body and translate that into somebody else 's body so it 's a direct transfer transformation of energy
so i can describe it very simply i can describe it in my arms right so all i did was take my hand and then i move my hand i can describe it whoa in my head you know whoa okay i can do also my shoulder yeah it gives me something to do something to work towards if i were to take that letter t and flatten it down on the floor
here maybe just off the floor all of a sudden i could do maybe something with my knee yeah whoa so if i put the knee and the arms together i 've got something physical yeah and i can start to build something so what i 'm going to do just for one and a half minutes or so is i 'm going to take that concept i 'm going to make something
and the dancers behind me are going to interpret it they 're going to snapshot it they 're going to take aspects of it
so what they 're doing let 's see something like that so what they 're doing is grasping aspects of that movement and they 're generating it into a phrase you can see the speed is extremely quick yeah i 'm not asking them to copy exactly they 're using the information that they receive to generate the beginnings of a phrase
i can watch that and that can tell me something about how it is that they 're moving
so i 've taken this aspect of ted and translated it into something that 's physical
throw it into the audience whoom throw it into the audience again we 've got mental architecture we 're sharing it therefore solving a problem they 're enacting it let me just see that a little bit ready and go
the second one which is using them as objects to think with their architectural objects i do a series of provocations i say if this happens then that if this if that happens i 've got lots of methods like that but it 's very very quick and this is a third method they 're starting it already and this is a task based method where they have the autonomy to make all of the decisions for themselves
so i 'd like us just to do we 're going to do a little mental dance a little in this little one minute so what i 'd love you to do is imagine you can do this with your eyes closed or open and if you don 't want to do it you can watch them it 's up to you
just for a second think about that word ted in front of you so it 's in mind and it 's there right in front of your mind what i 'd like you to do is transplant that outside into the real world so just imagine that word ted in the real world
and i 'm going to scale that e so it 's absolutely massive so i 'm scaling that e so it 's absolutely massive and then i 'm going to give it dimensionality i 'm going to think about it in three d space so now instead of it just being a letter that 's in front of me it 's a space that my body can go inside of
i now decide where i 'm going to be in that space so i 'm down on this small part of the bottom rib of the letter e and i 'm thinking about it and i 'm imagining this space that 's really high and above
if i asked you to reach out you don 't have to literally do it but in mind reach out to the top of the e where would you reach if you reach with your finger where would it be if you reach with your elbow where would it be
if i already then said about that space that you 're in let 's infuse it with the color red what does that do to the body if i then said to you what happens if that whole wall on the side of e collapses and you have to use your weight to put it back up what would you be able to do with it
so this is a mental picture i 'm describing a mental vivid picture that enables dancers to make choices for themselves about what to make okay you can open your eyes if you had them closed so the dancers have been working on them so just keep working on them for a little second so they 've been working on those mental architectures in the here versions of physical thinking
