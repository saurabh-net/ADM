one thing the world needs one thing this country desperately needs is a better way of conducting our political debates we need to rediscover the lost art of democratic argument
if you think about the arguments we have most of the time it's shouting matches on cable television ideological food fights on the floor of congress
i have a suggestion look at all the arguments we have these days over health care over bonuses and bailouts on wall street
over the gap between rich and poor over affirmative action and same sex marriage lying just beneath the surface of those arguments
passions raging on all sides are big questions
of moral philosophy big questions of justice but we too rarely articulate and defend
and argue about those big moral questions in our politics so what i would like to do today is have something of a discussion
first let me take a famous philosopher who wrote about those questions of justice and morality
give you a very short lecture on aristotle of ancient athens aristotle 's theory of justice
and then have a discussion here to see whether aristotle 's ideas actually inform the way we think and argue about questions today
so are you ready for the lecture according to aristotle
justice means giving people what they deserve
that's it that's the lecture
take the example of flutes suppose we're distributing flutes who should get the best ones
you can just call it out
at random you would do it by lottery
or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them
how many say the best flute players
why actually that was aristotle 's answer a harder question why
do you think those of you who voted this way that the best flutes should go to the best flute players all right
it's a good reason we'll all be better off if good music is played rather than terrible music but
peter aristotle doesn't agree with you that that's the reason that's all right aristotle had a different reason for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players he said
that's what flutes are for
to be played well he says that to reason about just distribution of a thing
we have to reason about and sometimes argue about the purpose
of the thing or the social activity in this case musical
when we think about justice aristotle says what we really need to think about is the essential nature of the activity in question
the qualities that are worth honoring and admiring and recognizing one of the reasons that the best flute players should get the best flutes is that musical performance is not only to make the rest of us happy
but to honor and recognize the excellence of the best musicians now flutes may seem the distribution of flutes may seem
casey martin a few years ago casey martin
did any of you hear about him he was a very good golfer but he had a disability he had a bad leg a circulatory problem
that made it very painful for him to walk the course in fact it carried risk of injury
he asked the pga the professional golfers association for permission to use a golf cart
in the pga tournaments they said no now that would give you an unfair advantage
and his case went all the way to the supreme court believe it or not the case over the golf cart
because the law says that the disabled must be accommodated the accommodation does not
change the essential nature of the activity
he says i 'm a great golfer i want to compete but i need a golf cart to get from one hole to the next suppose
you were on the supreme court suppose you were deciding the justice of this case
how many here would say that casey martin does have a right to use a golf cart and how many say no he doesn 't all right let 's take a poll show of hands how many would rule in favor of casey martin
and how many would not how many would say he doesn 't all right we have a good division of opinion here someone who would not be an unfair advantage
if he gets to ride in a golf cart
those of you i imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart worry about an unfair advantage what about
those of you who say he should be given a golf cart how would you answer the objection yes
get charlie a microphone in case someone wants to reply tell us charlie why would you say he should be able to use a golf cart
who has an answer for charlie all right who has an answer for charlie what would you say the endurance element is a very important part of the game not a
not a it's interesting
in the case in the lower court they brought in golfing greats to testify on this very issue
is walking the course essential to the game and they brought in jack nicklaus and arnold palmer and what do you suppose they all said yes they agreed with warren
they said yes walking the course is strenuous physical exercise the fatigue factor is an important part of golf and so it would change the fundamental nature of the game to give him the golf cart now notice something interesting
well i should tell you about the supreme court first the supreme court
decided what do you suppose they said
that casey martin must be provided a golf cart
two they ruled what was interesting about their ruling and about the discussion we've just had
is that the discussion about the right the justice of the matter depended on figuring out what is
the essential nature of golf
the supreme court justices wrestled with that question and justice stevens writing for the majority said he had read all about the history of golf
the essential point of the game is to get very small ball from one place into a hole
in as few strokes as possible and that walking was not essential but incidental now there were two dissenters one of whom was justice scalia
he wouldn't have granted the cart
and he had a very interesting dissent it's interesting because he rejected the aristotelian premise
to say that something is essential is ordinarily to say that it is necessary to the achievement of a certain object
but since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement
that is what distinguishes games from productive activity
it is quite impossible to say that any of a game 's arbitrary rules is essential so there you have justice scalia taking on the aristotelian premise of the majority 's opinion
justice scalia 's opinion is questionable for two reasons first
no real sports fan would talk that way
if we had thought that the rules of the sports we care about are merely arbitrary rather than designed
to call forth the virtues and the excellences that we think are worthy of admiring we wouldn't care about the outcome of the game
it's also objectionable on a second ground
on the face of it it seemed to be this debate about the golf cart an argument about fairness what's an unfair advantage
but if fairness were the only thing at stake there would have been an easy and obvious solution what would it be
but letting everyone ride in a cart would have been i suspect more anathema to the golfing greats
to the golfing greats and to the
even than making an exception for casey martin why
because what was at stake in the dispute over the golf cart
let me put the point as delicately as possible golfers are a little sensitive about the athletic status of their game
after all there's no running or jumping and the ball stands still
so if golfing is the kind of game that can be played while riding around in a golf cart it would be hard to confer
on the golfing greats the status that we confer the honor and recognition that goes to truly great athletes
flutes it's hard to decide the question of what justice requires without grappling with the question what is the essential nature of the activity in question
what qualities what excellences connected with that activity are worthy of honor and recognition
let 's take a final example that's prominent in contemporary political debate same sex marriage
there are those who favor state recognition
only of traditional marriage between one man and one woman
and there are those who favor state recognition of same sex marriage how many here favor
and how many favor the second same sex marriage
what ways of thinking about justice and morality underlie the arguments we have over marriage the opponents of same sex marriage say that the purpose of marriage fundamentally is procreation
what's worthy of honoring and recognizing and encouraging
and the defenders of same sex marriage say no procreation is not the only purpose of marriage what about a lifelong mutual loving commitment that's really what marriage is about
so with flutes with golf carts and even with a fiercely contested question like same sex marriage aristotle has a point
very hard to argue about justice without first arguing about the purpose of social institutions
about what qualities are worthy of honor and recognition so let 's step back from these cases and see how they shed light on the way we might
elevate the terms of political discourse in the united states and for that matter around the world there is a tendency to think
that if we engage too directly with moral questions in politics that's a recipe for disagreement
and for that matter a recipe for intolerance and coercion so better to shy away from to ignore the moral and the religious convictions that people bring to civic life
it seems to me that our discussion reflects the opposite that a better way
to mutual respect is to engage directly
with the moral convictions citizens bring to public life
rather than to require that people leave their deepest
moral convictions outside politics before they enter that it seems to me is a way to begin to restore the art of democratic argument thank you very much
golf courses to same sex marriage that was a genius link now look you're a pioneer of open education your lecture series was one of the first to do it big what's your vision for the next phase of this
well i think that it is possible in the classroom we have arguments on some
of the most fiercely held moral convictions that students have about big public questions and i think we can do that in public life more generally and so my real dream would be to take
the public television series that we've created of the course it's available now online free for everyone anywhere in the world
and to see whether we can partner with institutions at universities in china in india in africa around the world to try to promote
civic education and also a richer kind of
at some point live in real time you could have this kind of conversation inviting questions but with people from china and india joining in
way of thinking and arguing engaging seriously with
big moral questions exploring cultural differences and connect through a live video hookup
students in beijing and mumbai and in cambridge massachusetts and create a global classroom that's what i would love to
