i went to the local baker and took their stale bread i went to the local greengrocer and i went to a farmer who was throwing away potatoes because they were the wrong shape or size for supermarkets
pocket money addition to my teenage allowance
but i noticed that most of the food that i was giving my pigs was in fact fit for human consumption
and that i was only scratching the surface and that right the way up the food supply chain in supermarkets greengrocers bakers in our homes in factories and farms we were hemorrhaging out food
supermarkets didn 't even want to talk to me about how much food they were wasting i 'd been round the back i 'd seen bins full of food being locked and then trucked off to landfill sites and i thought surely
there is something more sensible to do with food than waste it
one morning when i was feeding my pigs i noticed a particularly tasty looking sun dried tomato loaf that used to crop up from time to time
i grabbed hold of it sat down and ate my breakfast with my pigs
really an exhibition of the injustice of food waste
and the provision of the solution to food waste which is simply to sit down and eat food rather than throwing it away
eventually i set about writing my book really to demonstrate the extent of this problem on a global scale
what this shows is a nation by nation breakdown of the likely level of food waste in each country in the world
unfortunately empirical data good hard stats don 't exist and therefore to prove my point i first of all had to find some proxy way of uncovering how much food was being wasted
that black line in the middle of that table is the likely level of consumption
with an allowance for certain levels of inevitable waste there will always be waste i 'm not that unrealistic that i think we can live in a waste free world
but that black line shows what a food supply should be in a country if they allow for a good stable secure
nutritional diet for every person in that country any dot above that line and you 'll quickly notice that that includes most countries in the world
represents unnecessary surplus and is likely to reflect levels of waste in each country
as a country gets richer it invests more and more in getting more and more surplus into its shops and restaurants
but the thing that really struck me when i plotted all this data and it was a lot of numbers
countries rapidly shoot towards that one hundred and fifty mark and then they level off and they don 't really go on rising as you might expect
so i decided to unpack that data a little bit further to see if that was true or false
and that 's what i came up with if you include not just the food that ends up in shops and restaurants but also the food that people feed to livestock
the maize the soy the wheat that humans could eat but choose to fatten livestock instead to produce increasing amounts of meat and dairy products what you find is that most rich countries have between three and four times
the amount of food that their population needs to feed itself a country like america has four times the amount of food
the fact is we have an enormous buffer in rich countries between ourselves and hunger
we 've never had such gargantuan surpluses before
in many ways this is a great success story of human civilization of the agricultural surpluses that we set out to achieve twelve thousand years ago
and when we chop down forests as we are every day to grow more and more food
when we extract water from depleting water reserves when we emit fossil fuel
emissions in the quest to grow more and more food and then we throw away so much of it
we have to think about what we can start and yesterday
i went to one of the local supermarkets that i often visit
so i want you to imagine that these nine biscuits that i found in the bin represent the global food supply okay we start out with nine that 's what 's in fields around the world every single year
the first biscuit we 're going to lose before we even leave the farm that 's a problem primarily associated with
developing work agriculture whether it 's a lack of infrastructure refrigeration pasteurization grain stores even basic fruit crates which means that food goes to waste before it even leaves the fields the next three biscuits
unfortunately our beasts are inefficient animals
and they turn two thirds of that into feces and heat so we 've lost those two and we 've only kept this one in meat and dairy products
two more we 're going to throw away directly into bins this is what most of us think of when we think of food waste what ends up in the garbage what ends up in supermarket bins what ends up in restaurant bins we 've lost another two and we 've left ourselves with just four biscuits to feed on
that is not a superlatively efficient use of global resources especially when you think of the billion hungry people that exist already in the world having gone through the data i then needed to demonstrate where that food ends up
where does it end up we 're used to seeing the stuff on our plates but what about all the stuff that goes missing in between
supermarkets are an easy place to start
this is the result of my hobby which is unofficial bin inspections
it represents a colossal waste of food but what i discovered whilst i was writing my book was that this very evident
abundance of waste was actually the tip of the iceberg
when you start going up the supply chain you find
where the real food waste is happening on a gargantuan scale
who lives in a household where it does get eaten
okay most people not everyone but most people and this is i 'm glad to say what i see across the world and yet has anyone seen a supermarket or sandwich shop anywhere in the world that serves sandwiches with crusts on it
go one step up and you get to farmers who throw away sometimes a third or even more of their harvest because of cosmetic standards this farmer for example has invested sixteen thousand pounds in growing spinach not one leaf of which he harvested because there was a little bit of grass growing in amongst it
potatoes that are cosmetically imperfect all going for pigs
parsnips that are too small for supermarket specifications tomatoes in tenerife
all being discarded perfectly edible because they 're the wrong shape or size
liver lungs heads tails kidneys testicles all of these things which are traditional delicious and nutritious parts of our gastronomy
this man in kashgar xinjiang province in western china is serving up his national dish it 's called sheep 's organs it 's delicious it 's nutritious and as i learned when i went to kashgar it symbolizes their taboo against food waste i was sitting in a roadside cafe
a chef came to talk to me i finished my bowl and halfway through the conversation he stopped talking and he started frowning into my bowl
i thought my goodness what taboo have i broken how have i insulted my host
he pointed at three grains of rice at the bottom of my bowl and he said clean
fish forty to sixty percent of european fish are discarded at sea they don 't even get landed
in our homes we 've lost touch with food this is an experiment i did on three lettuces
who keeps lettuces in their fridge
some food waste as i said at the beginning will inevitably arise so the question is what is the best thing to do with it i answered that question when i was fifteen in fact humans answered that question six thousand years ago we domesticated pigs
to turn food waste back into food
and yet in europe that practice has become illegal
since two thousand and one as a result of the foot and mouth outbreak it 's unscientific it 's unnecessary if you cook food for pigs just as if you cook food for humans it is rendered safe
it 's also a massive saving of resources at the moment europe depends on importing millions of tons of soy from south america where its production contributes to global warming to deforestation to biodiversity loss
to feed livestock here in europe at the same time we throw away millions of tons of food waste which we could and should be feeding them
if we did that and fed it to pigs we would save that amount of carbon
if we feed our food waste which is the current government favorite way of getting rid of food waste to anaerobic digestion which turns food waste into gas to produce electricity you save a paltry four hundred and forty eight kilograms of carbon dioxide per ton of food waste it 's much better to feed it to pigs we knew that during the war
the best thing to do with food is to eat and enjoy it and to stop wasting it for the sake of the planet we live on
we are a terrestrial animal and we depend on our land
