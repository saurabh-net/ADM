talk about manias let 's start with
hysterical teenagers crying screaming pandemonium all for one idea
all for one idea manias can be alarming
or manias can be deadly
the world has a new mania a mania for learning english listen as chinese students practice their english by screaming it
how many people are trying to learn english worldwide two billion of them
in latin america in india in southeast asia and most of all in china if you are a chinese student you start learning english in the third grade
by law that's why this year china will become the world 's largest english speaking country
why english in a single word opportunity opportunity for a better life a job to be able to pay for school or put better food on the table
she studies twelve hours a day for three years to prepare twenty five percent of her grade
is based on english it's called the gaokao and eighty million high school chinese students have already taken
this grueling test the intensity to learn english is almost unimaginable unless you witness it
so is english mania good or bad is english a tsunami washing away other languages not likely english is the world 's second language
your native language is your life but with english you can become part of a wider conversation a global conversation about global problems like climate change or poverty
or hunger or disease the world has other universal languages mathematics is the language of science
music is the language of emotions and now english is becoming the language of problem solving not because america is pushing it but because the world is pulling it
so english mania is a turning point like the harnessing of electricity in our cities or the fall of the berlin wall english represents hope for a better future
a future where the world has a common language to solve its common problems thank you very much
