i love coming to doha it 's such an international place this is like it feels like the united nations just here you land at the airport and you 're welcomed by an indian lady
who takes you to al maha services where you meet a filipino lady who hands you off to a south african lady who then takes you to a korean who takes you to a pakistani guy with the luggage who takes you to the car with a sri lankan you go to the hotel and you check in there 's a lebanese
i was on my way home from the airport i got a job i 'm working already
the middle east is going crazy you know the middle east is going crazy when lebanon is the most peaceful place in the region
i was in lebanon i got used to three
i went to egypt i went to say hello to this one egyptian guy
i went one two i went for three he wasn 't into it
after the revolution three so with iranians you can tell whose side the person is on based on the number of kisses they give you
americans don 't know a lot about us about the middle east i 'm iranian and american i 'm there i know i 've traveled here there 's so much we laugh right people don 't know we laugh when i did the axis of evil comedy tour it came out on comedy central i went online to see what people were saying about it i ended up on a conservative website one guy wrote another guy he said i never knew these people
think about it you never see us laughing in american film or television right maybe like an evil like
and i wish more americans would travel here i always encourage my friends travel see the middle east there 's so much to see so many good people and it 's vice versa and it helps stop problems of misunderstanding and stereotypes from happening for example i don 't know if you heard about this
a little while ago in the u s there was a muslim family walking down the aisle of an airplane talking about the safest place to sit on the plane
some passengers overheard them somehow misconstrued that as terrorist talk
got them kicked off the plane it was a family a mother father child walking down the aisle talking about the seating now as a middle eastern male i know there 's certain things i 'm not supposed to say on an airplane in the u s if you 're brown
here 's my advice to my brown friends
the next time you 're on an airplane in the u s just speak your mother tongue
that way no one knows what you 're saying life goes on
they might say what 's he talking about
thank you very much have a good night thank you i
