about compassion from an islamic point of view and perhaps my faith is not very well thought of as being one that is grounded in compassion
the truth of the matter is otherwise our holy book the koran consists of one hundred and fourteen chapters
each chapter begins with what we call the
the saying in the name of god the all compassionate the all merciful or as sir richard burton
not the richard burton who was married to elizabeth taylor
but the sir richard burton who lived a century before that and who was a world wide traveler and translator of many works of literature
translates it as in the name of god the compassionating the compassionate
and in a saying of the koran which to muslims is god speaking to humanity god says to his prophet muhammad
whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets beginning with adam including noah including moses including abraham including jesus christ and ending with muhammad
that we have not sent you oh muhammad except as a raham except as a source of compassion to humanity and for us human beings and certainly for us as muslims
and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet is to make ourselves as much like the
and the prophet in one of his sayings said adorn yourselves with the attributes of god and because god himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion
in fact the koran says that god decreed upon himself compassion or reigned himself in
of compassion actors of compassion and speakers of compassion and doers of compassion that is all well and good
but where do we go wrong and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world for the answer to this we turn to our spiritual path
in every religious tradition there is what you call the outer path and the inner path
or the exoteric path and the esoteric path
the esoteric path of islam is more popularly known as sufism or tasawwuf in arabic
and these doctors or these masters these spiritual masters of the sufi tradition refer to teachings and examples of our prophet
that teach us where the source of our problems lie
in one of the battles that the prophet waged he told his followers we are returning from the lesser war to the greater war to the greater battle
and they said messenger of god we are battle weary how can we go to a greater battle he said that is the battle of the self the battle of the ego
the sources of human problems have to do with egotism i
the famous sufi master rumi who is very well known to most of you
has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend and knocks on the door
and a voice answers who 's there it 's me or more grammatically correctly it is i as we might say in english the voice says go
after many years of training of disciplining of search and struggle he comes back and with much greater humility he knocks again on the door
the voice asks who is there he said it is you oh heartbreaker the door swings open
and the voice says come in for there is no room in this house for two
not these eyes for two egos
and rumi 's stories are metaphors for the spiritual path
in the presence of god there is no room for more than one
and that is the i of divinity
in a teaching called a hadith qudsi in our tradition god says that my servant or my creature my human creature does not approach me
that is dearer to me than what i have asked them to do
you want your employees to do what you ask them to do and if they've done that then they can do extra but don't ignore what you've asked them to do and god says
my servant continues to get nearer to me by doing more of what i've asked them to do extra credit we might call
until i love him or love her and when i love my servant god says i become
by which he or she sees
the ears by which he or she listens
by which he or she walks and the heart
by which he or she
with divinity that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions
muslims regard jesus as the master of
when he says i am the spirit and i am the way when the prophet muhammad said whoever has seen me has seen god
it is because they became so much an instrument
of god they became part of god 's steam so that god 's will was manifest through them and not acting from their own self
is given it is in us
all we have to do is to get our egos out of the way get our egotism out of the way
sure probably all of you here or certainly the very vast majority of you have had
what you might call a spiritual experience a moment in your lives when for a few seconds a minute perhaps ego dissolved
of water one with every human being one with the creator and you felt in the presence of power of awe of the deepest love
a gift when for a moment he lifts that boundary which makes us insist on i i i me me me
and instead like the person in rumi 's story we say oh this is all this is all you
and this is all us us and i and
us and i and all part of you
all creator all the objective the source of our being and the end of our journey
you are also the breaker of our hearts
you are the one whom we should all be towards for whose purpose we live and for whose purpose we shall die and for
shall be resurrected again to account to god to what extent we have been compassionate beings our message today
and our purpose today and those of you who are here today and the purpose of this charter of compassion is to remind for the
always urges us to remember to remind each other because the knowledge of truth
is within every human being
through our subconscious in your dreams which the koran calls our
state of sleep the lesser death
in our state of sleep we have dreams we have visions we travel
even outside of our bodies for many of us
and we see wonderful things we travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it and beyond the limitations of time as we know it is for us to
the name of the creator
whose primary name is the compassionating the compassionate
whatever name you want to call him with allah ram om whatever the name might be
through which you name or access the presence of divinity
the presence of divinity is the locus
and absolute knowledge and wisdom what hindus call satchidananda the language differs
but the objective is the same rumi has another story
about three a turk an arab
one is asking for grapes and they have a fight and an argument because i want grapes i want eneb i want
not knowing that the word that they're using
the same reality in different languages there's only one absolute reality by definition
one absolute being by definition because absolute is by definition single and absolute and singular
absolute concentration of being the absolute concentration of consciousness awareness an absolute locus
that defines the primary attributes of divinity
and that should also be the primary attributes of what it means to be human
for what defines humanity perhaps biologically is our physiology
the koran says he speaks to the angels and says when i have finished the formation of adam from
and breathed into him of my spirit then fall in prostration to him the angels
prostrate not before the human body
but before the human soul why because the soul the human soul embodies
a piece of the divine breath
a piece of the divine soul
this is also expressed in biblical vocabulary when we
we were created in the divine image
what is the imagery of god
the imagery of god is absolute being absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom and absolute compassion
and love and therefore for us to be human
in the greatest sense of what it means to be human in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human means that we
have to be proper stewards
of the breath of divinity within us
and to seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being of being alive
the attribute of wisdom of consciousness of awareness
and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings this
is what i understand from my faith
and this is what i understand from my studies of other faith traditions
and this is the common platform
on which we must all stand and when we stand on this platform as such i am convinced
that we can make a wonderful world and i believe personally that we're on the verge
and that with the presence and help of people like you here we can bring about
the prophecy of isiah for he foretold of a period when people shall transform their swords into plowshares
and will not learn war and make war anymore lower our
and let all be for the glorification of the one
thank you and god bless
