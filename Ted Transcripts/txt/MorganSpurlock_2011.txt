i difficult and dangerous
and i spent thirty days eating nothing but this fun in the beginning
very dangerous in the end
in fact most of my career i 've been immersing myself into seemingly horrible situations for the whole goal of trying to
examine societal issues in a way that make them engaging that make them interesting that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience
so when i knew i was coming here to do a ted talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship i knew i would want to do something a little different
so as some of you may or may not have heard a couple weeks ago i
took out an ad on ebay
i sent out some facebook messages some twitter messages
was going to get the once in a lifetime opportunity because i 'm sure chris anderson will never let it happen again
that at the time didn 't have a title
didn 't really have a lot of content and didn 't really give much hint as to what the subject matter would actually be
so what you were getting was this
your name here presents my ted talk
that you have no idea what the subject is and depending on the content could ultimately blow up in your face especially if i make you or your company look stupid for doing it but that being said
it 's a very good media opportunity
that 's just a working title by the way
i knew that someone would buy the naming rights now if you 'd have asked me that a year ago i wouldn 't have been able to tell you that with any certainty
but in the new project that i 'm working on my new film we examine the world of marketing advertising and as i said earlier i put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years
but nothing could prepare me
nothing could ready me for anything as difficult or as dangerous
it is the ultimate respect
people are going to be to it
pursuing a couple big really obvious brands
turns out it really means we want nothing to do with your movie
this intersection of new media and old media and the fractured media landscape isn 't the idea to get that new buzz worthy delivery vehicle that 's going to get that message to the masses no that 's what i thought
but the problem was you see my idea had one fatal flaw and that flaw
this would have been fine but what this image represents was the problem see when you do a google image search for transparency this is
this is one of the first images that comes up so
i like the way you roll sergey brin
this is was the problem transparency
free from pretense or deceit easily detected or seen through
readily understood characterized by visibility or accessibility of information especially concerning business practices that last line being probably the biggest problem you see we hear a lot about transparency these days our politicians say it our president says it even our ceo 's say it
but suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality something suddenly changes but why well transparency is scary
and it 's also very risky
he would say son there 's three sides to every story there 's your story there 's my story
that i would have to go on my own i 'd have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies myself
the greatest movie ever sold so how specifically will we see ban in the film
any time i 'm ready to go any time i open up my medicine cabinet you will see ban deodorant
i want to help you calm down so maybe you should put some one before the interview so we 'll offer one of these fabulous scents whether it 's a floral fusion or a paradise winds they 'll have their chance we will have them geared for both male or female solid roll on or stick whatever it may be
that 's the two cent tour
so now i can answer any of your questions and give you the five cent tour
i think fresh is a great word that really spins this category into the positive versus
what about me what about a regular guy i need to go talk to the man on the street the people who are like me the regular joes they need to tell me about my brand
dark glamor i like a lot of black colors a lot of grays and stuff like that
but i do often find myself at the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly
will just focus on one of their strengths or the other instead of focusing on both most companies
up attributes are things like being playful
being fresh like the fresh prince contemporary adventurous edgy
daring like errol flynn nimble or agile profane domineering magical or mystical like gandalf
are you reliable stable familiar safe secure sacred contemplative or wise like the dalai lama or yoda
over the course of this film
we had five hundred plus companies who were up and down companies saying no they didn 't want any part of this project they wanted nothing to do with this film mainly because they would have no control they would have no control over the final product but we did get seventeen brand partners
who were willing to relinquish that control who wanted to be in business with someone as mindful and as playful as myself
and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn 't be able to tell
stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind
they enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they 're using mri 's to target the desire centers of your brain for both commercials as well schools all across america
what 's incredible for me is the projects that i 've gotten the most feedback out of or i 've had the most success in are ones where i 've interacted with things directly and that 's what these brands did they cut out the middleman they cut out their agencies and said maybe these agencies don 't have my best interest in mind
i 'm going to deal directly with the artist i 'm going to work with him to create something different something that 's going to get people thinking that 's going to challenge the way we look at the world
and how has that been for them has it been successful well since the film premiered at the sundance film festival let 's take a look according to burrelles
the movie premiered in january and since then and this isn 't even the whole thing we 've had nine hundred million media impressions for this film that 's literally covering just like a two and a half week period that 's only online no print no tv the film hasn 't even been distributed yet it 's not even online it 's not even streaming it 's not even been out into other foreign countries yet so ultimately
this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum and not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to advised their clients not to take part
what i always believe is that if you take chances if you take risks that in those risks will come opportunity i believe that when you push people away from that you 're pushing them more towards failure
i believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse then you 're preparing your whole company to be reward challenged
i feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take risks we need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may scare them ultimately moving forward i think we have to embrace fear we 've got to put that bear in a cage
one big spoonful at a time we have to embrace risk and ultimately we have to embrace transparency
today more than ever a little honesty is going to go a long way and that being said through honesty and transparency my entire talk embrace transparency
has been brought to you i
