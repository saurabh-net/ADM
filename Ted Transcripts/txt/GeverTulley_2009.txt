this is the exact moment that i started creating something called tinkering school
and be trusted trusted not to hurt themselves and trusted not to hurt others
when the kids arrive they're confronted with lots of stuff wood and nails and rope and
and lots of tools real tools
it's a six day immersive experience for the kids and within that context we can offer the kids time something that seems in short supply in their over scheduled lives our goal
is to ensure that they leave with a better sense of how to make things than when they arrived and the deep internal realization that you can figure things out by fooling around
nothing ever turns out as planned ever
and the kids soon learn that all projects go awry
and become at ease with the idea that every step in a project is a step closer to sweet success or gleeful calamity
we start from doodles and sketches and sometimes we make real plans and sometimes we just start building
building is at the heart of the experience hands on deeply immersed and fully committed to the problem at hand
is in the doing and failures are celebrated and analyzed problems become puzzles and obstacles disappear
when faced with particularly difficult setbacks or complexities a really interesting behavior emerges decoration from these interludes come
deep insights and amazing new approaches to solving the problems that had them frustrated just moments before all materials
are available for use even those mundane hateful plastic grocery bags
can become a bridge stronger than anyone imagined and the things that they build even themselves
even themselves three
