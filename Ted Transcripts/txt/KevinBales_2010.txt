and i was at a public event and i saw this leaflet and it said
there are millions of slaves in the world today and i thought
because i also i'm going to admit to you i also thought
how can i be like a hot shot young full professor who teaches human rights and not know this so it can't be true
well if you teach if you worship in the temple of learning do not mock the gods
because they will take you fill you with curiosity and desire and drive you
you with a passion to change things
i went out and did a lit review three thousand articles on the key word slavery two turned out to be about contemporary only
all the rest were historical they were press pieces and they were full of outrage they were full of speculation they were anecdotal no solid information
so i began to do a research project of my own i went to five countries around the world i looked at slaves i met slaveholders
and i looked very deeply into slave based businesses because this is an economic crime people do not
to be mean to them they do it to make a profit
four different continents was depressingly familiar
showing us how they were
and met up with our film it was mind blowing
and i want to be very clear
i'm talking about real slavery this is not about lousy marriages this is not about jobs that suck this is about people who can not walk away
it's real slavery in exactly the same way that slavery would be recognized throughout all of human history
now where is it well
this map in the sort of redder yellower colors are the places with the highest densities of slavery but in fact that kind of bluey color are the countries where we can't find any cases of slavery and you might notice that it's only iceland and greenland
where we can't find any cases of enslavement around the world we're also particularly interested and looking very carefully at places where
slaves are being used to perpetrate extreme environmental destruction
around the world slaves are used to destroy the environment cutting down trees in the amazon destroying
it's a pretty harrowing linkage between what's happening to our environment and what's happening to our human rights
that's double the number that came out of
africa in the entire transatlantic slave
well it builds up with these factors they are not causal they are actually supporting factors one is we all know about the population explosion the world goes from two billion people to almost seven billion people in the last
being numerous does not make you a slave
the increased vulnerability of very large numbers of people in the developing world
caused by civil wars ethnic conflicts kleptocratic governments disease you name it you know it we understand how that works in some countries all of those things happen at once
like sierra leone a few years ago
and push enormous parts about a billion people in the world in fact as we know live on the edge live in situations where they don't have
any opportunity and are usually even destitute but that doesn't make you a slave either
what it takes to turn a person who is destitute and vulnerable into a slave
is the absence of the rule of law
if the rule of law is sound it protects the poor and it protects the vulnerable
but if corruption creeps in and people don't have the opportunity to have that protection of the rule of law then if you can use violence if you can use violence with impunity you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable into slavery
well that is precisely what has happened around the world
the way they come into slavery today the people who step into slavery today don't usually get kidnapped or knocked over the head
they come into slavery because someone has asked them this question
i knew i had to do anything i could to earn some money to support the people i care
they climb into the back of the truck they go off with the person who recruits them
ten miles one hundred miles one thousand miles later
they find themselves in dirty dangerous demeaning work
the hammer comes down and they discover
that kind of slavery is again pretty much what slavery has been all through human history but there is one thing that is particularly remarkable and novel about slavery today
and that is a complete collapse
the price of human beings
even the business programs have started picking up on this i just want to share a little clip for
okay lively discussion guaranteed here as always as we get macro and talk commodities continuing here in the studio with our guest michael o 'donohue head of commodities at four continents capital management
well daphne we've been going short on gas and oil recently and casting our net just a little bit wider we really like the human being story a lot if you look at a long term chart
we're recommending to our clients a buy and hold strategy there is no need to play the market there is a lot of vulnerable people out there it's very exciting
figured it out that's a
i enjoyed watching your jaws drop drop drop
until you got it mtv europe worked with us and made that spoof and they've been slipping it in between music videos without any introduction which i think is kind of fun
thousand capital purchase items you can see that the lines cross when the population explodes the average price of a human being today around the world is about dollar ninety key here is that
you use them you crumple them up
these young boys are in nepal
they are basically the transport system on a quarry run by a slaveholder there are no roads there so they carry loads of stone on their backs often of their own weight up and down the himalayan mountains
it's a horrible situation and if there is anything that makes me feel very positive about this it's that there are also in addition to young men like this who are still enslaved there are ex slaves who are now working to free others
or we say frederick douglass is in the house i don't know if you've ever had a daydream about wow what would it be like to meet harriet tubman what would it be like to meet frederick douglass i've got to say one of the most exciting parts about my job is that i get to
and i want to introduce you to one of those his name is james kofi annan he was a slave child in ghana enslaved in the fishing industry and he now after escape and building a new life has
an organization that we work closely with to go back and get people out of slavery this is not james this is one of the kids that he works with
and this reminds me of james and our
a very positive side to this and that is this the twenty seven million people who are in slavery today
and likewise the forty billion dollars that they generate into the global economy each year is the tiniest proportion of the global economy to ever be represented by slave labor
slavery illegal in every country has been pushed to the edges of our
in a way without us even noticing has ended up standing on the precipice of its own extinction
waiting for us to give it a big
and knock it over and get rid of it
if we do that if we put the resources and the focus to it
first before i even tell you the cost i've got to be absolutely clear
we do not buy people out of slavery
amazingly in places like india where costs are very low
live in those places where
and in fact the global average is about what it is for
and that means when you multiply it up
what americans spend on potato chips and pretzels
usually the annual expenditure in this country on blue jeans
ten point eight billion dollars
intel 's fourth quarter earnings ten point eight billion
it's not a lot of money at the global level in fact it's peanuts and the great thing about it is that it's not money down a hole there is a freedom dividend when you let people out of slavery to work for themselves are they motivated
they take their kids out of the workplace they build a school they say we 're gonna have stuff we've never had before like three squares
they become consumers and producers and local economies begin to spiral up very rapidly
four million people were lifted up out of slavery and
dumped without political participation decent education
we have made a commitment that we will never let people come out of slavery on our watch and end up as second class citizens it's just not going this is
this is a village in nepal
been working there about a month
they had just begun to come out of a hereditary kind of slavery
just begun to light up a little bit open up a little bit but when we went to speak with her when we took this photograph
the slaveholders were still menacing us from the sidelines they hadn't been really pushed back
i was frightened we were frightened
we said to her are you worried are you upset she said no
because we've got hope now succeed she said
when people like you from the other side of the world are coming here to stand beside us
we have to ask ourselves
are we willing to live in a world with slavery
if there is one thing that every human being can agree on i think it's that slavery should end and if there is a fundamental violation of our human dignity
got to say what good is all of our intellectual and political and economic power and i'm really thinking intellectual power in this room
if we can't use it to bring slavery to
and you know what if we can't do that
okay thank you so much you know for me
