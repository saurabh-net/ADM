what we do though is we send each one of them including myself out into the world with the admonition be perfect never ever ever make a mistake but you worry about the details about how that
and all the while i was amassing more and more knowledge and i did well i graduated with
and to report back to my attending
and i saw mrs drucker and she was breathless and when i listened to her she was making a wheezy sound and when i
to get her to pee out the access fluid and over the course of the next hour and a half or two she started to feel
without speaking to my attending
maybe i didn 't want to be a high maintenance resident maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility
in sending her home i disregarded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me
goldman not a good idea
in fact so lacking in confidence was i that
when i did something that i don 't usually do i walked through the emergency department on my way home
and it was there that another nurse not the nurse who was looking after mrs drucker before but another nurse said three words to me that are the three words that most emergency physicians i know dread others in medicine dread them as well but there 's something particular about emergency medicine because we see patients so fleetingly the three words are
slowly but surely it lifted
and she said the three words do you remember
felt cleansed and went back
they had their operations and they did okay
but each time they were gnawing at me eating at me and i 'd like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say
which is total b s laughter some of my doozies have been in
believe me i 'd have trouble making eye
what will we be left with but a safe
i 've made a personal study of medical malpractice and medical errors to learn everything i can from one of the first articles i wrote for the toronto star to my show white coat black art and what i 've learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous
in this country as many as twenty four thousand canadians die of preventable medical errors in the united states the institute of medicine pegged it at one hundred thousand in both cases these are gross underestimates because we really aren 't ferreting out the problem as we their worst cases
and it starts with one physician at a time the redefined physician is human knows she 's human accepts it isn 't proud of making mistakes but strives to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else
and she works in a culture of medicine that acknowledges that human beings run the system and when human beings run the system they will make mistakes from time to time so the system is evolving to create
and also fosters in a loving supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewarded for doing so and especially people like me when we do make mistakes we 're rewarded for coming clean
i am a redefined physician i 'm human i make mistakes i 'm sorry about that
but i strive to learn one thing that i can pass legendary
