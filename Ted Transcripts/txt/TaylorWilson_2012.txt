my name is taylor wilson i am seventeen years old and i am a nuclear physicist which may be a little hard to believe but i am and i would like to make the case that nuclear fusion will be that
point that the bridge that t boone pickens talked about will get us to so nuclear fusion is our energy future and the second point making the case that kids can really change the world so you may ask applause you
that is the inside of my nuclear fusion reactor i started building this project when i was about twelve or thirteen years old i decided i wanted to make a star now most of you are probably saying well
there 's no such thing as nuclear fusion i don 't see any nuclear power plants with fusion energy well it doesn 't break even it doesn 't produce more energy out than i put in but it still does some pretty cool stuff
and i assembled this in my garage and it now lives in the physics department of the university of nevada reno and it slams together deuterium which is just hydrogen with an extra neutron in it so this is similar to the reaction of the proton chain that 's going on inside the sun
and i 'm slamming it together so hard that that hydrogen fuses together and in the process it has some byproducts and i utilize those byproducts so
my garage applause and i
produce these isotopes so that 's my fusion reactor in the background there
that is me at the control panel of my fusion reactor
oh by the way i make yellowcake in my garage so my nuclear program is as advanced as the iranians so maybe i don 't want to admit to that
