fertilizer or land so here 's what i came up with imagine that we build an enclosure where we put it just underwater and we fill it with wastewater and some form of microalgae that produces oil and we make it out of some kind of flexible material that moves with waves underwater
and the system that we 're going to build of course will use solar energy to grow the algae and they use co two which is good and they produce oxygen as they grow
the algae that grow are in a container that distributes the heat to the surrounding water and you can harvest them and make biofuels and cosmetics and fertilizer and animal feed and of course you 'd have to make a large area of this so you
we know the importance of potentially getting an alternative liquid fuel
here you see a graph showing you the different types of crops that are being considered for making biofuels so you can see some things like soybean which makes fifty gallons per acre per year or sunflower or canola or jatropha or palm and
so what are microalgae microalgae are micro that is they 're extremely small as you can see here a picture of those single celled organisms compared to a human hair
those small organisms have been around for millions of years and there 's thousands of different species of microalgae in the world some of which are the fastest growing plants on the planet and produce as i just showed you lots and lots of oil now
why do we want to do this offshore well the reason we 're doing this offshore is because if you look at our coastal cities
there isn 't a choice
because we 're going to use waste water as i suggested and if you look at where most of the waste water treatment plants are they 're embedded in the cities this is the city of san francisco which has nine hundred miles of sewer pipes under the city already and it releases its waste water offshore so
different cities around the world treat their waste water differently some cities process it some cities just release the water but in all cases the water that 's released is perfectly adequate for growing microalgae so let 's envision what the system might look like we call it omega which is an acronym for offshore membrane enclosures for growing algae
so how does it work i sort of showed you how it works already we
they of course use solar energy to grow and the wave energy on the surface provides energy for mixing the algae and the temperature is controlled by the surrounding water temperature the algae that grow produce oxygen as i 've mentioned and they also produce biofuels and fertilizer and food and other
bi algal products of interest
and the system is contained what do i mean by that
the waste water that leaks out is water that already now goes into that coastal environment and
the algae that leak out are biodegradable and because they 're living in waste water they 're fresh water algae which means they can 't live in salt water so they die the plastic we 'll build it out of is some kind of well known plastic that we have good experience with and we 'll rebuild our modules to be able to reuse them again
so we may be able to go beyond that when thinking about this system that i 'm showing you and that is to say we need to think in terms of the water the fresh water which is also going to be an issue in the future and we 're working on methods now for recovering the waste water
the other thing to consider is the structure itself it provides a surface for things in the ocean and this surface which is covered by seaweeds and other organisms in the ocean will become enhanced marine
so you 're probably thinking gee this sounds like a good idea what can we do to try to see if it 's real
well i set up laboratories in santa cruz at the california fish and game facility
and that facility allowed us to have big seawater tanks to test some of these ideas we also set up experiments in san francisco at one of the three waste water treatment plants again a facility to test ideas and finally we wanted to see where we could look at what the impact of this structure would be
in the marine environment and we set up a field site
at a place called moss landing marine lab in monterey bay where we worked in a harbor to see what impact this would have on marine organisms
the laboratory that we set up in santa cruz was our skunkworks it was a place where we were growing algae and welding plastic and building tools and making a lot of mistakes or as edison said we were finding the ten thousand ways that the system wouldn 't work now we grew algae in waste water
so the most important feature that we needed to develop were these so called photobioreactors or pbrs these were the structures that would be floating at the surface made out of some inexpensive plastic material that 'll allow the algae to grow
and we had built lots and lots of designs most of which were horrible failures and when we finally got to a design that worked at about thirty gallons we scaled it up to four hundred and fifty gallons in san francisco
so let me show you how the system works we basically take waste water with algae of our choice in it and we circulate it through this floating structure this tubular flexible plastic structure
and it circulates through this thing and there 's sunlight of course it 's at the surface and the algae grow on the nutrients but this is a bit like putting your head in a plastic bag the algae are not going to suffocate because of co two as we would they suffocate because they produce oxygen and they don 't really suffocate but the oxygen that they produce is problematic
and what you see here is the prototype which was the first attempt at building this type of column the larger column that we then installed in san francisco in the installed system
so the column actually had another very nice feature and that is the algae settle in the column and this allowed us to accumulate the algal biomass in a context where we could easily harvest it
so we would remove the algaes that concentrated in the bottom of this column and then we could harvest that by a procedure where you float the algae to the surface and can skim it off with a net
so we wanted to also investigate what would be the impact of this system in the marine environment and i mentioned we set up this experiment at a field site in moss landing marine lab
well we found of course that this material became overgrown with algae and we needed then to develop a cleaning procedure and we also looked at how seabirds and marine mammals interacted
and in fact you see here a sea otter that found this incredibly interesting and would periodically work its way across this little floating water bed and we wanted to hire this guy or train him to be able to clean the surface of these things but that 's for the future
now really what we were doing we were working in four areas our research covered the biology of the system which included studying the way algae grew but also what eats the algae and what kills the algae
i mentioned we looked at birds and marine mammals and looked at basically the environmental impact of the system and finally we looked at the economics and what i mean by economics is what is the energy required to run the system do you get more energy out of the system than you have to put into the system to be able to make the system run
and what about operating costs and what about capital costs and what about just the whole economic structure
so let me tell you that it 's not going to be easy and there 's lots more work to do in all four of those areas to be able to really make the system work
but when you do the economics of this system you find that in fact it will be difficult to make it work
unless you look at the system as a way to treat waste water
sequester carbon and potentially for photovoltaic panels or wave energy or even wind energy and if you start thinking in terms of integrating all of these different activities you could also include in such a facility aquaculture
so we would have under this system a shellfish aquaculture where we 're growing mussels or scallops
we 'd be growing oysters and things that would be producing high value products and food and this would be a market driver as we build the system to larger and larger scales so that it becomes ultimately competitive with the idea of doing it for fuels so
there 's always a big question that comes up because plastic in the ocean has got a really bad reputation right now and so we 've been thinking cradle to cradle what are we going to do with all this plastic that we 're going to need to use in our marine environment
well i don 't know if you know about this but in california there 's a huge amount of plastic that 's used in fields right now as plastic mulch and this is plastic that 's making these tiny little greenhouses right along the surface of the soil and this provides warming the soil to increase the growing season
it allows us to control weeds and of course it makes the watering much more efficient
so the omega system will be part of this type of an outcome and that when we 're finished using it in the marine environment we 'll be using it hopefully on fields
it would produce at two thousand gallons per acre per year it would produce over two million gallons of fuel which is about twenty percent of the biodiesel or of the diesel that would be required in san francisco
and that 's without doing anything about efficiency where else could we potentially put this system
there 's lots of possibilities there 's of course san francisco bay as i mentioned san diego bay is another example mobile bay or chesapeake bay but the reality is as sea level rises there 's going to be lots and lots of new opportunities to consider
to innovative production of sustainable biofuels and en route i discovered that what 's really required for sustainability
is integration more than innovation
long term i have great faith in our collective and connected ingenuity i think there is almost no limit to what we can accomplish if we are radically open and we don 't care who gets the credit
sustainable solutions for our future problems are going to be diverse and are going to be many
i think we need to consider everything everything from alpha to omega thank you
permitting issues and the time required to get permits to do things offshore it really requires at this point people on the outside and we 're being radically open with this technology in which we 're going to launch it out there for anybody and everybody who 's interested to take it on and try to make it real
