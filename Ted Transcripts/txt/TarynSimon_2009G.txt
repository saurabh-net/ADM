is in fact not photographic it involves a campaign of letter writing research and phone calls
to access my subjects which can range from hamas leaders in gaza to a hibernating black bear in its cave in west virginia
and oddly the most kind of notable letter of rejection i ever recieved came from walt disney world a seemingly innocuous site
and it read i'm just going to read a key sentence especially during these violent times i personally believe that the magical spell
cast upon guests who visit our theme parks is particularly important to protect and helps to provide them with an important fantasy they can escape to
photography threatens fantasy they didn't want to let my camera in because it confronts constructed realities myths and beliefs and provides what appears to be evidence of a truth
but there are multiple truths attached to every image depending on the creator 's intention the viewer and the context in which it is presented
over a five year period following september eleventh when the american media and government were seeking hidden and unknown sites beyond its borders
most notably weapons of mass destruction i chose to look inward at that which was integral to america 's foundation mythology and daily functioning
i wanted to confront the boundaries of the citizen self imposed and real and confront the divide between privileged and public access to knowledge
it was a critical moment in american history and global history where one felt they didn't have access to accurate information
and i wanted to see the center with my own eyes but what i came away with is a photograph and it's just another place from which to observe
and the understanding that there are no absolute all knowing insiders and the outsider can never really reach the core
i'm going to run through some of the photographs in this series it's titled an american index of the hidden and unfamiliar and it's comprised of nearly seventy images in this context i'll just show you a few
this is a nuclear waste storage and encapsulation facility at hanford site in washington state
where there are over nineteen hundred stainless steel capsules containing nuclear waste submerged in water a human standing in front of an unprotected capsule would die instantly
and i found one section amongst all of these that actually resembled the outline of the united states of america which you can see here
and a big part of the work that is sort of absent in this context is text so i create these two poles every image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text
and what i'm most interested in is the invisible space between a text and its accompanying image and how the image is transformed by the text and the text by the image so at best the image is meant to float away into
abstraction and multiple truths and fantasy and then the text functions as this cruel anchor that kind of nails it to the ground
in this context i'm just going to read an abridged version of those texts
this is a cryopreservation unit and it holds the bodies of the wife and mother of cryonics pioneer robert ettinger who hoped to be awoken one day to extended life

this is a u s customs and border protection room a contraband room at john f kennedy international airport
on that table you can see forty eight hours worth of seized goods from passengers entering in to the united states there is a pig 's head and african cane rats
and part of my photographic work is i'm not just documenting what's there i do take certain liberties and intervene and in this i really wanted it to resemble an early still life painting so i spent some time with the smells and
items this is the exhibited art on the walls of the cia in langley virginia their original headquarters building
and the cia has had a long history with both covert and public cultural diplomacy efforts
and it's speculated that some of their interest in the arts was designed to counter soviet communism and promote what it considered to be pro american thoughts and aesthetics and one of the art forms that elicited the interest of the agency and had thus come under question is
this is the forensic anthropology research facility and on a six acre plot there are approximately seventy five cadavers at any given time that are being studied by forensic anthropologists and researchers

this is the only federally funded site where it is legal to cultivate cannabis for scientific research in the united states it's a research crop marijuana grow room
and you can't completely understand how information is being distributed
these are transatlantic submarine communication cables that travel across the floor of the atlantic ocean connecting north america to europe they carry over sixty million simultaneous voice conversations
and in a lot of the government and technology sites there was just this very apparent vulnerability this one is almost humorous because it feels like i could just snip all of that conversation in one easy cut but stuff did feel like it could have been
this is a braille edition of playboy magazine and this is a division of the library of congress produces a free national library service

all living white tigers in north america are the result of selective inbreeding that would be mother to son father to daughter sister to brother to allow for the genetic conditions that create a salable white tiger meaning white fur ice blue eyes a pink nose

now i'm going to move on to another project i did it's titled the innocents and for the men in these photographs photography had been used to create a fantasy
i traveled across the united states photographing men and women who had been wrongfully convicted of crimes they did not commit violent crimes
i investigate photography 's ability to blur truth and fiction and its influence on memory which can lead to severe even lethal consequences
for the men in these photographs the primary cause of their wrongful conviction was mistaken identification a victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcement 's use of images
but through exposure to composite sketches polaroids mugshots and line ups eyewitness testimony can change i'll give you an example from a case
a woman was raped and presented with a series of photographs from which to identify her attacker she saw some similarities in one of the photographs but couldn't quite make a positive identification
days later she is presented with another photo array of all new photographs except that one photograph that she had some draw to from the earlier array is repeated in the second array
and a positive identification is made because the photograph replaced the memory if there ever was an actual memory

between truth and fiction in both his life and in photography
