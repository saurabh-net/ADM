what i am always thinking about
is what this session is about which is called simplicity and almost i would almost call it being simple minded but in the best sense of the word
how to die period that's all i'm trying to do all day long and i'm also trying to have some meals and have some snacks and you know and yell at my children and do all the normal things that keep you grounded
so i was fortunate enough to be born a very dreamy child my older sister was busy torturing my parents and they were busy torturing her
i was lucky enough to be completely ignored which is a fabulous thing actually i want to tell you so i was able to completely daydream my way through my life
where i met a man who was trying to blow up the math building of nyu and i was writing terrible poetry and knitting sweaters for him
and feminists hated us and the whole thing was wretched from beginning to end but
i kept writing bad poetry and he didn't blow up the math building but he went to cuba but i gave him the money because i was from riverdale so i had more money than he did
and that was a good thing to help the you know the cause but then he came back
and things happened and i decided i really hated my writing that it was awful awful purple prose
and i decided that i wanted to tell but i still wanted to tell a narrative story and i still wanted to tell my stories so i decided that i would start to draw how hard could that be and so
what happened was that i started just becoming an editorial illustrator through you know sheer whatever sheer ignorance and we started a
if you know too much you're stymied so the premise in the studio was there are no boundaries there is no fear and i and my full time job i landed the best job on earth was to daydream and to actually come up
with absurd ideas that fortunately there were enough people there and it was a team it was a collective it was not just me coming up with crazy ideas but
the point was that i was there as myself as a dreamer and so some of the things i mean it was a long history of m company and clearly we also needed to make some money so we decided
we would create a series of products and some of the watches there attempting to be beautiful and humorous maybe not attempting hopefully succeeding
that to be able to talk about content to break apart what you normally expect to use humor and surprise elegance and
humanity in your work was really important to us it was a very high it was a very impersonal time in design and we wanted to say
the content is what's important not the package not the wrapping you really have to be journalists you have to be inventors you have to use your imagination more importantly than anything so
the good news is that i have a dog and though i don't know if i believe in luck i don't know what i believe in it's a very complicated question but
i do know that before i go away i crank his tail seven times so whenever he sees a suitcase in the house because everybody 's always you know leaving they're always cranking this wonderful dog 's tail and he runs to the other room but
i am able to make the transition from working for children and from working for adults to children and back and forth because you know i can say that i'm immature and in a way
true i don't really i mean i could tell you that i didn't understand
i'm not proud of it but i didn't understand let 's say ninety five percent of the talks at this conference but i have been taking beautiful notes of drawings and i have a gorgeous onion from
's talk and i have a beautiful page of doodles from jonathan woodham 's talk so good things come out of you know incomprehension
which i will do a painting of and then it will end up in my work so i'm open to the possibilities of not knowing and finding out something new so
in writing for children it seems simple
and it is you have to condense a story into thirty two pages usually and what you have to do is you really have to edit down to what you want to say and hopefully
not talking down to kids and you're not talking in such a way that you you know couldn't stand reading it after one time so i hopefully am writing you know books that are good for children and for adults
the painting reflects i don't think differently for children than i do for adults i try to use the same kind of imagination the same kind of whimsy the same kind of love of language so
you know and i have lots of wonderful looking friends this is andrew gatz and he walked in through the door and i said you sit down there you know i take lots of photos and the bertoia chair in the background is my favorite chair so
i get to put in all of the things that i love hopefully a dialog between adults and children will happen on many different levels and hopefully different different kinds of humor will evolve and the books are really journals of my life i never
because my life is too random and too confused and i enjoy it that way but anyway so i was in we were in venice
and this is our room and i had this dream that i was wearing this fantastic green gown and i was looking out the window and it was really a beautiful thing and so i was able to put that into this
well he has some hair but well he used to have hair and with him i was able to do a project that was really fantastic i work for the new yorker and i do covers and
nine eleven happened and it was you know a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it
and rick and i were on our way to a party in the bronx and somebody said bronxistan and somebody said fareerristan and we
came up with this new yorker cover which we were able to we didn't know what we were doing we weren't trying to be funny we weren't trying to be well we were trying to be funny actually that's not true
we hoped we'd be funny but we didn't know it would be a cover and we didn't know that that image at the moment that it happened would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people and it really became the
i don't know you know it was one of those moments people started laughing at what was going on and from you know fattushis to taxistan to you know for the fashtoonks botoxia pashmina khlintunesia
you know we were able to take the city and make fun of this completely foreign who are what's going on over here who are these people what are these tribes and
david remnick who was really wonderful about it had one problem he didn't like al zheimer al zheimers because he thought it would insult people with alzheimer 's but you know we said david who 's
they're not so it stayed in and it was and you know it was a good thing
in the course of my life i never know what's going to happen and that's kind of the beauty part and we were on cape cod a place obviously of great inspiration and i picked up this book
the elements of style at a yard sale and i didn't and i'd never used it in school because i was too busy writing poems and flunking out and
i don't know what sitting in cafes but i picked it up and i started reading it and i thought this book is amazing i said who people should know about this book so
decided it needed a few it needed a lift it needed a few illustrations and basically i called the you know i convinced the white estate and what an intersection of like you know
polish jew you know main wasp family here i am saying i'd like to do something to this book and they said yes and they left me completely alone which was a gorgeous wonderful thing and
e b white wrote such wonderful whimsical and actually strunk and then you come to the rules and you know there are lots of grammar things do you mind me asking a question do you mind my asking a question
could should or would should could and would is coco chanel 's lover should is edith sitwell and could is an august sander subject and he noticed a large stain in the center of the rug
so there's a kind of british understatement murder mystery theme that i really love very much
or you can ignore them which i do or you can i don't know what you know eat a sandwich so
what i did when i was painting was i started singing because i really adore singing and i think that music is the highest form of all art so i commissioned a wonderful composer nico muhly who
wrote nine songs using the text and we performed this fantastic evening
he wrote music for both amateurs and professionals i played the clattering teacup and the slinky in the main reading room of the new york public library
where you're supposed to be very very quiet and it was a phenomenally wonderful event which we hopefully will do some more
who knows the new york times select the op ed page asked me to do a column and they said you can do whatever you want so once a month for the last year i've been doing
column called the principles of uncertainty which you know i don't know who heisenberg is but i know i can throw that around now you know it's the principles of uncertainty so
you know i'm going to read quickly and probably i'm going to edit some because i don't have that much time left a few of the columns and basically i was
how can i tell you everything that is in my heart impossible to begin enough no begin with the hapless dodo and i talk about the dodo and how the dodo became extinct
and then he died and there was no more spinoza extinct and then we don't have a stuffed spinoza but we do have a stuffed pavlov 's dog
and i visited him in the museum of hygiene in st petersburg in russia and there he is with this horrible electrical box on his rump
in this fantastic decrepit palace
and i think it must have been a very very dark day when the bolsheviks arrived maybe amongst themselves they had a few good laughs but stalin was a paranoid man even more than my father
you don't even know and
's family fled russia how could the young nabokov sitting innocently and elegantly in a red chair leafing through a book and butterflies imagine such displacement such loss
and then i want to tell you that this is a map so my beautiful mother 's family fled russia as well too many pogroms leaving the shack the wild blueberry woods the geese
the river sluch they went to palestine and then america and my mother drew this map for me of the united states of america and that is my dna over here because that
who i grew up with had no use for facts whatsoever facts were actually
from our home and so if you see that texas you know texas and california are under canada and that south carolina is on top of north carolina this is the home that i grew up in
ok so it's a miracle that i'm here today
but actually it's not it's actually a wonderful thing but then she says tel aviv and lenin which is the town they came from and sorry the rest unknown thank you but in her lexicon means sorry the rest unknown is sorry the rest unknown go to hell because she couldn't care less
of february is that february 's a really wretched month in new york and the images for me conjure up these really awful things
not so awful i received a box in the mail and it was wrapped with newspaper and there was the picture of the man on the newspaper and he was dead
and i say i hope he 's not really dead just enjoying a refreshing lie down in the snow but the caption says he is dead and actually he was i think he 's dead though i don't know maybe he 's not dead
and this woman leans over in anguish not about that man but about all sad things it happens quite often in february there's consoling
this man is angry because somebody threw onions all over the staircase and basically you know i guess onions are a theme here and he says it is impossible not to lie it is february and not lying is impossible and i really spend a lot of time wondering
how much truth do we tell what is that we're actually what story are we actually telling how do we know when we are ourselves how do we actually know that these sentences coming out of our mouths are real stories you know are real sentences
or are they fake sentences that we think we ought to be saying i'm going to quickly go through this
a quote by bertrand russell all the labor of all the ages all the devotion all the inspiration all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction
so now my friends if that is true and it is true what is the point a complicated question and so you know i talk to my friends and i go to plays where they're singing russian songs oh my god you know what could we have no we don't have time
i taped my aunt i taped my aunt singing a song in russian from the you know could we have it for a second do you have used
in the ocean every day of the year until she was about eighty five
so and that's a song about how everybody 's miserable because you know we're from russia
i went to visit kitty carlisle hart and she is ninety six and when i brought her a copy of the elements of style she said she would treasure it and then i said oh and she was talking about moss hart and i said you know when you met him you knew it was him and she said i knew it was he so
i was the one who should have kept the book but it was a really wonderful moment
and she dated george gershwin so you know get out gershwin died at the age of thirty eight he 's buried in the same cemetery as my husband
i don't want to talk about that now i do want to talk the absolute icing on this cemetery cake is the barricini family mausoleum nearby i think the barricini family should open a store there and sell chocolate
and i would like to run it for them and i went to visit louise bourgeoise who 's also still working and i looked at her sink which is really amazing and left and then i photograph and do a painting of a sofa on the street and a woman who lives on our street lolita
and then my aunt frances dies and before she died she tried to pay with sweet n low packets for her bagel
and i look at a beautiful bowl of fruit and i look at a dress that i sewed for friends of mine and it says ich habe genug which is a bach cantata which i once thought meant i've had it
i can't take it anymore give me a break but i was wrong it means i have enough and that is utterly true i happen to be alive end of discussion thank you
