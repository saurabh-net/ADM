used to be a lot easier to be from iceland because until a couple of years ago people knew hardly anything about us and i could basically come out here and say only good things about us but in the last couple of years we 've become infamous for a couple of things first
of course the economic meltdown it actually got so bad that somebody put our country up for sale on
ninety nine pence was the starting price and no reserve
none of your media got it right
careers in investment banking in the corporate sector leave to found a financial services firm well let it suffice to say
that we felt a bit overwhelmed with testosterone
and i 'm not here to say that men are to blame for the crisis and what happened in my country but i can surely tell you that in my country much like on wall street and the city of london and elsewhere men were at the helm of the game of the financial sector
and that kind of lack of diversity and sameness leads to disastrous problems
into the world of finance raised quite a few eyebrows in iceland we weren 't known as the typical women women in iceland up until then so
the fact that we were women and that we believed that we had a set of values and a way of doing business that would be more sustainable than what we had experienced until then
and we got a great group of people to join us principled people with great skills and investors with a vision and values to match ours
and together we got through the eye of the financial storm in iceland without taking any direct losses to our equity or to the funds of our clients
and although i want to thank the talented people of our company foremost for that and also there 's a factor of luck and timing we are absolutely convinced that we did this because of our values so let me share with you our values
we believe in risk awareness what does that mean we believe that you should always understand the risks that you 're taking and we will not invest in things we don 't understand
not a complicated thing but in two thousand and seven at the height of the sub prime and all the complicated financial structures it was quite opposite to the reckless risk taking behaviors that we saw on the market
we also believe in straight talking telling it as it is
using simple language that people
and although we do work in the financial sector where excel is king we believe in emotional capital and we believe
that doing emotional due diligence
is just as important as doing financial due diligence
it is actually people that make money and lose money not excel spreadsheets
positive social and environmental benefits when we invest
but it wasn 't just about the values although we are convinced that they matter it was also about a business opportunity it 's the female trend and it 's the sustainability trend that are going to create some of the most interesting investment opportunities in the years to come
the whole thing about the female trend is not about women being better than men it is actually about women being different from men bringing different values and different ways to the table so what do you get you get better decision making
and you get less herd behavior and both of those things hit your bottom line with very positive results
but one has to wonder now that we 've had this financial sector collapse upon us in iceland and by the way europe looks pretty bad right now and many would say that you in america are heading for some more trouble as well
now that we 've had all that happen and we have all this data out there telling us that it 's much better to have diversity around the decision making tables will we see business and finance change will government change
well i 'll give you my straight talk about this i have days that i believe but i have days that i 'm full of doubt have you seen the incredible urge out there to rebuild the very things that failed us
hoping for a different outcome
so i guess the world is insane because i see entirely too much of doing the same things over and over again hoping that this time it 's not going to collapse upon us
i want to see more revolutionary thinking and i remain hopeful like ted i believe in people and i know that consumers are becoming more conscious and they are going to start voting with their wallets and they are going to change the face of business and finance from the outside if they don 't do it from the inside
but i 'm more of the revolutionary and i should be i 'm from
they marched into the center of reykjavik and they put women
five years later iceland elected vigdis finnbogadottir as their president first female to become head of state single mom
a breast cancer survivor who had had one of her breasts removed
and at one of the campaign sessions she had one of her male contenders allude to the fact that she couldn 't become president she was a woman and even half a woman
that night she won the election because she came back
not just because of his crappy behavior but she came back and said
well i 'm actually not going to breastfeed the icelandic nation i 'm going to lead it
absolutely convinced that it was just about the individual that women and men would have just the same opportunities but i 've come to conclude lately that it isn 't like that we are not the same and it 's great because
