design bad design there 's just no excuse for it it 's letting stuff happen without thinking about it every object
should be about something john it should imagine a user it should cast that user in a story starring the user and the object good design my dad said is about supplying
he designed chairs and desks and other office equipment for steelcase that was important i knew design was important in my house because for heaven 's sake it put food on our table right and design was in everything my dad did
he had a dixieland jazz band when we were growing up
and he would always cover louis armstrong tunes and i would ask him every once in a while dad do you want it to sound like the record we had lots of old jazz records lying around the house and he said no never john never the song is just a given that 's how you have to think about it you gotta make
your own you gotta design it show everyone what you intend is what he said
doing that acting by design is what we all should be doing
it 's where we all belong
that 's right i was in a poorly designed automobile
that hit a poorly designed
but ever since then the wheelchair has been a given in my life my life at the mercy of good design
a wheelchair is a very difficult object
it mostly projects tragedy and fear and misfortune and it projects that message that story so strongly that it almost blots out anything else i roll swiftly through an airport right and moms grab their
kids out of the way and say don 't stare the poor kid you know has this terrified look on his face god knows what they think and for
nothing whatsoever worked until a few years ago my six year old daughters were looking at this wheelchair catalog that i had
and i said oh girls
they 're not for safety
what 's the difference here the wheelchair with no lights and the wheelchair with lights the difference
i 'm no longer a victim i chose to change the situation i 'm the commander of the starship wheelchair with the phaser wheels in the front
it suggests that someone is driving
it 's reassuring people are drawn to it
someone making the experience their own covering the tragic tune with something different something radically different
now if he intended to kill in olso norway last year dozens and dozens of young people
if he was motivated by some random
mental illness he 's in a completely different category we may put him away for life but we watch him clinically
it 's a completely different domain
as an intentional murderer anders breivik is merely evil
but as a dysfunctional as a dysfunctional murderer psychotic he 's something much more complicated he 's the breath of some primitive
of some primitive ancient chaos
he 's the random state of nature we emerged from
he 's something very very different it 's as though intent is an essential component for humanity it 's what we 're supposed to do somehow we 're supposed to act with intent we 're supposed to do things by design
now here 's an example a little closer to home
my family is all about intent
you can probably tell there are two sets of twins the result of ivf technology in vitro fertilization technology due to some physical limitations i won 't go into
anyway in vitro technology ivf is about as intentional as agriculture let me tell you some of you may have the experience in fact the whole technology of sperm extraction for spinal cord injured males was invented by a veterinarian i met the dude he 's a great guy he carried this big
leather bag full of sperm probes for all of the animals that he 'd worked with all the different animals probes he designed laughter
but anyway so when my wife and i decided to upgrade our early middle age we had four kids after all with a little different technology that i won 't explain in too much detail here my urologist assured me i had nothing whatsoever to worry about no need for birth control doc are you sure about that john john
i looked at your chart
from your sperm tests we can confidently say that you 're basically a form of birth control
yes and after a couple very liberating weekends my wife and i utilizing some cutting edge erectile technology that is certainly worthy of a tedtalk someday but i won 't get into it now we noticed some familiar if unexpected symptoms
i wasn 't exactly a form of birth control
look at that font there my wife was so pissed i mean did a designer come up with that no i don 't think a designer did come up with that
in fact maybe that 's the problem
and so little ajax was born he 's like our other children but the experience is completely different
it 's something like my accident
but we all had to change but not just react to the given we bend to this new experience with intent
facing the given with intent
doing things by design hey the name ajax you can 't get much more intentional than that right we 're really hoping he thanks us
but i never became a designer no no no no never attempted never even close
man i love that thing i could afford that
but there were some lessons even there this guy plato it turns out he 's a designer he designed a state
the state in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern is always the best and most quietly governed and the state in which they are most eager the worst well got that wrong didn 't we
but look at that statement it 's all about intent that 's what i love about it but consider what plato is doing here
what is he doing it 's a grand idea of design a huge idea of design common to all of the voices of religion and philosophy that emerged in the classical period what was going on then
they were trying to answer the question of what would human beings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survive
as the human race emerged from a prehistoric chaos a confrontation with random brutal nature
they suddenly had a moment to think and there was a lot to think about
all of a sudden human existence needed an intent
human life needed a reason reality itself needed a designer
the given was replaced by various aspects of intent by various designs
by various designs by various gods
gods we 're still fighting about
today it is the chaos of humanity 's impact on the earth itself that we confront
this young discipline called design i think
on all the places we change the consequences of a planet with seven billion people and counting
that 's the tune we 're all covering today all of us
and we can 't just imitate the past no
the place was falling apart it was a horrible horrible place and i needed to go and explore the center of kinshasa to report on the rioting and the looting people were carrying off vehicles carrying off pieces of buildings soldiers were in the streets shooting at looters and herding some in mass arrests
in the middle of this chaos i 'm rolling around in a wheelchair and i was completely invisible
i was in a wheelchair i didn 't look like a journalist particularly at least from their perspective and i didn 't look like a soldier that 's for sure
i was part of this sort of background noise of the misery of zaire completely invisible
and all of a sudden from around a corner comes this young man paralyzed just like me in this
and i looked at him he didn 't know any other english than that but we didn 't need english no no no
and i looked at his whacky pedal mechanism he was full of pride over his design i wish i could show you that contraption
his smile our glow as we talked a universal language
his machine homemade bolted rusty comical
my machine american made confident sleek
he was particularly proud of the comfortable seat really comfortable seat he had made in his chariot
he would have understood those a chariot of pure intent think about it
in a city out of control
design blew it all away for a moment
we spoke for a few minutes and then each of us vanished back into the chaos he went back to the streets of kinshasa i went to my hotel
it has power it 's treasure we 're drawn to it
an object devoid of intent
it 's random it 's imitative
it repels us it 's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away this
is what we must demand
of our lives of our objects of our things of our circumstances thirty six years ago
thirty six years ago at nearly this moment
a nineteen year old boy awoke from a coma
to ask a nurse a question
but the nurse was already there with an answer
you 've had a terrible accident young man you 've broken your back
you see i knew that the car had gone over the guardrail on the twenty eighth of february
and i knew that one thousand nine hundred and seventy six was a leap year
nurse is this the twenty eighth or the twenty nine lived by design
to get back to this to get back to design
and as my daddy suggested a long time ago
make the song your own
