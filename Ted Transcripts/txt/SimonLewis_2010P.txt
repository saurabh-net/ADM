was a time in my life when everything seemed perfect
everywhere i went i felt at home
everyone i met i felt i knew them for as long as i could remember
how i came to that place and what i 've learned since i left it this is where it began
and it raises an existential question which is if i 'm having this experience of complete connection and full consciousness why am i not visible in the photograph and where is this time and place this is los angeles california where i live
this is a police photo that 's actually my car we 're less than a mile from one of the largest hospitals in los angeles called cedars sinai and the situation is that a car full of paramedics on their way home from the hospital after work have run across the wreckage
and they 've advised the police that there were no survivors inside the car that the driver 's dead
that night i receive because of my internal bleeding forty five units of blood which means
full replacements of all the blood in me before they 're able to staunch the flow i 'm put on full life support and i have a massive stroke and my brain drops into a coma
from my family looking in from outside what they 're trying to figure out is a different kind of existential question
which is how far is it going to be possible to bridge from the comatose potential mind that they 're looking at to an actual mind which i define simply as the functioning of the brain that is remaining inside my head
now to put this into a broader context i want you to imagine that you are an eternal alien watching the earth from outer space and your favorite show on intergalactic satellite television is the earth channel and your favorite show is the human show
and the reason i think it would be so interesting to you is because consciousness is so interesting it 's so unpredictable and so fragile
and this is how we began we all began in the awash valley in ethiopia
the show began with tremendous special effects because there were catastrophic climate shifts which sort of sounds interesting as a parallel to today because of the earth tilting on its axis and those catastrophic climate shifts we had to figure out how to find better food and we had to learn there 's lucy that 's how we all began
we had to learn how to crack open animal bones use tools to do that to feed on the marrow to grow our brains more so we actually grew our consciousness in response to this global threat
it 's a cupule that took forty to fifty thousand blows with a stone tool to create and it 's the first known expression of art on the planet
and the reason it connects us with consciousness today is that all of us still today the very first shape we draw as a child is a circle
and that comes down right way to the present with the dollar bill in the united states which has on it an eye of providence
so watching all of this show from outer space you think we get it we understand that the most precious resource on the blue planet is our consciousness because it 's the first thing we draw we surround ourselves with images of it it 's probably the most common image on the planet
but we don 't we take our consciousness for granted while i was producing in los angeles i never thought about it for a second
is that consciousness is under threat on this planet in ways it 's never been under threat before these are just some examples and the reason i 'm so honored to be here to talk today in india is because india has the sad distinction of being
the head injury capital of the world that statistic is so sad there is no more drastic and sudden gap created between potential and actual mind than a severe head injury each one can entail up to a decade of rehabilitation
which means that india unless something changes is accumulating a need for millennia of rehabilitation
what you find in the united states is an injury every twenty seconds that 's one and a half million every year stroke every forty seconds alzheimer 's disease every seventy seconds somebody succumbs to that all of these represent gaps between potential mind and actual mind
and here are some of the other categories if you look at the whole planet the world health organization tells us that depression is the number one disease on earth in terms of years lived with disability we find that the number two source of disability is depression in the age group of fifteen to forty four
our children are becoming depressed at an alarming rate i discovered during my recovery the third leading cause of death amongst teenagers is suicide
we 're talking about a society that is retreating into depression and disassociation when we are potentially confronting the next great catastrophic climate shift
so what you 'd be wondering watching the human show is are we going to confront and address the catastrophic climate shift that may be heading our way by growing our consciousness or are we going to continue to retreat and that then might lead you to watch an episode one day of cedars sinai medical center
channels of information it 's not my eeg at cedars it 's your eeg tonight and last night it 's the what our minds do every night to digest the day and to prepare to bridge from the potential mind when we 're asleep to the actual mind when we awaken the following morning
this is how i was when i returned from the hospital after nearly four months the horseshoe shape you can see on my skull is where they operated and went inside my brain to do the surgeries they needed to do to rescue my life but if you look into the eye of consciousness that single eye you can see i 'm looking down but let me tell you how i felt at that point
i didn 't feel empty i felt everything simultaneously i felt empty and full hot and cold euphoric and depressed
because the brain is the world 's first fully functional quantum computer it can occupy multiple states at the same time and with all the internal regulators of my brain damaged i felt everything simultaneously
but let 's swivel around and look at me frontally this is now flash forward to the point in time where i 've been discharged by the health system
look into those eyes i 'm not able to focus those eyes i 'm not able to follow a line of text in a book
but the system has moved me on because as my family started to discover there is no long term concept in the health care system
so my family as we moved forward and discovered that the health care system had moved us by had to try to find solutions and answers and during that process it took many years
one of the doctors said that my recovery my degree of advance since the amount of head injury i 'd suffered was miraculous and that was when i started to write a book because i didn 't think it was miraculous i thought there were miraculous elements but i also didn 't think it was right that one should have to struggle and search for answers when this is a pandemic within our society
so from this experience of my recovery i want to share four particular aspects i call them the four c 's of consciousness that helped me grow my potential mind back towards the actual mind that i work with every day the first c is cognitive training
unlike the smashed glass of my car plasticity of the brain means that there was always a possibility with treatment to train the brain so that you can regain and raise your level of awareness and consciousness plasticity means that there was always hope for our reason hope for our ability to rebuild that function
but what i discovered is it 's almost impossible to find anyone who provides that treatment
full scale i q is the mental processing how fast you can acquire information retain it and retrieve it that is essential for success in life today
and you can see here there are three columns untestable that 's when i 'm in my coma and then i creep up to the point that i get a score of seventy nine which is just below average in the health care system if you touch average you 're done that 's when i was discharged from the system
what does average i q really mean
it meant that when i was given two and a half hours to take a test that anyone here would take in fifty minutes i might score
this is a very very low level in order to be kicked out of the health care system
then i underwent cognitive training and let me show you what happened to the right hand column when i did my cognitive training over a period of time this is not supposed to occur
i q is supposed to stabilize and solidify at the age of eight
now the journal of the national medical association gave my memoir a full clinical review which is very unusual i 'm not a doctor i have no medical background whatsoever
but they felt the evidences that there was important valuable information in the book and they commented about it when they gave the full peer review to it but they asked one question they said is this repeatable
second aspect i still had crushing migraine headaches two elements that worked for me here are the first is ninety percent i learned of head and neck pain is through muscular skeletal imbalance the craniomandibular system is critical to that
up to thirty percent of the population have a disorder disease or dysfunction in the jaw that affects the entire body
i was fortunate to find a dentist who applied this entire universe of technology you 're about to see to establish that if he repositioned my jaw the headaches pretty much resolved but that then my teeth weren 't in the right place he then held my jaw in the right position
while orthodontically he put my teeth into correct alignment so my teeth actually hold my jaw in the correct position
this affected my entire body if that sounds like a very very strange thing to say and rather a bold statement how can the jaw affect the entire body
how far would you last before you had to remove that grain of sand
that tiny misalignment bear in mind there are no nerves in the teeth
that 's why the same between the before and after that this shows it 's hard to see the difference
is the circulation imagine the blood flowing through your body i was told at ucla medical center
as one sealed system there 's a big pipe with the blood flowing through it and around that pipe are the nerves drawing their nutrient supply from the blood that 's basically it if you press on a hose pipe in a sealed system it bulges someplace else if that some place else where it bulges is inside the biggest nerve in your body your brain
you get a vascular migraine this is a level of pain that 's only known
to other people who suffer vascular migraines
using this technology this is mapping in three dimensions this is an mri mra mrv a volumetric mri using this technology the specialists at ucla medical center were able to identify where that compression in the hose pipe was occurring a vascular surgeon removed most of the first rib on both sides of my body
and in the following months and years i felt the neurological flow of life itself returning communication the next c
this is critical all consciousness is about communication and here by great fortune one of my father 's clients had a husband who worked at the alfred mann foundation for scientific research
alfred mann is a brilliant physicist and innovator who 's fascinated with bridging gaps in consciousness whether to restore hearing to the deaf vision to the blind or movement to the paralyzed and i 'm just going to give you an example today of movement to the paralyzed
i 've brought with me from southern california the fm device
this is it being held in the hand
it weighs less than a gram so two of them implanted in the body would weigh less than a dime five of them would still weigh less than a rupee coin
where does it go inside the body it has been simulated and tested to endure in the body corrosion free for over eighty years
so it goes in and it stays there here are the implantation sites the concept that they 're working towards and they have working prototypes
and other fm devices implanted in fingertips on contacting a surface will send a message back to the sensory cortex of the brain so that the person feels a sense of touch
is this science fiction no because i 'm wearing the first application of this technology i don 't have the ability to control my left foot a radio device is controlling every step i take and a sensor picks up my foot for me every time i walk
in my coma one of the presences i sensed was someone i felt was a protector and when i came out of my coma i recognized my family but i didn 't remember my own past
gradually i remembered the protector was my wife
she had been laid to rest in her hometown of phoenix
now in the dark years that followed i had to work out what remained for me if everything that made today special was gone
man to come by who obviously would have some difficulty i don 't know what i had in my mind and he was walking around i didn 't expect that person that i was going to meet to be him and then we met and we
the thing that amazed me is the painstaking
and that 's my friend i mean i charge it every night and it works it works and what i would love to add because i didn 't have time
this thing blinks all the time i 'll leave it out so you might be able to see it but this is blinking all the time it 's sending signals in real time and if you walk faster if i walk faster
and he was going to retire all the technology was going to be lost because not a single medical manufacturer would take it on because it was a small issue but there 's millions of deaf people in the world
it works and the other thing is they 're working on artificial retinas for the blind and this this is the implantable generation because what i didn 't say in my talk is this is actually exoskeletal i should clarify that because the first generation is exoskeletal it 's wrapped around the leg around the affected limb
