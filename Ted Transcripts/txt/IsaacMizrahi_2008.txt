a thing about sleeping i don't sleep that much and i've come to this thing about like not sleeping much as being a great virtue after years of kind of battling it as being a terrible
i think that like my creativity is greatly motivated by this kind of insomnia i lie awake i think thoughts i walk aimlessly sometimes i used to walk more at night i walk during the day and i follow people who i think look interesting
and sometimes actually once it was on page six in the post that i was cruising this guy like sort of whatever but i was actually just following because he had these really great shoes on
i think a lot of my design ideas come from mistakes and tricks of the eye because i feel like you know there are so many images out there so many clothes out there
and the only ones that look interesting to me are the ones that look slightly mistaken of course
or very very surprising and often i'm driving in a taxi and i see a hole in a shirt or something that looks very interesting or pretty or functional in some way that i'd never seen happen before
and so i'd make the car stop and i'd get out of the car and walk and see that in fact there wasn't a hole but it was trick of my eye it was a shadow you know
or if there was a hole i'd think like oh damn there was actually someone thought of that thought already someone made that mistake already so i can't do it anymore i don't know where inspiration comes from it does not come
for me from research i don't get necessarily inspired by research as a matter of fact one of the most fun things i've ever ever done in my whole life was this christmas season at the guggenheim
in new york i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful band from juilliard and i did like you know the narrator and i read it
and i saw this really smart critic who i love this woman joan acocella who 's a friend of mine and she came backstage and she said oh you know isaac did you know that talking about stalinism and talking about you know like the thirties in russia
so i don't really know that i don't really actually i do my own kind of research you know if i'm commissioned to do the costumes for an eighteenth century opera or something like
i will do a lot of research because it's interesting not because it's because what i'm supposed to do i'm very very very inspired by movies the
of movies and the way light makes the colors light from behind the projection or light from the projection makes the colors look so impossible
and anyway roll this little clip i'll just show you i sit up at night and i watch movies and i watch women in movies a lot
and i think about you know their roles and about you have to like watch what your daughters look at
because i look at the way women are portrayed all the time whether they're kind of glorified in this way or whether they're kind of you know
ironically glorified or whether they 're you know sort of denigrated or ironically denigrated
i go back to color all the time color is something
motivates me a lot it's rarely color that i find in nature
although you know juxtaposed next to artificial color natural color is so beautiful so that's what i do i study color a lot but for the most part i think
like how can i ever make anything that is as beautiful as that image of natalie wood how can i ever make anything as beautiful as greta garbo i mean that's just not possible you know
and so that's what makes me lie awake at night i guess you know i want to show you i'm also like a big i
go to astrologers and tarot card readers often and that's another thing that motivates me a lot people say oh do that and astrologer tells me to do something so i do when i was about
had this really interesting tarot reading a long time ago the last card he pulled which was representing my destiny was this guy on like a straw boater with a cane and you know sort of spats and this
you know a minstrel singer right i want to show you this clip because i do this kind of crazy thing where i do a cabaret act so actually check this out
the name of the show is based on this story that i have to tell you about my mother it's sort of an excerpt from a quote of
i was dating this guy right and this has to do with being happy i swear i was dating this guy and
it was going on for about a year right and we were getting serious so we decided to invite them all to dinner our parents and we you know sort of introduced them to each other my mother was sort of
very sensitive to his mother who it seemed
was a little bit skeptical about whole alternative lifestyle thing you know homosexuality right so my mother was a little offended she turned to her and she said
are you kidding they have the greatest life together they eat out they see shows they eat out they see shows
that's the name of the show they eat out they that's on my tombstone when i die he ate out he saw shows right
so in editing these clips i didn't have the audacity to edit a clip of me singing at joe 's pub so you'll have to like go check it out and come see me or something because it's mortifying and yet
it feels i don't know how to put this i feel as
little comfort as possible is a good thing you know and at least you know in my case because
if i just do one thing all the time i don't know i get very very bored i bore very easily and you know
say that i do everything well i just say that i do a lot of things that's all and i kind of try not to look back
you know except i guess that's what staying up every night is about like looking back and thinking what a fool you made of yourself you know but i guess that's okay right
because if you do many things you get to feel lousy about everything and not just one you know you don't master feeling lousy about one thing yeah exactly
i will show you this next thing speaking of costumes for operas i do work with different choreographers i work with twyla tharp a lot
and i work with mark morris a lot who is one of my best friends and i designed three operas with him and the most recent one
king arthur i'd been very ingrained in the dance world since i was a teenager i went to performing arts high school where i was an actor and many of my friends were ballet dancers again i don't know where inspiration comes from i
don't know where it comes from i started making puppets when i was a kid maybe that's where the whole inspiration thing started from puppets right
and then performing arts high school there i was in high school meeting dancers and acting and somehow from there
i got interested in design i went to parsons school of design and then i began my career as a designer
i don't really think of myself as a designer i don't really think of myself necessarily as a fashion designer and frankly i don't really know what to call myself i think of myself as a i don't know what i think of myself as it's just
i must say this whole thing about being slightly bored all the time that is what i think that is a very important thing for a fashion designer you always have to be slightly bored with everything and if you're not you have to pretend to be slightly
but i am really a little bored with everything i always say to my partner marissa gardini who books everything she books everything and she makes everything happen and she makes all the deals
and i always tell her that i find myself with a lot of time on the computer bridge program too much time on computer bridge which is you know like that's so
all of these things that i love all kind of in one place and if you ever get bored you can look at another thing and do another thing and talk about it right
get nervous ashleigh ashleigh doing what cutting hair a cutting hair never never i don't think there was ever a day where i cut hair i was nervous you look so cute already by the way you like
you read about all these people who have a lot of money and they have kids and the kids always end up somehow like really messed up you know what i mean and there's got to be some way to do that rosie i
i to
so by the way of all the most unboring things in the world right i mean like making someone who 's already cute look terrible like
actually i read this great quote the other day which was style makes you feel great because it takes your mind
i'll tell you that i cook a lot also i love to cook and i often look at things as though they're food like i say oh you know would you serve a rotten chicken then how could you serve you know
and so i think that's what it all boils down to everything boils down to that so check this out this is what i've been doing because i think it's
the most fun thing in the world it 's like this website it's got a lot of different things on it it's a polymathematical website we actually shoot segments like tv
that whole that there's no such thing as whole buttermilk sorry
the deal let me tell you the deal in the old days when they used to make
the liquid is actually that clear liquid if you've ever overbeaten your whipped cream it's actually buttermilk and that's what it was in the early days and that's what people used for baking and all sorts of things now the buttermilk that you get is actually low fat or
thank you very much happy ted it's so wonderful here
