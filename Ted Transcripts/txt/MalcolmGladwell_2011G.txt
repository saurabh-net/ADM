seven years ago or so
over seven years and so i though i would come and try and put spaghetti sauce behind me
and the man 's name is carl norden carl norden was born in one thousand eight hundred and eighty and he was swiss and of course the swiss can be divided into two general categories those who make small exquisite expensive objects and those who handle the money of those who
expensive objects and carl norden is very firmly in the former camp
he 's an engineer he goes to the federal polytech in zurich in fact one of his classmates is a young man named lenin who would go on to break small expensive exquisite objects and he 's a swiss engineer
he has a very very small important mustache and he is domineering and narcissistic and driven and has an extraordinary ego and he works sixteen hour days and he has very strong feelings about alternating current
and he feels like a suntan is a sign of moral weakness and he drinks lots of coffee and he does his best work sitting in his mother 's kitchen in zurich for hours in complete
silence with nothing but a slide rule
in any case carl norden emigrates to the united states just before the first world war and sets up shop on lafayette street in downtown manhattan and he becomes obsessed with the question of how to drop bombs from an airplane
now if you think about it in the age before gps and radar that was obviously a really difficult problem it 's a complicated physics problem
you 've got a plane that 's thousands of feet up in the air going at hundreds of miles an hour and you 're trying to drop an object a bomb towards some stationary target in the face of all kinds of winds and cloud cover and all kinds of other impediments and all sorts of people
moving up to the first world war and between the wars tried to solve this problem and nearly everybody came up short
the bombsights that were available were incredibly crude but carl norden is really the one
take this particular object visually sight the target because they 're in the plexiglas cone of the bomber
and then they plug in the altitude of the plane the speed of the plane the speed of the wind and the coordinates of the target and the bombsight will tell him when to drop the bomb
and as norden famously says before that bombsight came along
now i cannot tell you
how incredibly excited the u s military was by the news of the norden bombsight it was like manna from heaven
here was an army that had just had experience in the first world war where millions of men fought each other in the trenches getting nowhere making no progress and here someone
had come up with a device that allowed them to fly up in the skies high above enemy territory and destroy whatever they wanted with pinpoint accuracy
and the u s military spends one point five billion dollars billion dollars in one thousand nine hundred and forty dollars developing the norden bombsight and to put that in perspective
the total cost of the manhattan project was three billion dollars half as much money was spent on this norden bombsight as was spent on the most famous military industrial project of the modern era
and there were people strategists within the u s military who genuinely thought that this single device was going to spell the difference between defeat and victory when it came to the battle against the nazis and against the japanese
and for norden as well this device had incredible moral importance because norden was a committed christian in fact he would always get upset when people referred to the bombsight as his invention because in his eyes only god could invent things he was simple the instrument of god 's will
and what was god 's will well god 's will was that
and what did the norden bombsight do well it allowed you to do that it allowed you to bomb only those things that you absolutely needed and wanted to bomb
so in the years leading up to the second
and whenever the norden bombsight is taken onto a plane it 's escorted there by a series of armed guards and it 's carried in a box with a canvas shroud over it and the box is handcuffed to one of the guards it 's never allowed to be photographed
so what happens during the second world war well
conditions aren 't perfect first of all it 's really hard to use really hard to use and not all of the people who are of those fifty thousand men who are bombardiers have
the ability to properly program an analog computer secondly it breaks down a lot it 's full of all kinds of gyroscopes and pulleys and gadgets and ball bearings and they don 't work as well as they ought to in the heat of battle
so they started flying them at high altitudes at incredibly high speeds and the norden bombsight doesn 't work as well under those conditions but most of all the norden bombsight
and then to give you a sense of just how inaccurate the norden bombsight was there was a famous case in one thousand nine hundred and forty four where the allies bombed a chemical plant in leuna germany and the chemical plant
comprised seven hundred and fifty seven acres and over the course of twenty two bombing missions the allies dropped eighty five thousand bombs on this seven hundred and fifty seven acre
chemical plant using the norden bombsight
well what percentage of those bombs do you think actually landed inside the seven hundred acre perimeter of the plant ten percent ten percent
and of those ten percent that landed sixteen percent didn 't even go off they were duds the leuna chemical plant after one of the most extensive bombings in the history of the war was up and running
within weeks and by the way all those precautions to keep the norden bombsight out of the hands of the nazis
we live in a time where there are all kinds of really really smart people running around saying that they 've invented gadgets that will forever change our world they 've invented websites that will allow people to be free they 've invented some kind of this thing or this thing or this thing that will make our world forever better
if you go into the military you 'll find lots of carl nordens as well
the u s military the air force sent two squadrons of f fifteen e fighter eagles to the iraqi desert equipped with these five million dollar cameras that allowed them to see the entire desert floor and their mission was to find and to destroy remember the scud missile launchers
those surface to air missiles that the iraqis were launching at the israelis the mission of the two squadrons was to get rid of all the scud missile launchers and so they flew missions day and night and they dropped thousands of bombs and they fired thousands of missiles in an attempt to get rid of this particular scourge
and after the war was over there was an audit done as the army always does the air force always does and they asked the question how many scuds did we actually destroy
the issue was they didn 't know where the scud launchers were the problem with bombs and pickle barrels is not getting the bomb inside the pickle barrel it 's knowing how to find the pickle barrel that 's always been the harder problem when it comes to fighting wars or take the battle in afghanistan
what is the signature weapon of the cia 's war in northwest pakistan it 's the drone
what is the drone well it is the grandson of the norden mark fifteen bombsight it is this weapon of devastating accuracy and precision and over the course of the last six years in northwest pakistan the cia has flown hundreds of
drone missiles and it 's used those drones to kill two thousand suspected pakistani and taliban militants now what is the accuracy of those drones well it 's
ninety five percent of the people we kill need to be killed right that is one of the most extraordinary records in the history of modern warfare
but do you know what the crucial thing is in that exact same period that we 've been using these drones with devastating accuracy the number of attacks of suicide attacks and terrorist attacks against american forces in afghanistan has increased tenfold
as we have gotten more and more efficient in killing them
they have become angrier and angrier and more and more motivated to kill us i have not described to you a success story i 've described to you the opposite of a success story and this is the problem with our infatuation with
problems but our problems are much more complex than that
the issue isn 't the accuracy of the bombs you have it 's how you use the bombs you have and more importantly whether you ought to use bombs at all there 's a postscript
to the norden story of carl norden and his fabulous bombsight and that is on august sixth one thousand nine hundred and forty five a b twenty nine bomber
called the enola gay flew over japan and using a norden bombsight dropped a very large thermonuclear device on the city of hiroshima and as was typical with the norden bombsight the bomb actually missed its target by eight hundred ft but of course it didn 't matter
and that 's the greatest irony of all when it comes to the norden bombsight
the air force 's one point five billion dollar bombsight was used to drop its three billion dollar bomb which didn 't need a bombsight
no one told carl norden that his bombsight was used over hiroshima he was a committed christian he thought he had designed something that would reduce the toll of suffering in war it would have broken his heart
