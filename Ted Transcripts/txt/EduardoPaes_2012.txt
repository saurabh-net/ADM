it 's great to be here as a mayor i really do believe that mayors have the political position to really change people 's lives
that 's the place to be and it 's great to be here as the mayor of rio rio 's a beautiful city a vibrant place special place actually you 're looking at a guy who has the best job in the world and i really wanted to share with you a very special moment of my life and the history of the city of rio
we had to beat the powerful japanese with all of their technology we had to beat the most powerful man in the world defending his own city
so it was not easy at all and actually this last guy here said a phrase a few years ago that i think fits perfectly to the situation of rio winning the olympic bid we really showed that yes we can
and really this is the reason i came here tonight i came here tonight to tell you that things can be done that you don 't have always to be rich or powerful to get things on the way
that cities are a great challenge it 's a difficult task to deal with cities but with some original ways of getting things done with some basic commandments you can really get cities to be a great great place to live
this is going to be the third largest park in rio by june this year it 's going to be a place where people can meet where you can put nature
the temperature 's going to drop two three degrees centigrade so
the first commandment i want to leave you tonight is a city of the future has to be environmentally friendly every time you think of a city you 've got to think green you 've got to think green and green so moving to our second commandment that i wanted to show you
with people so how do you move these people around when you have three point five billion people living in cities by two thousand and fifty it 's going to be six billion people so every time you think about moving these people around you think about high capacity transportation but there is a problem high capacity transportation
means spending lots and lots of money
a kilometer of this costs a tenth of a subway
so spending much less money and doing it much faster you can really change the way people move this is a map of rio
all the lines the colored lines you see there it 's our high capacity transportation network
in this present time today we only carry eighteen percent of our population in high capacity transportation
with the brts we 're doing again the cheapest and fastest way we 're going to move to sixty three percent of the population being carried by high capacity transportation so remember what i said you don 't always have to be rich or powerful
to get things done you can find original ways to get things done so the second commandment i want to leave you tonight is a city of the future has to deal with mobility and integration of its people
all over the world but the point we want to make here tonight is favelas are not always a problem i mean favelas can sometimes really be a solution if you deal with them if you put public policy inside the favelas
let me just show a map of rio again rio has six point three million inhabitants more than twenty percent one point four million live in the favelas all these red parts are favelas so you see they are spread all over the city this is a typical view of a favela in rio you see the contrast between the rich and poor
so i want to make two points here tonight about favelas the first one is you can change from what i call a vicious circle
that we just transformed into a primary school with high quality
this is primary assistance in health that we built inside a favela again with high quality we call it a family clinic so the first point is bring basic services
inside the favelas with high quality
you 've got to open spaces in the favela bring infrastructure to the favelas to the slums wherever you are rio has the aim by two thousand and twenty to have all its favelas completely urbanized another example this was completely packed with houses and then we built this what we call a knowledge square this is a place with high technology
where the kids that live in a poor house next to this place can go inside and have access to all technology we even built a theater there three d movie
and this is the kind of change you can get for that
integrated but moving to our fourth commandment
i really wouldn 't be here tonight between november and may rio 's completely packed we just had last week carnivale it was great it was lots of fun we have new year 's eve there 's like two million people on copacabana beach we have problems
but the reason i could come here is because of that this was something we did with ibm that 's a little bit more than a year old it 's what we call the operations center of rio and i wanted to show that i can govern my city using technology from here from long beach
invest in infrastructure invest in the green open parks open spaces integrate socially use technology
but at the end of the day when we talk about cities we talk about a gathering of people and we cannot see that as a problem
that is fantastic if there 's three point five billion now it 's going to be six billion then it 's going to be ten billion that is great that means we 're going to have ten billion minds working together ten billion talents together
so a city of the future i really do believe that it 's a city that cares about its citizens integrates socially its citizens a city of the future is a city that can never let anyone out of this great party which are cities thank you very much
