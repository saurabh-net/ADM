what i do is write for children and i 'm probably america 's most widely read children 's author in fact and i always tell people that i don 't want to show up looking like a scientist you can have me as a farmer or in leathers and no one has ever chose farmer
that 's a painting of a circle a friend of mine did that richard bollingbroke it 's the kind of complicated circle that i 'm going to tell you about my circle began back in the sixty s in high school in stow ohio where i was the class queer
i was the guy beaten up bloody every week in the boys room
i had a thumb i had eighty five dollars and i ended up in san francisco california and i should mention
that i have pancreatic cancer
and i 'd like you to please be quick about this
well the next day we were in cleveland
we took a look at her we laughed we cried and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice we found her one we got her there
and we took care of her and watched over her family because it was necessary it 's something we knew how to do
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands and what had happened
was the circle had closed it had become a circle
the epiphany is that death is a part of life she saved my life
i and my partner saved hers
