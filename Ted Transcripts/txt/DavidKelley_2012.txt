i 'm going to start way back in the third grade at oakdale school in barberton ohio i remember one day my best friend brian was working on a project
he was making a horse out of the clay that our teacher kept under the sink
and at one point one of the girls who was sitting at his table
seeing what he was doing leaned over and said to him that 's terrible that doesn 't look anything like a horse
and brian 's shoulders sank and he wadded up the clay horse and he threw it back in the bin
it seems like when i tell that story of brian to my class
and i see that opting out that happens in childhood and it moves in and becomes more ingrained even by the time you get to adult life so
so fuzzy or unconventional
and eventually these bigshot executives whip out their blackberries and they say they have to make really important phone calls and they head for the exits
and they 're just so uncomfortable
when we track them down and ask them what 's going on they say something like i 'm just not the creative type
if they stick with the process if they stick with it they end up doing amazing things and they surprise themselves just how innovative they and their teams really are
so i 've been looking at this fear of judgment that we have that you don 't do things you 're afraid you 're going to be judged if you don 't say the right creative thing you 're going to be judged and i had a major breakthrough when i met the psychologist albert bandura
freud skinner somebody and bandura
and so i went to see him because he has just worked on phobias for a long time which i 'm very interested in he had developed this
methodology that ended up curing people in a very short amount of time in four hours he had a huge cure rate of people who had phobias and we talked about snakes i don 't know why we talked about snakes we talked about snakes and fear of snakes as a phobia
and it was really enjoyable really interesting
he told me that he 'd invite the test subject in and he 'd say you know there 's a snake in the next room and we 're going to go in there
and he 'd get them comfortable with that and then through a series of steps
he 'd move them and they 'd be standing in the doorway with the door open and they 'd be looking in there and he 'd get them comfortable with that and then many more steps later baby steps they 'd be in the room they 'd have a leather glove like a welder 's glove on
and they 'd eventually touch the snake
and when they touched the snake
everything was fine they were cured in fact everything was better than fine
these people who had life long fears of snakes were saying things like
bandura calls this process guided mastery
i love that term guided mastery and something else happened
these people who went through the process and touched the snake ended up having less anxiety about other things in their lives
they tried harder they persevered longer and they were more resilient in the face of failure
they just gained a new confidence
and bandura calls that confidence
self efficacy the sense that you can change the world
and that you can attain what you set out to do
well meeting bandura was really cathartic for me because i realized that this famous scientist had documented and scientifically validated something that we 've seen happen for the last thirty years that we could take people who had the fear that they weren 't creative and we could take them through a series of steps
kind of like a series of small successes and they turn fear into familiarity
and they surprise themselves that transformation is amazing we see it at the d school all the time people from all different kinds of disciplines
they think of themselves as only analytical and they come in and they go through the process our process they build confidence and now they think of themselves differently and they 're totally emotionally excited about the fact that they walk around thinking of themselves as a creative person
so i thought one of the things i 'd do today is take you through and show you what this journey looks like
to me that journey looks like doug dietz
doug dietz is a technical person he designs medical imaging equipment large medical imaging equipment he 's worked for ge and he 's had a fantastic career but at one point he had a moment of crisis
he was in the hospital looking at one of his mri machines in use
when he saw a young family
that nearly eighty percent of the pediatric patients in this hospital had to be sedated in order to deal with his mri machine
and this was really disappointing to doug because before this time he was proud of what he did he was saving lives with this machine but it really hurt him to see the fear that this machine caused in kids about that time he was at the d school at stanford taking classes
he was learning about our process about design thinking about empathy
about iterative prototyping and he would take this new knowledge and do something quite extraordinary he would redesign
the entire experience of being scanned
and this is what he came up with
he turned it into an adventure for the kids he painted the walls and he painted the machine and he got the operators retrained by people who know kids like children 's museum people and now when the kid comes
it 's an experience and they talk to them about the noise and the movement of the ship
and when they come they say okay you 're going to go into the pirate ship but be very still because we don 't want the pirates to find you
and the results were super dramatic so from something like eighty percent of the kids needing to be sedated to something like ten percent of the kids needing to be sedated
and the hospital and ge were happy too because you didn 't have to call the anesthesiologist all the time they could put more kids through the machine in a day so the quantitative results were great
but doug 's results that he cared about were much more qualitative
he was with one of the mothers waiting for her child to come out of the scan and when the little girl came out of her scan she ran up to her mother and said
mommy can we come back tomorrow
doug 's story takes place in a hospital
i know a thing or two about hospitals
a few years ago i felt a lump on the side of my neck
it was cancer it was the bad kind i was told i had a forty percent chance of survival
so while you 're sitting around with the other patients in your pajamas and everybody 's pale and thin and you 're waiting for your turn to get the gamma rays
you think of a lot of things mostly you think about am i going to survive
and i thought a lot about what was my daughter 's life going to be like without me but
but i decided and i committed to at this point to the thing i most wanted to do
was to help as many people as possible
come up with more interesting and just more ideas so they can choose from better ideas and they just make better decisions so i know at ted you 're supposed to have a change the world kind of thing everybody has a change the world thing if there is one for me this is it to help this happen
so i hope you 'll join me on my quest
and to have people realize that they 're naturally creative
