the news shape the way we see the world
here 's the world based on the way it looks based on landmass
and here 's how news shapes what americans see
now this was a month when north korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities
there was massive flooding in indonesia and in paris the ipcc released its study confirming man 's impact on global warming
the u s accounted for seventy nine percent of total news coverage
and when we take out the u s and look at the remaining twenty one percent
we see a lot of iraq that 's that big green thing there reached just one percent
when we analyzed all the news stories
and removed just one story here 's how the world looked
and the cycle continues as we all know britney has loomed pretty large lately
so why don 't we hear more about the world
one reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half
india or south america places that are home to more than two billion people
the reality is that covering britney
local tv news looms large
and unfortunately only dedicates twelve percent of its coverage to international news
the most popular news sites don 't do much better last year pew and the colombia j school analyzed the fourteen thousand stories that appeared on google news front page and they in fact covered the same twenty four news events
so if you put it all together this could help explain why today 's college graduates as well as less educated americans know less about the world than their counterparts did twenty years ago
and if you think it 's simply because we are not interested the real question
the real question is this distorted worldview
what we want for americans in our increasingly interconnected world
i know we can do better and can we afford not to thank you
