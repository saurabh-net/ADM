and our productivity as well
how does this work well two ways first of all ambience i have a whole tedtalk about this sound affects us physiologically psychologically cognitively and behaviorally all the time the sound around us is affecting us even though we 're not conscious of it
there 's a second way though as well that 's interference
communication requires sending and receiving
when i see a classroom that looks like this can you imagine how this sounds i am forced to ask myself a question
unfortunately it was designed like a corporate headquarters with a vast central atrium and classrooms leading off it with no back walls at all
the children couldn 't hear their teachers they had to go back in and spend six hundred thousand pounds putting the walls in let 's stop this madness of open plan classrooms right now
please it 's not just these modern buildings which suffer old fashioned classrooms suffer too a study in florida just a few years ago found that if you 're sitting where this photograph was taken in the classroom row four speech intelligibility is just fifty percent
children are losing one word in two now that doesn 't mean they only get half their education but it does mean they have to work very hard to join the dots and understand what 's going on this is affected massively by reverberation time how reverberant a room is in a classroom with a reverberation time of one point two seconds which is pretty common
this is what it sounds like
not so good is it if you take that one point two seconds down to zero point four seconds by installing acoustic treatments sound absorbing materials and so forth this is what you get
if education can be likened to watering a garden which is a fair metaphor sadly much of the water is evaporating before it reaches the flowers especially for some groups
for example those with hearing impairment now that 's not just deaf children that could be any child who 's got a cold glue ear an ear infection even hay fever on a given day one in eight children fall into that group on any given day
then you have children for whom english is a second language or whatever they 're being taught in is a second language in the u k that 's more than ten percent of the school population
and finally after susan cain 's wonderful tedtalk in february we know that introverts find it very difficult to relate when they 're in a noisy environment doing group work
in fact sixty five decibels is the very level at which this big survey of all the evidence on noise and health found that that is the threshold for the danger of myocardial infarction
what does it cost to treat a classroom down to that zero point four second reverberation time
two and a half thousand pounds and the essex study which has just been done in the u k which incidentally showed that when you do this you do not just make a room that 's suitable for hearing impaired children you make a room where behavior improves and results improve significantly this found that
sending a child out of area to a school that does have such a room if you don 't have one costs
ninety thousand pounds a year
i think the economics are pretty clear on this
i 'm glad that debate is happening on this i just moderated a major conference in london a few weeks ago called sound education which brought together top acousticians government people teachers and so forth we 're at last starting to debate this issue
out of that conference incidentally also came a free app
which is designed to help children study if they 're having to work at home for example in a noisy kitchen
let 's broaden the perspective a little bit and look at cities
we have urban planners where are the urban sound
planners i don 't know of one in the world and the opportunity is there to transform our experience in our cities the world health organization estimates that a quarter of europe 's population is having its sleep degraded by noise in cities we can do better than that
and in our offices we spend a lot of time at work
where are the office sound planners people who say don 't sit that team next to this team because they like noise and they need quiet or who say don 't spend all your budget on a huge screen in the conference room and then place one tiny microphone in the middle of a table for thirty people laughter if you can hear me you can understand me without seeing me
if you can see me without hearing me that does not work
so office sound is a huge area and incidentally noise in offices has been shown to make people less helpful less enjoy their teamwork and less productive at work
finally we have homes we use interior designers where are the interior sound designers hey let 's all be interior sound designers
take on listening to our rooms and designing sound that 's effective and appropriate my friend richard mazuch an architect in london coined the phrase invisible architecture
i love that phrase it 's about designing not appearance and our productivity
it 's time to start designing for the ears thank you our social behavior
