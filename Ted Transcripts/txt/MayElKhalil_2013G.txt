you know lebanon as a country has been once destroyed by a long and bloody civil war honestly i don 't know why they call it civil war when there is nothing civil about it
with syria to the north israel and palestine to the south and our government even up till this moment is still fragmented and unstable
for years the country has been divided between politics and religion however
until one fateful morning and while training
i was hit by a bus i nearly died
as soon as i came out of my coma i realized that i was no longer the same runner i used to be so i decided if i couldn 't run myself i wanted to make sure
that others could so out of my hospital bed i asked my husband to start taking notes and a few months later the marathon was born
but at that time even during my most vulnerable condition i needed to dream big i needed something to take me out of my pain an objective to look forward to
i didn 't want to pity myself nor to be pitied
and i thought by organizing such a marathon i 'll be able to pay back to my community build bridges with the outside
how do you introduce the concept of running to a nation that is constantly at the brink of war how do you ask those who were once fighting and killing each other to come together and run next to each other
more than that how do you convince people to run a distance of twenty six point two miles at a time they were not even familiar with the word marathon
so we had to start from scratch for people from mosques churches
and they shared their stories in return it was honesty and transparency that brought us together we spoke one common language to each other and that was from one human to another
once that trust was built everybody wanted to be part of the marathon to show the world the true colors of lebanon and the lebanese and their desire to live in peace
all determined and when the gunfire went off
so did our political problems but for every disaster we had the marathon found ways to bring people together
in two thousand and five our prime minister was assassinated and the country came to a complete standstill
so we organized a five kilometer united we run campaign over sixty thousand people came to the start line all wearing white t shirts with no political slogans
that was a turning point for the marathon where people started looking at it as a platform for peace and unity
between two thousand and six up to two thousand and nine our country lebanon went through unstable years invasions and more assassinations that brought us close to a civil war the country was divided again so much that our parliament resigned
we had no president for a year and no prime minister but we did have a marathon
we learned that political problems can be
overcome when the opposition party decided to shut down part of the city center we negotiated alternative routes
government protesters became sideline cheerleaders they even hosted juice stations
you know the marathon has really become one of
kind it gained credibility from both the lebanese and the international community last november two thousand and twelve over thirty three thousand runners from eighty five different nationalities
themes have included runs for the environment breast cancer for the love of lebanon for peace
or just simply to run
the first annual all women and girls race for empowerment which is one of its kind in the region has just taken place only a few weeks ago with
and this is only the beginning blocks for future peace
we are now one of the largest running events in the middle east but most importantly it is a platform for hope
from national marathons or from national events to smaller
regional races we 've seen that people want to run
for a better future after all
peacemaking is not a sprint it is more of a marathon thank you
