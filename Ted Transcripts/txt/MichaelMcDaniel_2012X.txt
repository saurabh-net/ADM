forty two million people were displaced by natural disasters in two thousand and ten now there was nothing particularly special about two thousand and ten because on average thirty one and a half million people are displaced by natural disasters every single year
now usually when people hear statistics or stats like that you start thinking about places like haiti or other kind of exotic or maybe even impoverished areas but it happens right here in the united states every single year
from joplin missouri and tuscaloosa alabama
to the central texas wildfires that just happened recently
now how does the most powerful country in the world handle these displaced people
they cram them onto cots put all your personal belongings in a plastic garbage bag stick it underneath and put you on the floor of an entire sports arena or a gymnasium
so obviously there 's a massive housing gap
and this really upset me
because academia tells you after a major disaster there 's typically about an eighteen month time frame to we kinda recover start the recovery process but what most people don 't realize is that on average it takes forty five to sixty days or more for the infamous fema trailers to even begin to show up before that time people are left to their own devices
this actually became my creative obsession i put aside all my freelance work after hours and started just focusing particularly on this problem
so i started sketching two days after katrina i started sketching and sketching and trying to brainstorm up ideas or solutions for this
but it was an obsession so i couldn 't just stop there i started experimenting making models talking to experts in the field taking their feedback and refining
and i kept on refining and refining for nights and weekends for over five years now my obsession ended up driving me to create
full size prototypes in my own backyard laughter and actually spending my own personal savings on everything from tooling to patents and a variety of other costs
but in the end i ended up with this modular housing system that can react to any situation or disaster it can be put up in any environment
from an asphalt parking lot
to pastures or fields because it doesn 't require any special setup or specialty tools
now at the foundation and kind of the core of this whole system is the exo housing unit which is just the individual shelter module and though it 's light light enough that you can actually lift it by hand and move it around and it actually sleeps four people
and you can arrange these things as kind of more for encampments and more of a city grid type layout
now this fundamentally changes the way we respond to disasters because gone are the horrid conditions inside a sports arena or a gymnasium where people are crammed on these cots inside now we have instant neighborhoods
basically like a coffee cup they can actually stack together so we get extremely efficient transportation
and storage out of them in fact fifteen exos can fit on a single semi truck by itself this means the exo can actually be transported and set up faster than any other housing option available today
the doors can actually swap out
can actually serve as a living room bedroom or bathroom or an office a living space and secure storage
but i was quickly told that boy our government doesn 't really work like that
but i was quickly told by some corporations that my personal passion project was not a brand fit because they didn 't want their logos stamped across the ghettos of haiti
so now we have prototypes that can show that four people can actually sleep securely and much more comfortably than a tent could ever provide
and on top of that now we have a whole plethora of other individuals that have come up and started to talk to us from doing it for mining camps mobile youth hostels right down to the world
respond to these painful phone calls that we get after disasters where we don 't really have anything
