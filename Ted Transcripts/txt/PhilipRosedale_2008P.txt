things a little differently i'm not going to show you a presentation i'm going to talk to you and at the same time we're going to look at
just images from a photo stream that is pretty close to live of things that snapshots
come from there i thought i'd talk a little bit about some just big ideas about this and then get john back out here so we can talk interactively a little bit more and
ask questions you know i guess the first question is why build a virtual world at all
and i think the answer to that is always going to be at least driven to a certain extent by the people initially crazy enough to start the project
you know so i can give you a little bit of first background just on me and what moved me as a really going back as far as a teenager and then
an adult to actually try and build this kind of thing i was a very creative kid who read a lot and got into
electronics first and then later programming computers when i was really young i was just always
trying to make things i was just obsessed with taking things apart and building things and just anything i could do with my hands or with wood or electronics or metal or anything else
and so for example and it's a great second life thing i had a bedroom and every kid you know as a teenager has got his bedroom he retreats to but i wanted my door
i thought it would be cool if my door went up rather than opened like on star trek i thought it would be neat to do that and so i got up in the ceiling and i cut through the ceiling joists
much to my parents delight and put the door you know being pulled up through the ceiling i built i put a garage door opener up in the
would pull this door up you can imagine the amount of time that it took me to do this to the house and the displeasure of my parents the thing that
cobble together the materials and go through the actual execution phase of building something that you imagine from a design perspective
and so for me i know that when the internet came around and i was doing computer programming and just you know just generally trying to run my own little company and
figure out what to do with the internet and with computers i was just immediately struck by how
to sort of recreate the laws of physics and the rules of how things went together the sort of
the idea of atoms and how to make things and do that inside a computer so that we could all get in there and make stuff and so for me that was the thing that was so
enticing i just wanted this place where you could build things and so i think you see that in the genesis of what has happened with second life
and i think it's important i also think that more generally the use of the internet and technology as a kind of a space between us for creativity and design is a general
trend it is a sort of a great human progress technology is just generally being used to allow us to create
in as shared and social a way as possible and i think that second life and virtual
more generally represent the best we can do to achieve that right now you know another way to look at that and related to the content and you know thinking about space is to connect sort of virtual worlds
to space i thought that might be a fun thing to talk about for a second if you think about going into space
it's a fascinating thing so many movies so many kids we all sort of dream about exploring space now why is that stop for a moment and ask why that conceit why do we as people want to do that
in some sense you would become someone else in that journey because there wouldn't be you'd leave society and life as you know it behind and so inevitably you would transform yourself
you can find out there oh yeah you have no idea what you're going to find once you get there into space it's going to be different than here and in fact
virtual worlds and where we're going with more and more computing technology represent essentially the likely really tactically possible
version of space exploration we are moved by the idea of virtual worlds because like space they allow us to reinvent ourselves and they contain
web and virtual reality with internet you can find exactly the same articles written about everything that people are observing to give you an idea of scale
second life is about twenty thousand cpus at this point it's about twenty thousand computers connected together in three facilities in the united states right now
active population is something like a smallish city the space itself is about ten times the size of san francisco and it's about as densely built out
so that sort of space exploration thing is matched up here by the amount of content that's in there and i think that amount is critical
it was critical with the virtual world that it be this space of truly infinite possibility we're very sensitive to that as humans you know you know when you see it you know when you can do anything in a space and you know when you can 't second life today is this twenty thousand machines and it's about one hundred million or so user
created objects where you know an object would be something like this possibly interactive ten of millions of them are thinking all the time they have code attached to them
so it's a really large world already in terms of the amount of stuff that's there and that's very important if anybody plays like world of warcraft world
comes on like four dvds second life by comparison has about one hundred terabytes of user created data making it about twenty five thousand times larger
so again like the internet compared to aol and
that whatever this is going to evolve into is going to be bigger in total usage than the web itself and let me justify that with two statements
the web puts information in the form of text and images the topology the geography of the web is text to text links for the most part
that's one way of organizing information but there are two things about the way you access information in a virtual world that i think are the important ways that they're very different and much better than what
we've been able to do to date with the web the first is that as i said
the well the first difference for virtual worlds is that information is presented to you in the virtual world using the most powerful iconic symbols
that you can possibly use with human beings so for example c h a i r is the english word for that but a picture of this
is a universal symbol everybody knows what it means there's no need to translate it it's also more memorable if i show you that picture and i show you c h a i r on a piece of paper
so when you organize information using the symbols of our memory using the most common symbols that we've been immersed in all our lives you maximally
both excite stimulate are able to remember transfer and manipulate data and so virtual worlds are the best way for us to essentially organize and experience information
that lifelike environments are really important in some magical way to us but the second thing and i think this one is less obvious is that the
is in the virtual world implicitly and inherently social you are always there with other people and we as humans
social creatures and must or are aided by or enjoy more the consumption of information in the presence of others
it's essential to us you can't escape it when you're on amazon com and you're looking for digital cameras or whatever you're on
right now when you're on the site with like five thousand other people but you can't talk to them you can't just turn
to the people that are browsing digital cameras on the same page as you and ask them hey have you seen one of these before because i'm thinking about buying it
that experience of like shopping together just as a simple example is an example of how as social creatures we want to experience information in that way so that second point that we inherently
to connect us and so i think again that it's likely that in the next decade or so these virtual worlds are going to be
the most common way as human beings that we kind of use the electronics of the internet if you will to be together to consume information
you know mapping in india that's such a great example maybe the solution there involves talking to other people in real time
asking for advice rather than any possible way that you could just statically organize a map
so i think that's another big point i think that wherever this is all going whether it's second life
its descendants or something broader that happens all around the world at a lot of different points this is what we're going to see the internet used for and total traffic
and total unique users is going to invert so that the web and its bibliographic set of text and graphical information
is going to become a tool or a part of that consumption pattern but the pattern itself is going to happen mostly in this type of an environment
big idea but i think highly defensible so let me stop there and bring john back and maybe we can just have a longer conversation
such a deep question yeah is a virtual world likely to be a utopia would be one way i'd say it the answer is no and i think the reason why is because
the web itself as a good example is profoundly bottoms up that idea of infinite possibility that magic of anything can happen only happens in an environment where
you really know that there's a fundamental freedom at the level of the individual actor at the level of the lego blocks if you will that make up the virtual world you have to have that level of freedom and so i'm often asked that you know is there a kind of utopian or
is there a utopian tendency to second life and things like it that you would create a world that has a grand scheme to it those top down schemes are alienating
to just about everybody even if you mean well when you build them and what's more human society when it's controlled when you set out a grand scheme of rules a new way of people interacting or
a new way of laying out a city or whatever that stuff historically has never scaled much beyond you know i always laughingly say the mall of america
give me a story of a tool you created at the beginning in second life that you were pretty sure people would want to use in the creation of their avatars or in communicating
more private conversation but it wasn't instant messaging because you had to sort of befriend somebody it was just this idea that you could kind of have a private chat i just remember it was one of those examples of
data driven design i thought it was such a good idea from my perspective and it was just absolutely never used and we ultimately i think we've now turned it off if i remember we finally gave up took it out of the code
but more generally you know one other example i think about this which is great relative to the utopian idea second life originally had sixteen simulators
now has twenty thousand so when it only had sixteen it was only about as big as this college campus and we had
we zoned it you know we put a nightclub we put a disco where you could dance and then we had a place where you could fight with guns if you wanted to and we had another place that was like a boardwalk kind of a coney island
and we laid out the zoning but of course people could build all around it however they wanted to and what was so amazing right from the start
concept basically was instantly and thoroughly ignored and like two months into the whole thing which is really a small amount of time even in second life time i remember
the users the people who were then using second life the residents came to me and said we want to buy the disco because i had built it we want to buy that land and raze it
and put houses on it and i sold it to them i mean we transferred ownership and they had a big party and blew up the entire building and i remember that that
was just so telling you know that you didn't know exactly what was going to happen when you think about stuff that people have built that's popular jh cbgbs has to close eventually
and it but it closed on day one basically in internet time
you know an example of something pregnancy you can have a baby in second life this is done
entirely using kind of the tools that are built into second life so the innate concept of becoming pregnant and having a baby of course second life is at
the platform level at the level of the company at linden lab second life has no game properties to it whatsoever there is no attempt to structure the experience to make it utopian in that sense that
we put into it so of course we never would have put a mechanism for having babies or you know taking two avatars and merging them or something but people built the ability to have babies and care for babies
as a purchasable experience that you can have in second life and so i mean that's a pretty fascinating example of you know what goes on in the overall economy and of course
questions for philip rosedale right here
had a fantastic avatar a female avatar that i used to be once in a while but my avatar is a guy wearing
chaps spiky hair spikier than this kind of orange hair handlebar mustache kind of a village people sort of a character so very cool jh and your question
the question is there appears to be a lack of cultural fine tuning in second life it doesn't seem to have its own culture and the sort of differences that exist in the real world aren't translated into the second life
first of all we're very early so this has only been going on for a few years and so part of what we see is the same evolution of human behavior that you see in emerging societies so
a fair criticism is what it is of second life today is that it's more like the wild west than it is like rome
from a cultural standpoint that said the evolution of and the nuanced interaction that creates culture is happening at ten times the speed of the real world and in an environment where if you walk into a bar in second life
that you drag onto your body and they basically kind of pop up on your screen and allow you to use google or babelfish or one of the other online text translators to on the fly translate
spoken i'm sorry typed text between individuals and so the multicultural nature and the sort of cultural melting pot that's happening inside second life is quite i think quite remarkable relative to what
in real human terms in the real world we've ever been able to achieve so i think that culture will fine tune it will emerge but we still have some years to wait while that happens as you would naturally expect jh other questions right here
the use of second life increases dramatically as your physical age increases so as you go from
age thirty to age sixty and there are many people in their sixties using second life this is also not a sharp curve it's very very distributed
usage goes up in terms of like hours per week by forty percent as you go from age thirty to age sixty
in real life so there's not many people make the mistake of believing that second life is some kind of an online game actually it's generally unappealing
just speaking broadly and critically it's not very appealing to people that play online video games because the graphics are not yet
equivalent to i mean these are very nice pictures but in general the graphics are not quite equivalent to the fine tuned graphics that you see in a grand theft auto four
if you take the uk and europe together they make up about fifty five percent of the usage base in second life in terms of psychographic oh men and women men and women are almost equally
matched in second life so about forty five percent of the people online right now on second life are women
use second life though about thirty to forty percent more on an hours basis than men do meaning that more men sign up than women and more women stay and use it than men
so that's another demographic fact in terms of psychographic you know the people in second life are remarkably dissimilar
it's not easy to describe as a demographic if i had to just sort of paint a broad picture i'd say remember the people who were really getting
in the first few years of ebay maybe a little bit like that in other words people who are early adopters they tend to be creative they tend to be entrepreneurial a lot of them about fifty five thousand people so far are cash flow positive they're making money
from what i mean real world money from what they're doing in second life so it's a very build still a creative building things build your own business type of an orientation so that's
you describe yourself philip as someone who was really creative when you were young and you know liked to make things i
it was funny because i was definitely a more antisocial kid i read all the time i was shy i don't seem like it now but i was very shy
moved around a bunch had that experience too so i did kind of i think live in my own world and obviously that helps you know engage your real interest in something jh so you're on your fifth life at this point pr if you count yeah cities
so but i did and i didn't do i think i didn't do as well in school as i could have i think you're right i wasn 't like an obsessed you know get a
a great social experience when i went to college that i hadn't had before and more fraternal experience where i met
saying that in the pamphlet there's a statement that we
i'd say a couple of things
one is it's disturbing like the internet or electricity was that is it's a big change but it isn't avoidable
so no amount of backpedaling or intentional behavior or political behavior is going to keep these technology changes from connecting us together because the basic motive that people have to be
our concept of our very lives and being and our identities as well i don't think we can get away from those changes i think generally we were talking about this i think that generally
being present in a virtual world and being challenged by it being surviving there having a good life there so to speak
is a challenge because of the multiculturality of it because of the languages the sort of flea market nature if you will of the virtual world today
it puts challenges on us to rise to we must be better than ourselves in many ways we must learn things and you know be more tolerant and be smarter and learn faster
and be more creative perhaps than we are typically in our real lives and i think that if that is true of virtual worlds then these changes though scary and i say inevitable
are ultimately for the better and therefore something that we should ride out but i would say that and many other authors and speakers about this
