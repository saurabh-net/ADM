just quickly start out with a little bit of music here thank you
thank you thank you
thank you to start well
my own upbringing in music and family and all of that but i 'm even more excited
for you people to hear about donnell 's amazing family and maybe even a little bit about how we met and all that sort of thing but for those of you that may not be familiar with my upbringing
i 'm from cape breton island nova scotia eastern canada which is a very very musical island
and my dad taught me to play fiddle when i was nine
my uncle is a very well known cape breton fiddler his name 's buddy macmaster and just a wonderful guy and we have
a great tradition at home called square dancing and we had parties great parties at our house and the neighbors houses and you talk about kitchen ceilidhs well ceilidh first of all is gaelic for party but
so ten chances to one the fellow who walked in the door could play it
it was a wonderful wonderful way to grow up and that is where my beginnings in music come from my surroundings my family just my bloodline in itself
i 've actually known donnell for probably twelve years now and i 'm going to get into a little bit of i guess how
you i 'm kind of new to the ted experience and i 'm glad to be here but
so out went the television
come from within or go from within because we didn 't watch television we didn 't listen to a lot of radio we went to church and to school sometimes and farmed and played music so we were able i think at a very critical age to develop our own style our own self
and my mother plays my father plays
and the style that came from the ottawa valley in ontario we call it french canadian style but it originated in logging camps years ago hundreds of men would go up for the winter to the camps in northern ontario and in quebec
and they were all different cultures and
the irish the french scottish german they 'd all meet and of course at night they 'd play cards and step dance and play fiddles and over the course of many years the ottawa valley fiddling kind of evolved and the ottawa valley step dancing evolved
so that 's i kind of started out with that style and i quickly
well it 's just so interesting that donnell 's upbringing was very similar to mine
little did i think our children would be playing instruments you know playing music yeah twelve years er twenty years later little did she think her kids would be getting married
but anyway so then i got a phone call
he asked me out for supper
then we dated for two years broke up for ten got back together and got married
burials as a body was carried out from the wake site to the burial site the procession was led by a piper or a fiddle player
we 're laughing like because our styles are totally different as you can hear
and so you know donnell and i are actually in the process of writing new pieces of music together that we can play but we don 't have any of those ready we just started yesterday
before mom 's family had a piano in cape breton she learned to play the rhythms on a piece of board and the fiddlers would all congregate to play on the cold winter 's evenings and mom would be banging on this board
so when they bought a piano they bought it in toronto and had it
taken by train and brought in on a horse a horse and sleigh to the house it became the only piano in the region and mom said she could basically play as soon as the piano arrived she could play it because she had learned all these rhythms anyway we found the piano last
you had to wait until they were finished so of course what we would do is we 'd get on the piano and you wouldn 't even get off to eat because you wouldn 't want to give it up to your brother or sister and they 'd wait and wait and wait and it 'd be midnight and you 'd be still sitting there on the piano but it was their way to get us to practice in
