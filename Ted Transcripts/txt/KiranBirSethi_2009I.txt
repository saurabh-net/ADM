is a good word even in the times of h one n one i like the word laughter is contagious
but for me what was contagious about all of them was that they were infected by something i call the i can bug
the question is why only them in a country of a billion people and some why so few is it luck is it chance can we all not systematically and consciously get infected
when as a student of the design college i encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas challenged me and had lots of cups of
and i was struck by just how wonderful it felt and how contagious that feeling was i also realized i should have got infected when i was seven
so when i started riverside school ten years ago it became a lab a lab to prototype and refine a design process that could consciously infect the mind with the i can bug
and i uncovered that if learning is embedded in real world context that if you blur the boundaries between school and life then children go through a journey of aware where they can see the change
be changed and then empower lead the change and that directly increased
to experience what it means to be a child laborer it transformed them what you will see is their journey and then their utter conviction that they could go out and change the world
his face changes because he 's been able to understand that he has shifted that
from teacher told me to i am doing it and that's the i can mindshift and it is a process that can be energized and
but we had parents who said okay making our children good human beings is all very well but what about math and science and english show us the grades and we did the data was conclusive
when children are empowered not only do they do good they do well in fact very well as you can see in this national benchmarking assessment taken by over two thousand schools in india
so on august fifteenth independence day two thousand and seven the children of riverside set out to infect
businesses and basically said when are you going to wake up and recognize the potential that resides in every child when will you include the child in the city basically open your hearts and your minds to the child so how did the city respond
since two thousand and seven every other month the city closes down the busiest streets for traffic and converts it into a playground for children
and childhood here was a city telling its child you can a glimpse of infection in all
is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier and we plan to extend this to other parts of the city
because of that ahmedabad is known as
india 's first child friendly city so you're getting the pattern first two hundred children at riverside then thirty thousand children in ahmedabad and growing it was time now to infect india
so on august fifteenth again independence day two thousand and nine empowered with the same process we empowered one hundred thousand children to say
i can how we designed a simple toolkit converted it into eight languages and reached thirty two thousand schools
i mean it was incredible basically again reaffirming that when adults believe in children and say you can then they will infection in india and
and and write i
going out pretty difficult but they did it me that they had
so today who is it going to take to spread the infection from one hundred thousand children to the two hundred million children in india
last i heard the preamble still said we the people of india right so if not us then who if not now then when like i said contagious is a good word thank you
