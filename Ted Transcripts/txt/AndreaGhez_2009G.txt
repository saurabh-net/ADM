something you can 't see this is the basic question of somebody who 's interested in finding and studying black holes because black holes are objects whose pull of gravity is so intense that nothing can escape it not even light so you can 't see it directly
so my story today about black holes is about one particular black hole i 'm interested in finding whether or not there is a really massive what we like to call supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy
and the reason this is interesting is that
it gives us an opportunity to prove whether or not these exotic objects really exist and second it gives us the opportunity to understand how these supermassive black holes interact with their environment
and to understand how they affect the formation and evolution of the galaxies which they reside in
so to begin with we need to understand what a black hole is so we can understand the proof of a black hole so what is a black hole
so in that sense it 's a very simple object but in another sense it 's an incredibly complicated object that we need relatively exotic physics to describe and in some sense represents the breakdown of our physical understanding of the universe
but today the way i want you to understand a black hole for the proof of a black hole is to think of it as an object whose mass is confined to zero volume
so despite the fact that i 'm going to talk to you about an object that 's supermassive and i 'm going to get to what that really means in a moment it has no finite size so this is a little tricky but fortunately there is a finite size that you can see
and that 's known as the schwarzschild radius and that 's named after the guy who recognized why it was such an important radius this is a virtual radius not reality the black hole has no size so why is it so important it 's important because it tells us that any object can become a black hole
at that point what 's going to happen at that point gravity wins gravity wins over all other known forces and the object is forced to continue to collapse to an infinitely small object and then it 's a black hole
so if i were to compress the earth down to the size of a sugar cube it would become a black hole because the size of a sugar cube is its schwarzschild radius
now the key here is to figure out what that schwarzschild radius is and it turns out that it 's actually pretty simple to figure out
it depends only on the mass of the object bigger objects have bigger schwarzschild radii smaller objects have smaller schwarzschild radii so if i were to take the sun and compress it down to the scale of the university of oxford it would become a black hole
so now we know what a schwarzschild radius is and it 's actually quite a useful concept because it tells us not only when a black hole will form but it also gives us the key elements for the proof of a black hole i only need two things i need to understand the mass of the object i 'm claiming is a black hole
and what its schwarzschild radius is and since the mass determines the schwarzschild radius there is actually only one thing i really need to know so my job in convincing you that there is a black hole is to show that there is some object that 's confined to within its schwarzschild radius and your job today is to be skeptical
so if a star starts its life off with much more mass than the mass of the sun it 's going to end its life by exploding and leaving behind
roughly three times the mass of the sun on an astronomical scale that 's a very small black hole now what i want to talk about are the supermassive black holes and the supermassive black holes are thought to reside at the center of galaxies
and this beautiful picture taken with the hubble space telescope shows you that galaxies come in all shapes and sizes there are big ones there are little ones almost every object in that picture there is a galaxy and there is a very nice spiral up in the upper left
so what people have thought is that perhaps there are supermassive black holes
and if that 's the case and this is an example of a normal galaxy what we see is the star light and if there is a supermassive black hole what we need to assume is that it 's a black hole
if we 're going to look for these stealth black holes at the center of galaxies the best place to look is in our own galaxy our milky way and this is a wide field picture taken of the center of the milky way
and what we see is a line of stars and that is because we live in a galaxy which has a flattened disk like structure and we live in the middle of it so when we look towards the center we see this plane which defines the plane of the galaxy or line that defines the plane of the galaxy
now the advantage of studying our own galaxy is it 's simply the closest example of the center of a galaxy that we 're ever going to have because the next closest galaxy is one hundred times further away so we can see far more detail in our galaxy than anyplace else and as you 'll see in a moment the ability to see detail is key to this
stars will orbit the black hole in the very same way that planets orbit the sun it 's the gravitational pull that makes these things orbit if there were no massive objects these things would go flying off or at least go at a much slower rate because all that determines how they go around is how much mass is inside its orbit
so this is great because remember my job is to show there is a lot of mass inside a small volume so if i know how fast it goes around i know the mass and if i know the scale of the orbit i know the radius so i want to see the stars that are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible because i want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible
so this means that i want to see a lot of detail and that 's the reason that for this experiment we 've used the world 's largest telescope this is the keck observatory it hosts two telescopes with a mirror ten meters which is roughly the diameter of a tennis court
now this is wonderful because the campaign promise of large telescopes is that is that the bigger the telescope the smaller the detail that we can see
but it turns out these telescopes or any telescope on the ground has had a little bit of a challenge living up to this campaign promise and that is because of the atmosphere atmosphere is great for us it allows us to survive here on earth
but it 's relatively challenging for astronomers who want to look through the atmosphere to astronomical sources so to give you a sense of what this is like it 's actually like looking at a pebble at the bottom of a stream
looking at the pebble on the bottom of the stream the stream is continuously moving and turbulent and that makes it very difficult to see the pebble on the bottom of the stream very much in the same way it 's very difficult to see astronomical sources because of the atmosphere that 's continuously moving by
so i 've spent a lot of my career working on ways to correct for the atmosphere to give us a cleaner view and that buys us about a factor of twenty and i think all of you can agree that if you can figure out how to improve life by a factor of twenty you 've probably improved your lifestyle by a lot say your salary
this technology works by introducing a mirror into the telescope optics system that 's continuously changing to counteract what the atmosphere is doing to you so it 's kind of like very fancy eyeglasses for your telescope
now in the next few slides i 'm just going to focus on that little square there so we 're only going to look at the stars inside that small square although we 've looked at all of them so i want to see how these things have moved and over the course of this experiment these stars have moved a tremendous amount so we 've been doing this experiment for fifteen years and we see the stars go all the way around
now most astronomers have a favorite star and mine today is a star that 's labeled up there so two absolutely my favorite star in the world and that 's because it goes around in only fifteen years and to give you a sense of how short
and because of that we 've been able to show that there is a supermassive black hole there to give you a sense of how small that size is that 's the size of our solar system so we 're cramming
four million times the mass of the sun into that small volume now
truth in advertising right i have told you my job is to get it down to the schwarzchild radius and the truth is i 'm not quite there but we actually have no alternative today to explaining this concentration of mass and in fact it 's the best evidence we have to date for not only existence of a supermassive black hole at the center of our own galaxy
but any in our universe so what next
and the fun phase of this experiment is while we 've tested some of our ideas about the consequences of a supermassive black hole being at the center of our galaxy almost
every single one has been inconsistent with what we actually see and
ask what do you expect for the old stars stars that have been around the center of the galaxy for a long time they 've had plenty of time to interact with the black hole what you expect there is that old stars should be very clustered around the black hole you should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole
likewise for the young stars or in contrast the young stars they just should not be there a black
so what do we see using observations that are not the ones i 've shown you today we can actually figure out which ones are old and which ones are young the old ones are red
so this is the fun part and in fact today this is what we 're trying to figure out
to make further progress we really need to look at the orbits of stars that are much further away to do that we 'll probably need much more sophisticated technology than we have today because in truth while i said we 're correcting for the earth 's atmosphere we actually only correct for half the errors that are introduced
we do this by shooting a laser up into the atmosphere and what we think we can do is if we shine a few more that we can correct the rest
so this is what we hope to do in the next few years
and on a much longer time scale what we hope to do is build even larger telescopes because remember bigger is better in astronomy
so we want to build a thirty meter telescope and with this telescope we should be able to see stars that are even closer to the center of the galaxy and we hope to be able to test some of einstein 's theories of general relativity some ideas in cosmology about how galaxies form so we think the future of this experiment is quite exciting
so in conclusion i 'm going to show you an animation that basically shows you how these orbits have been moving in three dimensions and i hope if nothing else i 've convinced you that one we do in fact have a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy
and this means that these things do exist in our universe and we have to contend with this we have to explain how you can get these objects in our physical world
second we 've been able to look at that
and last but not least none of this would have happened without the advent of the tremendous progress that 's been made on the technology front and we think that this is a field that is moving incredibly fast and holds a lot in store for the future thanks very much
