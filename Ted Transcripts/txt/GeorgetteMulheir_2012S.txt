most people imagine orphanages as a benign environment that care for children
after all where else would we put all of those children who don 't have any parents
but sixty years of research has demonstrated that separating children from their families and placing them in large institutions seriously harms their health and development and this is particularly true for young babies
as we know babies are born without their full muscle development and that includes the brain
during the first three years of life the brain grows to its full size with most of that growth taking place in the first six months the brain develops in response to experience and to stimulation every time a young baby learns something new
to focus its eyes to mimic a movement or a facial expression to pick something up
new parents are astonished by the rapidity of this learning they are quite rightly amazed and delighted by their children 's cleverness they communicate their delight to their children who respond with smiles and a desire to achieve more and to learn more
this forming of the powerful attachment between child and parent provides the building blocks for physical social language cognitive and psychomotor development
it is the model for all future relationships with friends with partners and with their own children
it happens so naturally in most families that we don 't even notice it most of us are unaware of its importance to human development and by extension to the development of a healthy society and it 's only when it goes wrong that we start to realize the importance of families to children
in august one thousand nine hundred and ninety three i had my first opportunity to witness on a massive scale the impact on children of institutionalization and the absence of parenting
housing five hundred and fifty babies this was ceausescu 's show orphanage and so i 'd been told the conditions were much better
having worked with lots of young children i expected the institution to be a riot of noise
but it was as silent as a convent
yet i could see soiled nappies and i could see that some of the children were distressed but the only noise was a low continuous moan
over the next few days i began to realize that this quietness was not exceptional
within a few days they were listless lethargic and staring into space like all the others
the children must be woken at seven and fed at seven thirty at eight their nappies must be changed so a staff member may have only thirty minutes to feed ten or twenty children if a child soils its nappy at eight thirty he will have to wait several hours before it can be changed again
the child 's daily contact with another human being is reduced to a few hurried minutes of feeding and changing and otherwise their only stimulation is the ceiling the walls or the bars of their cots
since my first visit to ceausescu 's institution i 've seen hundreds of such places across eighteen countries from the czech republic to sudan
across all of these diverse lands and cultures the institutions and the child 's journey through them is depressingly similar
lack of stimulation often leads to self stimulating behaviors like hand flapping rocking back and forth or aggression
and in some institutions psychiatric drugs are used to control the behavior of these children whilst in others children are tied up to prevent them from harming themselves or others
these children are quickly labeled as having disabilities and transferred to another institution for children with disabilities most of these children will never leave the institution again
for those without disabilities at age three they 're transferred to another institution and at age seven to yet another
segregated according to age and gender they are arbitrarily separated from their siblings often without even a chance to say goodbye
when they leave the institution they find it really difficult to cope and to integrate into society
in moldova young women raised in institutions are ten times more likely to be trafficked than their peers
but why are there so many orphans in europe
when there hasn 't been a great deal of war or disaster in recent years in fact more than ninety five percent of these children have living parents
and societies tend to blame these parents for abandoning these children but research shows that most parents want their children and that the primary drivers behind institutionalization are poverty disability and ethnicity
the institution may be hundreds of miles away from the family
if the family 's poor they find it difficult to visit and gradually the relationship breaks down
behind each of the million children in institutions
there is usually a story of parents who are desperate and feel they 've run out of options
like natalia in moldova who only had enough money to feed her baby and so had to send her older son to the institution
or desi in bulgaria who looked after her four children at home until her husband died but then she had to go out to work full time and with no support felt she had no option but to place a child with disabilities in an institution
or the new parents the young couple who have just found
this state of affairs is neither necessary nor is it inevitable
it 's also much cheaper to provide support to families than it is to provide institutions one study suggests that a family support service costs ten percent of an institutional placement whilst good quality foster care costs usually about thirty percent
if we spend less on these children but on the right services we can take the savings and reinvest them in high quality residential care for those few children with extremely complex
across europe a movement is growing to shift the focus and transfer the resources from large institutions that provide poor quality care
to community based services that protect children from harm and allow them to develop to their full potential
when i first started to work in romania nearly twenty years ago there were two hundred thousand children living in institutions and more entering every day now there are less than ten thousand and family support services are provided across the country
in moldova despite extreme poverty and the terrible effects of the global financial crisis the numbers of children in institutions has reduced by more than fifty percent in the last five years
and the resources are being redistributed to family support services and inclusive schools many countries have developed national action plans for change
the european commission and other major donors are finding ways to divert money from institutions towards family support empowering communities to look after their own children
if we know people who are planning to support orphanages we should convince them to support family services instead
