myself and my brother belong to the under thirty demographic
which pat said makes seventy percent but according to our statistics it makes sixty percent of the region 's population
we have been reminiscing about the latest technologies and the ipods and for me the abaya my traditional dress that i 'm wearing today
now this is not a religious garment nor is it a religious statement instead it 's a diverse cultural statement that we choose to wear now i remember a few years ago
her answer was quite the contrary instead she felt more free more free because she could wear whatever she wanted under the abaya she could come to work in her pajamas and nobody would care
we know that modernization is happening and yes qatar wants to be a modern nation but at the same time we are reconnecting and reasserting our arab heritage
it 's important for us to grow organically and we continuously make the conscious decision to reach that balance in fact research has shown that the more the world is flat if i use tom friedman 's analogy or global
the more and more people are wanting to be different and for us young people they 're looking to become individuals and find their differences amongst themselves
which is why i prefer the richard wilk analogy of globalizing the local and localizing the global we don 't want to be all the same but we want to respect each other and understand each other
and therefore tradition becomes more important not less important
i 'm a representation of that phenomenon
and i think a lot of people in this room i can see a lot of you are in the same position as myself and i 'm sure although we can 't see the people in washington they are in the same position we 're continuously trying to straddle different worlds different cultures and trying to meet the challenges of a different expectation from ourselves and from others
so i want to ask a question what should culture in the twenty first century look like
in a time where the world is becoming personalized when the mobile phone the burger the telephone everything has its own personal identity how should we perceive ourselves and how should we perceive others how does that impact our desert culture
i 'm not sure of how many of you in washington are aware of the cultural developments happening in the region and the more recent museum of islamic art opened in qatar in two thousand and eight i myself am personalizing these cultural developments but i also understand that this has to be done organically
yes we do have all the resources that we need in order to develop new cultural institutions but what i think is more important is that we are very fortunate to have visionary leaders who understand that this can 't happen from outside it has to come from within
i want to ask you why do you think this is
is it because it 's a soft option we have nothing else to do no i don 't think so i think that women in this part of the world realize that culture is an important component to connect people both locally and regionally
it 's a natural component for bringing people together discussing ideas in the same way we 're doing here at ted we 're here we 're part of a community sharing out ideas and discussing them art becomes a very important part of our national identity
the existential and social and political impact
an artist has on his nation 's development of cultural identity is very important
for their future generations it 's very important to maintain our cultural identities
why else do greeks demand the return of the elgin marbles and why is there an uproar when a private collector tries to sell his collection to a foreign museum why does it take me months on end to get an export license from london or new york in order to get pieces into my country
instead she tries to engage in a very important dialogue about her culture nation and heritage she does that through important visual forms of photography and film
create an open dialogue so that we share our ideas and share yours with us
in a few days we will be opening the arab museum of modern art
we have done extensive research to ensure that arab and muslim artists and arabs who are not muslims not all arabs are muslims by the way but we make sure that they are represented in this new institution this institution is government backed and it has been the case for the past three decades
we will open the museum in a few days and i welcome all of you to get on qatar airways and come and join us
now this museum is just as important to us as the west
now visual expression is just one form of culture integration
we have realized that recently more and more people are using the means of youtube and social networking to express their stories share their photos and tell their own stories through their own voices in a similar way we have created the doha film institute
now the doha film institute is an organization to teach people about film and filmmaking last year we didn 't have one qatari woman filmmaker today i am proud to say we have trained and educated over sixty six qatari women filmmakers to edit tell their own stories in their own voices
if you 'll allow me i would love to share a one minute film
that has proven to show that a sixty sec film can be as powerful as a haiku in telling a big picture and this is one of our filmmakers products
it 's important for two things
first it allows us to showcase our arab filmmakers and voices to one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world new york city
no not the soft option that we have discussed before but rather the soft power that joseph nye has spoken about before
culture 's a very important tool to bring people together we should not underestimate
this is a very interesting journey i welcome you on board for us to engage and discuss new ideas of how to bring people together through cultural initiatives and discussions
ladies and gentlemen thank you very much
