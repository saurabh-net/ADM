talk about work specifically why people can't seem to get work done at work which is a problem we all kind of have but let 's sort of start at the beginning so
we have companies and non profits and charities and all these groups that have employees or volunteers of some sort
and they expect these people who work for them to do great work i would hope at least at least good work hopefully at least it's good work
so a company or a charity or an organization of any kind they typically unless you're working in africa if you're really lucky to do that most people have to go to an office every day
and so these companies they build offices they go out and they buy a building or they rent a building or they lease some space and they fill the space with stuff
they fill it with with tables or desks chairs computer equipment software internet access maybe a fridge maybe a few other things
and they expect their employees or their volunteers to come to that location every day to do great work it seems like it's perfectly reasonable to ask that however if you actually talk to people
and even question yourself and you ask yourself where do you really want to go when you really need to get something done you'll find out that people don't say what businesses think they would say
if you ask people the question where do you really need to go when you need to get something done typically you get three different kinds of answers
one is kind of a place or a location or a room another one is a moving object and a third is a time so here 's some examples
you almost never hear someone say the office but businesses are spending all this money on this place called the office and they're making people go to it all the time yet people don't do work in the office what is that about
why is that why is that happening and what you find out is that if you dig a little bit deeper you find out that people
i mean we've all been through this we probably went through it yesterday or the day before or the day before that you look back on your day and you're like i got nothing done today i was at work i sat at my desk i used my expensive computer
i used the software they told my to use i went to these meetings i was asked to go to i did these conference calls i did all this stuff but i didn't actually do anything i just did tasks i didn't actually get meaningful work done
and what you find is that especially with creative people designers programmers writers engineers thinkers that people really need long stretches of uninterrupted time to get something done
you cannot ask somebody to be creative in fifteen minutes and really think about a problem you might have a quick idea but to be in deep thought about a problem and really consider a problem carefully you need long stretches of uninterrupted time
and even though the work day is typically eight hours how many people here have ever had eight hours to themselves at the office how about seven hours six five
at home or they might go to the office but they might go to the office really early in the day or late at night when no one 's around or they stick around after everyone 's left or they go in on the weekends or they get work done on the plane
or they get work done in the car or in the train because there are no distractions now there are different kinds of distractions but there aren't the really bad kinds of distractions that i'll talk about in just a minute
i think sleep and work are very closely related and it's not just that you can work while you're sleeping and you can sleep while you're working that's not really what i mean
i'm talking specifically about the fact that sleep and work are phased based or stage based events
there's a sound or whatever happens you don't just pick up where you left off if you're interrupted and woken up you have to start again
so you have to go back a few phases and start again and what ends up happening sometimes you might have days like this where you wake up at eight in the morning or seven in the morning or whenever you get up and you're like
i didn't really sleep very well i did the sleep thing i went to bed i laid down but i didn't really sleep
people say you go to sleep but you really don't go to sleep you go towards sleep it just takes a while you've got to go through these phases and stuff and if you're interrupted you don't sleep well
so how do we expect does anyone here expect someone to sleep well if they're interrupted all night i don't think anyone would say yes why do we expect people to work well
so what are these interruptions that happen at the office that don't happen at other places because in other places you can have interruptions like you can have the tv
or you could go for a walk or there's a fridge downstairs or you've got your own couch or whatever you want to do and if you talk to certain managers they'll tell you that
they don't want their employees to work at home because of these distractions they'll also say
but oftentimes they'll cite distractions i can't let someone work at home they'll watch tv they'll do this other thing it turns out that those aren't the things that are really distracting
at the office most of the interruptions and distractions that really cause people not to get work done are involuntary so let 's go through a couple of those
now managers and bosses will often have you think that the real distractions at work are things like facebook and twitter and youtube
and other websites and in fact they'll go so far as to actually ban these sites at work some of you may work at places where you can't get to these certain sites
and today 's facebook and twitter and youtube these things are just modern day smoke breaks no one cared about letting people take a smoke break for fifteen minutes ten years ago
so why does everyone care about someone going to facebook here and there or twitter here and there or youtube here and there those aren't the real problems in the office
the real problems are what i like to call the m m 's the managers and the meetings those are the real problems in the modern office today and this is why things don't get done at work it's because of the
you find a lot of other distractions but you don't find managers and meetings so these are the things that you don't find elsewhere but you do find at the office
and managers are basically people whose job it is to interrupt people that's pretty much what managers are for they're for interrupting people they don't really do the work so they have to make sure everyone else is doing the work which is an interruption and
we have a lot of managers in the world now and there's a lot of people in the world now and there's a lot of interruptions in the world now because of these managers they have to check in hey how 's it going show me what's up
we all know this to be true and you would never see a spontaneous meeting called by employees it doesn't work that way the manager calls the meeting so the employees can all come together and it's an incredibly disruptive thing to do to people is to say hey look
to bring ten people together right now and have a meeting i don't care what you're doing just you've got to stop doing what you're doing so you can have this meeting i mean what are the chances that all ten people are ready to stop
what if they're thinking about something important what if they're doing important work all of a sudden you're telling them that they have to stop doing that to do something else so they go into a meeting room they get together
and they talk about stuff that doesn't really matter usually because meetings aren't work meetings are places to go to talk about things you're supposed to be doing later
but meetings also procreate so one meeting tends to lead to another meeting and tends to lead to another meeting there's often too many people in the meetings and they're very very expensive to the organization
it's ten hours of productivity taken from the rest of the organization to have this one one hour meeting which probably should have been handled by two or three people talking for a few minutes
but instead there's a long scheduled meeting because meetings are scheduled the way software works which is in increments of fifteen minutes or thirty minutes or an hour
so meetings and managers are two major problems in businesses today especially to offices these things don't exist outside of the office
so i have some suggestions to remedy the situation what can managers do enlightened managers hopefully
what can they do to make the office a better place for people to work so it's not the last resort but it's the first resort it's that people start to say when i really want to get stuff done i go to the office
because the offices are well equipped everything should be there for them to do their work but they don't want to go there right now so how do we change that i have three suggestions i'll share with you guys i have about three minutes so that'll fit perfectly
we've all heard of the casual friday thing i don't know if people still do that but how about no talk thursdays how about
one thursday just once a month and cut that day in half and just say the afternoon i'll make it really easy for you so just the afternoon one thursday the first thursday of the month just the afternoon
the office can talk to each other just silence that's it and what you'll find
is that a tremendous amount of work actually gets done when nobody talks to each other this is when people actually get stuff done is when no one 's bothering them when no one 's interrupting them and you can give someone giving someone four hours of uninterrupted time is the best gift you can give anybody at work
another thing you an try is switching from active communication and collaboration which is like face to face stuff tapping people on the shoulder saying hi to them
having meetings and replace that with more passive models of communication using things like email and instant messaging or collaboration products things like that
now some people might say email is really distracting and i m is really distracting and these other things are really distracting
but they're distracting at a time of your own choice and your own choosing you can quit the email app you can't quit your boss you can quit i m you can't hide your manager
you can put these things away and then you can be interrupted on your own schedule at your own time when you're available when you're ready to go again because work like sleep happens in phases
and there are very very few things that are that urgent that need to happen that need to be answered right this second so if
is that if you do have a meeting coming up if you have the power just cancel just cancel that next meeting today 's friday so monday usually people have meetings on monday just don't have it
i don't mean move it i mean erase it from memory it's gone and you'll find out that everything will be just fine all these discussions and
so those are three quick suggestions i wanted to give you guys to think about this and i hope that some of these ideas were at least provocative enough for managers and bosses and business owners and organizers and
