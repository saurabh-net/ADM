you can hold in the palm of your hand and it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space it can contemplate the meaning of infinity
and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity and this peculiar recursive quality
so how do you study this mysterious organ i mean you have one hundred billion nerve cells little wisps of protoplasm interacting with each other
and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities that we call human nature and human consciousness how does this happen well there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain
one approach the one we use mainly is to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain where there's been a genetic change in a small region of the brain what then happens is not
and this gives you some confidence in asserting that that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function so you can then map function onto structure
and then find out what the circuitry 's doing to generate that particular function so that's what we're trying to do
so let me give you a few striking examples of this in fact i'm giving you three examples six minutes each during this talk the first example is
that's been called the face area in the brain because when it's damaged you can no longer recognize people 's faces you can still recognize them from their voice and say oh yeah that's joe but you can't look at their face and know who it is right you can't even recognize yourself in the
i mean you know it's you because you wink and it winks and you know it's a mirror but you don't really recognize yourself as yourself
ok now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus but there's another rare syndrome so rare in fact that very few physicians have heard about it not even neurologists this is called the
and that is a patient who 's otherwise completely normal has had a head injury comes out of coma otherwise completely normal
he looks at his mother and says this looks exactly like my mother this woman but she's an impostor she's some other woman pretending to be my mother
now the most common interpretation of this which you find in all the psychiatry text books is a freudian view and that is that this chap
and then as you grow up the cortex develops and inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother thank god or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother
my god if this is my mom how come i'm being sexually turned on she's some other woman she's an impostor it's the only interpretation that makes sense
say doctor this is not fifi it looks exactly like fifi but it's some other dog right now you try using the talking about
in all humans or some such thing which is quite absurd of course now what's really going on so to explain this curious disorder we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain
normally visual signals come in into the eyeballs go to the visual areas in the brain there are in fact thirty areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision and after processing all that the message goes to a small structure called the fusiform
where you perceive faces there are neurons there that are sensitive to faces you can call it the face area of the brain right i talked about that earlier
now when that area 's damaged you lose the ability to see faces right but from that area the message cascades into a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system the emotional core of the brain
and that structure called the amygdala gauges the emotional significance of what you're looking at is it prey is it predator is it
or is it something absolutely trivial like a piece of lint or a piece of chalk or a i don't want to point to that but or a shoe or something like that ok which you can completely ignore
so if the amygdala is excited and this is something important the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system your heart starts beating faster you start sweating to dissipate the heat that you're going to exert create from
however and it's processed in the fusiform gyrus and you recognize it as a pea plant or a table or your mother for that matter ok
the message cascades into the amygdala and then goes down the autonomic nervous system but maybe in this chap that wire that goes from the amygdala to the limbic
the emotional core of the brain is cut by the accident so because the fusiform is intact the chap can still recognize his mother and says oh yeah this looks like my mother
but because the wire is cut to the emotional centers he says but how come if it's my mother i don't experience a warmth or terror as the case may be right
and therefore he says how do i account for this inexplicable lack of emotions this can't be my mother it's some strange woman pretending to
how do you test this well what you do is if you take any one of you here and put you in front of a screen and measure your galvanic skin response and show pictures on the screen i can measure how you sweat
when you see an object like a table or an umbrella of course you don't sweat if i show you a picture of a lion or a tiger or a pin up you start sweating right and believe it or not if i show you a picture of your mother
what happens what happens if you show
this patient you take the patient and show him pictures on the screen and measure his galvanic skin response tables and chairs and lint nothing happens
as in normal people but when you show him a picture of his mother the galvanic skin response is flat there's no emotional reaction to his mother because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is
so his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal his emotions are normal he'll laugh he'll cry so on and so forth but the wire from vision to emotions is
psychiatric syndrome and say that the standard freudian view is wrong that in fact you can come up with a precise explanation in terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain by the way if this patient then goes and mother phones
from an adjacent room phones him and he picks up the phone and he says wow mom how are you where are you there's no delusion through the phone
she approaches him after an hour he says who are you you look just like my mother ok the reason is there's a separate pathway going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers and that's not been cut by the accident
all this complex circuitry set up in the brain is it nature genes or is it nurture and we approach this problem by considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb
you all know what a phantom limb is when an arm is amputated or a leg is amputated for gangrene or you lose it in war for example in the iraq war it's now a serious problem
you continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing arm and that's called a phantom arm or a phantom leg in fact you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body
believe it or not even with internal viscera i've had patients with the uterus removed hysterectomy who have a phantom uterus including
phantom menstrual cramps at the appropriate time of the month and in fact one student asked me the other day do they get phantom pms
subject ripe for scientific enquiry but we haven't pursued that ok now the next question is what can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments
answer the phone when it rings it'll wave goodbye these are very compelling vivid sensations the patient 's not delusional he knows that the arm is not there but nevertheless it's a compelling sensory experience for the patient
but however about half the patients this doesn't happen the phantom limb they'll say but doctor the phantom limb is paralyzed it's fixed in a clenched spasm and it's excruciatingly painful
and then in a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm the surgeon amputates the arm and then you get a phantom arm with the same pains right
and this is a serious clinical problem patients become depressed some of them are driven to suicide ok so how do you treat this syndrome now why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb when i looked at the case sheet i found that they had an actual arm
the nerves supplying the arm had been cut and the actual arm had been paralyzed and lying in a sling for several months before the amputation and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom
move no move no and this gets wired into the circuitry of the brain and we call this learned paralysis
the arm this learned paralysis carries over into the into your body image and into your phantom ok now how do you help these patients
how do you unlearn the learned paralysis so you can relieve him of this excruciating clenching spasm of the phantom arm
the phantom pain the phantom cramp how do you do that well virtual reality but that costs millions of dollars so i hit on a way of doing this for three dollars but don't tell my funding agencies
what you do is you create what i call a mirror box you have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle and then you put the phantom so my first patient derek came in
he had his arm amputated ten years ago he had a brachial avulsion so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed lying in a sling for a year
right and the patient puts his phantom left arm which is clenched and in spasm on the left side of the mirror and the normal hand on the right side of the mirror and makes the same posture the clenched posture and looks inside the mirror
and what does he experience he looks at the phantom being resurrected because he 's looking at the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror and it looks like this phantom has been
now i said now look wiggle your phantom your real fingers or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror he 's going to get the visual impression that the phantom is moving
right that's obvious but the astonishing thing is the patient then says oh my god my phantom is moving again and the pain the clenching spasm is relieved and remember my first patient who came in
in and he looked in the mirror and i said look at your reflection of your phantom and he started giggling he says i can see my phantom but he 's not stupid he knows it's not real he knows it's a mirror reflection but it's a vivid sensory experience
now i said move your normal hand and phantom he said oh i can't move my phantom you know that it's painful i said move your normal hand and he says oh my god my phantom is moving again i don't believe this and my pain is being relieved ok
ok this proves my theory about learned paralysis and the critical role of visual input but i'm not going to get a nobel prize for getting somebody to move his phantom limb completely useless ability
but then i started realizing maybe other kinds of paralysis
that you see in neurology like stroke focal dystonias there may be a learned component to this which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror
so i said look derek well first of all the guy can't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain i said look derek take it home and practice with it
for a week or two maybe after a period of practice you can dispense with the mirror unlearn the paralysis and start moving your paralyzed arm and then relieve yourself of pain so he said ok and he took it home i said look it's after all two dollars
so he took it home and after two weeks he phones me and he said doctor you're not going to believe this i said what he said it 's gone i said what 's gone i thought maybe the mirror box was
he said no no no you know this phantom i've had for the last ten years it's disappeared and i said i got worried i said my god i mean i've changed this guy 's body image what about human subjects ethics
and all of that and i said derek does this bother you he said no last three days i've not had a phantom arm and therefore no phantom elbow pain
no clenching no phantom forearm pain all those pains are gone away but the problem is i still have my phantom fingers dangling from the shoulder and your box doesn't reach
so can you change the design and
put it on my forehead so i can you know do this and eliminate my phantom fingers he thought i was some kind of magician
and because of this conflict the brain says to hell with it there is no phantom there is no arm right it goes into a sort of denial negates the signals and when the arm disappears
the bonus is the pain disappears because you can't have disembodied pain floating out there in space so that's the bonus now this technique has been tried on dozens of patients by other groups in helsinki
so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain and indeed people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation stroke you normally think of as damage to the
and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors this has also gone through clinical trials helping lots and lots of patients
he pointed out that certain people in the population who are otherwise completely normal had the following peculiarity every time they see a number
it's colored five is blue seven is yellow eight is chartreuse nine is indigo ok
in mind these people are completely normal in other respects or c sharp sometimes tones evoke color c sharp is blue f sharp is green another tone might be yellow right
is eight times more common among artists poets novelists and other creative people than in the general population why would that be i'm going to answer that question it's never been answered before
ok what is synaesthesia what causes it well there are many theories one theory is they're just crazy now that's not really a scientific theory so we can forget about
another theory is they are acid junkies and potheads right now there may be some truth to this because it's much more common here in the bay area than
area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain in the fusiform gyrus so we said there's some accidental cross
and numbers in the brain so every time you see a number you see a corresponding color and that's why you get
now remember why does this happen why would there be crossed wires in some people remember i said it runs in families that gives you the clue and that is there is an abnormal gene
the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring in all of us it turns out we are born with everything wired to everything else
so every brain region is wired to every other region and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain
so if there's a gene causing this trimming and if that gene mutates then you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas
and if it's between number and color you get number color synaesthesia if it's between tone and color you get tone color synaesthesia so far so good now what if this gene is expressed everywhere in the brain so everything is cross connected
well think about what artists novelists and poets have in common the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking linking seemingly unrelated ideas
such as it is the east and juliet is the sun well you don't say juliet is the sun does that mean she's a glowing ball of fire i mean schizophrenics do that but it's a different story
and concepts are also in different parts of the brain then it's going to create a greater propensity towards metaphorical thinking and creativity in people with synaesthesia and hence the eight times more common incidence
of synaesthesia among poets artists and novelists ok it's a very phrenological view of synaesthesia the last demonstration can i take one minute
it's because you're all doing a cross model synaesthetic abstraction meaning you're saying that that sharp inflection kiki in your auditory cortex the hair cells being excited kiki
mimics the visual inflection sudden inflection of that jagged shape now this is very important because what it's telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive it's just it looks like a silly illusion
but these photons in your eye are doing this shape and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern but the brain is able to
extract the common denominator it's a primitive form of abstraction and we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain because when that's damaged
people lose the ability to engage in buba kiki but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor if you ask this guy
what all that glitters is not gold what does that mean the patient says well if it's metallic and shiny it doesn't mean it's gold you have to measure its specific gravity
ok so they completely miss the metaphorical meaning so this area is about eight times the size in higher especially in humans
as in lower primates something very interesting is going on here in the angular gyrus because it's the crossroads between hearing vision and touch
in humans and something very interesting is going on and i think it's a basis of many uniquely human abilities like abstraction metaphor
