a few years ago oddly enough i needed the bathroom
and for some reason that day instead i asked myself a question and it was where does this stuff
and with that question i found myself plunged into the world
to go back to that toilet
but it had a lockable door it had privacy it had water it had soap so i could wash my hands and i did because i 'm a woman and we do that
but that day when i asked that question i learned something and that was that i 'd grown up thinking that a toilet like that was my right when in fact it 's a privilege two point five billion people worldwide have no adequate toilet they don 't have
a bucket or a box
forty percent of the world with no adequate toilet
and every day probably that guy in the picture walks on by
because he sees that little boy but he doesn 't see him but he should
because the problem with all that poop lying around
is that poop carries passengers fifty communicable diseases like to travel in human shit
all those things the eggs the cysts the bacteria the viruses all those can travel in one gram of human feces
in what i call the flushed and plumbed world that most of us in this room are lucky to live in
the most common symptoms associated with those diseases diarrhea is now a bit of a joke it 's the runs the hershey squirts the squits where i come from we call it delhi belly as a legacy of empire
but if you search for a stock photo of diarrhea in a leading photo image agency this is the picture that you come up with laughter still not sure about the bikini
and here 's another image of diarrhea this is marie saylee nine months old
you can 't see her because she 's buried under that green grass in a little village in liberia
because she died in three days from diarrhea
the hershey squirts the runs a joke
and they do every day
diarrhea is the second biggest killer of children worldwide
and you 've probably been asked to care about things like hiv aids or t b or measles
it 's a very potent weapon of mass destruction
and the cost to the world is immense two hundred and sixty billion dollars lost every year on the losses to poor sanitation these are cholera beds in haiti you 'll have heard of cholera but we don 't hear about diarrhea it gets a fraction of the attention and funding given to any of those other diseases but we know
wonderful victorian engineers installed systems of sewers and wastewater treatment and the flush toilet
and disease dropped dramatically child mortality dropped by the most it had ever dropped in history the flush toilet was voted the best medical advance of the last two hundred years by the readers of the british medical journal and they were choosing over the pill anesthesia and surgery it 's a wonderful waste disposal device
because i can 't explain otherwise when i look at the figures what 's going on
we know how to solve diarrhea and sanitation but if you look at the budgets of countries developing and developed
you 'll think there 's something wrong with the math because
you 'll expect absurdities like pakistan spending forty seven times more on its military than it does on water and sanitation even though one hundred and fifty thousand children die of diarrhea in pakistan every year
think about it that little boy who 's running back into his house
he may have a nice clean fresh water supply but he 's got dirty hands that he 's going to contaminate his water supply with
and i think that the real waste of human waste is that we are wasting it as a resource and as an incredible trigger for development because these are a few things that toilets and poop itself can do for us
so a toilet can put a girl back in school twenty five percent of girls in india drop out of school because they have no adequate sanitation
they 've been used to sitting through lessons for years and years holding it in we 've all done that but they do it every day
and when they hit puberty and they start menstruating it just gets too much
in rwanda they are now getting seventy five percent of their cooking fuel in their prison system from the contents of prisoners bowels
it gives off gas and you can cook with it
and you might think it 's just good karma to see these guys stirring shit but it 's also good economic sense because they 're saving a million dollars a year they 're cutting down on deforestation and they 've found a fuel supply that is inexhaustible infinite and free at the point of production
it 's not just in the poor world that poop can save lives
maybe it 's the ick factor
that 's okay because there 's a team of research scientists in canada who have now created a stool sample a fake stool sample which is called repoopulate so you 'd be thinking by now okay the solution 's simple we give everyone a toilet
and this is where it gets really interesting because it 's not that simple because we are not simple so
the really interesting exciting work this is the engaging bit in sanitation is that we need to understand human psychology we need to understand
so the idea is to manipulate human emotion it 's been done for decades the soap companies did it in the early twentieth century
they tried selling soap as healthy no one bought it they tried selling it as sexy everyone bought it in india now there 's a campaign which persuades young brides not to marry into families that don 't have a toilet it 's called no loo no i do
and she was scared she was scared of drunks hanging around she was scared of snakes she was scared of rape after three days she did an unthinkable thing she left
and if you know anything about rural india you 'll know that 's an unspeakably courageous thing to do but not just that she got her toilet
and now she goes around all the other villages in india persuading other women to do the same thing it 's what i call social contagion and it 's really powerful and really exciting
another version of this another village in india near where priyanka lives is this village called lakara and about a year ago it had no toilets whatsoever kids were dying of diarrhea and cholera
not only that but they were ingesting their neighbors shit that 's what really made them change their behavior
so when i get despondent about the state of sanitation even though these are pretty exciting times because we 've got the bill and melinda gates foundation
reinventing the toilet which is great we 've got matt damon going on bathroom strike which is great for humanity very bad for his colon but there are things to worry about
it 's about fifty or so years off track we 're not going to meet targets providing people with sanitation at this rate
so when i get sad about sanitation
they have in built bidet nozzles for a lovely hands free cleaning experience and they have various other features like a heated seat and an automatic lid raising device which is known as the marriage saver
i hope that we can do that it 's not a difficult thing to do
all we really need to do as the urgent
shameful issue that it is
and don 't think that it 's just in the poor world that things are wrong our sewers are crumbling
things are going wrong here too
the solution to all of this is pretty easy i 'm going to make your lives easy this afternoon and just ask you to do one thing and that 's to go out
protest speak about the unspeakable and talk shit
and talk shit thank you talk dirty
