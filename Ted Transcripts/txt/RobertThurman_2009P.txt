by quoting einstein 's wonderful statement just so people will feel at ease that the great scientist of the twentieth century also agrees with us and also calls us to this action
he said a human being is a part of the whole called by us universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest
a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness that separation this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us
our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty
this insight of einstein 's is uncannily close to that of buddhist psychology wherein compassion karuna it is called
is defined as the sensitivity to another 's suffering and the corresponding will to free the other from that suffering
it pairs closely with love which is the will for the other to be happy which requires of course that one feels some happiness oneself and wishes to share
this is perfect in that it clearly opposes self centeredness and selfishness to compassion the concern for others
and further it indicates that those caught in the cycle of self concern suffer helplessly while the compassionate are more free and implicitly more happy
the dalai lama often states that compassion is his best friend it helps him when he is overwhelmed with grief and despair
and broadens his awareness of the sufferings of others even of the perpetrators of his misery and the whole mass of
in fact suffering is so huge and enormous his own becomes less and less monumental and he begins to move beyond his self concern
into the broader concern for others and this immediately cheers him up as his courage is stimulated to rise to the occasion
is a very famous story in the indian and buddhist tradition of the great saint asanga who lived contemporary of augustine in the west and was sort of like the
lived eight hundred years after the buddha 's time and he was discontented with the state of people 's practice of the buddhist religion in india at that time
and so he said i 'm sick of all this nobody 's really living the doctrine they're talking about love and compassion and wisdom and enlightenment but they are acting selfish and
so buddha 's teaching has lost its momentum i know next buddha will come a few thousand years from now but exists currently in a certain heaven that's
so i'm going to go on a retreat and i'm going to meditate and pray until the buddha maitreya reveals himself to me
and gives me a teaching or something to revive the practice of compassion in the world today so he went on this retreat
and he meditated for three years and he did not see the future buddha maitreya and he left in disgust and as he was leaving he saw
a man a funny little man sitting sort of part way down the mountain and he had a lump of iron
and he said that 's ridiculous you can't make a needle by rubbing a lump of iron with a cloth and the man said really and he showed him a dish full of needles
making a nest on a cliff ledge and where it's landing to bring the twigs to the cliff
its feathers brushes the rock and it had cut the rock in inches six to eight inches in there was a cleft in the rock by the brushing of the feathers of generations of the birds
so he said all right i get the point he went back another three years again no vision of maitreya after nine years and he again leaves and this time water dripping
making a giant bowl in the rock where it drips in a stream and so again he goes back and after twelve there is still no vision
and he 's freaked out and he won 't even look left or right to see any encouraging vision and he comes to the town he 's a broken person and there in the town he 's approached by a dog
who comes like this one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries even in america i think in some areas and he 's looking just terrible
and he becomes interested in this dog because it's so pathetic and it's trying to attract his attention and he sits down looking at the dog and the dog 's whole hindquarters are a complete open sore
and some of it is like gangrenous and there's like maggots in the flesh and it's terrible he thinks what can i do to fix up this dog
i can clean this wound and wash it so he takes it to some water he 's about to clean then his awareness focuses on the maggots
and he sees the maggots and the maggots are kind of looking a little cute and they're maggoting happily in the dog 's hindquarters there well if i clean the dog i'll kill the maggots
the maggots so he had a brilliant idea and he took a shard of something and cut a piece of flesh from his thigh and he placed it on ground
was not really thinking too carefully about the aspca he was just immediately caught
so he says well i'll put my tongue on the dog 's flesh and then the maggots will jump on my warmer tongue the dog is kind of used
and then i'll spit them one by one down on the thing so he goes down and he 's sticking his tongue out like this and
the future buddha maitreya in a beautiful vision like rainbow lights golden jeweled plasma body
mystic vision he sees and he says oh he bows but being human he 's immediately thinking of his next complaint so as he comes up from his first bow he says my lord i'm so happy to see you but where have you been for twelve years
what is this and maitreya says i was with you who do you think was making needles and making nests and dripping on rocks for you mister dense
looking for the buddha in person he said and he said you didn't have until this moment real compassion and until you have real compassion you cannot recognize love
love the loving one you know in sanskrit and so he looked very dubious asanga did and he said if you don't believe me just take me with you and so he took
a globe a ball took him on his shoulder
and he ran into town in the marketplace and he said rejoice rejoice the future buddha has come ahead of all predictions here
and then pretty soon they started throwing rocks and stones at him it wasn't chautauqua it was some other town because they saw a demented looking scrawny looking yogi man
some kind of hippie with a bleeding leg and a rotten dog on his shoulder shouting that the future buddha had come so naturally they chased him out of town but on the edge of town one elderly lady a char woman in the charnel ground
saw a jeweled foot on a jeweled lotus on his shoulder and then the dog but she saw the jewel foot of the maitreya and she offered
a flower so that encouraged him and he went with maitreya with maitreya then took him to a certain heaven the way the buddhist myth unfolds in a typical way
and maitreya then kept him in heaven for five years dictating to him five complicated tomes of the methodology of how you cultivate compassion and then i thought i would share with you
what that method is or one of them famous one it's called the sevenfold causal method of developing compassion and it begins first by one meditating and visualizing that all beings are with one
all even animals too but everyone is in human form the animals are in one of their human lives the humans are human
and then among them you think of your friends and loved ones the circle at the table and you think of your enemies and you think of the neutral ones and then you try to say well the loved ones i love
but you know after all they're nice to me i had fights with them sometimes they were unfriendly i got mad brothers can fight parents and children can fight
so in a way i like them so much because they're nice to me while the neutral ones i don't know they could all be just fine and then
the buddhist view in some previous life although you don't remember it and neither do i have been my mother for which i do apologize for the trouble i
and also actually i've been your mother i've been female and i've been every single one of you your mother in a previous life the way the buddhists reflect
so my mother is this life is really great but all of you in a way are part of the eternal mother you gave me that expression the eternal mama you
that's the way the buddhists do it a theist christian can think that all beings even my enemies are god 's children so in that sense we're related
so they first create this foundation of equality so we sort of reduce a little of the clinging to the ones we love just in the meditation
and we open our mind to those we don't know and we definitely reduce the hostility and i don't want to be compassionate to them to the ones we think of as the bad guys the ones we hate
and we don't like and we don't hate anyone therefore so we equalize that's very important and then the next thing we do is what is called mother recognition
and that is we think of every being as familiar as family we expand we take the feeling about remembering a mama
and we defuse that to all beings in this meditation and we see the mother in every being we see that look that the mother has on her face this looking at this child that is a miracle that she has produced from her own body being a mammal
it's the most powerful form of altruism the mother is what is the model of all altruism for human beings in spiritual traditions and so we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression
in all beings people laugh at me because you know i used to say that i used to meditate on
mama cheney as my mom when of course i was annoyed with him about all of his evil doings in iraq i used to meditate on george bush he 's quite a cute mom in a female form has his little ears and he
and he rocks you in his arms and you think of him as nursing you and then saddam hussein 's serious mustache is a problem but you think of him as a
and this is the way you do it you take any being who looks weird to you and you see how they could be familiar to you
and you do that for awhile until you really feel that you can feel the familiarity of all beings nobody seems alien they're not other you reduce the feeling of otherness about beings then you move from there to
and you begin to get very sentimental you cultivate sentimentality intensely you will even weep perhaps with gratitude and kindness
and then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that motherly possibility every being even the most mean looking ones can be motherly
and then third you step from there to what is called a feeling of gratitude you want to repay that kindness that all beings have shown to you and then the fourth step you go to what is called lovely love
in each one of these you can take some weeks or months or days depending on how you do it or you can do them in a run this meditation and then you think of
how lovely beings are when they are happy when they are satisfied and every being looks beautiful when they are internally feeling a happiness
their face doesn't look like this when they're angry they look ugly every being but when they're happy they look beautiful and so you see beings in their potential happiness
enemy he does say that and we think he 's being unrealistic and sort of spiritual and highfalutin and nice for him to say it but i can't do that but actually that's practical if you love your enemy that means you want your enemy to be happy if your enemy was really happy
anyway that's the lovely love and then finally the fifth step is compassion universal compassion and that is where you then look at the reality of all the beings you can think of
you look at them and you see how they are and you realize how unhappy they are actually mostly most of the time you see that furrowed brow in people
you realize they don't even have compassion on themselves they're driven by this duty and this obligation i have to get that i need more i'm not worthy and i should do something and they're rushing around all stressed out
and they think of it as somehow macho hard discipline on themselves but actually they are cruel to themselves and of course they are cruel and ruthless toward others and they then never get any positive feedback
and the more they succeed and the more power they have the more unhappy they are and this is where you feel real compassion for them
who was fixing the maggots on the dog because he had that motivation and whoever was in front of him he wanted to help but of course that is impractical he should have founded the
in the town and gotten some scientific help for dogs and maggots and i'm sure he did that later but that
and you have compassion for yourself also and you don't it isn't sentimental only you might be in fear of something some bad guy is making himself more and more unhappy being more and more mean to other people
and getting punished in the future for it in various ways and in buddhism they catch it in the future life of course in theistic religion they're punished by god or whatever and materialism
they get out of it just by not existing by dying but they don 't and so they get reborn as whatever you know never mind i won 't get into that
but the next step is called universal responsibility and that is very important the charter of compassion must lead us to develop through true compassion what is called universal responsibility and that means
that the great teaching of his holiness the dalai lama that he always teaches everywhere and he says that is the common religion of humanity kindness but
means universal responsibility and that means whatever happens to other beings is happening to us that we are responsible for that and we should take it and do whatever we can at whatever little level and small level that we can do it
we absolutely must do that there is no way not to do it and then finally that leads to a new orientation in life where we
equally for ourselves and others and we realize that happiness for ourselves and we are joyful and happy one thing we mustn't think is compassion makes you miserable
even if you haven't done anything yet for anybody else although the change in your mind already does something for other beings they can sense this new quality in yourself
and it helps them already and gives them an example and that uncompassionate clock has just showed me that it's all over so practice compassion
read the charter disseminate it and develop it within yourself don't just think oh well i'm compassionate or i'm not compassionate and sort of think you're stuck
you can develop this you can diminish the non compassion the cruelty the callousness the neglect of others take universal responsibility for them
and then not only will god smile and the eternal mama will smile but karen armstrong will smile thank you very
