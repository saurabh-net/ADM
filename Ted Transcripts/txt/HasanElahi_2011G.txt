and i had a little bit of a problem a few years ago so let me show you a little of that so it started over here and this is the detroit airport in june nineteenth of two thousand and two i was flying back to the u s from an exhibition overseas and as i was coming back well i was taken by the fbi met by an fbi agent and
from ten thirty a m to twelve zero p m i met with judith who was one of my graduate students at the time from twelve zero p m to three zero p m i taught my intro class three zero p m to six zero p m i taught my advanced class where were you the eleventh where were you the tenth where were you the twenty ninth the thirtieth where were you october fifth we read about six months of my calendar
and i don 't think he was expecting me to have such detailed records
and he 's still a little confused but i think that anyone who talks to me for more than a couple of minutes realizes i 'm not exactly a terrorist threat
and so we 're sitting there and eventually after about an hour hour and a half of just going back and forth he says okay i have enough information here i 'm going to pass this onto the tampa office they 're the ones who initiated this they 'll follow up with you and we 'll take care of it i was like great so i got home and the phone rings and
this is the fbi offices in tampa where i spent six months of my life back and forth not six months continuously by the way you folks know that in the united states you can 't take photographs of federal buildings but google can do it for you so to the folks from google thank you
and you also have to consider the state of mind you 're in when you 're doing this you 're basically face to face with someone that
essentially decides life or death or questions such as actually during the polygraph which was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them one of the polygraph questions was well the first one was is your name hasan yes are we in florida yes is today tuesday yes because you have to base it on a yes or no
then of course the next question is do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the united states
i was like i know that 's what i 've been trying to tell you guys all along i know everything 's fine so they 're looking at me really odd and it 's like guys i travel a lot this is with the fbi and i was like all we need is alaska not to get the last memo and here we go all over again
and there was a sincere concern there and he was like you know if you get into trouble give us a call we 'll take care of it so ever since then before i would go anywhere i would call the fbi i
a couple weeks later i 'd call again let them know it wasn 't that i had to but i chose to just wanted to say hey guys don 't want to make it look like i 'm making any sudden moves
and so i just kept doing this over and over and over and then the phone calls turned
emails and the emails got longer and longer and longer with pictures with travel
then i built this over here let me go back to it over here so
i actually designed this back in two thousand and three so this kind of tracks me at any given moment i wrote some code for my mobile phone basically what i decided is
well they probably have all my flight records so i decided to put all my flight records from birth
singapore you can see they 're kind of empty
at the time that this was going on the last thing on my mind was art project
i was certainly not thinking hey i got new work here but
after going through this after realizing well what just happened and after piecing together this this and this this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself eventually evolved into this and it actually became this project so
some of them because they need to know this is me buying some duck flavored paste at the ranch ninety nine in daly city on sunday november fifteenth at coreana supermarket buying my kimchi because i like kimchi and i bought some crabs too right around there and some chitlins at the safeway in emoryville
and laundry too laundry detergent at west oakland east oakland sorry and then my pickled jellyfish at the hong kong supermarket on route eighteen in east brunswick now if you go to my bank records it 'll actually show something from there so you know that on may ninth that i bought dollar fourteen point seven nine in fuel from safeway vallejo
so not only that i 'm giving this information here and there but now there 's a third party an independent third party my bank that 's verifying that yes indeed i was there at this time so there 's points and these points are actually being cross referenced and there 's a verification taking place sometimes they 're really small purchases
so thirty four cents foreign transaction fee all of these are extracted directly from my bank accounts and everything pops up right away
and then sometimes you get this sometimes you just get this just an empty hallway in salt lake city january twenty second and i can tell you exactly who i was with where i was because this is what i had to do with the fbi i had to tell them every little detail of everything i spend a lot of time on the road this is a parking lot
and sometimes you get a lot of text information and no visual information so you get something like this this by the way is the location of my favorite sandwich shop in california vietnamese sandwich
they need to know where i 'm doing my business because they want to know about my business so on december fourth i went here
and on sunday june fourteenth at two thousand and nine this was actually about two o 'clock in the afternoon in skowhegan maine this was my apartment there so what you 're basically seeing here
is all bits and pieces and all this information if you go to my site there 's tons of things and really it 's not the most user friendly interface it 's actually quite user unfriendly
and one of the reasons also being part of the user unfriendliness is that everything is there but you have to really work through it so by me putting all this information out there
but in this barrage of noise that i 'm putting out
intelligence agencies and it doesn 't matter who they are
they all operate in an industry where their commodity is information or restricted access to information and the reason their information has any value is well because no one else has access to it and by me
cutting out the middle man and giving it straight to you the information
so thus devaluing their currency and i understand that on an individual level it 's purely symbolic but if three hundred million people in the u s started doing this we would have to redesign the entire intelligence system from the ground up
and we 're getting to that when i first started this project
people were looking at me and saying why would you want to tell everybody what you 're doing where you 're at why are you posting these photos
i 'm still doing this project but it is obsolete because you 're all doing it this is something that we all are doing on a daily basis whether we 're aware of it or not so we 're creating our own archives and so on and you know
and i came up with these so these are some of my sample logs and just little bits and pieces and you can see some of the things there and i cleaned up the list a little bit so you can see so you can see that the homeland security likes to come by
department of homeland security you can see the national security agency likes to come by i actually moved very close to them i live right down the street from them now
central intelligence agency executive office of the president
not really sure why they show up but they do i think they kind of like to look at art and i 'm glad that we have patrons of the arts in these fields so thank you very much
so it 's really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks send and then it 's done and everything 's automated at the other end
