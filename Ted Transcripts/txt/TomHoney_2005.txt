in the church of england i've been a priest in the church for twenty years for most of that time
i've been struggling and grappling with questions about the nature of god who is god
and i'm very aware that when you say the word god many people will turn off immediately
a celestial controller a rulemaker a policeman in the sky who orders everything
and causes everything to happen he will protect his own people and answer the prayers of the faithful
and in the worship of my church the most frequently used adjective about god is almighty
but i have a problem with that i have become more and more uncomfortable with this perception of god over the years
do we really believe that god is the kind of male boss that we've been presenting in our worship and in our liturgies over all these years
of course there have been thinkers who have suggested different ways of looking at god exploring the feminine nurturing side of divinity
acknowledging that god is unknown and unknowable by definition finding deep resonances with other religions and philosophies
and ways of looking at life as part of what is a universal and global search for meaning
been reluctant to air them for fear of creating tension and division in our church communities
for fear of upsetting the simple faith of more traditional believers i have chosen not to rock the boat
then on december twenty sixth last year just two months ago that underwater earthquake triggered the tsunami
and two weeks later sunday morning ninth january i found myself standing in front of my congregation intelligent well meaning mostly thoughtful christian
and i needed to express on their behalf our feelings and our questions i had my own personal responses but i also
have a public role and something needed to be said and this is what i said
the essence of what he said was this the people most affected by the devastation and loss of life
do not want intellectual theories about how god let this happen
he wrote if some religious genius did come up with an explanation of exactly why all these deaths made sense
we feel happier or safer or more confident in god
if the man in the photograph that appeared in the newspapers holding the hand of his dead child was standing in front of us
now there are no words that we could say to him a verbal response would not be appropriate the only appropriate response would be
a compassionate silence and some kind of practical help it isn't a time for explanation or preaching or theology it's a time for
this is true and yet here we are my church in oxford semi detached from events
that happened a long way away but with our faith bruised and we want an explanation from god we demand an explanation from god
some have concluded that we can only believe in a god who shares our pain
in some way god must feel the anguish and grief and physical pain that we feel in some way
the eternal god must be able to enter into the souls of human beings and experience the torment within
and if this is true it must also be that god knows the joy and exaltation of the human spirit as well
we want a god who can weep with those who weep and rejoice with those who rejoice
this seems to me both a deeply moving and a convincing re statement of christian belief about god
hundreds of years the prevailing orthodoxy the accepted truth was that god the father the creator is unchanging
and therefore by definition cannot feel pain or sadness now the unchanging god feels a bit cold and indifferent to me
and the devastating events of the twentieth century have forced people to question the cold unfeeling god
the slaughter of millions in the trenches and in the death camps have caused people to ask
is god in all this who is god in all this and the answer was god is in this with us or god doesn't deserve our allegiance anymore
if god is a bystander observing but not involved then god may well exist but we don't want to know about
many jews and christians now feel like this i know and i am among them
so we have a suffering god a god who is intimately connected with this world and with every living soul i very much relate to this idea of god
but it isn't enough i need to ask some more questions and i hope they are questions that you will want to ask as well some of you
over the last few weeks i have been struck by the number of times that words in our worship have felt a bit inappropriate a bit dodgy
we have a pram service on tuesday mornings for mums and their pre school children and last week we sang with the children one of their favorite songs the wise man built his house upon the rock perhaps some of you know it
some of the words go like this the foolish man built his house upon the sand and the floods came up and the house on the sand went crash
then in the same week at a funeral we sang the familiar hymn we plow the fields and scatter a very english hymn in the second verse comes the line the wind and waves obey him
i don't feel we can sing that song again in church after what's happened so the first big question is about control
does god have a plan for each of us is god in control does god order each moment
does the wind and the waves obey him
from time to time one hears christians telling the story of how god organized things for them so that everything worked out all right some difficulty overcome some illness cured some trouble averted
a parking space found at a crucial time i can remember someone saying this to me
shining with enthusiasm at this wonderful confirmation of her faith and the goodness of god
but if god can or will do these things intervene to change the flow of events then surely he could have stopped the tsunami
do we have a local god who can do little things like parking spaces but not big things like five hundred mile per hour waves
that's just not acceptable to intelligent christians and we must acknowledge it either god is responsible for the tsunami or god is not in control
so that they were still out of harm 's way when the wave struck afterwards someone said that god must have been looking after them
so the next question is about partiality can we earn god 's favor by worshipping him or believing in him does god demand loyalty like any medieval tyrant
a god who looks after his own so that christians are ok while everyone else perishes a cosmic us
and a god who is guilty of the worst kind of favoritism that would be appalling
and that would be the point at which i would hand in my membership such a god would be morally inferior to the highest ideals of humanity
so who is god if not the great puppet master or the tribal protector
perhaps but these ideas are all just variations on god controlling everything
the supreme commander toying with expendable units in a great campaign we are still left with a god who can do the tsunami and allow auschwitz
in his great novel the brothers karamazov dostoevsky gives these words to ivan addressed to his naive and devout younger brother
if the sufferings of children go to make up the sum of sufferings which is necessary for the purchase of truth
then i say beforehand that the entire truth is not worth such a price we cannot afford to pay so much for admission
it is not god that i do not accept i merely most respectfully return him the ticket
or perhaps god set the whole universe going at the beginning and then relinquished control forever so that natural processes could occur and evolution run its course
this seems more acceptable but it still leaves god with the ultimate moral responsibility
is god a cold unfeeling spectator or a powerless lover watching with infinite compassion things god is unable to control or change
is god intimately involved in our suffering so that he feels it in his own being
if we believe something like this we must let go of the puppet master completely take our leave of the almighty controller abandon traditional
we must think again about god maybe god doesn't do things at all maybe god isn't an agent like all of us are agents
by his mighty acts but what if god doesn't act what if god doesn't do things
compassionate presence underpinning and sustaining all things what if god is in things in the
in the process of evolution in the incredible intricacy and magnificence of the natural world in the collective unconscious the soul of the human race in you in
mind and body and spirit in the tsunami in the victims in the depth of things
in presence and in absence in simplicity and complexity in change and development and growth how does this in ness this innerness this interiority of god work
it's hard to conceive and begs more questions is god just another name for the universe with no independent existence
to what extent can we ascribe personality to god
in the end we have to say i don't know if we knew god would not be god
to have faith in this god would be more like trusting an essential benevolence in the universe and less like believing a system of doctrinal statements
ironic that christians who claim to believe in an infinite unknowable being then tie god down in closed systems and rigid doctrines
how could one practice such a faith by seeking the god within by cultivating my own inwardness in silence in meditation
in my inner space in the me that remains when i gently put aside my passing emotions and ideas and preoccupations
in awareness of the inner conversation and how would we live such a faith how would i live such a faith
by seeking intimate connection with your inwardness the kind of relationships when deep speaks to deep
if god is in all people then there is a meeting place where my relationship with you becomes a three way encounter
there is an indian greeting which i'm sure some of you know namaste accompanied by a respectful bow
which roughly translated means that which is of god in me greets that which of god is in you
and how would one deepen such a faith by seeking the inwardness which is in all things in music and poetry in the natural world of beauty
and in the small ordinary things of life there is a deep indwelling presence that makes them extraordinary
it needs a profound attentiveness and a patient waiting a contemplative attitude
and a generosity and openness to those whose experience is different from my
when i stood up to speak to my people about god and the tsunami i had no answers to offer them no neat packages of faith
with bible references to prove them only doubts and questioning and uncertainty
i had some suggestions to make possible new ways of thinking about god ways that might allow us to go on down a new and uncharted road
but in the end the only thing i could say for sure was i don't know and that just might be the most profoundly religious statement of all thank you
