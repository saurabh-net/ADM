i'm a writer and a journalist and i'm also an insanely curious person
so in twenty two years as a journalist i've learned how to do a lot of new things and three years ago
i became one of the working homeless
i quit my job as a newspaper editor
after my father died in february of that same year and decided to travel
his death hit me pretty hard and there were a lot of things that i wanted to feel and deal with while i was doing that i've camped my whole life and i decided that living in a van for a year to do this would be like one long camping trip so
that society equates living in a permanent structure even a shack with having value as a person
two i failed to realize how quickly the negative perceptions of other people can impact our reality if we let it
three i failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude not a lifestyle
i showered in campgrounds i ate out regularly and i had time to relax and to grieve
but then the anger and the depression about my father 's death set in
my freelance job ended and i had to get a full time job to pay the bills
it became impossible to park anywhere
used employee showers in office buildings and truck stops or i washed up in
food rotted in the heat
ice in my ice chest melted within hours and it was pretty miserable
i couldn't afford to find an apartment or couldn't afford an apartment that would allow me to have the rottweiler and the cat
and i refused to give them up
so i stayed in the van
outside my van at night i used a bucket
a trash bag as a toilet
a different place every night so i would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police i didn't always succeed but
out of control of my life
which i went from being a talented writer and journalist i hadn't changed
my i q hadn't dropped my talent my integrity my values
and as depressed as anyone in line
i just wasn't drunk or high
you aren't homeless why are you really here
other homeless people didn't see me as homeless but i did
a reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression left me suicidal and i remember thinking
if i killed myself no one would notice
a friend told me shortly after that that she had heard that tim russert a nationally renowned journalist had been talking about me on national
an essay i'd written about my father the year before he died
was in tim 's new book and he was doing the talk show circuit and he was talking about my writing and when i realized that tim russert
former moderator of meet the press was talking about my writing
while i was living in a van in a wal mart parking lot i started laughing you should too i started laughing
by the summer of the following year i was a working journalist i was winning awards i was living in my own apartment i was no longer homeless and i was no longer invisible
thousands of people work full and part time jobs and live in their cars
so the homeless the working homeless primarily remain invisible but if you ever meet one
engage them encourage them and offer them hope
the human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope
or what their life situation is at any given time
three years ago i was living in a van in a wal mart parking lot
and today i'm speaking at ted
hope always always finds a way
