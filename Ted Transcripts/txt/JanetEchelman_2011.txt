is about taking imagination seriously
fourteen years ago i first encountered this ordinary material fishnet used the same way for centuries today i 'm using it to create permanent billowing voluptuous forms the scale of hard edged buildings in cities around the world
i was an unlikely person to be doing this i never studied sculpture engineering or architecture
in fact after college i applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven i went off on my own to become an artist and i painted
for ten years when i was offered a fulbright to india promising to give exhibitions of paintings i shipped my paints and arrived in mahabalipuram the deadline for the show arrived
my paints didn 't i had to do something this fishing village was famous for sculpture so i tried bronze casting
but to make large forms was too heavy and expensive
a new approach to sculpture a way to make volumetric form without heavy solid materials my first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen
it 's a self portrait titled wide hips
i discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns i was mesmerized
i continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans next in lithuania with lace makers i liked the fine detail it gave my work
but i wanted to make them larger to shift from being an object you look at
to something you could get lost in returning to india to work with those fishermen we made a net of a million and a half hand tied knots
he asked if i could build this as a permanent piece for the city i didn 't know if i could do that and preserve my art durable
engineered permanent those are in opposition to idiosyncratic delicate and ephemeral
for two years i searched for a fiber that could survive ultraviolet rays salt air pollution and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind
we needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle so we raised this forty five thousand pound steel ring
we had to engineer it to move gracefully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds but there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving
he helped me tackle the twin challenges of precise shape and gentle movement
i couldn 't build this the way i knew because hand tied knots weren 't going to withstand a hurricane so i developed a relationship with an industrial fishnet factory learned the variables of their machines and figured out a way to make lace with them
there was no language to translate this ancient idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce so we had to create one
three years and two children later
we raised this fifty thousand square foot lace net
it was hard to believe that what i had imagined was now built
now it had a sense of place
i walked underneath it for the first time
as i watched the wind 's choreography unfold i felt sheltered and at the same time connected to limitless sky
my life was not going to be the same
i want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world
i 'm going to share two directions that are new in my work
historic philadelphia city hall its plaza i felt needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than netting so we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind
and in testing discovered that it can be shaped by people
who can interact and move through it without getting wet
i 'm using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time
like an x ray of the city 's circulatory system unfolding
next challenge the biennial of the americas in denver asked could i represent the thirty five nations of the western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture
and the tsunami that rippled across the entire pacific ocean it shifted the earth 's tectonic plates sped up the planet 's rotation and literally shortened the length of the day
so i contacted noaa and i asked if they 'd share their data on the tsunami and translated it into this
its title one point two six refers to the number of microseconds that the earth 's day was shortened i couldn 't build this with a steel ring the way i knew its shape was too complex now
so i replaced the metal armature with a soft fine mesh of a fiber fifteen times stronger than steel
the sculpture could now be entirely soft which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings
literally becoming part of the fabric of the city there was no software that could extrude these complex net forms and model them with gravity
so we had to create it
then i got a call from new york city
asking if i could adapt these concepts to times square
to times square fourteen years ago
fourteen years ago i searched for beauty
in the traditional things in craft forms
now i combine them with hi tech materials and engineering
to create voluptuous billowing forms the scale of buildings
my artistic horizons continue to grow i 'll leave you with this story
i got a call from a friend in phoenix
never visited the local art museum
sharing the rediscovery of wonder
