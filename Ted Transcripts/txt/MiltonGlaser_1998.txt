intellectual activity because you are always comparing the variation with the theme that you hold in your mind you might say that the theme is nature
and everything that follows is a variation on the subject i
i guess about six years ago to do a
that in some way would celebrate the birth of piero della francesca
and it was very difficult for me to imagine how to
pictures that were based on
until i realized that i could look at piero as nature
that i would have the same attitude towards looking
at piero della francesca as i would if i were looking out a
and that was enormously liberating to me and perhaps it's not a very insightful observation but
that really started me on a path to be able to do a kind of theme and variation based on a work by piero in this case that remarkable
the real piero della francesca
one of the greatest portraits in human history and these i'll just show
these without comment it's just a series of variations on the head of the duke of montefeltro who 's a great great figure in the renaissance and probably the basis for machiavelli 's the
in battle which is why he is always shown in profile and this is battista
and then i decided i could move them around a little
so that for the first time in history they're facing the same direction
and then a visitor from another painting by piero this is from the resurrection of christ
as though the cast had just gotten of the set to have a chat and now four large panels this is upper left right lower left lower
i've never understood the conflict between abstraction and
i was driving in the country one day with my wife and i saw this sign and i said that is a fabulous piece of design and she said what are you talking about i said well it's so persuasive because
the purpose of that sign is to get you into the
they use the word reliable but everybody says they're reliable but reliable
so on and so the entire issue is detoxified by the use of dutchman now if you think i'm
at all in this all you have to do is substitute something else like or even french
now swiss works but you know it's going to cost a lot of money
i'm going to take you quickly through the actual process of doing a poster i do a lot of work for the school of visual arts where i teach and the director of this school a remarkable man named silas rhodes often
hold alike fantastic if too new or old be not the first by whom the new are tried nor yet the last to lay the old aside i could make nothing of
and i really struggled with this one and the first thing i did which was sort of in the absence of another idea was say i'll sort of write it out and make some words big and i'll have some kind of design on the back
somehow and i was hoping as one often does to stumble into something
so i took another sort of crack at it and you've got to keep it moving i xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper and i pasted them down on an ugly board
i thought that something would come out of it like words rule fantastic new old first last pope
by alexander pope but i sort of made a mess out of it and then i thought i'd repeat it in some way so it was legible so it was going nowhere sometimes
in the middle of a resistant problem i write down things that i know about it
and then i did some variations of it but it still wasn't sort of coalescing graphically at all i had this other version which had something interesting about it in terms of
able to put together in your mind from clues the w was clearly a w the n was clearly an n even though they were
very fragmentary and there wasn't a lot of information in it then i sort of got the words new and old and now i had regressed back to a point where there seemed to be no return i was
really desperate at this point and so i do something
truthfully ashamed of which is that i took two drawings i had made for another purpose
and i put them together and it says dreams
the top and i was going to do a thing i say well change the copy let it say something about dreams and come to sva and you'll sort of fulfill your dreams but to my credit i
embarrassed about doing that that i never submitted this sketch
and finally i arrived at the following
solution now it doesn't look terribly interesting but it does have something that distinguishes it from a lot of other posters
for one thing it transgresses the idea of what a poster 's supposed to be which is to be understood and seen
immediately and not explained i remember hearing all of you in the graphic arts if you have to explain it
and one day i woke up and i said well suppose that's not true
here 's what it says in my explanation at the bottom left
it says thoughts this poem is impossible
silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations this one generates no
i am now exposing myself to my audience
right which is something you never want to do professionally
maybe the words can make the image without anything else happening what's the heart of this poem don't be trendy if you want to be serious is doing
the poster this way trendy in itself i guess one could reduce the idea further by suggesting that the new emerges behind and through the old like this
and then i show you a little drawing you see you remember that old thing i discarded well i found a way to use it so there's that little alternative over there
each defines the other and then more self questioning am i being simple minded
as any ambition do you think this sort of thing could really attract a student to the school
well i think there are two fresh things here two fresh things one is the sort of
the willingness to expose myself to a critical audience and not to suggest that i am confident about
what i'm doing and as you know you have to have a front i mean you've got to be confident if you don't believe in your work who
so that's one thing sort of to introduce the idea of doubt to graphics that can be a big contribution the other thing is to actually give you two solutions for the price of
you get the big one if you don't like that how about the little
and that too is a relatively new idea and here 's just a series of experiments where i ask the question
of does a poster have to be square now this is a little illusion that poster is not folded
it's not folded that's a photograph and it's cut on the diagonal
same cheap trick in the upper left hand
poster because simply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer it
in the space at times it seems to be wider at the back than the front and then it shifts and if you sit here long enough it'll float off the page into the audience
and then an experiment a little bit about the nature of perspective where the outside shape is determined by the peculiarity of perspective but the shape of the bottle which is identical to the outside shape
is seen frontally and another
piece for the art directors club is anna rees casting long shadows this is not a poster from the school of visual arts there were ten artists
the idea was and it was a brilliant idea was to have ten posters distributed throughout the city 's subway system so every time you got on the subway you'd be passing a different poster all of which had a different
of what art is but i was absolutely stuck on the idea of art is and trying to determine what art was
but then i gave up and i said well art is whatever
the word hat was hidden in the word whatever and that led me to the inevitable conclusion but then again it's
my list of didactic posters my intent is to have a literary accompaniment that explains the poster in case you don't get
this says note to the viewer i thought i might use a visual cliche of our time magritte 's everyman to express the idea that art is mystery continuity and history
also convinced that in an age of computer manipulation surrealism has become banal a shadow of its former self
the phrase art is whatever expresses the current inclusiveness that surrounds art making a sort of it ain't what you do it's the way that you do it notion
the shadow of magritte falls across the central part of the poster a poetic event that occurs as the shadow man isolates the word hat hidden in the word whatever thing whatever
the one that i did not submit which i still like i wanted to use the same phrase and
of course those are the remains and they're so labeled but what really happens is you read it as art is whatever remains thank you
