the problem with these patents is that the mechanisms are obscure and the patent system is dysfunctional and as a result most of these lawsuits end in settlements and because these settlements are under a non disclosure agreement no one knows what the terms were and as a result the patent troll can claim that they won the case
in the case of gooseberry natural resources this patent on emailing news releases had sort of a fatal flaw as it pertained to myself and that was that in the mainstream media world there is only one definition for news release and it turns out that is press release as in p r
now my company fark deals with news ostensibly and as a result we were not in violation of this patent so case closed right wrong
one of the major problems with patent law is that in the case that when you are sued by a patent troll the burden of proof that you did not infringe on the patent is actually on the defendant which means you have to prove that you do not infringe on the patent they 're suing you on and this can take quite a while
you need to know that the average patent troll defense costs two million dollars and takes eighteen months when you win
that is your best case outcome when you get sued by a patent troll now i had hoped to team up with some of these larger companies in order to defend against this lawsuit but one by one they settled out of the case
even though and this is important none of these companies infringed on this patent not a one of
the reason they settled out is because it 's cheaper to settle than to fight the lawsuit clearly two million dollars cheaper in some cases and much worse if you actually lose
it would also constitute a massive distraction for management of a company especially a small eight man shop like my company
six months into the lawsuit we finally reached the discovery phase and in discovery phase we asked the patent troll to please provide screenshots of fark where the infringement of their patent was actually occurring now perhaps it 's because no such screenshots actually existed
but suddenly gooseberry wanted to settle their attorney ah yes my company 's having a reorganization on our end never mind the fact that the address led to a strip mall somewhere in northern l a with no employees
and we 'd like to go ahead and close this out so would you mind giving us your best and final offer
now as mentioned before one of the reasons i can talk to you about this is because there 's no non disclosure agreement on this case now how did that happen
well during the settlement process when we received our copy i struck it my attorney said nah no chance of that
make it clear from the beginning that either you have no money at all or that you would rather spend money with your attorney fighting the troll
now this is a tactic that patent trolls are supposed to use on people to get their way it turns out because they 're paid on contingency it works really really well in reverse don 't forget that so what does all this mean well to sum up
it boils down to one thing don 't negotiate with terrorists
and what do they do with that money
they plow it right back into filing more troll lawsuits
now this is the point in the talk where i 'm supposed to come up with some kind of a solution for the patent system and the problem with that is that there are two very large industry groups that have different outcomes in mind for the patent system the health care industry would like stronger protections for inventors the hi tech industry would like stronger protections for producers
and these goals aren 't necessarily diametrically opposed but they are at odds and as a result patent trolls can kind of live in the space in between
so unfortunately i 'm not smart enough to have a solution for the patent troll problem
defined as a computer which is not stationary
