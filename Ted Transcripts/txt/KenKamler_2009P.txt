we've heard a lot of people speak at this conference about the power
which occurred on mt everest it was the worst disaster in the history of everest
and when it occurred i was the only doctor on the mountain
so i'll take you through that and
see what it's like when someone really
summons the will to survive
it was on my forth trip to everest that a comet
passed over the mountain hyakutake and the sherpas told us then that was a very bad omen and we should
you can have winds twenty to forty miles an hour it's actually a windchill factor which is lower than a summer day on mars
i remember one time being up near the summit i reached into my down jacket for a drink from my water bottle inside my down jacket only to discover that the water was already frozen solid
okay this is the route up everest it starts at base camp at seventeen thousand five hundred feet camp one two thousand feet higher camp two another two thousand feet higher up what's called the western
camp three is at the base of lhotse which is the fourth highest mountain in the world but it's dwarfed by everest
and then camp four is the highest camp
is a view of base camp this is pitched on a glacier at seventeen thousand five hundred feet it's the highest point you can bring your yaks before you have to unload
and this is what they unloaded for me i had four yak loads of medical supplies which are dumped in a tent and here i am trying to arrange things
this was our expedition it was a national geographic expedition but it was organized by the explorers club there were three other expeditions on the mountain an american team a new zealand team and
and after actually two months of preparation we built our camps all the way up the mountain this is a view looking up the icefall the first two thousand feet of the climb up from base camp
and here 's a picture in the icefall it's a waterfall but it's frozen but it moves very slowly and it actually changes every day when you're in it you're like a rat in a maze you can't even see over the top
this is me crossing a crevasse we cross on aluminum ladders with safety ropes attached
some of these things are ten stories deep or more and one of my climbing says that the reason we actually climb at night is because if we ever saw the bottom of what we're climbing over we would never do it
is a view taken from camp three you can see the lhotse face is in profile it's about a forty five degree angle it takes two days to climb it so you put the camp halfway through if you notice the summit of everest is black there's no
and that's because everest is so high it's in the jet stream and winds are constantly scouring the face so no snow gets to accumulate what looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge is actually snow being blown off the summit
this is on the way up from camp three to camp four moving in up through the clouds
is a picture of rob hall he was the leader of the new zealand team this is a radio he used later to call his wife that i'll tell you about
the wind does die down at night it becomes very calm there's no wind at all this looks like a good chance to go for the summit
so here are some climbers starting out for the summit on what's called the triangular face it's the first part of climb it's done in the dark because it's actually less steep than what comes next and you can gain daylight hours if you do this in the dark
but what happened that year was the wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up a storm blew in that no one was anticipating you can see here some ferocious winds blowing snow way high off the summit and there were climbers
is a picture of me in that area taken a year before and you can see i've got an oxygen mask on with a rebreather
i have an oxygen hose connected here you can see on this climber we have two oxygen tanks in the backpack little titanium tanks very lightweight
much else this is all you've got you're very exposed on the summit ridge
okay this is a view taken on the summit ridge itself
and the reason is because the drop off is so sheer on either side that if you were roped to somebody you'd wind up just pulling them off with you so each person climbs individually and it's
eight thousand feet into nepal if you fall to your right you're going to fall twelve thousand feet into tibet
so it's probably better to fall into tibet because you'll live longer
but either way you fall for the
those climbers were up near the summit along that summit ridge that you see up there and i was down here in camp three my expedition was down in camp three while these guys were up there in the storm the storm was so fierce that we had to
winds i've ever seen and the climbers up on the ridge were that much higher two thousand feet higher and completely exposed to the elements
we were in radio contact with some of them this is a view taken along the summit ridge rob hall we heard by radio was
up here at this point in the storm with doug hansen and we heard that rob was okay but doug was too weak to come down
was exhausted and rob was staying with him we also got some bad news in the storm that beck weathers another climber
had collapsed in the snow and was dead there were still eighteen other climbers that we weren't aware of
during that storm we were just hunkered down in our tents
at camp three our two strongest climbers todd burleson and pete athans decided to go up
to try to rescue who they could even though there was a ferocious storm going they tried to radio a message to rob hall who was a superb climber
with a weak climber up near the summit
i expected them to say to rob hold on
but in fact what they said was
leave doug and come down yourself there's no chance of saving him and just try to save yourself at this point
and rob got that message but his answer was we 're both listening
got up to the summit ridge up in here and
and we sent down the climbers that could make it down under their own power the ones that couldn't we just sort of decided to leave up at camp four so the climbers were coming down along this route this is taken from camp three where i was
which is really not much because camp three is a little notch cut in the ice in the middle of a forty five degree angle you can barely stand outside the tent
it's really cold it's twenty four thousand feet the only supplies i had at that altitude were two plastic bags with preloaded syringes of painkiller and steroids so as the climbers came by me
i sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition to continue on further down the ones that weren't as lucid or were not that well coordinated i would give an injection of steroids to try to give them some period of lucidity and
was just too hard to maneuver any other way up there while i was taking care of them we got more news about rob hall
there was no way we could get up high enough to rescue him he called in to say that he was alone now apparently doug had died higher up on the mountain
but rob was now too weak to come down himself and with the fierce winds and up at that altitude he was just beyond rescue and he knew it at that point he asked
to be paged into his wife he was carrying a radio his wife was home in new zealand seven months pregnant with their first child
and rob asked to be patched into her that was done
signed off and that was the
i was faced with treating a lot of critically ill patients at twenty four thousand feet which was an impossibility so what we did was we got the victims down to twenty one thousand feet where it was easier for me to treat them this was my medical kit it's a tackle box
and this was scene at the lower camp the survivors came in one by one
some of them were hypothermic some of them were frostbitten some were both
what we did was try to warm them up as best we could put oxygen on them and try to revive them which is difficult to do at twenty one thousand feet when the tent is freezing
this is some severe frostbite on the feet
severe frostbite on the nose
this climber was snow blind
as i was taking care of these climbers we got a startling experience
out of nowhere beck weathers who we had already been told was dead
just like a mummy he walked into the tent i expected him to be incoherent but in fact he walked into the tent and said to me hi ken where should i
and then he said do you accept my health insurance he really said
so he was completely lucid but he was very severely frostbitten you can see his hand is completely white and his face his nose is burned first it turns white and then when it's completed necrosis it turns black and then it falls off
so as i was taking care of beck he related what had been going on up there he said he had gotten lost in the storm
snow and just laid there unable to move
some climbers had come by and looked at him and he heard them say he 's dead
but beck wasn't dead he heard that but he was completely unable to move he was in some sort of catatonic state where he could
be aware of his surroundings but couldn't even blink to indicate that he was alive so the climbers passed him by and beck lay there for a day a night and another day
and then he said to himself
i don't want to die i have a family to come back to and the thoughts of his family his kids and his wife
generated enough energy enough motivation in him
so that he actually got up after laying in the snow that long a time he got up and found his way back to the camp
beck told me that story very quietly but i was absolutely stunned by it i couldn't imagine anybody laying in the snow that long a time
and then getting up he apparently reversed and irreversible hypothermia and i can only
the temporal lobe where you form images and keep memories and the posterior part of your brain which contains the cerebellum which controls motion
and the brain stem where you have your basic maintenance functions like heartbeat and respiration so let 's take a cut through the brain here
and image that beck was hooked up to a spect scan this measures dynamic blood flow and therefore energy flow within the brain so you have the prefrontal cortex here
lighting up in red this is pretty a pretty evenly distributed scan you have the middle area where the temporal lobe might be in here and the posterior portion where the
now you go to this one and you see how much more
the frontal lobes are lighting up this might be what beck would be experiencing when he realized he 's in danger he 's focusing all his attention on getting himself out of trouble
these parts of the brain are quieting down he 's not thinking about his family or anybody else at this point and he 's working pretty hard he 's trying to get his muscles going and get out of this
he 's losing ground here he 's running out of energy it's too cold he can't keep his metabolic fires going
and you see there's no more red here his brain has quieting down he 's collapsed in the snow here everything is quiet there's very little red anywhere
is powering down he 's dying
to the next scan but in beck's case you can see that the middle part of his brain is beginning to light up again
this is how he 's going to turn thought back into action this part of the brain is called the anterior cingulate gyrus it's an area in which
make decisions where they develop willpower and you can see there's an energy flow going from the mid portion of his brain where he 's got images of his family into this area
which is powering his will
okay this is getting stronger and stronger to the point where it's actually going to be a motivating factor he 's going to develop enough energy in that area after a day a night and a day to actually motivate himself to get up
and you can see here
he 's starting to get more energy into the frontal lobe he 's beginning to focus he can concentrate now he 's thinking about what he 's got to do to save himself so this energy has been transmitted up
brain and it's getting quieter down here but he 's using this energy
and then that energy is sort of spreading throughout his thought areas he 's not thinking about his family now and he 's getting himself motivated this is the posterior part where his muscles are going to be moving and
he 's going to be pacing himself his heart and lungs are going to pick up speed
so this is what i can speculate might have been going on had we been able to do a spect scan on beck during this
so here i am taking care of beck at twenty one thousand feet and i felt what i was doing was completely trivial compared to what he had done for himself it just shows you what the power of the mind can do
he was critically ill there were other critically ill patients
get them off to kathmandu in a clinic before we even got back to base camp this is a scene at base camp
at one of the camps where some of the climbers were lost and we had a memorial service there
few days later these are serphas lighting juniper branches they believe juniper smoke is and the climbers
stood around on the high rocks and spoke of the climbers who were lost up near the summit turning to the mountain actually to talk to them directly
there were five climbers lost here this was scott fischer doug hansen
doug hansen and
and one more climber should have died that day but didn and that's beck weathers
he was able to survive because he was able to generate that incredible willpower he was able to use all the power of his mind to save himself
these are tibetan prayer flags these sherpas believe that if you write prayers on these flags
the message will be carried up to the gods
