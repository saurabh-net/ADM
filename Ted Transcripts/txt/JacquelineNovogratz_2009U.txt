and i had an experience that really deepened and elucidated for me the understanding that i have it was in kenya and i want to share it with you
i was with my friend susan meiselas the photographer in the mathare valley slums now mathare valley is one of the oldest slums in africa it's about three miles out of nairobi and it's a mile long and about two tenths of a mile wide
where over half a million people live crammed in these little tin shacks generation after generation renting them often eight or ten people to a room and it's known for prostitution violence
sewage and the garbage alongside the little homes but at the same time it was also impossible not to see the human vitality the aspiration and the ambition of the people who live there women washing their babies washing their clothes hanging them out to
i met this woman mama rose who has rented that little tin shack for thirty two years where she lives with her seven children four sleep in one twin bed and three sleep on the mud and linoleum floor
and i would see kids on the street corners and they'd say obama he 's our brother and i'd say well obama 's my brother so that makes you my brother too they would look quizzically and then be like high five
off by telling me her dream she said i had two my first dream was to be a doctor and the second was to marry a good man who would stay with me and my family because my mother was a single mom
and couldn't afford to pay for school fees so i had to give up the first dream and i focused on the second she got married when she was eighteen had a baby right away and when she turned twenty
found herself pregnant with a second child her mom died and her husband left her married another woman so she was again in
with no income no skill set no money and so she ultimately turned to prostitution it wasn't organized in the way we often think of it she would go into the city at night with about twenty girls
look for work and sometimes come back with a few shillings or sometimes with nothing she said you know the poverty wasn't so bad it was the humiliation and the embarrassment of it all in two thousand and one
her life changed she had a girlfriend who had heard about this organization jamii bora that would lend money to people no matter how poor you
as long as you provided a commensurate amount in savings and so she spent a year to save fifty dollars and started borrowing
and over time she was able to buy a sewing machine she started tailoring and that turned into what she does now
which is to go into the secondhand clothing markets and for about three dollars and twenty five cents she buys an old ball gown some of them might be ones you gave and
she repurposes them with frills and ribbons and makes these frothy confections that she sells to women for their daughter 's sweet sixteen or first holy communion
and i reflected as i was watching her sell the dresses and also the jewelery that she makes that now jane makes more than four dollars a day
and by many definitions she is no longer poor but she still lives in mathare valley and so she can't move out
she lives with all of that insecurity and in fact in january during the ethnic riots she was chased from her home and had to find a new shack in which she would live
go the long term with them they built a low cost housing development about an hour outside nairobi central and they designed it from the perspective of customers like jane herself
and in the next couple of weeks she's going to be among the first two hundred families to move into this development when i asked her if she feared anything or whether she would miss anything from
she said what would i fear that i haven't confronted already i'm hiv positive i've dealt with it all and she said what would i miss
you think i will miss the violence or the drugs the lack of privacy do you think i'll miss not knowing if my children are going to come home at the end of the day she said if you gave me ten minutes my bags would be packed i said well what about your dreams
i think about it i thought i wanted a husband but what i really wanted was a family that was loving and i fiercely love my children and they love me back
she said i thought that i wanted to be a doctor but what i really wanted to be was somebody who served and
and so i feel so blessed with everything that i have that two days a week i go and i counsel hiv patients and i say look at me
you are not dead you are still alive if you are still alive you have to serve and she said i 'm not a doctor who gives out pills but maybe me i give out something better because i give them hope
and in the middle of this economic crisis where so many of us are inclined to pull in with fear
i think we're well suited to take a cue from jane and reach out recognizing that being poor doesn't mean
i truly believe it's where dignity starts we owe it to the janes of the world and just as important we owe it to ourselves thank you
