i'll just take you to bangladesh for
that story we should ask ourselves the question why does poverty exist i mean there is plenty of knowledge and
so i want to throw a perspective that i have so that we can assess this project or any other project for that matter
to see whether it's contributing or contributing to poverty or trying to alleviate it rich countries have been sending aid
to poor countries for last sixty years and by and large this has failed and you can see this book
in my mind there is something to learn from the history of europe i mean even here
so my point is there's a lot of struggle has gone in europe where citizens were empowered by technologies and they demanded authorities from to come down from their high horses
and in the end there's better bargaining between the authorities and citizens and democracies capitalism everything else flourished
and so you can see the real process of and this is backed up by this five hundred page book that the authorities came down and citizens got
but if you look if you have that perspective then you can see what happened in the last sixty years aid actually did the opposite
it empowered authorities and as a result marginalized citizens the authorities did not have the reason
to make economic growth happen so that they could tax people and make more money for to run their business because they were getting it from abroad
and in fact if you see oil rich countries where citizens are not yet empowered the same thing goes nigeria saudi arabia all sorts of countries
because the aid and oil or mineral money acts the same way it empowers authorities without activating the citizens their hands legs brains what have you
and if you agree with that then i think the best way to improve these countries is to recognize that economic development is of the people by the people for the people
and that is the real network effect if citizens can network and make themselves more organized and productive so that their voices are heard so then things would improve
i can start my story of course how would you empower citizens there could be all sorts of technologies and one is cell phones
recently the economist recognized this but i stumbled upon the idea twelve years ago and that's what i've been working on
so twelve years ago i was trying to be an investment banker in new york we had quite a few our colleagues were connected by
and we got more productive because we didn't have to exchange floppy disks we could update each other more often
my family moved out of a urban place where we used to live to a remote rural area where
and one time my mother asked me to get some medicine for a younger sibling and i walked ten miles or so all morning
to get there to the medicine man and he wasn't there so i walked all afternoon back so i had another unproductive day so while i was sitting in a
tall building in new york i put those two experiences together side by side and basically concluded that connectivity is productivity whether it's in a modern office or an underdeveloped village
so naturally i the implication of that is that the telephone is a weapon against poverty and if that's the case then the question is how many telephones did we have at that time
and it turns out that there was one telephone in bangladesh for every five hundred people and all those phones were in the few urban places
the vast rural areas where one hundred million people lived there were no telephones so just imagine how many man months or man years are wasted just like
if you just multiply by one hundred million people let 's say losing one day a month whatever and you see a vast amount of resource wasted and after all poor countries
like rich countries one thing we've got equal is their days are same length twenty four hours so if you lose that precious resource where you are somewhat equal to the richer countries that's a huge waste
so i started looking for any evidence that does connectivity really increase productivity and
i couldn't find much really but i found this graph produced by the itu which is the international telecommunication union
based in geneva they show an interesting thing that you see the horizontal axis is where you place your country
so the united states or the uk would be here outside and so the impact of one new telephone which is on the vertical axis is very little
but if you come back to a poorer country where the gnp per capita is let 's say five hundred dollars or three hundred dollars then the impact is huge six thousand dollars
five thousand dollars the question was how much did it cost to install a new telephone in bangladesh it turns out two thousand dollars so if you spend two thousand dollars
and let 's say the telephone lasts ten years and if five thousand dollars every year so that's fifty thousand dollars so obviously this was a gadget to have
and of course if the cost of installing a telephone is going down because there's a digital revolution going on then it would be even more dramatic
and i knew a little economics by then it says adam smith taught us that specialization leads to productivity
but how would you specialize let 's say i'm a fisherman and a farmer and chris is a fisherman farmer both are generalists so
the point is that we could only only way we could depend on each other if we can connect with each other
and if we are neighbors i could just walk over to his house but then we are limiting our economic sphere to something very small area
but in order to expand that you need a river or you need a highway or you need telephone lines but in any event it's connectivity that leads to dependability and that leads to specialization that leads to productivity
so the question was i started looking at this issue and going back and forth between bangladesh and new york there were a lot of
reasons people told me why we don't have enough telephones and one of them is the lacking buying power poor people apparently don't have the power to buy but the point is if it's a production tool why do we have to worry about that
i mean in america people buy cars and they put very little money down they get a car and they go to work the work pays them a salary
the salary allows them to pay for the car over time the car pays for itself so if the telephone is a production tool then we don't quite have to worry about the purchasing power
and of course even if that's true then what about initial buying power so then the question is why can't we have some kind of shared
in the united states we have everybody needs a banking service but very few of us are trying to buy a bank
so it's a bank tends to serve a whole community so we could do that for telephones and also people told me that we have a lot of important primary needs to meet
food clothing shelter whatever but again it's very paternalistic you should be raising income and let people decide what they want to do with their money
but the real problem is the lack of other infrastructures see you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing for instance the internet was booming in the u s
because there were there were people had computers they had modems they had telephone lines so it's very easy to bring in a new idea like the internet
but that's what's lacking in a poor country so for example we didn't have ways to have credit checks few banks to collect bills et cetera but that's why i noticed grameen bank which is a bank for poor people
and anyway to cut the time short so i started i first went to them and said you know perhaps i could connect all your branches and make you more efficient
but you know they have after all evolved in a country without telephones so they are decentralized i mean of course there might be other good reasons but this was one of the reasons they had to be
and so they were not that interested to connect all their branches and then to be and rock the boat so i started focusing what is it that they really do
so what happens is that somebody borrows money from the bank she typically buys a cow the cow gives milk and she sells the milk to the villagers and pays off the loan
and this is a business for her but it's milk for everybody else and suddenly i realized that
because some way she could borrow two hundred dollars from the bank get a phone and have the phone for everybody and it's a business for her so i wrote to the bank and they thought for a while and they said
little crazy but logical if you think it can be done come and make it happen so i quit my job i went back to bangladesh i created a company in america called gonofone which in bengali means
and angel investors in america put in money into that i flew around the world after about a million i mean i got rejected from lots of places
because i was not only trying to go to a poor country i was trying to go to the poor of the poor country after about a million miles and a meaningful a substantial loss of hair i eventually put together a
provided the infrastructure to spread the service to make the story short here is the coverage of the country you can see it's pretty much covered
about that cow model i talked about there are about one hundred and fifteen thousand people
who are retailing telephone services in their neighborhoods and it's serving fifty two thousand villages which represent about eighty million people and these phones
are generating about one hundred million dollars for the company and two dollars profit per entrepreneur per day which is like seven hundred dollars per year and
of course it's very beneficial in lot of ways it increases income improves welfare
and the result is right now this company is the largest telephone company with three point five million subscribers one hundred and fifteen thousand of these phones i talked about that produces about a third of the traffic in the network
and two thousand and four the net profit after taxes very serious taxes was one hundred and twenty million dollars and the company contributed about one hundred and ninety million dollars to the government coffers
and again here are some of the lessons the government needs to provide economically viable services actually this is an instance where private companies can
provide that governments need to subsidize private companies this is what some people think and actually private companies help governments with taxes
poor people are recipients poor people are a resource services cost too much for the poor their involvement reduces the cost the poor are uneducated and cannot do much
very eager learners and very capable survivors i've been very surprised most of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day
poor countries need aid businesses this one company has raised the if the ideal figures
percent true this one company is raising the gnp of the country much more
the country receives and as i was trying to show you as far as i'm concerned aid does damages because it removes the government from its citizens
two villages where cow manure is producing biogas which is running these generators and each of these generators
selling electricity to twenty houses each it's just an experiment we don't know how far it will go but it's going on thank you
