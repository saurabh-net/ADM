to make a confession at the outset here a little over twenty years ago i did something that i regret something that i'm not
late nineteen eighties in a moment of youthful indiscretion i went to law school now
in america law is a professional degree you get your university degree then you go on to law school and when i got to law school
i didn't do very well to put it mildly i didn't do very well i in fact graduated in the part of my law school class that made the top ninety percent possible thank you i never
law a day in my life i pretty much wasn't allowed to
but today against my better judgement against the advice of my own wife i want to try to dust off some of those legal skills what's left of those legal skills
i don't want to tell you a story i want to make a case i want to make a hard headed evidence based dare i say lawyerly case for rethinking how we run our businesses
i give you a candle some thumbtacks and some matches and i say to you your job is to attach the candle to the wall so the wax
doesn't drip onto the table now what would you do now many people begin trying to thumbtack the candle to the wall doesn't work
and eventually after five or ten minutes most people figure out the solution which you can see here the key to to overcome what's called functional
this shows the power of incentives here 's what he did he gathered his participants and he said i 'm going to time you how quickly you can solve this problem
to one group he said i'm going to time you to establish norms averages for how long it typically takes someone to solve this sort of problem to the second group he offered rewards he said if you're in the top
you get twenty dollars now this is several years ago adjusted for inflation it's a decent sum of money for a few minutes of work it's a nice motivator question how much faster did this group solve the problem
answer it took them on average three and a half minutes longer
three and a half minutes longer now this makes no sense right i mean i'm an american i believe in free markets that's not how it's supposed to work right
if you want people to perform better you reward them right bonuses commissions their own reality show incentivize them that's how business
but that's not happening here you've got an incentive designed to sharpen thinking and accelerate creativity and it does just the opposite
it dulls thinking and blocks creativity and what's interesting about this experiment is that it's not an aberration this has been replicated over
and over and over again for nearly forty years these contingent motivators if you do this then you get that
work in some circumstances but for a lot of tasks they actually either don't work or often they do harm
this is one of the most robust findings in social science and also one of the most ignored
i spent the last couple of years looking at the science of human motivation particularly the dynamics of extrinsic motivators and intrinsic motivators
and i'm telling you it's not even close if you look at the science there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does and
here is that our business operating system think of the set of assumptions and protocols beneath our businesses how we motivate people how we apply our human resources
it's built entirely around these extrinsic motivators around carrots and sticks that's actually fine for many kinds of twentieth century tasks
but for twenty one st century tasks that mechanistic reward and punishment approach doesn't work often doesn't work and often does harm let me show you what
so glucksberg did another experiment similar to this where he presented the problem in a slightly different way like this up here
attach the candle to the wall so the wax doesn't drip onto the table same deal you we're timing for norms you what happened this time
this time the incentivized group kicked the other
why because when the tacks are out of the box it's pretty easy isn't it
if then rewards work really well for those sorts of tasks where there is a simple set of rules and a clear destination to go to
narrow focus where you just see the goal right there zoom straight ahead to it they work really well but for the real candle problem
you don't want to be looking like this the solution is not over here the solution is on the periphery you want to be looking around that reward actually narrows our focus and restricts our possibility let me tell you why this is so important
in western europe in many parts of asia in
north america in australia white collar workers are doing less of this kind of work and more of this kind of work that
rule based left brain work certain kinds of accounting certain kinds of financial analysis certain kinds of computer programing has become fairly easy to outsource fairly easy to automate
software can do it faster low cost providers around the world can do it cheaper so what really matters are the
more right brained creative conceptual kinds of abilities think about your own work think about your own work
are the problems that you face or even the problems we've been talking about here are those kinds of problems do they have a clear set of rules and a single solution
no the rules are mystifying the solution if it exists at all is surprising and not obvious
everybody in this room is dealing with their own version of the candle problem and for candle problems of
any kind in any field
those if then rewards the things around which we've built so many of our businesses
work now i mean it makes me crazy and this is not here 's the thing this is not a feeling
okay i'm a lawyer i don't believe in feelings this is not a philosophy i'm an american i don't believe in philosophy this is a
or as we say in my hometown of washington d c a true let me
give you an example of what i mean let me marshal the evidence here because i'm not telling you a story i'm making a case ladies and gentlemen of the jury some evidence dan ariely one of the great
them for performance three levels of rewards small reward medium reward large reward okay if you do really well you get the large reward on down what happened
as long as the task involved only mechanical skill bonuses worked as they would be expected the higher the pay the better the performance
but one the task called for even rudimentary cognitive skill a larger
then they said okay let 's see if there's any cultural bias here lets go to madurai india and test this standard of living is lower in madurai a reward that is modest in north american standards is more
there same deal a bunch of games three levels of rewards what happens the worst of all
in eight of the nine tasks we examined across three experiments higher incentives led to worse performance
no these are economists from mit from carnegie mellon from the university of chicago and do you know who sponsored this research the federal reserve
bank of the united states that's the american experience let 's go
training ground for great economic thinkers like george soros and friedrich hayek and mick jagger last month
just last month economists at lse looked at fifty one studies of pay for performance plans inside of companies here 's what the economists there said we find that financial incentives can result in a negative
impact on overall performance there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does
and what worries me as we stand here in the rubble of the economic collapse is that too many organizations are making their decisions their policies about talent and people
based on assumptions that are outdated unexamined and rooted more in folklore than in science
and if we really want to get out of this economic mess and if we really want high performance on those definitional tasks of the twenty one st century the solution is not
to do more of the wrong things to entice people with a sweeter carrot or threaten them with a sharper stick
we need a whole new approach and the good news about all of this is that the scientists who 've been studying motivation have given us this new approach
my mind that new operating system for our businesses revolves around three elements autonomy mastery and purpose
in the service of something larger than ourselves these are the building blocks of an entirely new operating system for our businesses i want to talk today only about autonomy
the twentieth century we came up with this idea of management management did not emanate from nature management is like it's not a tree it's a television set okay somebody invented
you don't see a lot of it but you see the first stirrings of something really interesting going on because what it means is paying people adequately and fairly absolutely
getting the issue of money off the table and then giving people lots of autonomy let me give you some examples how many of you have heard of the company
it looks like less than half
is an australian software company and they do something incredibly cool a few times a year they tell their engineers go for the next twenty four hours and work on anything you want
as long as it's not part of your regular job work on anything you want so that engineers use this time to come up with a cool patch for code come up with an elegant hack
then they present all of the stuff that they've developed to their teammates to the rest of the company in this wild and wooly all hands meeting
at the end of the day and then being australians everybody has a beer they call them fedex days why
you have to deliver something overnight it's pretty it's not bad it's a huge trademark violation but it's pretty clever
that one day of intense autonomy has produced a whole array of software
they have autonomy over their time their task their team their technique okay radical amounts of autonomy and at google as many of you know
about half of the new products in a typical year are birthed during that twenty percent time things like gmail orkut google news let me give you an even more radical example of it something called the results only work environment
they show up when they want they don't have to be in the office at a certain time or any time they just have to get their work done
how they do it when they do it where they do it is totally up to them meetings in these kinds of environments
are optional what happens almost across the board
autonomy mastery and purpose these are the building blocks of a new way of doing things now some of you might look at this and say hmm that sounds nice but it's utopian and i say i
few years later another encyclopedia got started different model right do it for fun no one gets paid a cent or a euro or
ten years ago you could not have found a single sober economist anywhere on planet earth who would have predicted the
this is the titanic battle between these two approaches this is the ali frazier of motivation right this is the thrilla in manila alright intrinsic motivators versus extrinsic motivators
autonomy mastery and purpose versus carrot and sticks and who wins intrinsic motivation autonomy mastery and purpose in a knockout let me wrap up
a mismatch between what science knows and what business does and here is what science knows
rewards those motivators we think are a natural part of business do work but only in a surprisingly narrow band of circumstances two
those if then rewards often destroy creativity three the secret to high performance isn't rewards and punishments
but that unseen intrinsic drive the drive to do things for their own sake the drive to do things cause they matter and here 's the best part
here 's the best part we already know this the science confirms what we know in our hearts so if we repair this mismatch between what science knows and what business does
and maybe maybe maybe we can change the world i rest
