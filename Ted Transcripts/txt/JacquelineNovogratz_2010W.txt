spending a lot of time traveling around the world these days talking to groups of students and professionals
and everywhere i 'm finding that i hear similar themes on the one hand people say the time for change is now
they want to be part of it
they talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning
i don 't want to disappoint my family or friends
i work in global poverty and they say i want to work in global poverty but what will it mean about my career will i be marginalized will i not make enough money will i never get married or have children and as a woman who didn 't get married until i was a lot older and i 'm glad i waited without a cost
these conversations really reflect what 's happening at the national and international level
our leaders and ourselves want everything but we don 't talk about the costs we don 't talk about the sacrifice
one of my favorite quotes from literature was written by tillie olsen the great american writer from the south
i 've been so privileged in my life to know extraordinary leaders who have chosen to live lives of immersion one woman i knew who was a fellow at a program that i ran at the rockefeller foundation was named ingrid washinawatok she was a leader of the menominee tribe a native american peoples
and when we would gather as fellows she would push us to think about how the elders in native american culture make decisions and she said they would literally visualize the faces of children for seven generations into the future looking at them from the earth
and they would look at them holding them as stewards for that future
ingrid understood that we are connected to each other not only as human beings but to every living thing on the planet
and tragically in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine when she was in colombia working with the u 'wa people focused on preserving their culture and language
she and two colleagues were abducted and tortured and killed by the farc
the farc and whenever we would gather the fellows after that we would leave a chair empty for her spirit and more than a decade later
they all say that they 're trying to integrate her wisdom and her spirit
and really build on the unfulfilled work of her life 's mission and when we think about legacy
and they focused and targeted the elites and the intellectuals the artists the dancers
and at the end of the war there were only thirty of these classical dancers still living and the women who i was so privileged to meet when there were three survivors
they said they would try so hard to remember the fragments
and she talked about the reunion of the thirty after the war and how extraordinary it was and these big tears fell down her face but she never lifted her hands to move them and the women decided that they would train not the next generation of girls because they had grown too old already but the next generation
and i sat there in the studio watching these women clapping their hands beautiful rhythms as these little fairy pixies were dancing around them wearing these beautiful silk colors and i
after all this atrocity this is how human beings really pray
because they 're focused on honoring what is most beautiful
are those things that we cannot measure
i also have been touched by the dark side of power and leadership
and i have learned that power particularly in its absolute form is an equal opportunity provider
she was one of the first three women parliamentarians in rwanda and her legacy should have been
this idea of empowering women
but agnes cared more about the trappings of power than she did principle at the end and though she had been part of building
a liberal party a political party that was focused on diversity and tolerance
about three months before the genocide she switched parties and joined the extremist party hutu power and she became the minister of justice under the genocide regime and was known for inciting men to kill faster and stop behaving like women she was convicted of category one crimes of genocide
and i would visit her in the prisons
sitting side by side knees touching
and i would have to admit to myself that monsters exist in all of us sadnesses secret shame
and to make us look at other beings human beings as lesser than ourselves
in the extreme to do terrible things
and so in a gathering where we 're focused on women
while it is so critical that we invest in our girls and we even the playing field and we find ways to honor them we have to remember
that the girls and the women are most isolated and violated and victimized and made invisible in those very societies where our men and our boys feel disempowered
well then it 's easy to understand how the greatest source of status can come from a uniform and a gun
sometimes very small investments can release enormous infinite potential that exists in all of us
alex in some ways said it best he said we used to feel like nobodies but now we feel like somebodies and i think we have it all wrong when we think that income is the link
and they wanted to celebrate what 's beautiful about kibera and mathare the photojournalists and the creatives the graffiti artists the teachers and the entrepreneurs
and they 're doing it and my hat 's off to you in kibera
we 've invested more than fifty million dollars in fifty companies and those companies have brought another two hundred million dollars into these forgotten markets
this year alone they 've delivered forty million services like maternal health care and housing emergency services solar energy so that people can have more dignity in solving their problems
patient capital is uncomfortable for people searching for simple solutions easy categories
because we don 't see profit as a blunt instrument but we find those entrepreneurs who put people and the planet before profit
and ultimately we want to be part of a movement
that is about measuring impact measuring what is most important to us and my dream is we 'll have a world one day where we don 't just honor those who take money and make more money from it but we find those individuals who take our resources and convert it into changing the world in the most positive
and it 's only when we honor them and celebrate them and give them status that the world will really change
one based on violence and the other on transcendence i happened to be in lahore pakistan on the day that two mosques were attacked by suicide bombers and the reason these mosques were attacked is because the people praying inside were from a particular sect of islam who fundamentalists don 't believe are fully muslim
and not only did those suicide bombers take a hundred lives
but they did more because they created more hatred more rage more fear and certainly despair
and he had a dream that he would build a housing community on this barren piece of land
using patient capital but he continued to pay a price he stood on moral ground and refused to pay bribes
it took almost two years just to register the land
but i saw how the level of moral standard can rise from one person 's action
today two thousand people live in three hundred houses in this beautiful community and there 's schools and clinics and shops
but there 's only one mosque
and we decided that we would elect the three most respected imams and those imams would take turns they would rotate who would say friday prayer but the whole community
all the different sects including shi 'a and sunni would sit together and pray
we need that kind of moral leadership and courage in our worlds
we face huge issues as a world the financial crisis
global warming and this growing sense of fear and otherness
a fear of each other distancing and blame or we can take the much more difficult path of transformation transcendence compassion and love but also accountability and justice
i had the great honor of working with the child psychologist dr robert coles who stood up for change during the civil rights movement in the united states and he tells this incredible story about working with a little six year old girl named ruby bridges the first child to desegregate schools in the south in this case new
and he said that every day this six year old dressed in her beautiful dress would walk with real grace through a phalanx of white people screaming angrily calling her a monster threatening to poison her
distorted faces and every day he would watch her and it looked like she was talking to the people
and finally he said ruby i see that
and he said well what are you praying
and she said i 'm praying father forgive them for they know not what they are doing
and he said to me at the end of his year jacqueline it was so humbling because i thought as a farmer and as an african i would understand how to transcend culture
but especially when i was talking to the african women i sometimes made these mistakes it was so hard for me to learn how to listen
and he said but right before the harvest it bends over with great gratitude and humility to touch the earth from where it came we need leaders
we ourselves need to lead from a place
that has the audacity to believe we can ourselves extend the fundamental assumption that all men are created equal to every man woman and child on this planet and we need to have the humility to recognize that we cannot do it alone
robert kennedy once said that few of us have the greatness to bend history itself
and it is in the total of all those acts that the history of this generation will be written
our lives are so short
and all we have is each other
so may each of you live lives of immersion
