talk my a new lecture just for ted and i'm going show you some illusions that we've created for ted and i'm going to try to relate this to happiness
i was thinking about with happiness is what gives happiness or happiness which i equate with joy in my particular area and i think there's something very fundamental and i was thinking about this
and it's in terms of both illusions and movies that we go see and jokes and magic shows is that
so what i'm going to try and do in my lecture is a go a little bit further and see
can violate your expectations in a pleasing way i mean sometimes expectations that are violated are not pleasant but i'm going to try to do it in a pleasant way in a very primal way so i can make the audience here happy
so i'm going to show you some ways that we can violate your expectations first of all i want to show you the particular illusion here
i want you first of all when it pops up on the screen to notice that the two holes are perpendicular to each other these are real objects
now i'm going to show you how it is done i've looped the film here so you can get a very interesting experience i want you to see
how this illusion is constructed and it's going to rotate so you see that it's inside out now watch as it rotates back how quickly your perception snaps
ok now watch it as it rotates back again and this is a very bright audience all right see if you can stop it from happening even though you know one hundred percent it's true that you
we're going to do it again no doubt about
see if you can stop it from happening it's difficult
and we can violate your
in a whole variety of ways about representation about shape about color and so forth and it's very primal and it's an interesting question to ponder why these things
we find these things joyful why would we find them joyful so here 's something that lionel did a while ago i like these sort of little things like this
ok we can violate your expectations about shape
we can violate your expectations on representation what an image represents
what do you see here
see dolphins ok those people who raised their hands afterwards the rest of the audience go talk to them all right actually this is the best example
of priming by experience that i know if you are a child under the age of ten who haven't been ruined yet
look at this image and see dolphins now some of you adults here are saying
dolphins what dolphins but in fact if you
figure ground in other words the dark areas here i forgot to ask for a pointer but if you reverse it you'll see a whole series of little dolphins by the way it's
something like this can be
because this is after all talk about design
this is done by saatchi and saatchi and they actually got away with this ad in australia so if you look at this ad for beer
all those people are in sort of provocative positions but they got it past and actually won the clio awards
so it is funny to do these things
this is the joke i did
when the the florida ballot was going around you know count the dots for gore count the dots for bush count them again
you can violate your expectations about experience here is
this is something we're building
for you know amusement parks and that kind of stuff
now let 's take a static image
can you see this do you see the middle section moving down and the outer sections moving up it's completely static
a static image how many people see it's completely static
right now when it's interesting that when we look at an image we see you know color depth texture
and you can look at this whole scene and analyze it you can see the woman is in closer than the wall and so forth but the whole thing is actually flat
and it was such a good trompe l 'oeil that people got irritated when they tried to talk to the woman and she wouldn't respond
now you can make design mistakes
like this building in new york so that when you
see it from this side it looks like the balconies tilt up and when you walk around to the other side it looks like the balconies
go down so there are cases where you have mistakes in design that incorporate illusions or you take this particular un retouched
now interestingly enough i get a lot of emails from people who say is there any perceptual difference between males and females
and i really say no i mean women can navigate through the world just as well as males can and why
however this is one illusion that women can consistently do better than males in matching which head because they rely on fashion cues they can match the
now getting to a part i want to show design in illusions i believe that the first example
of illusions being used purposely was by da vinci in this anamorphic image of
so that when you saw from one little angle
was like this and this little technique got popular in the sixteenth century and the seventeenth century to disguise hidden meanings where you could flip the image
like this but these are early incorporations of illusions brought to sort of hot point with hans holbein 's ambassadors and hans holbein worked for henry
this was hung on a wall where you could walk down from the stair and you can see this hidden skull
right now i'm going to show you some designers who
with illusions to give that element of surprise one of my favorites is scott kim i worked with scott to create some illusions for ted
i hope you will enjoy we have one here ted and happiness
so we scott created this wonderful
well there's analog and digital figure goes to ground
figure goes to ground and for the musicians
and of course since happiness we want joy to the world
now another great designer he 's very well known in japan
and he just builds some fantastic things this is simply amazing
this is a pile of junk
that when you view it from one particular angle
you see its reflection in the mirror as a perfect piano to violinist
to violinist this is really wild
this assemblage of forks knives and spoons and various cutlery welded together
a shadow of a motorcycle
you learn something in the sort of thing that i do which is there are people out there with a lot of time on their hands
ken knowlton does wonderful composite images
like creating jacques cousteau out of seashells un retouched seashells but just by rearranging them
he did einstein out of dice
because after all einstein said god does not play dice with the universe
out of un retouched keyboards will shortz crossword puzzle
john cederquist does these wonderful trompe
i'm going to skip ahead since i'm sort of running i want to show you quickly what i've created
some new type of illusions i've done something with taking the pixar type illusions so you see these kids the same size here
running down the hall the two table tops of the same size they're looking out two directions at once you have a larger piece fitting in with a smaller
and that's something for you to think about all right so you see larger pieces fitting in within smaller pieces here
you can see the two kids are looking out simultaneously out of two different directions at once
now can you believe these two table tops are the same size and shape
they are so if you measured them they would be
as i say those two figures are identical in size and shape interesting by doing
this in this sort of rendered fashion how much stronger these illusions are any case i hope this has brought you a little joy and happiness and if you're interested in seeing more cool effects
see me outside i'd be happy to show you
