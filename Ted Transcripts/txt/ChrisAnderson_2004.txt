i'd like to speak about technology trends which is something that
we also like a lot of companies create a product that's based on technology trends in this case ours is about ideas and information and if we're lucky some entertainment
but the concept 's quite the same and so we have to understand not only why tech 's important where it's going but also very importantly when the timing is everything
about e commerce or internet traffic or broadband adoption or internet advertising they were all right
they were all right wrong in time
that's why timing is everything
you've probably seen something like this before this is the classic gartner hype curve which talks about kind of the trajectory of a technology 's lifespan and just for fun we put a bunch of technologies on it to show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak
about to crash into the trough of disillusionment or rise back in the slope of enlightenment or et cetera and
this is one way to do technology forecasting get a sense of where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn we tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important we'll typically do it twice once we want to do it first
and that's one way that we try to time technology trends
i'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends that i call my grand unified theory of predicting the future but it's
a petite unified theory of predicting the future it's based on the presumption the observation even
for example a critical price line that changes both the technology and also changes its effect on the world it's an inflection point
and these are the inflection points that tell you what the next chapter in that technology 's life is going to be and maybe how you
is the critical price the first stage in a technology 's advance is that it'll fall below a critical price
will tend if it's successful to rise above a critical mass a penetration
and that's another important point
and then finally a lot of technologies commoditize towards the end of their life they become nearly free each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it it's an opportunity for the technology to change and even if you missed
you know the first boom of wi fi you know wi fi did the critical price it did the critical mass but hasn't done displacement yet
and hasn't done free yet there's still more opportunity in that i'd like to demonstrate what i mean by this by telling the story of the dvd which is a technology which has done all of these
and it started to take off and you can see that the units started to trend up the hidden inflection point it was taking off
the next thing it hit a year later
was critical mass in this case twenty percent is often a good proxy for critical mass in a household and what's interesting here is that something else took off along with it home theater units
suddenly you have a dvd in the house you've got high quality digital video you have a reason to have a big screen television you have a reason for dolby five point one surround sound
the next phase it hit was displacement you can see around two thousand and one it finally out sold the vcr
netflix was right the netflix model could capitalize on the dvd in a way that the video rental stores couldn 't among the dvd 's many assets is that it's very small you can stick it in the mailer
has several times in the past year been the number one dvd seller in america their average price for last year was forty eight dollars you're aware of the
as they get cheaper the premium brands the sonys and such are losing market share and the no names the apexes are gaining them they're being commodified and that's what happens when things go to zero
it's a tough market out there
now they've introduced these four ways of looking at technology these four stages of technology 's life i'd like to talk about some other technologies out there just technologies on our radar
and i'll use this lens these four as a way to kind of tell you where each one of those technologies is in its development they're not necessarily the top ten technologies out there they're just examples of technologies that are in each one
craig venter indeed comes today he may tell you something about this to sequence the human genome for forty million dollars by the end of this year that's as opposed to billions just a few years ago
you know our ability to
there will come a day when you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done very cheaply if you want to know
you can learn about your own mosaic
two thousand the price was ten thousand dollars or twenty seven dollars a day the generics came in first in brazil and elsewhere and the effect was just dramatic on
believe that they can treat three million people worldwide by two thousand and five two million in sub saharan africa and the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with
see the direction those lines are going you can see that at the twenty percent it's now taken seriously it's not just for the geeks any more
that is i imagine what people in redmond wake up in the middle of the night thinking about
another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars i don't know whether anybody has a prius two thousand and four but they're fantastic and if you look at the trends here by about two thousand and eight and i don't think this is a crazy forecast
be two percent of auto sales two percent isn't twenty percent but in the car business which is slow moving that's huge that's arrival
at two percent you start seeing them on the roads everywhere and what's interesting about the hybrids taking off is you've now introduced electric motors
to the automobile industry it's the first radical change in automobile technology in one hundred years and once you have electric motors you can do anything
you can change the structure of the car in any way you want you can have regenerative braking you can have drive by wire you can have replaceable body shapes it's a little thing that starts with a hybrid but it can lead to a whole new era of the car
voice over ip is something you may have heard something about again it's kind of coming out of nowhere it's a little hard to use right now there's a company created by that's critical mass
and the same thing 's happening on the carrier side you're looking at ip taking over from some of the traditional telecom
this is a tipping point here forgive me
look a little bit like that and finally
free free is really really interesting free is
that comes with digital because the reproduction costs are essentially free it comes with ip
and here you have just the number of songs can be stored on a hard drive you know
and you've seen the numbers i mean you know the music industry is imploding in front of our very eyes and hollywood's worried as well they're facing a force is draconian
and not necessarily the one that's going to get them out of this
has a regulated phone system and so did we
it was surprisingly non innovative moved very slowly but then
so much fiber out there you couldn't hold back and look how quickly the price fell it's seven cents a minute in many cases
and the consequence of cheap
free phone calling to india is
and any other country that can contact our markets and will work with our companies
