when i grew up and realized that science fiction was not a good source for superpowers i decided instead to embark on a journey of real science to find a more useful truth
i started my journey in california with a uc berkley thirty year longitudinal study that examined the photos of students in an old yearbook and tried to measure their success and well being throughout their life
by measuring their student smiles researchers were able to predict how fulfilling and long lasting a subject 's marriage will be how well she would score on standardized tests of well being and how inspiring she would be to others
in another yearbook i stumbled upon barry obama 's picture when i first saw his picture i thought that these superpowers came from his super collar
players who didn 't smile in their pictures lived an average of only seventy two point nine years where players with beaming smiles lived an average of almost eighty years
when they 're born babies continue to smile initially mostly in their sleep and even blind babies smile to the sound of the human voice
smiling is one of the most basic biologically uniform expressions of all humans
in studies conducted in papua new guinea paul ekman the world 's most renowned researcher on facial expressions found that even members of the fore tribe who were completely disconnected from western culture and also known for their unusual cannibalism rituals
attributed smiles to descriptions of situations the same way you and i would so from papua new guinea
to hollywood all the way to modern art in beijing we smile often and you smile to express joy and satisfaction
smile less than five in fact those with the most amazing superpowers are actually children who smile as many as four hundred times per day
you ask why because smiling is evolutionarily contagious and it suppresses the control we usually have on our facial muscles
mimicking a smile and experiencing it physically help us understand whether our smile is fake or real so we can understand the emotional state of the smiler
please don 't try this at home
the finding supported darwin 's theory by showing that facial feedback modifies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain in a way that helps us feel better when we smile
smiling stimulates our brain reward mechanism in a way that even chocolate a well regarded pleasure inducer cannot match british researchers found that one smile can generate the same level of brain stimulation as up to two thousand bars of chocolate
and think about it this way twenty five thousand times four hundred quite a few kids out there feel like mark zuckerberg every day
and unlike lots of chocolate lots of smiling can actually make you healthier smiling can help reduce the level of stress enhancing hormones
a recent study at penn state university found that when you smile you don 't only appear to be more likable and courteous but you actually appear to be more competent
so whenever you want to look great and competent reduce your stress or improve your marriage or feel as if you just had a whole stack of high quality chocolate without incurring the caloric cost or as if you found twenty five grand in a pocket of an old jacket you hadn 't worn for ages
