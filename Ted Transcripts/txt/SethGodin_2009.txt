unfortunately i couldn't go but it got me thinking about the fact that these guys at least most of them
know what it is that they do for a living what they do is they dress up as stuffed animals and entertain people at sporting events really cool stuff with
but not often and the other thing about these guys is they also
they do for a living they make balloon animals but what do we do for a living what exactly to the people watching this do
every day and i want to argue that what we do is we try to change everything
that we try to find a piece of the status quo something that bothers us something that needs to be improved something that is itching to be changed and we change it
and i've been studying it for a couple years and i want to share a couple stories with you today first about a guy named nathan winograd nathan was the number two person at the san francisco
and what you may not know about the history of the spca is it was founded to kill
cities gave them a charter to get rid of the stray animals on the street and destroy them in a typical year four million dogs and cats were killed most of them within twenty four hours of being scooped off of the street
nathan and his boss saw this and they could not tolerate it so they set out to make san francisco a no kill city
create an entire city where every dog and cat unless it was ill or dangerous would be adopted not killed and everyone said it was impossible
his boss went to the city council to get a change in the ordinance and people from spcas and humane shelters around the country flew to san francisco to testify against them to say it would hurt the movement and it was
they persisted and nathan went directly to the community he connected with people who cared about this nonprofessionals people with passion
and within just a couple years san francisco became the first no kill city
running no deficit completely supported by the community nathan left and went to tompkins county new york a place as different from san francisco as you can be and still be in the united states
and he did it again he went from being a glorified dog catcher to completely transforming the community and then he went to north carolina and did it again
and he went to reno and he did it again and when i think about what nathan did and when i think about what people here do i think about
there is a bunch of reasons for that and stories about it but one reason is because it indicates a change from before to after it is a moment in time
and i want to argue that we are living through and are right at the key moment of a change in the way ideas are created and spread and
we started with the factory idea that you could change the whole world if you had an efficient factory that could churn out change we then went to the tv idea that said if you had a big enough mouthpiece if you could get on tv enough times if you could buy enough ads you could win
it enables him to hire men who used to get paid fifty cents a day and pay them five dollars a day because he 's got an efficient enough factory well with that sort of advantage
you can churn out a lot of cars you can make a lot of change you can get roads built you can change the fabric of an entire country that the essence of what you're doing is you need ever cheaper labor
and ever faster machines and the problem we've run into is we're running out of both ever cheaper labor and ever faster machines
we shift gears for a minute and say i know television advertising push push take a good idea and push it on the world
i have a better mousetrap and if i can just get enough money to tell enough people i'll sell enough and you can build an entire industry on that
one thing instead of the
this model requires you to act like the king like the person in the front of the room throwing things to the peons in the back
you are in charge and you're going to tell people what to do next the quick little diagram of it is you're up here and you are pushing it out to the world this method mass marketing requires
what we've done as spammers is tried to hypnotize everyone into buying our idea hypnotize everyone into donating to our cause
but there is good news around the corner really good news
i call it the idea
what tribes are is a very simple concept that goes back
fifty thousand years it's about leading and connecting people and ideas
and it's something that people have wanted forever lots of people are used to having a spiritual tribe or a church tribe having a work tribe
having a community tribe but now thanks to the internet thanks to the explosion of mass media
tribes are everywhere the internet was
got the organized armies over here you've got the disorganized rebels over here you've got people in white hats making food and people in white hats sailing boats the point is that you can find ukrainian folk dancers and connect with them
it turns out this is a legitimate non photoshopped photo people i know who are firemen told me that this is not uncommon and that what firemen do to train sometimes
is they take a house that is going to be torn down and they burn it down instead and practice putting it out but they always stop and take a picture
you know the pirate tribe is a fascinating one they've got their own flag they've got the eyepatches you can tell when you're running into someone in a tribe and it turns out
that it's tribes not money not factories that can change our world that can change politics that can align large numbers of people not because you force them
to do something against their will but because they wanted to connect that what we do for a living now all of us i think
is find something worth changing and then assemble
tribes that assemble tribes that spread the idea and spread the idea and it becomes something far bigger than ourselves it becomes a movement
so when al gore set out to change the world again he didn't do it by himself and he didn't do it by buying a lot of ads
he did it by creating a movement thousands of people around the country who could give his presentation for him because he can't be
in one hundred or two hundred or five hundred cities in each night
you don't need everyone what kevin kelley has taught us is you just need i don't know a thousand true fans a thousand people who care enough that they will get you the next
round and the next round and the next round and that means that the idea you create the product you create the movement you create isn't for everyone it's not a mass thing that's not what this is about what it's about instead is finding the true believers
it's easy to look at what i've said so far and say wait a minute i don't have what it takes to be that kind of leader so here are two leaders they don't have a lot in common
about the same age but that's about it
what they did though is each in their own way created a different way
of navigating your way through technology so some people will go out and get people to be on one team and some people will get people to be on the other team
it also informs the decisions you make when you make products or services you know this is one of my favorite devices but what a shame that it's not organized
to help authors create movements what would happen if when you're using your kindle you could see the comments and quotes and notes
from all the other people reading the same book as you in that moment or from your book group or from your friends or from the circle you want what would happen
if authors or people with ideas could use version two which comes out on monday and use it to organize people who want to talk about something
now there is a million things i could share with you about the mechanics here but let me just try a couple the beatles did not invent teenagers they merely decided to lead them
that most movements most leadership that we're doing is about finding a group that's disconnected but already has a yearning not persuading people to want something they don't have yet
the idea of caring about this issue but she helped organize people and helped turn it into a movement
did not invent the disaffected middle and lower class of venezuela he merely led them bob marley did not invent rastafarians he just stepped up and said follow me derek sivers
all these people have in common is that they are heretics that heretics look at the status quo and say this will not stand
i can't abide this status quo i am willing to stand up and be counted and move things forward i see what the status quo is i don't like it
that instead of looking at all the little rules and following each one of them that instead of being
what i call a sheepwalker somebody who 's half asleep following instructions keeping their head down fitting in every once in a while someone stands up and says not me
says this one is important we need to organize around it and not everyone
but you don't need everyone you just need a few people
who will look at the rules
realize they make no sense and realize how much they want to be connected so tony shea does not run a shoe store
zappos isn't a shoe store zappos is the one the only the best there ever was place for people who are
to find each other to talk about their passion to connect with people who care more about customer service than making
what it requires as geraldine carter has discovered is to be able to say i can't do this by myself but if i can get other people to join my climb and ride
then together we can get something that we all want we're just waiting for someone to lead us michelle kaufman
has pioneered new ways of thinking about environmental architecture she doesn't do it by quietly building one house at a time
she does it by telling a story to people who want to hear it by connecting a tribe of people who are desperate to be connected to each other by leading a movement
making change and around and around and around it goes so three questions i'd offer you the first one is who exactly are you upsetting because if you're not upsetting anyone you're not changing the status quo
the second question is who are you connecting because for a lot of people that's what they're in it for the connections that are being made one to the other and the third one is who are you leading
because focusing on that part of it not the mechanics of what you're building but the who and the leading part
where change comes so blake at tom 's shoes had a very simple idea what would happen
if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes i gave exactly the same pair to someone who doesn't even own a pair of shoes
this is not the story of how you get shelf space at neiman marcus it's a story of a product that tells a story
and as you walk around with this remarkable pair of shoes and someone says what are those you get to tell the story on blake 's behalf on behalf of the people who got the shoes
and suddenly it's not one pair of shoes or one hundred pairs of shoes it's tens of thousands of pairs of shoes my friend red maxwell has spent the last ten years
need the connection they need the leadership it makes a difference you don't need permission from people to lead them but in case you do
here it is they're waiting we're waiting for you to show us where to go next
so here is what leaders have in common the first thing is they challenge the status quo they challenge what's currently there the second thing is they build a culture
a secret language a seven second handshake a way of knowing that you're in or out they have curiosity curiosity about people in the tribe curiosity about outsiders they're asking questions they connect people to one another do you know what people want more than anything
they want to be missed
they want to be missed the day they don't show up they want to be missed when they're gone and tribe leaders can do that it's fascinating because
all tribe leaders have charisma but you don't need charisma to become a leader being a leader gives you charisma if you look and study the leaders who have succeeded that's where charisma comes from
from the leading finally they commit they commit to the cause they commit to the tribe they commit to the people who are there
so i'd like you to do something for me and i hope you'll think about it before you reject it out of hand what i want you to do only takes twenty four hours is create a movement
something that matters start do it we need it thank you very much
