it 's shot on green screen yet this is the kind of movie that i wanted to make ever since i was a kid really back when i was reading some comic books and dreaming about what the future might be
when american producers see my film they think that i had
twenty three million but in fact i had ten percent of that budget i did mars et avril for only two point three million so you might wonder what 's the deal here how did i do this
the second aspect is love i got
in my early twenty s i did some graphic novels but they weren 't your usual graphic novels they were books telling a science fiction story through images and text
and most of the actors who are now starring in the movie adaptation they were already involved in these books portraying characters into a sort of experimental theatrical simplistic way
and one of these actors is the great stage director and actor robert lepage and i just love this guy i 've been in love with this guy since i was a kid his career i admire a lot and i wanted this guy to be involved in my crazy project and he was
kind enough to lend his image to the character of eugene spaak who is a
and to write direct and produce the film myself
and robert is actually the very first example of how constraints can boost creativity
because this guy is the busiest man on the planet i mean his agenda is booked until two thousand and forty two and he 's really hard to get and i wanted him to be in the movie to reprise his role in the movie
but the thing is had i waited for him until two thousand and forty two my film wouldn 't be a futuristic film anymore so i just couldn 't do that right but that 's kind of a big problem how do you get somebody who is too busy to star in a movie
well i said as a joke in a production meeting and this is a true story by the way i said why don 't we turn this guy into a hologram
because you know he is everywhere and nowhere on the planet at the same time and he 's an illuminated being in my mind and he 's in between reality and virtual reality so it would make perfect sense to turn this guy into a hologram
everybody around the table laughed but the joke was kind of a good solution so that 's what we ended up doing
here 's how we did it we shot robert with six cameras he was dressed in green and he was like in a green aquarium each camera was covering sixty degrees of his head so that in post production we could use pretty much any angle we needed and we shot only his head
six months later there was a guy on set a mime portraying the body the vehicle for the head
and he was wearing a green hood
so that we could erase the green hood in postproduction and replace it with robert lepage 's head so he became like a renaissance man and here 's what it looks like in the movie
and they carry a nice story with them actually i knew
but my problem was i didn 't have the money to pay for them i couldn 't afford them so that 's kind of a big problem too how do you get something that you can 't afford
and you know i woke up one morning with a pretty good idea i said what if i have somebody else pay for them
and i thought of cirque du soleil in montreal because
who better to understand the kind of crazy poetry that i wanted to put on screen so i found my way to guy laliberte cirque du soleil 's ceo and i presented my crazy idea to him with sketches like this and visual references and something
pretty amazing happened guy was interested by this idea not because i was asking for his money but because i came to him with a good idea
and the artist dominique engel brilliant guy he was happy too because he had a dream project to work on for a year and obviously i was happy because i got the instruments in my film for free which was kind of what i tried to do
so here they are and
my last example of how constraints can boost creativity comes from
the green because this is a weird color a crazy color and you need to replace the green screens eventually and you must figure that out sooner rather than later and i had again pretty much ideas in my mind as to what the world would be but
and this guy is another guy i admire a lot and i wanted him to be involved in the movie as a production designer but people told me you know martin it 's impossible the guy is too busy and he will say no well i said you know what instead of
mimicking his style i might as well call the real guy and ask him and i sent him my books and he answered that he was interested in working on the film with me because he could be a big fish in a small aquarium in other words there was space for him to dream with me
so here i was with one of my childhood heroes drawing every single frame that 's in the film
to turn that into montreal in the future
and it was an amazing collaboration to work with this great artist whom i admire but then you know eventually you have to turn all these drawings into reality
so again my solution was to aim for the best possible artist that i could think of and there 's this guy in montreal another quebecois called carlos monzon and he 's a very good vfx artist this guy had been
instead of working on the next spielberg movie he accepted to work on mine why because i offered him a space to dream so if you don 't have
sixty artists to work full time for six months to do this crazy film
so i want to tell you that if you have some crazy ideas in your mind and that people tell you that it 's impossible to make well that 's an even better reason to want to do it because people have a tendency to see the problems rather than the final result
who knows you might even end up going
