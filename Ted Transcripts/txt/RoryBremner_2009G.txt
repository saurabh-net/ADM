thank you for sharing that's really interesting the
thank you for inviting us one
on in the ted week is that gradually as the days go by all the other speakers cover most of what you were going to say
so this morning i thought oh well i'll just do a card trick that one 's gone as well

decoding machine who will start me with one thousand dollars anyone
thank you bruno 's face just then he said no don't go through this don 't please don 't don't go through this don't do it i'm worried when i
got the invitation they said somewhere in the thing they said fifteen minutes to change the world your moment onstage fifteen minutes to change the world i don't know about you it takes me fifteen minutes to change a plug
seen that wonderful demonstration of the wireless electric fantastic you know it inspires us three hundred years ago he'd have been burnt at the
for that and now it's an idea it's
a whole new experience don't you think i mean he must walk in and they will say
how can your coffee be true
and they will say would you mind if i serve the next customer and elaine morgan yesterday wasn't she wonderful fantastic really good
talk about the aquatic ape and the link of course the link between darwinism and the fact that we are all
not hirsute and we can swim rather well and she said you know she's ninety she's running out of time she said and she's desperate to find more evidence for the link and i think i 'm sitting next to lewis pugh
this man has swum around the north pole what more evidence do you want
global problems require scottish solutions
the problem i have is because gordon brown he comes onstage and he looks for all the world like a man who 's just taken the head off a bear suit
can i tell you what happened in the woods back there uh no
sorry i've only got eighteen minutes eighteen minutes to talk about saving the world saving the planet global institutions
our work on climate change i've only got eighteen minutes unfortunately i'm not able to tell you about all the wonderful things we're doing to promote the climate change agenda in great britain like the third runway we're planning at heathrow airport the
british jobs for scottish people
although to be honest when i was at number eleven that was never going to be a problem i just
my wife with a wonderful smile that reminds me i must post that i just
i wrote to him just before i left office i said can i rely on your support for the next month and he wrote back he said
another thing gordon could have mentioned in his speech to the mansion house in two thousand and two that was to the building the people weren't listening but
the people when talking about the finance industry he said what you as the city of london have done for financial services we as a government hope to do for the economy as a whole
is the first time that i can remember where if you get a letter from the bank manager about a loan you don't know if you're borrowing money from him or if he 's
money from you am i right
these extraordinary things icelandic internet accounts did anyone here have an icelandic internet account why would you do that why would it's like one step up from replying to one of those emails from nigeria
asking for your bank details and you know iceland it was never going to cut it it didn't have that kind of
it have it has fish that's all that's why the prime minister went on television he said this has left us all with a very big haddock
very very difficult luckily somebody like george bush was really helpful he summed it up really at a dinner he was speaking at a dinner he said wall street got and now it's
is donald rumsfeld who said there are the known knowns the things we know we know
and then you got the known unknowns the things we know we don't know
and then you got the unknown unknowns those are the things we don't know we don't know and being
i first heard that i thought what a load of cock and then
now well actually that's what this is about this whole
they didn't know what they were doing in two thousand and six the head of the american mortgage bankers association said quote
as we can clearly see no seismic occurrence is about to overwhelm the u s economy now there is a man on top of his job
have a new man america has now elected its first openly black president
you see a lot of the people that i most admire either great artists great designers great thinkers they're left handed and somebody said to me last night you know being left handed you have to learn to write without smudging the ink
sorry about that i'm right handed but i seem to have smudged that ink as well
but you know he 's gone now he 's gone that's eight years of american history eight minutes of my act just gone like that you know it's the end of an error i happen to believe it was a
they said there was no link between iraq and al qaeda there is now message for the suicide
those people who 've blown themselves up
now he 's gone and it's great to see one of the
the worst speech makers in american history now given way to one of the greatest in obama you were there maybe on the night of his victory and he spoke to the crowd in chicago he said
if there is anyone out there who still doubts
not so easy is it
about cicero who said people would listen to a speech they said great speech and then they'd listen to demosthenes and they'd say let 's march and
we all want to believe in president obama it's rather like that line in the film as good as it gets do you remember that film with helen hunt and jack nicholson and helen hunt says to jack nicholson what do you see in me and jack nicholson just says you make me want to be a better man
you want a leader that inspires and challenges and makes you want to be a better citizen right but at the moment it's a cicero thing we like what barack obama says but we don't do anything about it so he comes over to this country and he says big
a nu ca ler sorry what a thank you
but he says we want a nuclear free world and that day north korea that very day north korea is just seeing if it can just get one over japan and land it before so where do we look for inspiration
i believe it was president dwight d eisenhower who said
was diana ross who said
reach out and touch somebody 's
this world a better place if you can i just think that's important i really do and i was him in
we have prince charles and the environment is so important all we can do my wife gets fed up with me constantly trying to push emissions up her agenda
we have mandela to inspire mandela the great man mandela he 's been honored with a statue now the previous highest honor he had in britain was a visit from the team from ground force a gardening program
