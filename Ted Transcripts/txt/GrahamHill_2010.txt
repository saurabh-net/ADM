question knowing what i know why am i not a vegetarian
after all i'm one of the green guys i grew up with hippie parents in a log cabin i started a site called treehugger
cruelty i knew that the ten billion animals we raise each year for meat are raised in factory farm conditions that we hypocritically wouldn't even consider for our own cats dogs and other pets
causes more emissions than all of transportation combined cars trains planes buses boats all of it
and beef production uses one hundred times the water that most vegetables do
we as a society are eating twice as much meat as we
so why was i stalling
i realized that what i was being pitched was a binary solution
it was either you're a meat eater or you're a vegetarian
and i guess i just wasn't quite ready imagine your last hamburger
so my common sense my good intentions so i wondered
i thought about it and i came up with one
the name says it all
a face monday through friday on the weekend your choice
if you want to take it to the next level remember the major culprits in terms of environmental damage
and health are red and processed meats so you want to swap those out with some good sustainably harvested fish
it's structured so it ends up being simple to remember and it's okay to break it here and there
after all cutting five days a week is cutting seventy percent of your meat intake
the program has been great weekday veg my footprint 's smaller lessening pollution
i feel better about the animals i'm even saving money
best of all i'm healthier i know that i'm going to live longer a little weight
so please ask yourselves for your health
what's stopping you from giving weekday veg a shot
if all of us ate half as much meat
