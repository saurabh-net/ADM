one of my favorite cartoon characters is snoopy i love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of life
so when i thought about compassion my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips where he 's lying there
and he says i really understand and i really appreciate how one should love one 's neighbor as one love 's oneself
is the people next door i can't stand them this in a way is one of the challenges of how to
a really good idea we all i think believe in compassion if you look at all the world religions all the main world religions
within them some teaching concerning compassion so in judaism we have from our torah that you should love you neighbor as you love yourself
and within jewish teachings the rabbinic teachings we have hillel who taught that you shouldn 't do to others what you don't like being done to yourself
and all the main religions have similar teachings and again within judaism we have
teaching about god who is called the compassionate one ha rachaman after all how could the world exist without god being compassionate
and we as taught within the torah that we are made in the image of god so we too have to be compassionate
but what does it mean how does it impact on our everyday life sometimes of course being compassionate can produce feelings within us that are very difficult to control
i know there are many times when i've gone and conducted a funeral or when i have been sitting with the bereaved or with people who are dying
and i am overwhelmed by the sadness by the
difficulty the challenge that is there for the family for the person and i'm touched so that tears come to my eyes
and yet if i just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings i wouldn't be doing my job
because i have to actually be there for them and make sure that rituals happen that practicalities are seen to
and yet on the other hand if i didn't feel this compassion then i feel that it would be time for me to hang up my robe and give up being
and these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world who can not be touched by compassion when we see the terrible war
some people who say well you know there's just so much out there i can't do anything i not going to even begin to try
and there are some charity workers who call this compassion fatigue there are
who feel they can't confront compassion anymore and so they turn off the television and don't
in judaism though we tend to always say
has to be a middle way you have to of course be aware of the needs of others
of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tick
and of course you can't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more and there's a lovely rabbinic interpretation of the beginnings of creation which says that when god created the world
god thought that it would be best to create the world only with the divine attribute of justice thought
in fact if the world was just filled with compassion there would be anarchy and chaos there has to be limits to all things
the rabbis describe this as being like a king who has a beautiful fragile glass
and so god put both these possibilities into the world
there is something more though that has to be
like snoopy we can't just lie there and think great thoughts about our neighbors we actually have to do something about
and so there is also within judaism this notion of love and kindness that becomes very important
all these three things then have to be melded together the idea of justice
which gives boundaries to our lives and gives us a feeling of what's right about life what's right about living what should we be doing social justice
has to be a willingness to do good deeds but not of course at the expense of our own sanity
you know there's no way that you can do anything for anyone if you overdo things and balancing them all in the middle
is this notion of compassion which has to be there if you like at our very roots
this idea of compassion comes to us because we're made in the image of god
who is ultimately the compassionate one what does this compassion entail it entails understanding the pain of the
but even more than that it means understanding
one 's connection to the whole of creation
that understanding that one is part of that creation that there is a unity that underlies
all that we see all that we hear all that we feel
i call that unity god
and that that unity is something that connects all of creation and of course in the modern world with the environmental movement we're becoming even more aware
the connectivity of things that something i do here actually does matter in africa that if i use too much of my carbon allowance it seems to be that we are causing
a great lack of rain in central and eastern africa
so there is a connectivity and i have to understand that as part of part of the creation as part of me being made in the image of god and i have to understand
that my needs sometimes have to be sublimated to other needs this eighteen minutes business
i find quite fascinating because in judaism the word the number eighteen in hebrew letters stands for life the word life
so in a sense the eighteen minutes is challenging me to say
is what's important in terms of compassion but something else as well actually eighteen minutes is important because at passover when we have to eat
what is the difference between dough that is made into bread and dough that is made into unleavened bread matzah and they say it's eighteen minutes
should revolve round us so we try and get rid of those and
try to get rid of the habits the emotions the ideas that enslave us that make
is a basis for having compassion for understanding our place in the world
now there is in judaism a gorgeous story of a rich man who sat in synagogue one day
many people do he was dozing off during the sermon and as he was dozing off they were reading from the book of leviticus in the torah
which they used to place into a special table in the temple in jerusalem
the man was asleep but he heard the words bread temple god and and he
and after the sabbath he made twelve loaves of bread
torah then he went home the cleaner came into the synagogue
such trouble i've got children to feed my wife 's ill i've got no money what can i do my
next week with raisins this went on for years every week the man would bring bread
and saw what was going on and he called the two of them to his office and he said you know this is what's happening and the rich man
of course what you are doing he said to the rich man is answering god 's plea that we should be compassionate
and god he said to the poor man is answering your plea that people should be compassionate and
he looked at the rich man he held the rich man 's hands and said don 't you understand he said these are the hands of god
so that is the way
understanding that there is a connectivity that there is a unity in this world that i want to try and
that unity and that i can try and do that by understanding i hope trying to understand something of the pain of
that i have to understand that there are limits to my energy to the giving i can give i have to reevaluate them try and
separate out the material things and my emotions that may be enslaving me
so that i can see the world clearly and then i have to try to see
in what ways i can make these the hands of god and so try to bring compassion to life
