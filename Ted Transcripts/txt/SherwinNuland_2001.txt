i'd like to do pretty much what i did the first time which is to choose a light hearted theme
last time i talked about death and dying
this time i'm going to talk about mental illness
but it has to be technological so i'll talk about electroshock therapy
you know ever since man had any notion that some of his other people his colleagues could be different could be strange could be severely depressed or what we now recognize as schizophrenia
he was certain that this kind of illness had to come from evil spirits getting into the body so the way of treating
these diseases in early times was to in some way or other exorcise those evil spirits and this is still going on as you know
that would literally shake the bad spirits out so they found certain plants that could cause convulsions and the herbals the botanical books of
up to the late middle ages the renaissance are filled with prescriptions for causing convulsions to shake the evil spirits out
finally in about the sixteenth century a physician whose name was theophrastus bombastus auricularis von hohenheim called paracelsus a name probably familiar to some people here
good old paracelsus found that he could predict the degree of convulsion by using a measured amount of camphor
to produce the convulsion can you imagine going to your closet pulling out a mothball and chewing on it if you're feeling depressed it's better than prozac but i wouldn't recommend
well along comes benjamin franklin and he comes close to convulsing himself with a bolt of electricity off the end of his kite and so people begin thinking in terms of electricity to produce convulsions and then we fast forward
that if they had an epileptic a series of epileptic fits a lot of them in a row the depression would very frequently lift not only would it lift but it might never return
so they got very interested in producing convulsions measured types of convulsions and they thought well we've got electricity we'll plug somebody into the wall
that always makes hair stand up and people shake a lot so they tried it on a few pigs and none of the pigs were killed
so they went to the police and they said we know that at the rome railroad station there are all these lost souls wandering around muttering gibberish can you bring one of them to us
someone who is as the italians say cagutis so they found this cagutis guy a thirty nine year old man who was really hopelessly schizophrenic who was known had been known for months
to be literally defecating on himself talking nothing that made any sense and they brought him into the hospital
so these three psychiatrists after about two or three weeks of observation laid him down on a table connected his temples to a very small source of current they thought well
try fifty five volts two tenths of a second that's not going to do anything terrible to him so they did that well i
the following from a firsthand observer who told me this about thirty five years ago when i was thinking about these things for some research project of mine
he said this fellow remember he wasn't even put to sleep after this major grand mal convulsion sat right up looked at these three fellas and said what the fuck are you assholes trying to do
i could only say that in
well they were happy as could be because he hadn't said a rational word in the weeks of observation
so they plugged him in again and this time they used one hundred and ten volts for half a second and to their amazement after it was over he began speaking like he was perfectly well
but they wrote a paper about this and everybody in the western world began using electricity
to convulse people who were either schizophrenic or severely depressed it didn't work very well on the schizophrenics but it was pretty clear in the thirties and by the middle of the forties
they would anesthetize people convulse them but the real difficulty was that there was no way to paralyze muscles so people would have a real grand mal seizure
bones were broken especially in old fragile people you couldn't use it and then in the nineteen fifties late nineteen fifties the so called muscle relaxants were developed by pharmacologists
and it got so that you could induce a complete convulsion an electroencephalographic convulsion you could see it on the brain waves
without causing any convulsion in the body except a little bit of twitching of the toes so again it was very very popular and very very useful
well you know in the middle sixties the first antidepressants came out tofranil was the first
in the late seventies early eighties there were others and they were very effective and patients rights groups seemed to get very upset about the kinds of things
that they would witness and so the whole idea of electroconvulsive electroshock therapy
probably about ten percent of the people severe depressives do not respond regardless of what is done for
now why am i telling you this story
i'm telling you this story because actually ever since richard called me and asked me to talk about as he asked all of his speakers to talk about something
that would be new to this audience that we had never talked about never written about i've been planning this moment
reason really is that i am a man who almost thirty years ago had his life saved by
long courses of electroshock therapy and let me tell you this story
i was in the nineteen sixties in a marriage to use the word bad would be perhaps the understatement of the year it was dreadful
there are i'm sure enough divorced people in this room to know about the hostility the anger who knows what being someone who had
a very difficult childhood a very difficult adolescence it had to do with not quite poverty but close it had to do with being brought up in a family where no one spoke
things got worse as we really began to hate each other i became progressively depressed over a period of a couple of years trying to save this marriage which was inevitably not to be
my major surgical cases i was scheduling them for twelve one o'clock in the afternoon because i couldn't get out of bed before about eleven o 'clock and anybody who 's been depressed here knows what that's like
i couldn't even pull the covers off myself well you're in the university medical center where everybody knows everybody and it's perfectly clear to my colleagues so my referrals began to decrease as my referrals began
to decrease i clearly became increasingly depressed until i thought my god i can't work anymore and in fact it didn't make any difference because i didn't have any patients anymore so
i had myself admitted to the acute care psychiatric unit of our university hospital
and my colleagues who had known me since medical school in that place said don 't worry chap six weeks you're back in the operating room everything 's going to be great well you know what bovine
proved to be a lot of bovine
i know some people who got tenure in that place with lies like that
i was one of their failures but it wasn't that simple because by the time i got out of that unit i was not functional at all
i could hardly see five feet in front of myself i shuffled when i walked i was bowed over i rarely bathed i sometimes didn't shave it was dreadful
and it was clear not to me because nothing was clear to me at that time anymore that i would need long term hospitalization
in that awful place called a mental hospital so i was admitted
and they tried everything they had they tried the usual psychotherapy they tried every medication available in those days and they did have tofranil and other things mellaril who knows what nothing happened except that i got jaundiced from one of these things
i was well known in connecticut they decided they had better have a meeting of the senior staff all the senior staff got together and i later found out
they put all their heads together
and they decided that there was nothing that could be done for this surgeon who had essentially separated himself from the world who by that time
had become so overwhelmed not just with depression and feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy but with obsessional thinking
all kinds of ritualistic observances just awful awful stuff remember when you were a kid and you had to step on every line well i was a grown man who had all of these rituals
and it got so there was a throbbing there was a ferocious fear in my head you've seen this painting by edvard munch the scream the
every moment was a scream it was impossible so they decided there was no therapy there was no treatment but there was one
you can imagine what it was it was pre frontal
so they decided i didn't know this again i found this out later that the only thing that could be done was for this forty three year old man to have a pre frontal
well as in all hospitals there was a resident assigned to my case he was twenty seven years old and he would meet with me two or three times a week
really extraordinary future and he dug in his heels and said no i know this man better than any of you i have met with him over and over again you've just seen him from time to time you've read reports and so forth
i really honestly believe that the basic problem here is pure depression and all of the obsessional thinking comes out of it and you know of course what 'll happen if you do a pre frontal lobotomy any of the results along the spectrum
from pretty bad to terrible terrible terrible is going to happen if he does the best he can he will have no further obsessions probably no depression
will be dulled he will never go back to surgery he will never be the loving father that he was to his two children his life will be changed if he has the usual result
up like one flew over the cuckoo 's nest and you know about that just essentially in a stupor the rest of his life well they just thought
so we'll lose a little time big deal it doesn't make any difference so they gave the course of ten and the first the usual course incidentally was six to eight and still is six to eight
plugged me into the wires put me to sleep gave me the muscle relaxant six didn't work seven didn't work eight didn't work at nine i noticed
and they agreed to do another ten again not a single one of them i think there are about seven or eight of them thought this would do any good they thought this was a temporary change but lo and behold
i had the sense i really had the sense that i could overcome this that i was now strong enough that by an act of will i could blow the obsessional thinking away i could blow the depression away
but i need a formula i need some thing to say to myself when i begin thinking obsessionally obsessively well
the gilbert and sullivan fans in this room will remember ruddy gore and they will remember mad margaret and they will remember that she was married
to a fellow named sir despard murgatroyd and she used to go nuts every five minutes or so in the play and he said to her we must have a word to bring you back to reality and the word my dear will be basingstoke
so every time she got a little nuts he would say basingstoke and she would say basingstoke it is and she
well you know i'm from the bronx i can't say basingstoke
but i had something better
much better than basingstoke at least for me
my god it worked every time i would begin thinking obsessionally again once more after twenty shock treatments
things got better and better and within three or four months
i was discharged from that hospital and i joined a group of surgeons where i could work with other people
in the community not in new haven but fairly close by i stayed there for three years at the end of three years i went back to new haven had remarried by
with me actually to make sure i could get through this the career
even better than it had been before went
right back into the university
as i said close to thirty years
i stopped doing surgery about six years ago and became a full time writer as many people know but it's been very exciting it's been very happy every once in a while i have to say
while i get somewhat depressed and a little obsessional so i'm not free of all of this
but it's worked it's always worked
never ever talking about this to talk about it
those of you who know
some of these books know that one is about death and dying one is about the human body and the human spirit one is about the way mystical thoughts are constantly in our minds and they have always to do
with my own personal experiences
one might think reading these books and i've gotten thousands of letters about them by people who do think this that based on my life 's history as i've portrayed in the books my early life 's history i am someone
who has overcome adversity that i am someone who has drunk drank drunk of the bitter dregs of
near disaster in childhood and emerged not just unscathed but
really have it figured out so that i can advise people about death and dying so that i can talk about mysticism and the human spirit and i've always felt guilty about
i've always felt that somehow i was an impostor because my readers don't know what i have just told you
it's known by some people in new haven obviously but it is not generally known so one of the reasons that i have come here to talk about this today
is to frankly selfishly unburden myself and let it be known
this is not an untroubled mind that has written all of these books but more importantly i think
is the fact that a very significant proportion of people in this audience are under thirty and there are many of course who are well over thirty
for people under thirty and it looks to me like almost all of you i would say all of you are either on the cusp of a magnificent and exciting career or right into a magnificent and exciting career
anything can happen to you things change accidents happen something from childhood comes back to haunt you you can be thrown off the track i hope it happens to none of you but it will probably
to a small percentage of you to those to whom it doesn't happen there will be adversities
with the bleakness of spirit with no spirit that i had in the nineteen seventies and no possibility of recovery as far as that group
very experienced psychiatrists thought if i can find my way back from this believe me anybody can find their way back from any adversity that exists in their lives
and for those who are older who have lived through perhaps not something as bad as this but who have lived through difficult times perhaps where they lost everything as i did and started out all over again some of these things will seem very familiar
will seem very familiar there is
there is recovery
recovery there is
redemption and there is resurrection
there are resurrection themes in every society that has ever been studied and it is because not just only do we fantasize about the possibility of resurrection and recovery but it actually happens and it happens a lot
the most popular resurrection theme outside of specifically religious ones is the one
about the phoenix the ancient story of the phoenix who every five hundred years resurrects itself from its own ashes to go on to live a life
is even more beautiful than it was before richard thanks very much
