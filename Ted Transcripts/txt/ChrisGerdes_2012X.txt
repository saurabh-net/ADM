maybe you 're out on the road for a long day and you just wanted to get home you were tired but you felt you could drive a few more miles maybe you thought i 've had less to drink than everybody else i should be the one to go home
or maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere that you could push
and the car would get you home safely
now that 's been the promise of the self driving car the autonomous vehicle and it 's been the dream since at least one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine when general motors showcased this idea at their futurama booth at the world 's fair
now california 's considering similar legislation and this would make sure that the autonomous car is not one of those things that has to stay in vegas
now why would we want to do such a thing well there 's two really good reasons for this
now if you 're like me and the other seventy percent of the population who know that we are above average drivers you understand that 's a very high bar
there 's another reason as well
just like race car drivers can use all of the friction between the tire and the road all of the car 's capabilities to go as fast as possible
we want to use all of those capabilities to avoid any accident we can
now you may push the car to the limits not because you 're driving too fast but because you 've hit an icy patch of road conditions have changed
in those situations we want a car that is capable enough to avoid any accident that can physically be avoided
i must confess there 's kind of a third motivation as well you see i have a passion for racing
in the past i 've been a race car owner a crew chief and a driving coach
although maybe not at the level that you 're currently expecting
one of the things that we 've developed in the lab we 've developed several vehicles
is what we believe is the world 's first autonomously drifting car
we 've also worked with volkswagen oracle on shelley an autonomous race car that has raced at one hundred and fifty miles an hour through the bonneville salt flats
gone around thunderhill raceway park in the sun
the wind and the rain
and navigated the one hundred and fifty three turns and twelve point four miles of the pikes peak hill climb route in colorado with nobody at the wheel
i guess it goes without saying that we 've had a lot of fun doing this these autonomous cars
we have developed a tremendous appreciation
for the capabilities of human race car drivers
as we 've looked at the question of how well do these cars perform
we wanted to compare them to our human counterparts are amazing
we can take a mathematical model of a car and with some iteration we can actually find the fastest way around that track
we line that up with data that we record from a professional driver
and the resemblance is absolutely remarkable
yes there are subtle differences here
but the human race car driver is able to go out and drive an amazingly fast line without the benefit of an algorithm that compares the trade off between going as fast as possible in this corner and shaving a little bit of time off of the straight over here
not only that they 're able to do it lap after lap after lap
they 're able to go out and consistently do this pushing the car to the limits every single time
it 's extraordinary to watch
you put them in a new car
and after a few laps they 've found the fastest line in that car
and they 're off to the races
it really makes you think
we 'd love to know what 's going on inside their brain
so as researchers that 's what we decided to find out
we decided to instrument not only the car
but also the race car driver to try to get a glimpse into what was going on in their head as they were doing this
now this is dr lene harbott applying electrodes to the head of john morton
john morton is a former can am and imsa driver who 's also a class champion at le mans fantastic driver and very willing to put up with graduate students and this sort of research
she 's putting electrodes on his head so that we can monitor the electrical activity in john 's brain as he races around the track
now clearly we 're not going to put a couple of electrodes on his head and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track however neuroscientists have identified certain patterns that let us tease out some very important aspects of this
for instance the resting brain tends to generate a lot of alpha waves
now we can measure this and we can look at the relative power between the theta waves and the alpha waves this gives us a measure of mental workload how much the driver is actually challenged cognitively at any point along the track
now we wanted to see if we could actually record this on the track so we headed down south to laguna seca
now the corkscrew is a chicane followed by a quick right handed turn as the road drops three stories now the strategy for driving this as explained to me was you aim for the bush in the distance and as the road falls away you realize it was actually the top of a tree
life is way too short
