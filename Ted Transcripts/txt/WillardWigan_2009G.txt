something doesn't mean it's not there my work is it's a reflection of myself what i wanted to do is to
show the world that the little things can be the biggest things
we all seem to think that you know if we look down on the ground there's nothing there and we use the word nothing
nothing doesn't exist because there is always something my mother told me that when i was a child
that i should always respect the little things what made me do this work i shall go into my story
this all started when i was age five
what made me do it at school i will admit this academically i couldn't express myself so i was
more or less classed as nothing my world was seen as less
so i decided i didn't really want to be a part of that world i thought i need to retreat into something else so when my mother used to take me to school
she thought i was at school and i used to do a u turn when her back was turned and run off and hide in the shed at the back of the garden now the one time i was in the shed and
my mother suspected something thinking i was at school my mother was like the woman in tom and jerry so you'd just see
so i was hiding in the shed like that and
and then i saw her legs and then she said grabbed me like that because my mother was quite big and she lifted me
school i told her i couldn't face it because the way the teacher was treating me ridiculing me and using me as an example of
at that age obviously i couldn't express it that way but i told her i didn't feel right and then she said you 're going back to school tomorrow and walked off and i didn't expect
that because i expected one of these but i didn't get it so i'm sitting there thinking
and as i looked down on the ground i noticed there was some ants running around and i went into this little fantasy world and i thought
looking for the queen ant or do they need somewhere to live so i thought perhaps if i made these ants some apartments
so i did and how i set about that i got some splinters of wood and i sliced the little splinters of wood with a broken shard of glass constructed this little apartment well it
little shanty shed when i'd finished but i thought perhaps the ant won 't know it'll probably move in and so
a bit crude at the time and i made all these little apartments and little merry go rounds seesaws and swings little ladders and i encouraged the ants to come round by putting sugar and things like that
and then i sat down and all the ants
came along and all i could hear was this
this i realized that
to life than just everything that we see around us that's i says
and then he said but i don't believe that you can do
of glass which as you can see that's the actual frame of i
i i don't inhale my

and things
to carve homer simpson like that in that position and
to make sure that there is room for bart's neck so after i've done the same thing then i have to
paint brush but i would never do it to a living fly because i've heard a fly i would never
i would never because
