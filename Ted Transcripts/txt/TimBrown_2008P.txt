so this guy this guy is a guy named bob mckim and he was a creativity researcher in the sixties and seventies and also led the and
and he
to do an exercise with his students
where he got them to take a piece of paper and draw the person sat next to them their neighbor very quickly just as quickly as they could
when i say go you a ve got thirty seconds to
your neighbor ok so everybody ready ok off you go you a ve got thirty seconds you a d better be fast come on those
all right now yes lot a s of laughter yeah exactly lots of laughter quite a bit of embarrassment
and he would point this out as evidence
we fear the judgment of our peers and that we a re embarrassed about kind of showing our ideas to people we think of as our peers to those around us
this fear is what causes us to be conservative
they just quite happily show their masterpiece to whoever wants to look at it
but as they learn to become adults they become much more sensitive to the opinions of others and they lose that freedom and they do start to become embarrassed
and in studies of kids playing it a s been shown time after time that kids who feel secure
who are in a kind of trusted environment they a re the ones that feel most free to play
you know a place where people have the same kind of security where they have the same kind of security to take risks maybe have the same kind of security to play
before founding ideo david said that what he wanted to do was to form a company where all the employees are my best
it allows us then to take the kind of creative risks that we need to take as a designer and so that kind of decision to
work with his friends now he has five hundred and fifty of them was what got ideo started
and our studios like i think many creative workplaces today are designed to help people feel relaxed familiar with their surroundings comfortable with the people that they a re working with
it takes more than decor but i think we a ve all seen that you know creative companies do often have symbols in the workplace that remind people to be playful
and decorated caves or at the googleplex where you know it a s famous for its volley beach ball courts and even this massive
so all of these places you know have these symbols now our big symbol at ideo is actually not so much the place it a s a thing and it a s actually something that we invented a few years ago or created a few years ago so it a s a toy and
and you will find that every one of you has got one taped under your chair and i a m going to run a little experiment
little experiment but before we
i need just to put these on
the room can actually get those things onto the stage so the way they work is you know you just
back and off you go so don a t look backwards that a s my only recommendation here so i want to see how many of you can get these things on the stage so
another idea i wanted to there we go we
not bad not bad no serious injuries so far
right this is pretty good this is pretty good okay all right
so the rest of you can save them for when i say something particularly boring and then so
so ok so why so we have the finger blasters other people have dinosaurs you know why do we have them well as i said we have them because we think maybe playfulness is important but why is it important
we use it in a pretty pragmatic way to be honest we think playfulness helps us get to better creative solutions helps us do our jobs better
and helps us feel better when we do them now an adult encountering a new situation when we encounter a new situation we
have a tendency to want to categorize it just as quickly as we can you know and there a s a reason for that we want
complicated we want to figure out what a s going on around us very quickly i suspect actually that the evolutionary biologists probably have lots of reasons why
we want to categorize new things very very quickly one of them might be you know when we see this funny stripey thing
is that a tiger just about to jump out and kill us or is it just some weird shadows on the tree we need to figure that out pretty fast well at least we did once most of us don a t need to anymore i suppose
also ask what can i do with it and you know the more creative of them might get to a really kind of interesting example and this openness is the beginning of exploratory play
any parents of young kids in the audience there must be some yeah thought so
so we a ve all seen it haven a t we we a ve all told stories about how on christmas morning you know our kids end up playing with the boxes far more than they play with the toys that are inside
and you know from an exploration perspective this behavior makes complete sense because you can do a lot more with boxes than you can do with a toy even one like say tickle me elmo
which despite its ingenuity really only does one thing whereas boxes offer an infinite number of choices
to do as many of them as you can in the minute that i a m just about to give you so everybody ready ok off you go okay
put down your pencils as they say so who got more than five circles figured out hopefully everybody more than ten keep your hands up if you did ten fifteen twenty
anybody get all thirty no oh somebody did fantastic
did anybody to a variation on a theme like a smiley face happy face sad face sleepy face anybody do that anybody use my examples the sun and the football great cool
things we stop ourselves from doing things we self edit as we a re having ideas and some cases our desire to be original is actually a form of editing
and that actually isn a t necessarily really playful so that ability just to kind of go for it and explore lots of things even if they don a t seem that different from each other is actually something that kids do well and it is a form of play
on creativity so he picked twenty seven professionals
they were you know engineers physicists mathematicians architects furniture designers even artists and he asked them to come along one evening and bring a problem with them that they were working on
he gave each of them some mescaline and had them listen to some nice relaxing music for a while and then he did
now actually he gave the test before the drugs and after the drugs to see how what the difference was in people a s sort of facility and speed with coming up with ideas and then he asked them to go away and work on those problems that they a d brought
and so some of the things that they figured out some of these individuals figured out in one case a new commercial building and design for houses that were accepted by clients
design of a solar space probe experiment a redesign of the linear electron accelerator an engineering improvement to a magnetic tape recorder you can tell this is a while ago
a line of furniture and even a new conceptual model of the photon so it was a pretty successful evening
in fact maybe this experiment was the reason that silicon valley got off to its great start with innovation we don a t know but it may be
have brainstorming rules written on the walls edicts like defer judgment or go for quantity and somehow that seems wrong i mean
have rules about creativity well it sort of turns out that we need rules to help us break the old rules and norms that otherwise we might bring to the creative process and we a ve certainly learnt that over time you get much
brainstorming much more creative outcomes when everybody does play by the rules now of course many designers many individual designers achieve this is in a much more organic way i think the eames
wonderful examples of experimentation and they experimented with plywood for many years without necessarily having one single goal in mind
they were exploring following what was interesting to them and they went from designing splints for wounded soldiers coming out of world war ii and the korean war i think and from this experiment they moved on to chairs and through constant experimentation with materials developed a wide range of iconic solutions that we know today and eventually resulting in of course the legendary lounge chair
now if the eames had stopped with that first great solution then we wouldn a t be the beneficiaries of so many you know wonderful designs today
and of course they used experimentation in all aspects of their work from films to buildings from games to
now while the eames were exploring those possibilities they were also exploring physical objects and they were doing that through building prototypes and building is the next of the behaviors that i thought i a d talk about
so the average western first grader spends as much as fifty percent of their play time taking part in what a s called construction play construction play it a s playful obviously but also a powerful way to learn
when play is about building a tower out of blocks the kid begins to learn a lot about towers and as they repeatedly knock it down and start again learning is happening as a sort of by product of play it a s classically learning by doing
one of his earliest projects the team was kind of stuck and they came up with a mechanism by hacking together
a prototype made from a roll on deodorant now that became the first commercial computer mouse for the apple lisa and the macintosh so they kind of learned their way to that by building prototypes
another example is a group of designers who were working on a surgical instrument with some surgeons they were meeting with them they were talking to the surgeons about what it was they needed with this device and one of the designers ran out of the room and
white board marker and a film canister which is now becoming a very precious prototyping medium and a clothes pin taped them all together ran back into the room and said you mean something like this and the surgeons grabbed hold of it and said well i want to hold it like this or like that
and all of a sudden a productive conversation was happening about design around a tangible object and in the end it turned into a real device and so this behavior is all about quickly getting
something into the real world and having your thinking advanced as a result at ideo there a s a kind of a back to preschool feel sometimes about the environment
the prototyping carts filled with colored paper and play dough and glue sticks and stuff i mean they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them but the important idea is everything a s to hand everything a s around
stuff that kind of facilitates this sort of playful and building mode of thinking and of course by the time you get to the average workplace maybe the best construction tool we have might be the post it notes it a s pretty barren
but giving project teams and their clients who they a re working with permission to think with their hands quite complex ideas can
spring into life and go right through to execution much more easily this is a nurse using a very simple as you can see
but what about designing something that isn a t physical something like a service or an experience something which exists as a series of interactions over time
food at a fast food joint or something you need to be able to imagine how that experience might feel over a period of time and i think the best way to achieve that
and get a feeling for any flaws in your design is to act it out so we do quite a lot of work at ideo trying to convince our clients of this they can be a little skeptical i a ll come back to that
but a place i think where the effort is really worthwhile is where people are wrestling with quite serious problems things like
security or finance or health and this is another example in a health care environment of some doctors and some nurses and designers acting out a service scenario around patient care
they dismiss an interesting interaction by saying you know that a s just happening because they a re acting it out research into kid a s behavior actually suggests that it a s worth taking role playing seriously
so they get used to quite quickly to understanding the rules for social interactions and are actually quite quick to point out when they a re broken so when as adults we role play
then we have a huge set of these scripts already internalized we a ve gone through lots of experiences in life and they provide a strong intuition as to whether an interaction is going to work
so we a re very good when acting out a solution at spotting whether something lacks authenticity so role play is actually i think quite valuable when it comes to thinking about
to sleep in a kind of confined space on an airplane and so they grab some very simple materials you can see and did this kind of role play this kind of very crude role play
just to get a sense of what it would be like for passengers if they were stuck in quite small places on airplanes this is one of our designers kristian simsarian
actually sick and sticking something into him that he was going to regret later so anyhow he went there with his video camera
and it a s kind of interesting to see what he brought back because when we looked at the video when he got back we saw twenty minutes of this
and also the amazing thing about this video as soon as you see it you kind of immediately project yourself
into that experience and know what it feels like all of that uncertainty while you a re left out in the hallway while the docs are dealing with some more urgent case
and so sometimes these analogous experiences kind of analogous role play can also be quite valuable so when a kid dresses up as a firefighter
you know he a s beginning to try on that identity he wants to know what it feels like to be a firefighter we a re doing the same thing as designers we a re trying on these experiences
and so the idea of role play is both as an empathy tool as well as a tool for prototyping experiences and you know we kind of admire
people who do this at ideo anyway not just because they lead to insights about the experience but also because of their willingness
to explore and their ability to kind of unselfconsciously surrender themselves to the experience in short we admire their willingness to play so playful exploration
play like a kid and to certain extent it is but i want to stress a couple of points the first thing to remember is that play is not
so remember the sketching task we did at the beginning the kind of little face the portrait you did well imagine if you did the same task with friends while you were drinking in a
but everybody agreed to play a game where the worst sketch artist bought the next round of drinks that framework of rules
an embarrassing difficult situation into a kind of a fun game and as a result you know we a d all feel perfectly secure and have a good time
but because we all understood the rules and we agreed on them together but there aren a t just rules about how to play there are rules about when to play
how to move kids through these experiences and as designers we need to be able to transition in and out of play
and come back looking for that sort of solution and developing that solution i think they a re two quite different modes divergence
and i think it a s probably in the divergent mode that we most need playfulness perhaps in convergent mode we need to be more serious and so being able to move between those modes is really quite important
but that a s not really true you can be a serious professional adult and at times be playful it a s not an either or it a s an and you can be serious and play
so to kind of sum it up we need trust to play and we need trust to be creative so there a s a connection
and there are a series of behaviors that we a ve learnt as kids and that turn out to be quite useful to us as designers
they include exploration which is about going for quantity
building and thinking with their hands
and role play where acting it out helps us both have more empathy for the situations in which we a re designing and to create services and experiences that are seamless and authentic
