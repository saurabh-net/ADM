but who had changed my life
i didn 't have a phone number to call to say i was coming
i didn 't have an exact address but i knew his name abed
i knew that he lived in a town of fifteen thousand
he broke my neck and so on an overcast morning in january i headed north
off in a silver chevy to find a man and some peace the road dropped and i exited jerusalem i then rounded the very bend where his blue truck heavy with four tons of floor tiles had borne down with great speed onto the back left corner of the minibus where i sat
i was then nineteen years old
i 'd grown five inches and done some twenty thousand pushups
playing basketball with friends into the wee hours of a may morning
i palmed the ball in my large right hand and when that hand reached the rim i felt invincible
i was off in the bus to get the pizza i 'd won on the court
i didn 't see abed coming
from my seat i was looking up at a stone town on a hilltop bright in the noontime sun when from behind there was a great bang as loud and violent as a bomb
my head snapped back over my red seat my eardrum blew my shoes flew off
i flew too my head bobbing on broken bones and when i landed i was a quadriplegic over the coming months i learned to breathe on my own then to sit and to stand and to walk
but my body was now divided vertically
i was a hemiplegic and back home in new york i used a wheelchair for four years
there i rose from my chair for good i leaned on my cane and i looked
and when i saw this photograph
i didn 't see a bloody and unmoving body
i saw the healthy bulk of a left deltoid
and i mourned that it was lost but was now impossible
it was then i read the testimony that abed gave the morning after the crash
reading his words i welled with anger
it was the first time i 'd felt anger toward this man and it came from magical thinking
on this xeroxed piece of paper
abed could still turn his wheel left so that i would see him whoosh by out my window
and i would remain whole
be careful abed look out slow down
but abed did not slow
and on that xeroxed piece of paper my neck again broke
and again i was left without anger
i decided to find abed
the quadriplegia and the catheters the insecurity and the loss
and when abed went on about how hurt he was in the crash
i didn 't say that i knew from the police report that he 'd escaped serious injury
i said i wanted to meet
abed said that i should call back in a few weeks
and when i did and a recording told me that his number was disconnected
i walked with my cane i pitched overhand
in a weekly softball game that i started in central park and home in new york i became a journalist and an author typing hundreds of thousands of words with one finger
a friend pointed out to me that all of my big stories mirrored my own each centering on a life that had changed in an instant
i 'd been working through my lot after all
still abed was far from my mind when last year i returned to israel to write of the crash
and the book i then wrote half life
and finally i understood why
to hear this man say two words
and so i got a cop to confirm that abed still lived somewhere in his same town
and i was now driving to it with a potted yellow rose in the back seat when suddenly flowers seemed a ridiculous offering
but what to get the man who broke your fucking neck abed would hug me
abed would spit at me
abed would say i 'm sorry
i then began to wonder as i had many times before how my life would have been different had this man not injured me had my genes been fed a different helping of experience who was i
was i who i had been before the crash
before this road divided my life like the spine of an open book
was i what had been done to me
were all of us the results of things done to us
it seemed that we could be nothing more than genes and experience but how to tease out the one from the other
as yeats put that same universal question o body swayed to music o brightening glance how can we know the dancer from the dance
i 'd been driving for an hour
when i looked in my rearview mirror and saw my own brightening glance
the light my eyes had carried for as long as they had been blue the predispositions and impulses that had propelled me as a toddler to try and slip over a boat into a chicago lake that had propelled me as a teen to jump into wild cape cod bay after a hurricane
but i also saw in my reflection that had abed not injured me i would now in all likelihood be a doctor
the frequent furl of five fingers the chips in my teeth come from biting at all the many things a solitary hand cannot open
the dancer and the dance were hopelessly entwined
it was approaching eleven when i exited right toward afula and passed a large quarry and was soon in kfar kara
i felt a pang of nerves
but chopin was on the radio
seven beautiful mazurkas and i pulled into a lot by a gas station to listen and to calm
i 'd been told that in an arab town one need only mention the name of a local and it will be recognized
and i was mentioning abed and myself noting deliberately that i was here in peace to the people in this town
when i met mohamed outside a post office at noon he listened to me
you know it was most often when speaking to people that i wondered where i ended and my disability began
for many people told me what they told no one else
she told me that best she could tell her tears had had something to do with my being happy and strong
but i was now me despite a limp and that i suppose was what now made me me
anyway mohamed told me what perhaps he would not have told another stranger
he led me to a house of cream stucco then drove off
and as i sat contemplating what to say
a woman approached in a black shawl and black robe
i stepped from my car and said shalom and identified myself
and she told me that her husband abed would be home from work in four hours
her hebrew was not good and she later confessed that she thought that i had come to install the internet
i drove off and returned at four thirty thankful to the minaret up the road that helped me find my way back
an average looking man of average size
and he told me i was a guest in his home and we sat beside one another on a fabric couch
it was then that abed resumed at once the tale of woe he had begun over the phone sixteen years before
he 'd just had surgery on his eyes he said
he had problems with his side and his legs too and oh he 'd lost his teeth in the crash
abed then rose and turned on the tv so that i wouldn 't be alone when he left the room
and returned with polaroids of the crash
and his old driver 's license
i was handsome he said
we looked down at his laminated mug abed had been less handsome than substantial
with thick black hair and a full face and a wide neck it was this youth who on may sixteen one thousand nine hundred and ninety had broken two necks including mine and bruised one brain and taken one life
twenty one years later he was now thinner than his wife his skin slack on his face and looking at abed looking at his young self i remembered looking at that photograph of my young self after the crash and recognized his longing
the crash changed both of our lives i said
and said that the crash was the fault of a bus driver in the left lane who did not let him pass
i did not want to recap the crash with abed i 'd hoped for something simpler to exchange a turkish dessert for two words and be on my way
and so i didn 't point out that in his own testimony the morning after the crash
and so i now went looking for remorse and threw truth under the bus
i understand i said that the crash was not your fault but does it make you sad that others suffered
abed spoke three quick words yes
before the crash and so god had ordained the crash
but now he said he was religious and god was pleased
news on the tv of a car wreck that hours before had killed three people up north
we looked up at the wreckage strange i said
strange i said strange he agreed
i had the thought that there on route eight hundred and four
there were perpetrators and victims dyads bound by a crash some as had abed would forget the date some as had i would remember
it is a pity he said that the police in this country are not tough enough on bad drivers i was baffled
abed had said something remarkable
was it evidence of guilt an assertion that he should have been put away longer
lost his truck license for a decade
i thought you had a few driving issues before the crash
well he said i once went sixty in a forty
and so twenty seven violations
driving through a red light driving at excessive speed driving on the wrong side of a barrier and finally riding his brakes down that hill reduced to one
and it was then i understood that no matter how stark the reality the human being fits it into a narrative that is palatable
the goat becomes the hero the perpetrator becomes the victim
it was then i understood that abed would never apologize
abed and i sat with our coffee
we 'd spent ninety minutes together
and he was now known to me
he was not a particularly bad man or a particularly good man
he was a limited man
with a nod to jewish custom he told me that i should live to be one hundred and twenty years old
but it was hard for me to relate to one who had so completely washed his hands of his own calamitous doing to one whose life was so unexamined
that he said he thought two people had died in the crash
i wished to tell him that were he to acknowledge my disability
people don 't know that they have lived through worse
i wished to tell him that what makes most of us who we are most of all
i wished to tell him that not only paralyzers and paralyzees must evolve reconcile to reality but we all must
the aging and the anxious and the divorced
and the balding and the bankrupt
but that this natural world still has many glories
i wished to tell him that in the end our mandate is clear
we have to rise above bad fortune
we have to be in the good and enjoy the good
study and work and adventure and community
that truly to enjoy bodily warmth
some small part of you must be cold
for there is no quality in this world that is not
what it is merely by contrast
and if the gods are kind you may truly enjoy what you have
that is the one singular gift you may receive if you suffer in any existential way
you know death and so may wake each morning pulsing with ready life
some part of you is cold and so another part may truly enjoy what it is to be warm
or even to be cold
when one morning years after the crash i stepped onto stone and the underside of my left foot felt the flash of cold nerves at last awake it was exhilarating
it was exhilarating a gust of snow
but i didn 't say these things to abed
i told him only that he had killed one man not two
i told him the name of that man
and then i said goodbye
