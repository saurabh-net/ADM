that 's long enough for a generation of managers to retire
you see the first wave of managers simply replaced their steam engines with electric motors but they didn 't redesign the factories to take advantage of electricity 's flexibility
it fell to the next generation to invent new work processes and then productivity soared often doubling or even tripling in those factories
electricity is an example of a general purpose technology like the steam engine before it
general purpose technologies drive most economic growth because they unleash cascades of complementary innovations like lightbulbs and yes factory redesign
is there a general purpose technology of our era
sure it 's the computer
but technology alone is not enough technology is not destiny
technology is not destiny we shape our destiny
and just as the earlier generations of managers needed to redesign their factories
we 're going to need to reinvent our organizations and even our whole economic system we 're not doing as well at that job as we should be as we 'll see in a moment productivity is actually doing all right
as the end of innovation
but they are actually the growing pains of what andrew mcafee and i call the new machine age
there 's some bumps along the way but the big story is you could practically fit a ruler to it
this is a log scale so what looks like steady growth
is actually an acceleration in real terms and here 's productivity
you can see a little bit of a slowdown there in the mid seventy s but it matches up pretty well with the second industrial revolution when factories were learning how to electrify their operations after a lag productivity accelerated again
so maybe history doesn 't repeat itself but sometimes it rhymes
is even better worldwide incomes have grown at a faster rate in the past decade than ever in history if anything all these numbers actually understate our progress because the new machine age is more about knowledge creation than just
physical production it 's mind not matter brain not brawn ideas not things
that creates a problem for standard metrics because we 're getting more and more stuff
according to the numbers the music industry is half the size that it was ten years ago but i 'm listening to more and better music than ever you know i bet you are too
in total my research estimates that the gdp numbers miss over three hundred billion dollars per year in free goods and services on the internet
now let 's look to the future
there are some super smart people who are arguing that we 've reached the end of growth
but to understand the future of growth we need to make predictions about the underlying drivers of growth
i 'm optimistic because the new machine age is digital
when goods are digital they can be replicated with perfect quality at nearly zero cost
and they can be delivered almost instantaneously
welcome to the economics of abundance
but there 's a subtler benefit to the digitization of the world measurement is the lifeblood of science and progress
in the age of big data we can measure the world in ways we never could before
secondly the new machine age is exponential
computers get better faster than anything else
exponential trends take us by surprise
but the reality is that each innovation creates building blocks for even more innovations here 's an example in just a matter of a few weeks an undergraduate student of mine
built an app that ultimately reached one point three million users he was able to do that so easily because he built it on top of facebook and facebook was built on top of the web and that was built on top of the internet and so on and so forth
now individually digital exponential and combinatorial would each be game changers
put them together and we 're seeing a wave of astonishing breakthroughs like robots that do factory work or run as fast as a cheetah or leap tall buildings in a single bound you know robots are even revolutionizing cat transportation
consider one project ibm 's watson
these little dots here those are all the champions on the quiz show jeopardy at first watson wasn 't very good
but it improved at a rate faster than any human could and shortly after dave ferrucci showed this chart to my class at mit watson beat the world jeopardy champion
at age seven watson is still kind of in its childhood recently its teachers let it surf the internet unsupervised
the next day it started answering questions with profanities
it 's being tested for jobs in call centers
and it 's getting them it 's applying for legal banking and medical jobs and getting some of them isn 't it ironic that at the very moment we are building intelligent machines perhaps the most important invention in human history some people are arguing that innovation is stagnating
like the first two industrial revolutions the full implications of the new machine age are going to take at least a century to fully play out but they are staggering
so does that mean we have nothing to worry about
we have created more wealth in the past decade than ever but for a majority of americans their income has fallen
this is the great decoupling of productivity from employment
but like too many others they misunderstand its basic causes technology is racing ahead
but it 's leaving more and more people behind today we can take a routine job
you know i recently overheard a conversation that epitomizes these new economics this guy says nah i don 't use h r block anymore
turbotax does everything that my tax preparer did but it 's faster cheaper and more accurate
how can a skilled worker compete with a dollar thirty nine piece of software
but seventeen percent of tax preparers no longer have jobs
that is a microcosm of what 's happening not just in software and services but in media and music in finance and manufacturing in retailing and trade in short
and many of them are losing that race what can we do to create shared prosperity
the answer is not to try to slow down technology instead of racing against the machine we need to learn to race with the machine that is our grand challenge the new machine age
can be dated to a day fifteen years ago when gary kasparov the world chess champion played deep blue a supercomputer
the machine won that day and today a chess program running on a cell phone can beat a human grandmaster
it got so bad that when he was asked what strategy he would use against a computer jan donner the dutch grandmaster
neither is a human because kasparov organized a freestyle tournament
where teams of humans and computers could work together
and the winning team had no grandmaster
and it had no supercomputer what they had was better teamwork
and they showed that a team of humans and computers working together could beat any computer
or any human working alone racing with the machine beats racing against the machine technology is not destiny
