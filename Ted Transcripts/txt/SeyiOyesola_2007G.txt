just to put everything in context and to kind of give you a background to where i'm coming from so that a lot of the things i'm going to say and the things i'm going to do
things i'm going to tell you i've done you will understand exactly why and how i got motivated to be where i am
six and by the time i was an intern house officer i could barely afford to maintain my mother 's thirteen year old car and i was a paid doctor
this brings us to why a lot of us who are
now as they say in diaspora now are we going to make that a permanent thing where
we all get trained and we leave and we don't go back perhaps not
i should certainly hope not because that is not my vision all right for good measure
that's where nigeria is on the african map and just
is the delta region that i'm sure everybody 's heard of people getting kidnapped where the oil comes from
that sometimes i think has driven us all crazy in
between africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care very interesting
how many people do you think are on that taxi and believe it or not that is a taxi in nigeria and the capital well what used to be the capital of nigeria lagos
that's a taxi and you have police on them so tell me how many policemen do you think are on this and now
so when these kind of people and believe me it's not just the police that use these taxis in lagos we all
i've been on one of these and i didn't have a helmet either and it just reminds me of the
of what happens when one of us on a taxi like this falls off has an accident and needs a hospital believe it or not some of us do survive
some of us do survive malaria we do survive aids and like i tell my family and my wife reminds me every time you're risking your life you know every time you go to that country and she's right
where do they go where do they go when they need help for this kind of stuff i'm not saying instead
i'm saying as well as aids tb malaria typhoid the list goes on i'm saying where do they go when they're like
when i go back home and i do all kinds of things i teach i train but i catch one of these things or i'm chronically ill with one of those
where do they go what's the economic impact when one of them dies or becomes disabled i think it's quite significant this is where they go
these are not old pictures and these are not from some downtrodden this is a major hospital in fact it's from a major teaching hospital in nigeria now
is less than a year old in an operating room that's sterilizing equipment in nigeria you remember all that
i'm sorry if it upsets some of you but i think you need to see this
ok you can say some of this is education you can say it's hygiene i'm not pleading poverty i'm saying we need more
just you know vaccination malaria aids because i want to be treated in a proper hospital if something happens to me out there in fact when i
running around saying hey boys and girls you're cardiologists in the u s can you come home with me and do a mission i want them to think well there's some hope now have a look at that that's the anesthesiology machine
and believe me these are current pictures now if something like this which has happened in the u k that's where they go this is the intensive care unit in which i work
this is a slide from a talk i gave about intensive care units in nigeria and jokingly we
expensive scare because it's scary and it's expensive but we need to
so these are the problems there are no prizes for telling us what the problems are are there i think we all know and
there we go we're going on a mission we're going to do some open heart surgery i was the only brit on a team of about nine american
just so you know i do believe in missions i do believe in aid and i do believe in charity they have their place but where do they go
for those things we talked about earlier because it's not everyone that's going to benefit from a mission health is wealth in the words of hans rosling
you get wealthier faster if you are healthy first so here we are mission big trouble
nigeria big trouble that's mike mike comes out from mississippi does he look like he 's happy it took us two days just to organize the place
the medical advice the committee chairman says yes i told you you weren't going to be able to you can't do this i just know it look that's the technician we had so yes you go on all right
i got him to come with me anesthesia tech come with me from the u k yes let 's just go work this thing out
but we had problems with it we had severe problems there he had to get on the phone this guy was always on the phone so what we going to do now it looks like all these americans are here and yes one brit and he 's not going to do anything
the reason i have this picture here this x ray it's just to tell you where and how we were viewing x rays do you figure where that is
was on a window i mean what's an x ray viewing box
well nowadays everything 's on pax anyway you look at your x rays on a screen and you do stuff with them you email them
but we were still using x rays but we didn't even have a viewing box and we were doing open heart surgery ok i know it's not aids i know it's not malaria but we still need this stuff
oh yeah echo this was just to get the children ready and the adults ready people still believe in voodoo heart disease
we had to do these for adults so we did succeed and we still do we've done three we're planning another one in july in
so we certainly still do open heart but you can see the contrast between everything that was shipped in we ship everything instruments we had explosions
because the kit was designed and installed by people who weren't used to it the oxygen tanks didn't quite work right but how many did we do the first one
twelve we did twelve open heart surgical patients successfully here is our very first patient out of intensive care
and just watch that chair
what i mean about appropriate technology that's what he was doing propping up the bed because the bed simply didn't work have you seen one of those before no yes
doesn't matter it worked i'm sure you've all seen or heard this before we
have been doing so much with so little for so long we are now qualified to do anything with thank you
so we put my hand in my pocket and say guys let 's just buy stuff let 's go set up a company that teaches people educates them gives them the tools they need to keep
and that's a perfect example of one usually when you buy a ventilator in a hospital you buy a different one for children you buy a different one
what's appropriately priced does the job
it will charge the batteries in there and guess what we have a little pedal charger too just in case and guess what if it all fails if you can find a car
is it dental surgery you want general surgery you want decide which instruments stock it up with
and currently we're working on oxygen oxygen delivery on site the technology
oxygen delivery is not new oxygen concentrators are very old technology what is new
and what we will have in a few months i hope is that ability to use this same renewable energy system to provide and produce oxygen on
take nitrogen out what's left
our device this is what makes it so special apart from the awards it's won it's portable and its certified it's
the mhra and the ce mark for those who don't know is the equivalent for europe of the fda in the u s
if you compare it with what's on the market price wise size wise ease of use complexity
too many of us outside
and everybody just to borrow a bit from hans hans rosling he 's my guy if the size of the text represents what gets the most attention it's the problems
but what we really need are african solutions that are appropriate for africa looking at the culture
and lots and lots of that little bit down there sacrifice you have to do it africans have to do it in conjunction with everyone else thank you
