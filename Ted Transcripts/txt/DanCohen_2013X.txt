academic as he said and what that means is that
i argue it 's an important part of my life and i like to argue and i 'm not just an academic i 'm a philosopher so i like to think that i 'm actually pretty good at arguing but i also like to think a lot about arguing and thinking about arguing i 've come across some puzzles and one of the puzzles is that
as i 've been thinking about arguing over the years and it 's been decades now
but the more that i argue and the better i get at arguing the more that i lose
why is it that i 'm okay with losing and why is it that i think that good arguers are actually better at losing
whose turn it is to do the dishes or who has to take out the garbage yeah we have those arguments too i tend to win those arguments because i know the tricks but those aren 't the important arguments i 'm interested in academic arguments today and here are the things that puzzle me
what does it matter to me whether you have this idea that kant 's theory works or mill 's the right ethicist to follow
it 's no skin off my back whether you think functionalism is a viable theory of mind
so why do we even try to argue why do we try to convince other people to believe things that they don 't want to believe
that 's not really a very helpful model for arguing but it 's a pretty common and entrenched model for arguing but there 's a second model for arguing arguments as proofs think of a mathematician 's argument here 's my argument does it work is it any good are the premises warranted are the inferences valid does the conclusion follow from the premises
but there 's another twist on this model that i really think is important namely that when we argue
before an audience sometimes the audience has a more
the argument as war is the dominant one
it dominates how we talk about arguments it dominates how we think about arguments and because of that it shapes
it is the dominant way of thinking about arguments when i 'm talking about arguments that 's probably what you thought of the adversarial model
first it elevates tactics over substance
ignominious defeat i think those are deforming effects and worst of all it seems to prevent things like negotiation or deliberation or compromise
and finally this is really the worst thing arguments don 't seem to get us anywhere they 're dead ends they are roundabouts or traffic jams or gridlock
then there 's an implicit equation of
how does it apply over here and you answer my question
to my satisfaction and so at the end of the day i say you know what
and it 's not just any belief but it 's a well articulated examined
it 's a battle tested belief
well the war metaphor seems to force us into saying you won even though i 'm the only one who made any cognitive gain what did you gain cognitively
i gained and there 's something wrong with that picture and that 's the picture i really want to change if we can yield something positive
what we need is new exit strategies for arguments
entry approaches to arguments we need to think of new kinds of arguments
i don 't have an answer but i have some suggestions and here 's my suggestion
that people play in arguments there 's the proponent and the opponent
in an adversarial dialectical argument there 's the audience in rhetorical arguments there 's the reasoner in arguments as proofs
