walters i 'm a performer
when i was sixteen in san francisco i had my breakthrough manic episode in which i thought i was jesus christ
maybe you thought that was scary but actually there 's no amount of drugs you can take that can get you as high as if you think you 're jesus christ
i was sent to a place a psych ward and in the psych ward everyone is doing their own one man show
there 's no audience like this to justify their rehearsal time
they 're just practicing one day they 'll get here
the first half of high school was the struggle of the manic episode and the second half was the overmedications of these drugs where i was sleeping through high school the second half was just one big nap pretty much in class
when i got out i had a choice i could either deny my mental illness or
there 's a movement going on right now
to reframe mental illness as a positive at least the hypomanic edge part of it now if you don 't know what hypomania is it 's like an engine that 's out of control maybe a ferrari engine with no breaks many of the speakers here many of you in the audience have that creative edge if you know what i 'm talking about
you 're driven to do something that everyone has told you is impossible and there 's a book john gartner john gartner wrote this book called the hypomanic edge in which christopher columbus and ted turner and steve jobs and all these business minds have this edge to compete
a different book was written not too long ago in the mid ninety s called touched with fire by kay redfield jamison in which it was looked at in a creative sense in which mozart and beethoven and van gogh all have this manic depression that they were suffering with some of them committed suicide
so it wasn 't all the good side of the illness now recently there 's been
development in this field and there was an article written in the new york times september two thousand and ten that stated
maybe they just make you a lot of money
your call your call and everyone 's somewhere in the middle
everyone 's somewhere in the middle so maybe
how much depends on where you fall in the spectrum
