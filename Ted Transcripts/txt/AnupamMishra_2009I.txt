we should not move quickly to the desert so
so welcome to the golden desert indian desert it receives the least rainfall in the country lowest
hundred meters and in most parts it is saline not fit for drinking so you
there is no electricity in most of the villages but suppose you use the green technology solar pumps they are of no use in this area so welcome to the golden desert
clouds seldom visit this area but we find forty different names of clouds in this dialect used
a number of techniques to harvest rain this is a new work it's a new program but for the desert society this is no program this is their life and they
and you can notice they have created a kind of false
the desert is there sand dunes some small field and this is all
you can notice the small holes the water will fall on this catchment and there is a slope sometimes
and architects do not care about slopes in bathrooms but here they will care properly and the water will go where it should go and then it is forty feet deep
the waterproofing is done perfectly better than our city contractors because not a single drop should go waste in this they collect one
hundred thousand liters in one season and this is pure drinking water below the surface there is hard saline water but now you can have
we often use a term called bylaws because we are used to get
things but here it is unwritten by law and people make their house and the water storage tanks these raised up platforms just like this
fifteen feet deep and collect rain water from roof there is a small pipe and from their courtyard it can also harvest something like twenty five thousand in a
good monsoon another big one this is of course out of the hardcore desert area this is near jaipur this is called the jaigarh fort and it can
six million gallons of rainwater in one season the age is four hundred years
so since four hundred years it has been giving you almost six million gallons of water per season you can
the price of that water it draws water from fifteen kilometers of canals you can see a modern road hardly fifty years
it can break sometimes but this four hundred year old canal which draws water is is maintained for so many generations
of course if you want to go inside the two doors are locked but they can be opened for ted people and
them you can see person coming up with two canisters of water and the water
these are not empty canisters water level is right up to this it can
the color the taste the purity of this water and this is what they call zero b type of water because it comes from the clouds pure distilled water
stop for a quick commercial break and then we come back to the traditional systems the government
this is a very backward area and we should bring a multi million dollar project to bring water from the himalayas that's why i said that this is a commercial
but we will come back once again to the
water from three hundred four hundred kilometers away soon it become like this in many portions water hyacinth covered
these big canals like anything of course there are some areas where water is reaching i'm not saying that it is not reaching at all but the tail end the
you will notice in bikaner things like this where the water hyacinth couldn't grow the
sand is flowing in these canals the bonus is that you can find wildlife around it
we had full page advertisements some thirty years twenty five years ago when this canal came they said that
your traditional systems these new cement tanks will supply you piped water it's a dream and it became a dream also because
soon the water was not able to reach these areas and people started renovating their own structures
these are all traditional water structures which we won 't be able to explain in such a short time but you can see that no woman is standing on those and
this is heart of desert this town was established eight hundred years ago i'm not sure by
was there or delhi was there or chennai was there or bangalore was there so this was the terminal point for silk route well connected eight hundred years ago through
able to go to europe but jaisalmer was well connected to it and this is the sixteen centimeter
such a limited rainfall and highest colorful life flourished in these areas you won 't find
in this slide but it is invisible somewhere a stream or a rivulet is
through here or if you want to paint you can paint it blue throughout because every roof which you see in this picture
drops and deposit in the rooms
apart from this system they designed fifty two beautiful water bodies around this town and
what we call private public partnership you can add estate also so
public and private enterprise work together to build this beautiful water body and
it's a kind of water body for all seasons you will admire it just behold the beauty throughout the year whether water level goes up or down the beauty is there throughout another water body
dried up of course during the summer period but you can see how the traditional society combines
these statues marvelous statues gives you an idea of water
this rain comes and the water starts filling this tank it will submerge these beautiful statues in what we call in english today mass communication this
everybody in the town will know that this elephant has drown so water will be there for seven months or nine months or twelve months and then they will come and
small water body called the it is difficult to
in severe drought periods nobody has seen this water body getting dried up and perhaps
that on sixth november two thousand and nine there will be a ted green and blue session so they painted it like this
water body children are standing on a very difficult device to explain this is called kund we have in english
it squeeze the moisture hidden in the sand and they have dubbed this water as the third one called and
is a gypsum belt running below it and it was deposited by the great mother earth some
million years ago and where we have this gypsum strip they can harvest this water this is the same dry water body now you don't find any
they are all submerged but when the water goes down they will be able to draw water from those structures throughout the year this year they have received only six centimeters six
and they can telephone you that if you find any water problem in your city delhi bombay bangalore mysore please come to our area of six centimeters we can give you water
how they maintain them there are three things concept planning making the actual thing and also maintaining them
for maintain for centuries by generations without any department without any funding so the secret
your own thing not personal property my property every time so these
remind you that you are entering into a water body area don't spit don't to anything wrong so that the clean water can be
on your right side if you climb these three six steps you will find something very nice
this was done in eleventh century and you have to go further down they say that a picture is worth a thousand words so we can say a thousand words
the water table goes down you will find new stairs if it comes up some of them will be submerged so
this beautiful system will give you some pleasure three sides such steps
on the fourth side there is a four story building where you can organize such ted conferences anytime who built these
in front of you the best civil engineers we had the best planners the best architects we can say that
there were no english medium schools at that time even no hindi schools schools but such people compelled to the east india company which came here for business a very dirty kind of business but not
to create the engineering colleges but because of them first engineering college was created in a small village not in the town the last point we all know in
this tire comes from the airplane so look at the beauty from the desert society who can harvest rainwater
and also create something through a tire from a jet plane and used in a camel
last picture it's a tattoo two thousand years old tattoo they were using it on
was at one time a kind of a blacklisted or con thing but now it
you can copy this tattoo i have some posters of this
life is water these are the beautiful waves these are the beautiful stairs which we just saw in one of these
and these are the flowers which add fragrance to our lives so this is the message of desert thank you very much
first of all i wish i had your eloquence truly in any
artifacts and designs are inspiring do you believe that they can be
and in other parts also and these which stored water there are two type of things one
and one stores so it depends on the terrain but kund which uses the gypsum belt for that you have to go back to your calendar three million years
it can be done right now
