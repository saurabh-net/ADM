i draw to better understand things sometimes i make a lot of drawings and i still don't understand what it is i'm drawing those of you who are comfortable
with digital stuff and even smug about that relationship might be amused to know that the guy who is best known for the way things work while preparing for
part of a panel for understanding
with his new cd burner
who knew about extension managers i've always managed my own extensions it never even occurred to me to
read the instructions but i did figure it out i had to figure it out because along with the invitation came the frightening
i could talk about something that i'm known for something that would be appropriate for the more sort of technically minded people here or i could talk about something that i care about
i decided to go with the latter i'm going to talk about rome now why would i care about rome particularly well i went to rhode island school of design
in the second half of the sixties i was lucky enough to spend my last year my fifth year in rome as a student it changed my life
not the least reason was that i spent those first four living at home
driving into risd everyday driving back the sixties
i missed them but i did spend that extraordinary year in rome it's a place that's never far from my mind so whenever given an opportunity i try to do something in it or for it
i also make drawings to help people understand things
things that i want them to believe that i understand and that's what i do as an illustrator that's my job
to show you some pictures of rome i've made a lot of drawings of rome over the years these are just drawings of rome i get back as often as
part of the reason i'm showing you these is that it sort of helps illustrate part of what i go through with trying to figure out what i feel about rome and why i feel it these are sketches of some of the little details
rome is a city full of surprises i mean we're talking about unusual perspective we're talking about narrow little winding streets that suddenly open up into vast sun
though piazzas that are humanly scaled part of the reason is that they grew it organically that amazing juxtaposition of old and new
the bits of light that come down between the buildings that sort of create a map that's traveling about your head usually blue especially in the summer
the primary reason for all these dead ends is that if you're not sure where you're going you're not going to get there with any kind of efficiency here 's a little map and i thought of maps at the beginning maybe i should just
a little atlas with my favorite streets and connections in rome and
a line of text that actually evolves from the exhaust of a scooter zipping across the page here that same line of text wraps around a fountain in an illustration that can be turned upside down and read both ways
maybe that line of text could be a story to give some human aspect to this maybe i should get away from this map completely and really be honest about wanting to show my favorite bits and pieces of rome and simply kick a soccer ball which happens
from some of those sketches was traveling through rome in different vehicles at different speeds to show
the different aspects of rome sort of an overview of rome that you might see from a dirigible
that you come across anyways i went back to the dirigible notion went to alberto santos dumont found one of his dirigibles that had enough dimensions so i could actually use it as a scale that i could actually juxtapose with
a dirigible a small dirigible she's assembling the structure ajax is sniffing for holes in the balloon before they set off she launches this thing above the spanish steps
sets off for an aerial tour of the city over the spanish steps we go a nice way to sort of show that river that stream
of pouring down the hill unfortunately just across the road from it or quite close by is the column of marcus aurelius and
the diameter of the dirigible makes an impression as you can see as she starts trying to read the story that spirals around the column of marcus aurelius gets a little too close nudges it
this give me a chance to suggest to you the structure of the column of marcus aurelius which is really no higher than a pile of quarters high thick quarters
over the piazza of st ignacio completely ruining the symmetry but that aside a spectacular place
to visit a spectacular framework inside of which you see usually extraordinary blue sky
over the pantheon and the twenty six foot diameter oculus she parks her dirigible lowers the anchor rope and climbs down for a closer look
inside the text is right side and upside down so that you are forced to turn the book around and you can see it from ground point of view and from her point of view
dimensions of the diameter being the same as the distance from the center of the floor to the center of the oculus unfortunately for her
the anchor line gets tangled around the feet of some boy scouts who are visiting the pantheon and they are immediately yanked out and given an extraordinary but terrifying tour of some of the domes of rome which would
she continues on her way to the piazza navona notices a lot of activity at the tre scalini restaurant reminding her that it's lunchtime and she's hungry
they keep on motoring towards the campo de fiori which they soon reach ajax the dog is put in the basket and lowered with a list of food
into the marketplace which flourishes there until about one in the afternoon and then is completely removed and doesn't appear again until six or seven the following morning
anyway the pooch gets back to the dirigible with the stuff unfortunately when she goes to unwrap the
ajax makes a lunge for it she's managed to save the prosciutto but in the process she loses the tablecloth which you can see flying away in the upper left hand corner
they continue without their tablecloth looking for a place to land this thing so they can actually have lunch they eventually discover a huge wall filled with small holes ideal for docking a dirigible because you have a place to tie
turns out to be the exterior wall that part of it that remains of the
at the end of lunch they untie the anchor they set off through the baths of caracalla and over the walls of the city in an abandoned
and decide to take one more look at the pyramid of cestius which has its lightning rod on top unfortunately that's a problem they get a little too close
not due at work until noon so the alarm goes off and it's five to twelve or so he gets up
leaps onto his scooter races through the city past the church of santa maria della pace down the alleys through the streets that tourists may be
can be turned around and read from both sides because there's text on the bottom and text on the top one of which is upside down in this image so he keeps on moving approaching an unsuspecting waiter who is trying to deliver two plates of
right through the piazza della rotonda in front of the pantheon again wreaking havoc and finally getting to work and marchello as it turns out is the driver of the number sixty four bus
and if you've ridden the number sixty four bus you know that it's driven with the same kind of exuberance as marchello demonstrated on his scooter the big front door
to check the wiring and then gradually works his way up to the top of the building apartment by apartment checking every television checking every connection
the problem is solved everybody in the palazzo is happy and of course he also solves his own problem all he has to do now with a perfect table is wait for her to arrive that was the first
but it didn't seem substantial enough to convey whatever it was i wanted to convey about rome so i thought well i'll just
and i'll get inside and underneath and i'll show these things growing and show why they're shaped the way they are and then i thought that's too complicated no i'll just take my favorite bits and pieces and i'll put them inside the but keep the scale
so you can see the top of sant 'ivo and the pyramid of cestius and the tempietto of bramante all side by side in this amazing space now that's one drawing well i thought maybe it's time for piranesi to meet
see that i'm beginning to really lose control here and also hope there's a very thin thin blue
line of exhaust that sort of runs through this thing that would be sort of the trail that holds this together and then i thought wait
a book is not only a neat way to collect and store information it's a series of layers i mean you always peel one layer off another we think of them as pages doing it a certain way but think of them as layers i mean rome is a place of layers
the scar the scars of centuries of change as these structures have been adapted rather than being torn down if i do a fold out page on the left hand side
i could also show you what it looks like in the corner at one of those magnificent buildings with all the massive stone blocks or the fake stone blocks done with brick and stucco which is more often the case
so it becomes slightly three dimensional i could take you down one of those narrow streets into one of those surprising piazzas by using a double gate fold double foldout page which if you were like me reading a pop up book as a child you hopefully stick your head into
let 's look at the pantheon and the piazza della rotonda in front of it here 's a book completely wide open
if i don't open the book the whole way if i just open it ninety degrees we're looking down the front of the pantheon and we're looking sort of at the top
more or less down on the square and if i turn the book the other way we're looking across the square at the front of the pantheon no foldouts no tricks just a book that isn't open
the whole way that seemed promising i thought maybe i'll do it inside and i can even combine the foldouts with the only partially open book so we get inside the pantheon and it grows and
so on and so forth and i thought maybe i'm on the right track but it sort of lost its human quality so i went back to the notion of story which is always a good thing to have if you're trying to get people to pay attention to a book and pick up information along the way pigeon 's progress struck me as a
but it would be a journey that went through rome and showed all the things i like about rome it's a pigeon sitting on top of a church goes off during the day and does normal pigeon stuff comes back
the whole place is covered with scaffolding and green netting and there's no way this pigeon can get home so it's a homeless pigeon and it's going to have to find a new place to live that allows me to go through my catalog of
dangerous places and whatnot and they become friends with this guy and learn to do tricks and entertain him during lunchtime
there's a real bond that develops between this old man and these pigeons but unfortunately he gets sick
gets really sick but he 's taught them to spell his name which is aldo they show up one day after three or four days without seeing him he lives in this little
spell his name and fly around and he finally gets enough strength together to sort of climb up the ladder onto the roof and all the pigeons a la red balloon are there waiting for him and they carry him off over the walls of the city a long way so
will sort of kick me off in the right direction and sometimes it does focus me enough and i'll even do a title page so these are all title pages that eventually led me to the solution i settled on which is the story of
a young woman who sends a message on a homing pigeon she lives outside the walls of the city of rome to someone in the city
and the pigeon is flying down above the appian way here you can see the tombs and pines and so on and so forth along the way if you are seeing the red line you are seeing the trail of the pigeon if you don't see the red line you are the pigeon
and it becomes necessary and possible at this point to try to convey what that sense would be like of flying over the city without actually moving
past the pyramid of cestius these will seem very familiar to you even if you haven't been to rome recently past the
this is something that's a little bit unusual this pigeon does something that most homing pigeons do not do it takes the scenic route which was
a device that i felt was necessary to actually extend this book beyond about four pages so
we circle around the coliseum past the church of santa maria in cosmedin and the temple of hercules towards the river
almost collide with the cornice of the palazzo farnese designed by michelangelo built of stone taken from the coliseum
narrow escape we swoop down over the campo de fiori this is one of those things i to show to my students because it's a complete bastardization a denial of any rules of perspective
the only rule of perspective that i think matters is if it looks believable you've succeeded but you try and figure out where the vanishing points meet here a couple are on on mars and someone
by a soccer ball i have all the pieces there's santa maria della pace there's a soccer ball there's a little bit of a bird 's wing nothing's happening so i had to rethink it and
if you do want to see santa maria della pace you know these books are really flexible incredibly interactive just turn it around and look at it the other way
through the alley we can see the impact is captured in the red line and the bird manages to pull itself together past this medieval tower one of the few remaining medieval towers
stopping just long enough on the twenty six foot diameter oculus of the pantheon to catch our breath and then we can swoop inside
and around and because we're flying we don't have to worry about gravity at this particular moment in time so this drawing can be oriented any way on the page we get a little
as we pass jesu it's not surprising to sort of mimic the architecture in this way past the wonderful wall filled with the juxtaposition that i was talking about
