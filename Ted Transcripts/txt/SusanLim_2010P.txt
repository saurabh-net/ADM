i was privileged to train in transplantation under two great surgical pioneers
who performed the first liver transplant in the u k in the following year against all odds
against all odds next raising the money
perhaps more important i am
but not all patients on the transplant wait list are so fortunate
the truth is there are just simply not enough donor organs to go around as the demand for donor organs continues to rise in large part due to the aging population the supply has remained relatively constant
in the united states alone one hundred thousand
and the gift of life has been extended
to a relative or loved one
but as there was still a dire shortage of donor organs the gift of life was then extended from living related donors to now living unrelated donors and this then has given rise and unexpected moral controversy
and unexpected moral controversy how can
from one that is forced or coerced from for example
a submissive spouse an in law
a servant a slave an employee
in my part of the world and in some areas
shortly after i performed the first liver transplant i received my next assignment and that was
to go to the prisons to harvest organs from executed prisoners
i was also pregnant at the time pregnancies are meant to be happy and fulfilling moments in any woman 's life but my joyful period
but my joyful period thoughts of walking through
the prison 's high security death row
as this was the only route to take me to the makeshift operating room and at each time
and for two years i struggled with the dilemma of waking up at four thirty am on a friday morning
ready to receive the body of an executed prisoner remove the organs and then transport these organs to the recipient hospital
no doubt i was informed
at engrafting the gift of life
but really none of us remained the same i was troubled
that the retrieval of organs from executed prisoners was at least as morally controversial
as the harvesting of stem cells from human embryos
for those who have no influence it made me wonder
if there could be a better way a way to circumvent death
and yet deliver the gift of life
from wide open incisions to keyhole procedures tiny incisions
and in transplantation concepts shifted from whole organs to cells
in one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight at the university of minnesota
i participated in a small series of whole organ pancreas transplants i witnessed the technical difficulty
and this inspired in my mind
i thought to myself why not take
the individual cells out of the pancreas the cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes and transplant these cells technically a much simpler procedure than having to grapple with the complexities of transplanting
pancreatic islet cells captured the attention of the media
and the imagination of the public
i too was fascinated by this new and disruptive cell technology
and this inspired a shift in my mindset
from transplanting whole organs to transplanting cells
and i focused my research
stem cells as a possible source for cell transplants
today we realize that there are many different types of stem cells
embryonic stem cells have occupied center stage chiefly because of their pluripotency that is their ease in differentiating into a variety of different cell types inspired
you and i i think would be very happy to get rid of anyway
fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells but adult stem cells are not embryonic stem cells
and here is the limitation adult stem cells are mature cells
and like mature human beings these cells
aging adult cells from you and me they are racing to reprogram these cells back into more useful
we are focused on taking fat
and reprogramming mounds of fat
into fountains of youthful cells
if this research is successful
it may then reduce the need
to research and sacrifice human embryos
indeed there is a lot of hype but also hope
heart disease stroke diabetes spinal cord injury muscular dystrophy retinal eye diseases
are any of these conditions relevant personally to you
in may two thousand and six something horrible happened to me i was about to start a robotic operation
but stepping out of the elevator into the bright and glaring lights of the operating room i realized that my left
i had taken a rather hard knock during late spring skiing yes i fell
and i started to see floaters and stars which i casually dismissed as too much high altitude sun exposure
but not before a prolonged period of convalescence three months in a head down position this experience taught me to empathize more with my patients and especially those with retinal diseases
thirty seven million people worldwide
or part vision to millions of patients with retinal diseases worldwide it is a fact
that when our organs or tissues are injured
stem cells may be used as building blocks to repair damaged scaffolds within our body
or to provide new liver cells to repair damaged liver
yearly four point eight million suffer
stem cells may one day herald
a quantum leap in the field of cardiology stem cells provide hope
for new beginnings small incremental steps cells rather than organs repair rather than replacement
rather than replacement stem cell therapies
may one day reduce the need
and in the u k neural stem cells to treat stroke
the research success that we celebrate today has been made possible
by the curiosity and contribution and commitment of individual scientists and medical pioneers each one has his story
a journey through controversy inspired
