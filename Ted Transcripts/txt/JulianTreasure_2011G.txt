our listening we spend roughly sixty percent of our communication time listening but we 're not very good at it we retain just twenty five percent of what we hear now not you not this talk but that is generally true
let 's define listening as making meaning from sound it 's a mental process and it 's a process of extraction we use some pretty cool techniques to do this one of them is pattern recognition
give you one example of that intention is very important in sound in listening
when i married my wife
i promised her that i would listen to her every day as if for the first time
now that 's something i fall short of on a daily basis
but that 's not all sound places us in space and in time if you close your eyes right now in this room you 're aware of the size of the room from the reverberation and the bouncing of the sound off the surfaces and you 're aware of how many people are around you because of the micro noises you 're receiving
and sound places us in time as well because sound always has time embedded in it in fact i would suggest that our listening is the main way that we experience the flow of time from past to future
so sonority is time and meaning a great quote i said at the beginning we 're losing our listening why did i say that
well there are a lot of reasons for this first of all we invented ways of recording first writing then audio recording and now video recording as well the premium on accurate and careful listening has simply disappeared secondly
we 're becoming impatient we don 't want oratory anymore we want sound bites and the art of conversation is being replaced dangerously i think by personal broadcasting i don 't know how much listening there is in this conversation which is sadly very common especially in the u k
this is a serious problem that we 're losing our listening this is not trivial
because listening is our access to understanding conscious listening always creates understanding and only without conscious listening can these things happen a world where we don 't listen to each other at all is a very scary place indeed
so i 'd like to share with you five simple exercises tools you can take away with you to improve your own conscious listening would you like that
second i call this the mixer noise so
third this exercise i call savoring and this is a beautiful exercise it 's about enjoying mundane sounds this for example
so mundane sounds can be really interesting if you pay attention i call that the hidden choir it 's around us all the time
the next exercise is probably the most important of all of these if you just take one thing away this is listening positions the idea that you can move your listening position
to what 's appropriate to what you 're listening to this is playing with those filters do you remember i gave you those filters at the beginning it 's starting to play with them as levers to get conscious about them and to move to different places these are just some of the listening positions or scales of listening positions that you can use there are many have fun with that it 's very exciting
and finally an acronym you can use this in listening in communication if you 're in any one of those roles and i think that probably is everybody who 's listening to this talk the acronym is rasa which is the sanskrit word for juice or essence
now sound is my passion it 's my life i wrote a whole book about it so i live to listen that 's too much to ask from most people
but i believe that every human being needs to listen consciously in order to live fully connected in space and in time to the physical world around us connected in understanding to each other not to mention spiritually connected because every spiritual path i know of has listening and contemplation at its heart
that 's why we need to teach listening in our schools as a skill why is it not taught it 's crazy
and if we can teach listening in our schools we can take our listening off that slippery slope to that dangerous scary world that i talked about and move it to a place where everybody is consciously listening all the time or at least capable of doing it now i don 't know how to do that but this is ted
