i couldn 't even do the simplest trick but it was very natural for me because i was not dextrous and hated all sports but after one week of practicing my throws became more like this
when i was eighteen years old
i was standing onstage at the world yo yo contest and i won i was so excited yes i did it i became a hero i may get many sponsors a lot of money tons of interviews and be on tv i thought
i started to consider what i should do
i started to learn classic ballet jazz dance acrobatics and other things to make my performance better
i passed an audition for cirque du soleil today
