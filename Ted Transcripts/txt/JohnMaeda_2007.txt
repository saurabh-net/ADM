on simplicity what a great way to start first of all i've been watching this trend where we have these books like such and such for dummies do you know these book these such and such for dummies my daughters pointed out that i'm very similar looking
i was looking online at amazon com for other books like this you know there s also something called the complete idiot 's guide there's a sort of business model around being stupid in some sense
we like to have technology make us feel bad for some strange reason but i really like that so i wrote a book called the laws of simplicity i was in milan last week for the italian launch
a book about questions questions about simplicity very few answers i'm also wondering myself what is simplicity is it good is it bad is complexity better i
so it was traumatizing actually so
i wanted to escape again so i went out to my car and cape cod there are idyllic roads and all of us can drive in this room and when you drive
so i thought complexity was attacking me suddenly so i thought ah simplicity very important but then i thought oh simplicity what would that be like on a beach what if
the media lab maybe some of you guys have heard of this place it's designed by i m pei one of the premier modernist architects modernism means white box and it's and
some of you guys are entrepreneurs et cetera whatever last month i was at google and boy that cafeteria man you guys have things here in silicon valley like stock options see in academia we get titles
last year at ted these were all my titles i had a lot of titles i have a default title as a father of a bunch of daughters
this year at ted i'm happy to report that i have new titles in addition to my previous titles another associate director of research and this also happened so i have five daughters now
my baby reina thank you
and so my life is much more complex because of the baby actually but that's okay we will still stay married i think but looking way back when i was a child you see i grew up in a tofu factory in seattle
work till six pm six days a week my father was kind of like andy grove paranoid of the competition so often seven days a week family business equals child labor we a great model
so i loved going to school school was great and maybe going to school helped me get to this media lab place
place and it's important to me because as a student i was a computer science undergrad and i discovered design later on in my life and there was this person muriel cooper who knows muriel cooper muriel cooper wasn't she amazing muriel cooper she was wacky
and she was a tedster exactly and she showed us she showed the world how to make the computer beautiful again and
she's very important in my life because she's the one that told me to leave mit and go to art school it was the best advice i ever got so i went to art school because of her
when i was in japan i went to an art school in japan i had a nice sort of situation because somehow i was connected to
paul rand some of you guys know paul rand the greatest graphic designer i'm sorry out there the great graphic designer paul rand designed the ibm logo the westinghouse logo he basically said i 've designed everything
i think that the mentors that we all meet sort of humanize us when you get older and you're all freaked out whatever the mentors calm us down and i'm grateful for my mentors and i'm sure all of you are
because the human thing is very hard when you're at mit the t doesn't stand for human it stands for technology and because of that i always wondered about this human thing so i've always been googling this word human to find out how many hits i get
in two thousand and one i had twenty six million hits and for a computer because computers are against humans a bit i have forty two million hits let me do an al gore here so if you sort of compare that
in the simplicity realm it's also interesting so if you compare complexities to simplicity it's also catching up in a way too so somehow humans and simplicity are intertwined i think
i have a confession i'm not a man of simplicity i spent my entire early career making complex stuff lots of complex stuff i
wrote computer programs to make complex graphics like this i had clients in japan to make really complex stuff like this and i've always felt bad about it in a sense so i hid in a time dimension
and this is a firework calendar so you launch the number into space because the japanese believe that when you see fireworks you're cooler for some reason this is why they have fireworks in the summer a very extreme culture
this is a fall based calendar because i have so many leaves in my yard so this is the leaves in my yard essentially and so i made a lot of these types of things
i've been lucky to have been there before people made these kind of things and so i made all this kind of stuff that messes with your eyes i feel kind of bad about that
tomorrow paola antonelli is speaking i love paola she has this show right now at moma where
these early works are here on display at moma on the walls if you're in new york please go and see that but i've had a problem because i make all this flying stuff and the people say oh
i know your work you're the guy that makes eye candy and when you're told this you feel kind of weird eye candy sort of pejorative don't you think so i say no i make eye meat instead
and eye meat is something different something more fibrous something more powerful perhaps but what could that
make art with a computer program you're always on the tree and the paradox is that for excellent art you want to be off the tree so this is sort of a complication i've found
so to get off the tree i began to use my old computers i took these to tokyo in two thousand and one to make computer objects this is a new way to type on my old color classic
you can't type very much on this i also discovered that an ir mouse responds to crt emissions and starts to move by itself so this is a self drawing machine
measure the impact stuff like this are things i made just to sort of understand what these things are
in different forms if you dry them quick you can make like elephants and steers and stuff and my wife didn't like these because they mold so i had to stop that
so i went back to the computer and i bought five large fries and scanned them all
and i was looking for some kind of food theme and i wrote some software to automatically lay out french fry images
and as a child i'd hear that song you know oh beautiful for spacious skies for amber waves of grain so i made this amber waves image it's sort of a midwest cornfield out of french fries and also
as a child i was the fattest kid in class so i used to love cheetos oh i love cheetos yummy so i wanted to play with cheetos in some way i wasn't sure where to go with this i invented cheeto paint cheeto paint is a very simple i discovered that
cheetos are good expressive material
and with these cheetos i began to think what can i make with these cheetos and so i began to crinkle up potato chip flecks and also pretzels i was looking for some kind of form and in the end i made one hundred butter fries and
each butter fry is composed of different pieces people ask me how they make the antenna sometimes they find a hair in the food that's my hair my hair 's clean it's okay i'm a tenured professor which means basically i don't have to work anymore
a strange business model i can come into work everyday and staple five pieces of paper and just stare at it with my latte end of story but
i realized that life could be very boring so i've been thinking about life and i notice that my camera my digital camera versus my car a very strange thing the car is so big the camera is so small yet the manual for the camera is so much bigger than the
so i was in the cape one time and i typed the word simplicity and i discovered in this weird m night shyamalan way that i discovered
but the laws are kind of like sushi in a way there are all kinds in japan they say that sushi is challenging you know the uni is the most challenging so number ten is challenging people hate number ten like they hate uni actually
the three keys are easy to eat so this is anago cooked already so easy to eat so enjoy your sushi meal later with the laws of simplicity
cookie versus laundry thing anyone who has kids knows that if you offer a kid a big cookie or a small cookie which cookie are they going to take
big cookie you can say the small cookie has godiva chocolate bits in it but it doesn't work they want the big cookie but if you offer kids two piles of
to fold the small pile or the big pile which will they choose strangely not the big pile
so i think it's as simple as this you know when you want more it's because you want to enjoy it when you want less it's because it's about work and so to boil it all down
your life and i just love to see the world the world is an amazing place by being at ted we see so many things at one time
and i can't help but enjoy looking at everything in the world like everything you see every time you wake up it's such a joy to sort of experience
i have a lot of cocky freshmen at mit so i tell them oh your bodies are really getting stronger and stronger but in your late twenties and mid thirties cells they die ok it gets them to work harder sometimes
and if you have your vision vision is interesting as you age from infant age your vision gets better and maybe in your late teens early twenties you're looking for a mate and your vision goes after that
your social responsibility is very interesting so as you get older you may like have kids whatever and then the kids graduate and you have no responsibility any more
but if any of you people ask what actually goes up does anything go up what's the positive part of this you know i think wisdom always goes up i love these eighty year old ninety year old guys and women they have so many thoughts and they have so much wisdom
and i think you know this ted thing i've come here and this is the fourth time and i come here for this wisdom i think
wisdom somehow and i'm so glad to be here and i'm very grateful to be here chris and this is an amazing experience for me as well
