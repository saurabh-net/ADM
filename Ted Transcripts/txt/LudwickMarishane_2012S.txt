and growing up in these tough situations at the age of seventeen i was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter and we were sunbathing the limpopo sun gets really hot in winter
multiple infections of trachoma can leave you permanently blind the disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year the shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with trachoma all you have to do is wash your face no medicine no pills no injections
so after seeing these shocking statistics i thought to myself okay even if i 'm not just doing it for myself and the fact that i don 't want to bathe i at least need to do it to try to save the world
and i wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper and it looked like the kfc special spice you know so i was like okay so we 've got the formula ready now we need to get this thing into practice
fast forward four years later
after having written a forty page business plan on the cell phone having written my patent on the cell phone i 'm the youngest patent holder in the country and
one of the things we learned was that poor communities don 't buy products in bulk
they buy products on demand a person in alex doesn 't buy a box of cigarettes they buy one cigarette each day even though it 's more expensive
so we packaged drybath in these innovative little sachets you just snap them in half and you squeeze it out and the cool part is one sachet substitutes one bath for five rand
after creating that model we also learned a lot in terms of implementing the product we realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want drybath
and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas two hours more for school two hours more for homework two hours more to just be a kid
after seeing that global impact we narrowed it down to our key value proposition which was cleanliness and convenience what 's stopping you
and another key thing that i learned a lot throughout this whole process last year google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world i 'm also currently the best student entrepreneur in the world the first african to get that accolade
