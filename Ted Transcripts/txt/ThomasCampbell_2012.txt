considering a career in the art world
i took a course in london
and one of my supervisors was this irascible italian called pietro who drank too much
but he was a passionate teacher
and i remember one of our earlier classes with him he was projecting images on the wall asking us to think about them
and he put up an image of a painting
and he said what is this
he said it 's a what
i said it 's a bacchanal by titian
as i said he swore too much there was an important lesson for me in that pietro was suspicious of formal art training art history training
because he feared that it filled people up with jargon
and then they just classified things rather than looking at them
and he wanted to remind us that all art was once contemporary
and he wanted us to use our eyes
and he was especially evangelical about this message because he was losing his sight
he wanted us to look and ask basic questions of objects what is it how is it made why was it made how is it used
and these were important lessons to me when i subsequently became a professional art historian
my kind of eureka moment came a few years later
when i was studying the art of the courts of northern europe
and of course it was very much discussed in terms of the paintings and the sculptures and the architecture of the day
but as i began to read historical documents and contemporary descriptions i found there was a kind of a missing component
for everywhere i came across descriptions of tapestries tapestries were ubiquitous
between the middle ages and really well into the eighteenth century
and it was pretty apparent why tapestries were portable
you could roll them up send them ahead of you
and in the time it took to hang them up you could transform a cold dank interior into a richly colored setting
tapestries effectively provided a vast canvas on which the patrons of the day could depict the heroes with whom they wanted to be associated or even themselves
and in addition to that
they required scores of highly skilled weavers working over extended periods of time
with very expensive materials the wools the silks even gold and silver thread
so all in all in an age when the visual image of any kind was rare
tapestries were an incredibly potent form of propaganda
because i saw the met as one of the few places where i could organize really big exhibitions about the subject i cared so passionately about
gave me the go ahead to organize an exhibition for two thousand and two
we normally have these very long lead in times
it wasn 't straightforward it 's no longer a question of chucking a tapestry shipped in oversized freighters
some of them are so big we had to get them into the museum we had to take them up the great steps at the front
we thought very hard about how to present this unknown subject to a modern audience
the dark colors to set off the colors that remained in objects that were often faded
the placing of lights to bring out the silk and the gold thread
these were big complex things
there was a lot of skepticism on the opening night i overheard one of the senior members of staff saying
this is going to be a bomb
hundreds of thousands of people
came to see the show
the exhibition was designed to be an experience and tapestries are hard to reproduce in photographs
so i want you to use your imaginations thinking of these wall high objects some of them ten meters wide
depicting lavish court scenes with courtiers and dandies who would look quite at home in the pages of the fashion press today
thick woods with hunters crashing through the undergrowth in pursuit of wild boars and deer
violent battles with scenes of fear and heroism
i remember taking my son 's school class he was eight at the time and all the little boys
there was a dog pooping in the foreground laughter kind of an in your face joke by the artist and you can just imagine them but it brought it alive to them i think they suddenly
through this experience that could only be created in a museum i 'd opened up the eyes of my audience
historians artists press the general public to the beauty of this lost medium
a few years later i was invited to be the director of the museum
and after i got over that
who me the tapestry geek
i don 't wear a tie i realized the fact i believe passionately in that curated museum experience
we live in an age of ubiquitous information and sort of just add water expertise
but there 's nothing that compares with the presentation of significant objects
in a well told narrative what the curator does the interpretation of a complex esoteric subject in a way that retains the integrity of the subject that makes it unpacks it for a general audience
and that to me today is now the challenge and the fun of my job supporting the vision of my curators
whether it 's an exhibition of samurai swords early byzantine artifacts renaissance portraits or the show we heard mentioned earlier
that was an interesting case in the late spring early summer of two thousand and ten
shortly after mcqueen 's suicide
and we proceeded to do something at the museum i think we 've never done before
it wasn 't just your standard installation
in fact we ripped down the galleries to recreate entirely different settings a recreation of his first studio a hall of mirrors a curiosity box
a sunken ship a burned out interior with videos and soundtracks that ranged from operatic arias to pigs fornicating
and in this extraordinary setting the costumes
it could have been a train wreck
it could have looked like
shop windows on fifth avenue at christmas
but because of the way that andrew connected with the mcqueen team
he was channeling the rawness and the brilliance of mcqueen and the show was quite transcendant and it became a phenomenon in its own right by the end of the show we had people queuing for four or five hours to get into the show
now i 've described two very immersive exhibitions but i also believe that collections individual objects can also have that same power
the met was set up not as a museum of american art but of an encyclopedic museum
today one hundred and forty years later
that vision is as prescient as ever
because of course we live in a world of crisis of challenge and we 're exposed to it through the twenty four seven newsreels
it 's in our galleries
that we can unpack the civilizations the cultures that we 're seeing the current manifestation of whether it 's libya egypt syria
it 's in our galleries that we can explain and give greater understanding i mean our new islamic galleries are a case in point
opened ten years almost to the week after nine eleven
i think for most americans
knowledge of the islamic world was pretty slight before nine eleven and then it was thrust upon us
in one of america 's darkest hours and the perception was through the polarization of that terrible event
now in our galleries we show fourteen centuries of the development of different islamic
cultures across a vast geographic spread
and again hundreds of thousands of people have come to see these galleries since they opened last october replacing the museum
and i think those numbers are a resounding rejection of that notion
i mean don 't get me wrong i 'm a huge advocate of the web
it gives us a way of reaching out to audiences around the globe
but nothing replaces the authenticity of the object presented with passionate scholarship
bringing people face to face with our objects
is a way of bringing them face to face with people
across time across space whose lives may have been very different to our own
frustrations and achievements in their lives
and i think this is a process that helps us better understand ourselves
helps us make better decisions about where we 're going
the great hall at the met is one of the great portals of the world
from there you can walk in any direction to almost any culture
i frequently go out into the hall and the galleries and i watch our visitors coming in
others are very uneasy it 's an intimidating place
they feel that the institution is elitist
i want to put people in a contemplative frame of mind where
they 're prepared to be
a little bit lost to explore
to see the unfamiliar in the familiar
because for us it 's all about bringing them
capturing them at that moment of discomfort
when the inclination is kind of to reach for your iphone your blackberry
but to create a zone where their curiosity
or a dog pooping in the corner of a tapestry
or to bring it back to my tutor pietro
those dancing figures who are indeed knocking back the wine
and that nude figure in the left foreground of youthful sexuality
of youthful sexuality in that moment
our scholarship can tell you
that this is a bacchanal
but if we 're doing our job right
and you 've checked the jargon at the front door
