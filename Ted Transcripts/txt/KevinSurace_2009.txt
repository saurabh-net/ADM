to the climate it is unbelievably bad this is obviously that famous view now of the arctic which is likely to be gone at this point in the next three or four or five years
very very very scary so we all look at what we can do and when you look at the worldwide sources of co two fifty two percent are tied to buildings only nine percent is passenger cars
use recycled content from cement and steel manufacturing there is the inside of our lab we haven't shown this before but our people had to do some five
thousand different mixes to get this right to hit our targets and they worked absolutely very very very hard
so then we went forward and built our production line in china we don't build this production equipment any longer in the u s unfortunately we did the line install over the summer
we started right there with absolutely nothing you're seeing for the first time a brand new drywall production line not made using gypsum at all that's the finished production line there we got our first panel out on december third that is the slurry being poured onto paper basically
obviously very very excited but this has a huge huge impact on the environment we signed the first panel just a few weeks after that had a great signing ceremony leading to people hopefully using
these products across the world and we've got cradle to cradle gold on this thing we happened to win just recently the green product of the year for the re invention of doctorywall from popular science
everything around us has to change or we're not going to lick this problem don't listen to the people who say you can't do this because anyone can and these job losses
we can fix them with green collar jobs we've got four plants we're building this stuff around the country we're going as fast as we can two and a half million cars worth of
that you had so my hope is that when you leave ted you will look at reducing your carbon footprint in how ever you can do it and if you don't know how please find me i will help you
