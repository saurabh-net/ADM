here i'm honored by the invitation and thanks i would love to talk about stuff that i'm interested in but unfortunately i suspect that what i'm interested in won 't interest many other people
first off my badge says i'm an astronomer i would love to talk about my astronomy
but i suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer in non gray atmospheres and polarization of light in jupiter 's upper atmosphere are the number of people who 'd fit in a bus shelter so to talk about that
it would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened
i caught the guys and they turned out to be working for what was then the soviet kgb and stealing information and selling it and i'd love to talk about that and it but twenty years
but twenty years later
i find computer security frankly to be kind of boring it's tedious
the first time you do something
it's science the second time it's engineering
third time it's just being a technician
do something i do something else
second book nor am i going to talk about why i believe computers don't belong in schools
i feel that there's a massive and
the argument is so obvious to anyone who 's hung around a fourth grade classroom
doesn't need much talking about but i guess i may be very wrong about that and everything else that i've said so don't go back and read my dissertation it probably has lies in it as well
said that i outlined my talk about five minutes ago and
if you look at it over here the main thing i wrote on my thumb was the future i'm supposed to talk about the future yes
right and my feeling is asking
me to talk about the future is bizarre because i've got gray hair and so it's kind of silly for me to talk about the future in fact
i think that if you really want to know what the future 's going to be if you really want to know about the future
ask a technologist a scientist a physicist no
don't ask somebody who 's writing code
no if you want to know what society 's going to be like in twenty years
in fact don't ask just any kindergarten teacher ask an experienced one
the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation i
nor i suspect do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring
certainly all of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there
to me things aren't the future
i ask myself is what's society is going to be like
the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging and spend a huge amount of on screen time never gone bowling together
happening and the change that is happening is not one that is in software but
going to talk about i'd love to talk about it it 'd be fun but
i want to talk about what i'm doing now what am i doing now oh the other thing that i think i'd like to talk about is right over here right over here
is that visible what i'd like to talk is one sided things
i would dearly love to talk about things that have one side because
i love mobius loops i not only love mobius loops but i'm one of the very few people if not the only person in the world that makes klein bottles right away i hope that all of your eyes glaze over this is a klein bottle
for those of you in the audience who know you roll your eyes and say yup i know all about it it's one sided it's a bottle whose inside is its outside it has zero volume and it's
non orientable it has wonderful properties if you take two mobius loops and sew their common edge together you get one of these and i make them out of glass and i'd love to talk to you about this but i don't
however the d in ted of course stands for design just
two weeks ago i made you know i've been making small medium and big klein bottles for the trade but
what i've just made and i'm delighted to show you first time in public here
this is a klein bottle wine
although in four dimensions it shouldn 't be able to hold any fluid at all it's perfectly capable of doing so because our universe
the cool one that was a month of my life
although i would love to talk about topology i'm not going to
i'm not going to going to mention my
going to mention my away last summer
had collected photographs of me as mothers will do
and i looked over her album and she had collected a picture of me standing well sitting in
it sent me back soon after that
i found in another picture that she had a picture of me over here
of course is me this man is robert moog
the inventor of the moog synthesizer who passed away this past august
robert moog was a generous kind person a musician
who took time from his life to teach me a sophomore a freshman at suny buffalo he'd come up from trumansburg
mentoring me he'd come up and spend hours and hours with me
he wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school
bob 's passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us
anyone who 's a musician has been profoundly influenced by
say what i'm about to do what i'm about to do i hope you can recognize
a distorted sine wave almost a triangular wave upon this hewlett packard i can get to
this place over here right
kids kids is what i'm going to talk about is that okay it says kids over here that's what i'd like to talk about
for me at least i don't have a big enough head so i think locally and i act locally i feel that the best way i can help out
is to help out very very locally so ph d this and degree there and the
how come you ain't over here on the front lines
i strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do not just show up to class every now and then teach a solid week okay i'm teaching three quarters time but
one of the things that i've done for my science students is to tell them look i'm going to teach you
with my help of course and with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope measured the speed of light we were off by twenty five percent
how many eighth graders do you know of who have measured the speed of light
in addition to that we've measured the speed of sound
i'd love to measure the speed of light here i was all set to do it and i was thinking aw man i was just going to impose upon the powers that be and measure the speed of light and i'm all set to do it i'm all set to do it but then it turns out that to set up here
could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation and all of you know the wave equation is
of any wave is a constant when the frequency goes up the wavelength comes down wavelength goes up frequency goes down
if we have a wave here over here that's what's interesting
what they didn't tell you in physics in eighth grade physics but they should have and i wish they had was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound or light
you get a constant and that constant is the speed of sound
is know its frequency well that's easy i've got a frequency counter right here set it up to
around a above a above a there's an a more or less now so i know the frequency it's one point seven six
need now is to flip on another beam and the bottom beam is me talking right so anytime i talk you'd see it on the screen
over here and as i move this away from the source you'll notice
the spiral the slinky moves we're going through different nodes of
the wave coming out this way those of you who are physicists i hear you rolling your eyes but bear with me to measure the wavelength
all i need to do is measure
the distance from here one full wave over to here from here to here is the wavelength of sound so i'll put a here
here here
let 's go back to mister
the frequency is one point seven six kilohertz or one thousand seven hundred and sixty the wavelength was zero point two meters
let 's figure out what this is one point seven six
zero point two over here is three hundred and fifty two meters per second if you look it up in the book it's really
three hundred and forty three but here with kludgy material and lousy drink
to measure the speed of sound to
comes to what i wanted to say
go back to this picture of me a million years ago
and i'm like oh my god i'm studying physics landau lipschitz resnick and halliday i'm going home for a midterm a riot 's going on
there's a riot going on on campus
and the police are chasing me
i'm walking across campus cop comes and looks at me and says you you're a student
and a tear gas canister the size of a pepsi
i go running across campus quick as i can i duck into
behind me climb up go past this place where i see a pendulum ticking and i'm thinking oh yeah the square root of the length is proportional to its period
i keep climbing up go
back i go to a place where a dowel splits off there's a clock clock clock clock the time 's going backwards because i'm inside of it i'm thinking of lorenz contractions and
i climb up and there's this place way in the
when they cast bells they write inscriptions on them so i wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells and i look at it
i'm asking myself why am i here so at this time
i'd like to tell you the words inscribed upon the hayes hall tower bells all truth is one in
science and religion endeavor here for the steady evolution of mankind
from darkness to light from narrowness to broad mindedness from prejudice to tolerance
