and for quite a long time
a consumer it cannot be consciously a
it is helpless it doesn't know
afford to doubt the person
who tends the child it has to totally surrender
totally surrender that implies a lot of trust
that implies the trusted person won 't violate the trust
as the child grows it begins to discover that the person trusted
is violating the trust it doesn't know even the word violation therefore it has to
more difficult to really resolve the wordless self blame
the child grows to become an adult
so far it has been a consumer
but the growth of a human being lies in capacity to
cannot contribute unless one feels secure one
one feels i have enough
to be compassionate is not a joke it's not that simple one has to discover
a certain bigness in oneself that bigness should be centered on oneself not in terms of money not in terms of power you
not in terms of any status that you can command in the society
but it should be centered on oneself the self you are
that self it should be centered a
wholeness otherwise compassion is just a word and a dream
you can be compassionate occasionally more moved by
these two guys fight it out each one has got it can be
so far has no meaning one person
both the players have to come to the net and shake hands
and shake hands and
has to come to the net when he comes to the
you see his whole face changes
it looks as though he 's wishing that why
why no
human hearted is denied of that empathy no religion can demolish that by indoctrination
no culture no nation and nationalism nothing can touch it
because it is empathy and that capacity
you reach out to people you do something that makes a difference in somebody 's life even words even it transcends nation gender
it transcends nation gender why because
why because in
in then this occasional compassion
we are not talking about
mandate you cannot make a person
you can't say please love me
is something you discover it's not an action
but in the english language it is also an action
so one has got to discover a certain wholeness
i am going to cite the possibility of being
which is within our experience everybody 's experience
in spite of a very tragic life
one is happy in moments which are very few and far between and the one who is happy slapstick joke
accepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds
that means the whole universe known things and unknown things
all of them are totally accepted
and the object the scheme of things fuse into
experience common to all and sundry that experience confirms
in spite of all your limitations all your wants desires unfulfilled and and
and and finally baldness
you can be happy but the
the logic is that you don't need to fulfill your desire to be
you are the very happiness the wholeness that you want to be there's no choice in this that only
the wholeness cannot be different from you cannot be minus you
it has got to be you you cannot be a part of wholeness and still be
moment of happiness reveals that reality that realization that recognition
i am the whole maybe the swami is right maybe the swami is right you start your new life then everything becomes meaningful
i have no more reason to blame myself
if one has to blame oneself one has a million reasons plus many but if i say in spite of my body being limited
if it is black it is not white if it is white it is not black
is limited any which way you look at it limited your knowledge is limited health is limited
is going to be limitless you cannot command compassion
are not period and there is no way of your being not limitless too your own experience
in spite of all limitations you are the
and the wholeness is the reality of you when you relate to the world it is
relate to the world the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness is what we say becomes compassion
if the object that you relate to that
then that again transforms into giving into sharing you express
you learn swimming by swimming you cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water
you learn swimming by swimming you learn cycling by cycling you learn cooking by cooking having some sympathetic people around you to
and therefore what i say you have to fake it and make it you
you meant that
meant that you
is no verb for compassion but you have
for compassion that's interesting to me you act compassionately
but then how to act compassionately if you don't have compassion that is where you fake you fake it and make it this is the mantra of the united states of
you fake it and make it
you act compassionately as though you have compassion grind your teeth take all the support system if you know how to
wholeness and that's what you are with these words thank you
