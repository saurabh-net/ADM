i'd like to ask you what do these three people have in common
who is a contestant indeed a finalist in the poet of the millions competition which is broadcast out of abu dahbi and seen throughout the arab world
in this contest people have to write and recite original poetry in the nabati form of poetry which is the traditional
form and lima sahar was a finalist in the afghan star singing competition
now before i go any further yes i know it all began with britain 's got talent but my point in discussing this is
to show you i hope i'll be able to show you how these merit based competitions with
and the arab world with the uae how they're changing tribal societies not by introducing western ideas but by being integrated into the language in those places it all begins with
these programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society in afghanistan people go to extraordinary lengths to be able to watch this program
and you don't necessarily have to have your own tv set people watch it all over the country also in public places but it goes beyond watching
because also part of this is campaigning people become so engaged that they have volunteers just like political volunteers anyway who fan out over the countryside
very conservative part of the country and here she relates in the documentary film afghan star how her friends urged her not to do this
and told her that she was leaving them for democracy but she also confides that she knows that members of the taliban are actually sms ing votes
also took risks and put herself out to compete in the poet of the millions competition
i have to say her husband backed her from the start but her tribe and family urged her not to compete
and were very much against it but once she started to win then they got behind her again it turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value
and she's out there her poetry is about women and the life of women in society so just by
now you'd think that american idol would introduce a measure of americanization but actually just the opposite is happening by using this engaging popular format
for traditional local culture it actually in the gulf is precipitating a revival of interest in nabati poetry also in traditional dress and dance and music
and for afghanistan where the taliban banned music for many years it is reintroducing their traditional music they don't sing pop songs
they sing afghan music and they also have learned how to lose gracefully without avenging the winner no small thing and
the final sort of formulation of this american idol format which has just appeared in afghanistan is a new program called the candidate
and in this program people present policy platforms that are then voted on many of them are too young to run for president
but by putting the issues out there they are influencing the presidential race so for me the substance of things unseen is how reality tv is driving reality thank you
