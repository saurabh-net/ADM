speaking to a group of about three hundred kids ages six to eight at a children 's museum and i brought with me a bag full of legs similar to the kinds of things you see up here and had them laid out on a table
the kids and from my experience you know kids are naturally curious about what they don't know or don't understand or what is foreign to them
only learn to be frightened of those differences when an adult influences them to behave that way and maybe censors that natural curiosity or you know reins in the question asking in the hopes of them being polite little kids
so i just pictured a first grade teacher out in the lobby with these unruly kids saying now whatever you do don't stare at her legs but
that's the point that's why i was there i wanted to invite them to look and explore so i made a deal with the adults that the kids could come in without any adults for two minutes on their own the doors open
the kids descend on this table of legs and they are poking and prodding and they're wiggling toes and they're trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg to see what happens with that and i said kids
really quickly i woke up this morning i decided i wanted to be able to jump over a house
dream up right now what kind of legs would you build me and immediately a voice
and other things that i don't aren't familiar with and then one eight year old said hey why wouldn't you want to
and the whole room including me was like yeah
i went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see as disabled
to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn't have yet somebody that might even be super abled
some of you actually saw me at ted eleven years ago and
a lot of talk about how life changing this conference is for both speakers and attendees and i am no exception
ted literally was the launch pad to the next decade of my life 's exploration
at the time the legs i presented were groundbreaking in prosthetics i had woven carbon fiber sprinting legs modeled after the hind leg of a cheetah which you may have seen on stage yesterday
and also these very life like intrinsically painted silicone legs
so at the time it was my opportunity to put a call out to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community to come bring their talent to the science and to the art
of building legs so that we can stop compartmentalizing form function and aesthetic and assigning them different values
well lucky for me a lot of people answered that call and the journey started funny enough with a ted conference attendee chee pearlman who hopefully is in the audience somewhere today she was the editor then of a magazine called id
and she gave me a cover story
on the design of the cheetah legs around the world people would come up to me after the conference after my talk men and women and the conversation would go something like this
you're very attractive you don't look disabled
i thought well that's amazing because i don't feel
and it really opened my eyes to this conversation that could be explored about beauty what does a beautiful woman have to look like
sexy body and interestingly from an identity standpoint what does it mean to have a disability
i mean people pamela anderson has more prosthetic in her body than i do nobody calls her disabled
so this magazine through the hands of graphic designer peter saville went to fashion designer alexander mcqueen and photographer nick knight who were also interested in exploring that conversation so three months after ted i found myself on a plane
to london doing my first fashion shoot which resulted in this cover fashion able three months after that
i did my first runway show for alexander mcqueen on a pair of hand carved wooden legs made from solid ash nobody knew everyone thought they were wooden boots actually i have them on stage with me
into something that invites them to look and look a little longer and maybe even understand
i learned this firsthand with my next adventure the artist matthew barney in his film opus called the the cremaster cycle
this is where it really hit home for me that my legs could be wearable sculpture and even at this point i started to move away from the need to replicate human ness as the only aesthetic ideal
so we made what people lovingly referred to as glass legs even though they're actually optically clear polyurethane a k a bowling ball material heavy then we made these legs that are
with a potato root system growing in them and beetroots out the top and a very lovely brass toe that's a good close up of that one
then another character was a half woman half cheetah a little homage to my life as an athlete
that whipped around like a gecko and then another pair of legs
we collaborated on were these look like jellyfish legs also polyurethane and the only purpose that these legs can serve outside the context of the film is to so whimsy
legs that various people have made for me and with them i have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet and i can change my height i have a variable of five different heights
and she looked at me and she said but
as you want it and that's when i knew that's when i knew that the conversation with society has changed profoundly in this last decade
it is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency it's a conversation about
limb doesn't represent the need to replace loss anymore
it can stand as a symbol that the wearer has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create in that space
so people that society once considered to be
can now become the architects of their own identities and indeed continue to change those identities
by designing their bodies from a place of empowerment
and what is exciting to me so much right now
is that by combining cutting edge technology robotics bionics with the age old poetry
that if we want to discover the full potential in our humanity
we need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengths and those glorious disabilities that we all have
i think of shakespeare 's shylock
if you prick us do we not bleed
and if you tickle us do we not laugh it is our humanity
and all the potential within it
that makes us beautiful thank you
