when i first arrived in beautiful zimbabwe it was difficult to understand that thirty five percent of the population is hiv positive
it really wasn't until i was invited to the homes of people that i started to understand the human toll
the epidemic for instance this is herbert with his grandmother when i first met him
of aids he liked to sit on her lap because he said that it was painful for him to lay in his own bed when she got up to make tea she placed him in my own lap and i had
felt a child that was that
this is joyce who 's in this picture twenty one single mother hiv positive i photographed her before and after the birth of her
i didn't know but she called to tell me that joyce had passed away at the age of twenty three joyce 's mother is now taking care of her daughter
with every picture there are individuals who have full lives and stories that deserve to be told all these pictures are from zimbabwe
tell your own story of how you got to africa
i was constantly reading the new york times and stunned by the statistics the numbers it was just frightening so i quit my job
that that's the subject that i wanted to tackle and i first actually went to botswana where i spent a month this is in december two thousand then went to zimbabwe for a month and a half
and then went back again this march two thousand and two for another month and a half in zimbabwe ca that's an amazing story
