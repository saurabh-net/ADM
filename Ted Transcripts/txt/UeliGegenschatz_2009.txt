with the possibility to fly cross country distance just with the use of thermals to soar also different aerobatic
possible with a paraglider from there i started with skydiving in this picture you can see there is a four way skydive
for the film itself and also for the judging from regular relative skydiving i went on to freeflying freeflying is more the three dimensional
flying head down and that's me in the background carving around the whole formation in freefall also with the helmet cam to film this jump
from freeflying i went on to skysurfing skysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet you can imagine with this big
a skysurfing board there is a lot of force a lot of power of course i can use this power for example for nice spinning we call it helicopter moves
from there i went on to wingsuit flying wingsuit flying is a suit that i can make fly just only with my body
put some tension on my body tension on my suit i can make it fly and as you see the fall rate is much much slower because of the
with a proper body position i'm able to really move forward to gain quite some distance this is a jump i did in rio de janeiro you can see the
from there with all the skills and knowledge from paragliding and all the different disciplines in skydiving i went on to base jumping
base jumping is skydiving from fixed objects like buildings
and earth meaning mountains cliffs it's for sure for me it's the ultimate feeling of being in free fall with all the visual references
so my goal soon was to discover new places that nobody had jumped before so in summer two thousand i was the first to base jump the eiger north face in switzerland
two years after this i was the first to base jump from matterhorn a very famous mountain that probably everybody knows in here
two thousand and five i did a base jump from the eiger from the monk and from the jungfrau three very
two thousand and eight i jumped the eiffel tower in paris
so with some friends we started to do different tricks like for example this jump here i jumped from a paraglider or here everybody
was freezing pretty much except me because it was very cold in austria where we did this filming everybody sitting in a basket and i was on top of the balloon ready to slide down with my
from a moving truck on the
of course you need to be in physical
very good condition so i'm training a lot you need to have the best possible equipment and
so for two thousand and nine i'm training hard for my two new projects the first one i want to set a
in flying from a cliff with my wingsuit and i want to set a new record with the longest distance
for my second project i have a sensational idea of a jump that never has been done before
following movie you will see that i'm much better in flying a wingsuit than speaking in english enjoy and thank you very much
pretty much i believe this is probably the closest possibility to come to the dream of being able to fly
not possible to land a wingsuit yet jc yet but people are trying are you among those you're not going to commit are you among those trying to do it ue it's a dream it's a dream yeah we're still working on it
and we're developing the wingsuits to get better performance to get more knowledge and
no smoke is for two reasons you can see the speed you can see the way where i was flying that's reason number one and reason number two it's much easier for the camera guy to film
so the wingsuit is set up to deliberately release smoke so that you can be tracked one more question what do you do to to cover your face because i just keep thinking of going that fast and having your whole face smushed backwards are you in a
and is that how you usually
a helmet in the mountains i'm always wearing a helmet because of landings usually it's difficult it's not like regular skydiving where you have like the big landings so you have to be prepared
now is there anything you don't do do people come to you with projects and say i started
