so a funny thing happened on my way to becoming a brilliant world class neuropsychologist i had a baby
that's not to say i ever went on to become a brilliant world class neuropsychologist sorry ted but i did go on to be a reasonably astute arguably world class worrier
one of my girlfriends in graduate school marie said kim i figured it out it's not that you're more neurotic than everyone else it's just that you're more honest about how neurotic you are
so in the spirit of full disclosure i brought some pictures to share awwww i'll just say july
i'll just say july zzzzzzip
for safety water wings an inch of water
and then finally all suited up for the ninety minute drive to copper mountain so
get kind of a feel for this so my baby vander is eight years old now and
because this is what i do this is what i teach it's what i study it's what i treat and i know that kids get concussed every year
and so when kids sustain a concussion we talk about them getting dinged or getting their bell rung but what is it that we're really talking about let 's take
how many g 's close seventy two would it be crazy
to know one hundred and three g 's the average concussive impact is ninety five g 's now when the kid on the right doesn't get up
we know they've had a concussion but how about the kid on the left or the athlete that leaves the field of play how do we know if he or she has sustained a concussion
how do we know that legislation that would require that they be pulled from play cleared for return to play applies to them
the definition of concussion doesn't actually require a loss of consciousness it requires only a change in consciousness and that can be any one or a number of symptoms including
feeling foggy feeling dizzy hearing a ringing in your ear being more impulsive or hostile than usual
so given all of that and given how darn neurotic i am how do i get any sleep at all because i know our brains are
designed to recover from an injury if god forbid any of us left here tonight and sustained a concussion most of us would go on to fully recover inside of a couple hours to a couple of weeks
but kids are more vulnerable to brain injury in fact high school athletes are three times more likely to sustain catastrophic injuries relative even to their college age peers and it takes them longer to return to a symptom free baseline
first injury their risk for
injury is exponentially greater from there their risk for a third injury greater still and so on
really alarming part we don't fully understand the long term impact of multiple injuries
you guys may be familiar with this research that's coming out of the nfl in a nutshell this research suggests that
among retired nfl players with three or more career concussions the incidents of early onset dementing disease is much greater than it is for the general population
it weird that my forty six year old husband is forever losing his keys isn't it weird that my forty seven year old husband is forever losing the car
isn't it weird that my forty eight year old husband is forever losing his way home in the car from the driveway
so i may have forgotten to mention that my son is an only child so it's going to be really important that he be able to drive me around
so how do we guarantee the safety of our kids how can we one hundred percent guarantee the safety of our kids let me tell you what i've come up with if
only my little boy 's right there and he 's like she 's not
so in all seriousness should my kid play football should your kid play football
i don't know but i do know there are three things you can do the first study up you have to be familiar with the issues we're talking about today
there are some great resources out there the cdc has a program heads up it's at cdc gov heads up is specific to concussion in kids
the second is a resource i'm personally really proud of we've just rolled this out in the last couple months co kids with brain injury
this is a great resource for student athletes teachers parents professionals athletic and coaching staff it's a great place to start if you have questions
the second thing is speak up just
ago a bill introduced by senator kefalas that would have required athletes kids under eighteen to wear a helmet when they're riding their bike died in committee
it died in large part because it lacked constituent buy in it lacked stakeholder traction
now i'm not here to tell you what kind of legislation you should or shouldn 't support but i am going to tell you that if it matters to you your legislators need to know
suit up wear a helmet the only way to prevent a bad outcome is to prevent that first injury from happening
and tom knows that that little bit of foam in a bike helmet can reduce the g force of impact by half now i thought that it was because i have this totally compelling helmet crusade right this epiphany of tom 's
as it turns out it occurred to tom that a twenty dollar helmet is a good way to protect one hundred thousand dollar graduate education so
so should vander play football
i can't say no but i can guarantee that every time he leaves the house that kid 's wearing a helmet
like to the car or
so whether athlete scholar over protected kid neurotic mom or otherwise
here 's my baby vander reminding you to mind your matter
