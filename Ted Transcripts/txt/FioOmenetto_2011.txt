high technology and maybe along the way also do some stuff for medicine and for global health and help reforestation so that 's kind of a bold statement i 'll tell you a little bit more this material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true it 's sustainable it 's a sustainable material that is processed all in water and at room temperature
and is biodegradable with a clock so you can watch it dissolve instantaneously in a glass of water or have it stable for years it 's edible
it 's implantable in the human body without causing any immune response it actually gets reintegrated in the body and it 's technological so it can do things like microelectronics
in fact this material you see is clear and transparent the components of this material are just water and protein so this material is silk so it 's kind of different from what we 're used to thinking about silk so the question is how do you reinvent something that has been around for five millennia
the process of discovery generally is inspired by nature and so we marvel at silk worms the silk worm you see here spinning its fiber the silk worm does a remarkable thing it uses these two ingredients protein and water that are in its gland
to make a material that is exceptionally tough for protection so comparable to technical fibers like kevlar and so in the reverse engineering process that we know about and that we 're familiar with for the textile industry the textile industry goes
and unwinds the cocoon and then weaves glamorous things we want to know how you go from water and protein to this liquid kevlar to this natural kevlar so the insight is how do you actually reverse engineer this
and go from cocoon to gland and get water and protein that is your starting material and this is an insight that came about two decades ago
from a person that i 'm very fortunate to work with david kaplan and so we get this starting material
and so this starting material is back to the basic building block and then we use this to do a variety of things like for example this film and we take advantage of something that is very simple the recipe to make those films
and you wait for the protein to self assemble
and then you detach the protein and you get this film as the proteins find each other as the water evaporates but i mentioned that the film is also technological and so what does that mean it means that you can
that is on the dvd
and we can store information that 's film with water and protein so we tried something out and we wrote a message in a piece of silk which is right here and the message is over there and much like in the dvd you can read it out optically
and this requires a stable hand so this is why i decided to do it onstage in front of a thousand people so let me see so as you see the
the film go in transparently through there and then
and the most remarkable feat is that my hand actually stayed still long enough to do that so once you have these attributes of this material then you can do a lot of things it 's actually not limited to films and so the material can assume
a lot of formats and then you go a little crazy and so you do various optical components or you do microprism arrays like the reflective tape that you have on your running shoes
or you can do beautiful things that if the camera can capture you can make you can add a third dimensionality to the film and if the angle is right you can actually see a hologram appear in this film of silk
but you can do other things you can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light and so we 've made optical fibers but silk is versatile and it goes beyond optics and you can think of different formats so for instance
if you 're afraid of going to the doctor and getting stuck with a needle we do microneedle arrays what you see there on the screen is a human hair superimposed on the needle that 's made of silk just to give you a sense of size
so there 's versatility as you see in the material formats that you can do with silk but there are still some unique traits i mean why would you want to do all these things for real i mentioned it briefly at the beginning the protein is biodegradable and biocompatible and you see here a picture of a tissue section
and so what does that mean that it 's biodegradable and biocompatible you can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted which means that all the devices that you 've seen before and all the formats in principle
like this can be thrown away without guilt applause unlike
it 's edible so you can do smart packaging around food that you can cook with the food it doesn 't taste good so
i 'm going to need some help with that but probably the most remarkable thing is that it comes full circle silk during its self assembly process acts like a cocoon for biological matter and so if you change the recipe and you add things when you pour so you add things to your liquid silk solution
that you thought about beforehand can actually be used to screw a bone together a fractured bone together and deliver drugs at the same while your bone is healing for example or
what is inside it so it allows for the recovery of what we 've stored before and so this allows for a controlled delivery of drugs and for reintegration in the environment in all of these formats that you 've seen so the thread of discovery that we have really is a thread
we 're impassioned with this idea that whatever you want to do whether you want to replace a vein or a bone or maybe be more sustainable in microelectronics
perhaps drink a coffee in a cup and throw it away without guilt maybe carry your drugs in your pocket deliver them inside your body or deliver them across the desert the answer may be in a thread of silk thank you
