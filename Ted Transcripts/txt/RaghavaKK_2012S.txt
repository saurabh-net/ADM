seventy five years ago my grandfather a young man
walked into a tent that was converted into a movie theater like that
you know my grandfather died many years ago when i was little but his love for mae west lives on as a misspelling in the dna of his progeny that for me is successful legacy
because you know we both come from families that really look up to humility and wisdom but we both like to live larger than life
i believe in the concept of a raja yogi be a dude before you can become an ascetic this is me being a rock star even if it 's in my own house
you know so when netra and i sat down to make our first plan ten years ago
will ever live beyond two hundred years so we thought that 's a perfect place where we should situate our plan
and let our imagination take flight
you know i never really believed in legacy what am i going to leave behind i 'm an artist
until i made a cartoon about nine eleven
ended up staying so much longer
now i 'm in the business of creating art that will definitely even outlive me and i think about what i want to leave behind through those paintings you know the nine eleven cartoon upset me so much that i decided i 'll never cartoon again i said i 'm never going to make any honest public commentary again
because i forgot about how people reacted to my work you know sometimes forgetting is so important to remain idealistic
perhaps loss of memory is so crucial for our survival as human beings
i really make decisions all the time about how i want to remember myself and that 's the most important kind of decisions i make and this directly translates into my paintings but like my friends i can
and i rather think of our brains as biased curators of our memory you know and if technology is not a metaphor for memory what is it
is a picture of my mother and she recently got a facebook account you know where this is going and i 've been very supportive until
and she said why you look so cute darling i said you just don 't understand
maybe we are among the first generation that really understands this digital curating of ourselves maybe we are the first to even actively record our lives you know whether you agree with you know legacy or not we are actually leaving behind digital traces all the time
so netra and i really wanted to use our two hundred year plan
when i think of the future i never see myself moving forward in time i actually see time moving backward towards me
i can actually visualize my future approaching i can dodge what i don 't want and pull in what i want it 's like a video game obstacle course and i 've gotten better and better at doing this even when i make a painting i actually imagine i 'm behind the painting it already exists and someone 's looking at it
and i see whether they 're feeling it from their gut are they feeling it from their heart or is it just a cerebral thing and it really informs my painting even when i do an art show i really think about what should people walk away with
i remember when i was nineteen i did i wanted to do my first art exhibition
and i wanted the whole world to know about it i didn 't know ted then but what i did was i closed my eyes tight and i started dreaming i could imagine people coming in dressed up looking beautiful my paintings with all the light
and in my visualization i actually saw a very famous actress launching my show giving credibility to me and i woke up from my visualization and i said who was that i couldn 't tell if it was shabana azmi or rekha two very famous indian actresses like the meryl streeps of india
as it turned out next morning i wrote a letter to both of them
and shabana azmi replied and came and launched my very first show twelve years ago
and what a bang it started my career with you know when we think of time in this way we can curate not only the future but also the past
this is a picture of my family and that is netra my wife she 's the co creator of my two hundred year plan netra 's a high school history teacher i love netra but i hate history i keep saying nets you live in the past while i 'll create the future
and when i 'm done you can study about it
she gave me an indulgent smile
and as punishment she said tomorrow i 'm teaching a class on indian history and you are sitting in it and i 'm grading you i 'm like oh god i went i actually went and sat in on her class
she started by giving students
primary source documents from india pakistan from britain and i said wow then she asked them to separate fact from bias
an image of your own story of dignity
history as an imaging tool
i was so inspired i went and created my own version of
you know if this is so it occurred to me that maybe just maybe the primary objective of our brains is to serve our dignity
don 't write our two hundred year
no we actually write it only to set our attitudes right you know
i used to believe that education is the most important tool to leave a meaningful legacy education is great it really teaches us who we are and helps us contextualize ourselves in the world but it 's really my creativity that 's taught me that i can be much more than what my education told me i am
i 'd like to make the argument that creativity is the most important tool we have it lets us create who we are and curate what is to come i like to think thank you i like to think of myself as a storyteller where my past and my future
