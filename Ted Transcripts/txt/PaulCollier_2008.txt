so can we dare to be optimistic well the thesis of the bottom billion is that a billion people have been stuck living in economies that have been stagnant for forty years
and hence diverging from the rest of
and so the real question to pose is not can we be optimistic it 's how can we give credible hope to that billion people
that to my mind is the fundamental challenge now of development
what i'm going to offer you
living in societies that have not offered credible hope
that is a human tragedy enlightened self interest
because if that economic divergence continues for another forty years
combined with social integration globally
it will build a nightmare for
we need compassion to get ourselves started
and enlightened self interest to get ourselves serious
that's the alliance that changes the world
so what does it mean to get serious about providing hope for the bottom billion
what can we actually do
what did we do last time the rich world got serious about developing another region of the world that gives us it turns out quite a good clue
the last time the rich world got serious about developing another region was in the late nineteen forties
the rich world was you america
and the region that needed to be developed was my world europe
why did america get serious
it wasn't just compassion for europe though there was that
it was that you knew you had to
because in the late nineteen forties country after country in central europe was falling into the soviet bloc
and so you knew you'd no choice
europe had to be dragged into economic development so what did you do last time you got serious
well yes you had a big aid program thank you very much that was marshall aid we need to do it again
aid is part of the solution but what else
before the war america had been highly protectionist after the war
you opened your markets to europe you dragged europe into the then global economy which was your economy and you institutionalized that trade liberalization through founding the general agreement on tariffs
so total reversal of trade policy did you do anything else yes you totally reversed your security policy before the war your security policy had been isolationist
after the war you tear that up you put one hundred thousand troops in europe for over forty years
total reversal of security policy anything else yes you tear up the eleventh commandment
you treated national sovereignty as so sacrosanct that you weren't even willing to join the league of nations
after the war you found the united nations you found the organization for economic cooperation and development you found the imf you encouraged europe
to create the european community all systems for mutual government support
that is still the waterfront of effective policies aid trade security governments
the details of policy are going to be different because the challenge is different it's not rebuilding europe
it's reversing the divergence for the bottom billion so that they actually catch up is that easier or harder
we need to be at least as serious as we
now today i'm going to take just one of those four i'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest the one that's just motherhood and apple pie
we could do something to strengthen governance
and i'm going to show you that that is enormously important now the opportunity
is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion
and that is the commodity booms the commodity booms
pumping unprecedented amounts of money into many though not all of the countries of the bottom billion
it's not just that there's also a range of new discoveries
guinea has got a huge new exploitation of iron ore coming out of the ground so a mass of new discoveries between them
these new revenue flows dwarf aid just to give you one example angola alone
is getting fifty billion dollars a year in oil revenue the entire aid flows to the sixty countries of the bottom billion last year were thirty four
the flow of resources from the commodity booms to the bottom billion so there's the optimism
so here comes a bit of science and this is a bit of science i've done since the bottom billion so it's new
i've looked to see what is the relationship between higher commodity prices of exports and the growth of commodity exporting countries
and i've looked globally i've taken all the countries in the world for the last forty years and looked to see what the relationship and the
the first five to seven years is just great
in fact it's hunky dory everything goes up
get more money because your terms of trade have improved but also that drives up output across the board so gdp goes up a lot
and how about the long
come back fifteen years later
well the short run it's hunky dory but the long run it's humpty dumpty
you go up in the short run but then most societies historically have ended up worse than if they'd had no booms at all that is not a forecast about how commodity prices
it's a forecast of the consequences the long term consequences for growth of an increase in prices
so what goes wrong why is there this resource
and again i've looked at that and it turns out that the critical issue is the level of
the initial level of economic governance when the resource booms accrue
in fact if you've got good enough governance there is no resource boom you go up in the short term
the question is whether the short run will persist
there's a threshold level above which you go up in the long term and below which you go down just to benchmark that threshold it's about the governance level of portugal in the mid nineteen eighties
so the question is are the bottom billion above
now there's one big change
since the commodity booms of the nineteen seventies and that is the spread of democracy
of these resource booms than autocracies
at that stage i just wanted to abandon the research
it turns out that democracy is a little bit more complicated than that because there are two distinct aspects of democracy
it turns out that electoral competition is the thing that's doing the damage with democracy whereas strong checks and balances
make resource booms good and so what the countries of the bottom billion need is very strong checks and balances
they haven't got them they got instant democracy in the nineteen nineties elections without checks and balances how can we help
the simple proposal is that we should have some international standards which will be voluntary but which would spell out the key decision points
need to be taken in order to harness these resource revenues
we know these international standards work because we've already got one it's called the extractive industries transparency initiative
that is the very simple idea that governments should report to their citizens what revenues they have
was it proposed than reformers in nigeria adopted it
so we know it works what would the content be of these international standards
through all of them but i'll give you an example the first is
how to take the resources out of the ground the economic processes taking the resources out of the ground and putting assets on top of the
and the first step in that is selling the rights to resource extraction
you know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment how they've been sold over the last forty years
a company flies in does a deal with a minister and that's great for the company and it's quite often great for the minister
and it's called verified auctions
the public agency with the greatest expertise on earth is of course the treasury that is the british treasury and the british treasury decided that it would sell the rights to third generation mobile phones by working out what those rights
worked out they were worth two billion pounds just in time a set of economists got there and said why not try an auction it'll reveal the
it went for twenty billion pounds through auction if the british treasury can be out by a factor of ten think what the ministry of finance in sierra leone is
put that to the president of sierra leone the next day he asked the world bank to send him a team to give expertise on how to conduct
there are five such decision points each one needs an international standard if we could do it
change the world we would be helping
the reformers in these societies who are struggling for change that's our modest
we cannot change these societies but we can help the people in these societies who are struggling and usually failing
and yet we've not got these rules
if you think about it the cost of promulgating international rules is zilch
why on earth are they not
i realized that the reason they're not
will get away with gestures
that unless we have an informed society what politicians do especially in relation to africa is gestures
things that look good but don't and so i realized
we had to go through the business of building an informed citizenry that's why i broke all the professional rules of conduct for an economist and i wrote an economics book that you could read on a beach
however i have to say the process of communication does not come naturally to me this is why i'm on this stage but it's
i grew up in a culture of self
my wife showed me a blog comment on one of my last talks and the blog comment said collier is not charismatic but his arguments
you agree with that sentiment
and if you agree that we need a critical mass of informed citizenry you will realize that i need you
please become ambassadors thank you
