organizations work and in particular how the simple parts of organizations
to create the behavior of the whole organization so ant colonies are a good example of an organization like that and there are many others the web is one there are many biological systems like
cells developing embryos there are about ten thousand species of ants
they all live in colonies consisting of one or a few queens and then all the ants you see walking around are sterile female workers
no ant directs the behavior of any other ant and i try to figure out how that works
and i've been working for the past twenty years on a population of seed eating ants in southeastern arizona here 's my study site this is really a picture of ants and the rabbit just happens to be there
and these ants are called harvester ants because they eat seeds this is the nest of the mature colony and there's the nest entrance
and they forage maybe for about twenty meters away gather up the seeds and bring them back to the nest and store them
and every year i go there and make a map of my study site this is just a road and it's not very big it's about two hundred and fifty meters on one side four hundred on the other and every colony has a name which is a number which is painted on a and i go there
year and look for all the colonies that were alive the year before and figure out which ones have died and put all the new ones on the map and by doing this i know how old they all are and because of that i've been able to study how their behavior changes
as the colony grows older and larger so i want to tell you about the life cycle of a colony ants never make more ants colonies make more colonies
and they do that by each year sending out the reproductives those are the ones with wings on a mating flight so every year on the same day and it's a mystery exactly how that
each colony sends out its virgin unmated queens with wings and the males and they all fly to a
and they mate and this shows a recently virgin queen here 's her wings and she's in the process of mating with this male
and then the newly mated queens fly off somewhere drop their wings dig a hole and go into that hole and start laying eggs and they will
live for fifteen or twenty years continuing to lay eggs using the sperm from that original mating
so the queen goes down in there she lays eggs she feeds the larvae so an ant starts as an egg then it's a larva she feeds the larvae by regurgitating from her fat reserves
then as soon as the ants the first group of ants emerge they're larvae then they're pupae then they come out as adult ants they go out they get the food they dig the nest and the queen
old colony this happens to be five hundred and thirty six there's the nest entrance there's a pencil for scale so this is the colony founded by a queen the previous summer
this is a three year old colony there's the nest entrance there's a pencil for scale they make a midden a pile of refuse mostly the husks of the seeds that they eat this is a
this is the nest entrance here 's a pencil for scale this is about as big as they get about a meter across and then this is how colony size and numbers of worker ants
changes so this is about ten thousand worker ants changes as a function of colony age in years
so it starts out with zero ants just the founding queen and it grows to a size of about ten or twelve thousand ants when the colony is five
and it stays that size until the queen dies and there's nobody to make more ants when she's about fifteen or twenty years old
and it's when they reach this stable size in numbers of ants that they start to reproduce that is to send more winged queens and males to that year 's mating flight
and i know how colony size changes as a function of colony age because i've dug up colonies of known age and counted all the ants of this research
that i think about with these ants is what i call task allocation that's not just how is the colony organized but how does it change what it's doing
how is it that the colony manages to adjust the numbers of workers performing each task as conditions change so things happen to an ant colony
when it rains in the summer it floods in the desert there's a lot of damage to the nest and extra ants are needed to clean up that mess when extra food becomes available and this is what everybody knows about picnics then extra ants are allocated to collect the food
so with nobody telling anybody what to do how is it that the colony manages to adjust the numbers of workers performing each task and that's the process that i call task allocation
and in harvester ants i divide the tasks of the ants i see just outside the nest into these four categories where an ant is foraging
when it's out on the foraging trail searching for food or bringing food back the patrollers that's supposed to be a magnifying glass
then the nest maintenance workers work inside the nest and i wanted to say that the nests look a lot like bill lishman 's house
that is that there are chambers inside they line the walls of the chambers with moist soil and it dries to a kind of an adobe like surface in it it also looks very similar to some of the cave dwellings
of the hopi people that are in that area and the nest maintenance workers do that inside the nest and then they come out of the nest carrying bits of dry soil in their mandibles
territorial chemical in the garbage so what you see the midden workers doing is making a pile of refuse on one day it'll all be here and then the next day they'll move it over there and then they'll move it back so that's what the midden workers do
and these four groups are just the ants outside the nest so that's only about twenty five percent of the colony and they're the oldest ants
so an ant starts out somewhere near the queen and when we dig up nests we find they're about as deep as the colony is wide so about a meter deep for the big old nests and then there's another long
and a chamber where we often find the queen after eight hours of hacking away at the rock with pickaxes i don't think that chamber has evolved because of
me and my backhoe and my crew of students with pickaxes but instead because when there's flooding occasionally the colony has to go down deep so there's this whole network of chambers the queen 's in there somewhere she just lays eggs
there's the larvae and they consume most of the food and this is true of most ants that the ants you see walking around don't do much eating they bring it back and feed it to the larvae
when the foragers come in with food they just drop it into the upper chamber and other ants come up from below get the food bring it back husk the seeds and pile them up
the ants in the colony are just doing nothing so despite what it says in the bible
about you know look to the ant thou sluggard in fact you could think of those ants as reserves that is to say if something happened and i've never seen anything like this happen but i've only been looking for twenty years if something happened
and they sort of stand as a buffer in between the ants working deep inside the nest and the ants working outside and if you mark ants that are working outside and dig up a colony you never see them deep down
so what's happening is that the ants work inside the nest when they're younger they somehow get into this reserve and then eventually they get recruited to join this exterior
and once they belong to the ants that work outside they never go back down now ants most ants including these don't see very well they have eyes they can distinguish between light and dark
but they mostly work by smell so just to reinforce that what you might have thought about
queens isn't true you know even if the queen did have the intelligence to send chemical messages through this whole network of chambers to tell the ants
what to do there is no way that such messages could make it in time to see the shifts in the allocations of workers that we actually
see outside the nest so that's one way that we know the queen isn't directing the behavior of the colony so when i first set out to work on task allocation my first question was what 's the relationship
between the ants doing different tasks does it matter to the foragers what the nest maintenance workers are doing does it matter to the midden workers what the patrollers are doing and i was working
in the context of a view of ant colonies in which each ant was somehow dedicated to its task from birth and sort of performed independently of the others
of toothpicks near the nest entrance early in the morning when the nest maintenance workers are first active
this is what it looks like about twenty minutes later here it is about forty minutes later and the nest maintenance workers just take all the toothpicks to the outer edge of the
on the workers performing other tasks
the ants marked so here 's some blue nest maintenance workers and lately we've gotten more sophisticated and we have this three color system and we
then i see fewer ants out foraging and this was true for all the pair wise combinations of tasks and the second result
which was surprising to a lot of people was that ants actually switch tasks the same ant doesn't do the same task over and over its whole life
i put out extra food everybody else the midden workers stop doing midden work and go get the food they become foragers the nest maintenance workers become foragers the patrollers become foragers
if there's more patrolling to do so i created a disturbance so extra patrollers were needed the nest maintenance workers will switch to patrol but if more nest maintenance work is needed for example if i put out a bunch of toothpicks
then nobody will ever switch back to nest maintenance they have to get nest maintenance workers from inside the nest so foraging acts as a sink and the ants inside the
act as a source and finally it looks like each ant is deciding moment to moment whether to be active or not so
for example when there's extra nest maintenance work to do it's not that the foragers switch over i know that they don't do that but the foragers somehow decide
and here was the most intriguing result the task allocation this process changes with colony age and it changes like this
when i do these experiments with older colonies so ones that are five years or older they're much more consistent from one time to another and much more homeostatic
the worse things get the more i hassle them the more they act like undisturbed colonies whereas the young small colonies the two year old colonies of just two thousand ants are much more variable and the
than the ants in the younger colony it's not due to the experience of older wiser ants instead something about the organization must be changing
as the colony gets older and the obvious thing that's changing is its size so since i've had this result i've spent a lot of time
the outcome that i see these predictable dynamics in who does what task and it would change as the colony gets larger and what
ants are using a network of antennal contact so anybody who 's ever looked at ants has seen them touch antennae
they smell with their antennae when one ant touches another it's smelling it and it can tell for example whether the other ant is a nest mate because ants
in deciding what to do and so what the message is is not any message that they transmit from one ant to another but the
i'm a forager i expect to meet another forager every so often but if instead i start to meet a higher number of nest maintenance workers i'm less likely to forage so it has to know the difference between a forager and a nest maintenance worker
and we've learned that in this species and i suspect in others as well these hydrocarbons this layer of grease on the outside of
is different as ants perform different tasks and we've done experiments that show that that's because the longer an ant stays outside the more these simple hydrocarbons on its surface
change and so they come to smell different by doing different tasks and they can use that task specific odor in cuticular hydrocarbons
they can use that in their brief antennal contacts to somehow keep track of the rate at which they're meeting ants of certain tasks
and it turns out that ants will respond to the right rate of contact with a glass bead with hydrocarbon extract on it as they would to contact with real ants
so i want now to show you
tasks and the rate at which they meet as they come in and out of the nest entrance determines or influences each ant 's decision about whether to go out and which task to perform
this is taken through a fiber optics microscope it's down inside the nest in the beginning you just see the ants just kind of engaging with the fiber optics microscope but the idea is that the ants are in there
and each ant is experiencing a certain flow of ants past it a stream of contacts with other ants
and the pattern of these interactions determines whether the ant comes back out and what it does when it comes back out
you can also see this in the ants just outside the nest entrance like these
each ant then as it comes back in is contacting other ants and the ants that are waiting just inside the nest entrance to decide whether to go out on their next trip are contacting the ants coming in
so what's interesting about this system is that it's messy it's variable it's noisy and in particular in two ways
the first is that the experience of the ant of each ant can't be very predictable because the rate at which ants come back depends on all the little things that happen to an ant as it goes out and does its task outside
and also experimental work to try to figure out how those two kinds of noise combine to in the aggregate produce
the predictable behavior of ant colonies again i don't want to say that this kind of
pattern of interactions produces a factory that works with the precision and efficiency of clockwork in fact if you watch
all you end up trying to help them because they never seem to be doing anything exactly the way that you think that they ought to be doing it so it's not
something that they're doing is clearly successful enough that this pattern of haphazard contacts in the aggregate produces something that allows ants to make a lot more ants
and one of the things that we're studying is how natural selection might be acting now to shape this
use of interaction patterns this network of interaction patterns to perhaps increase the foraging efficiency of ant colonies
the one thing though that i want you to remember about this is that these patterns of interactions are something that you'd expect to be closely connected to colony size the simplest idea is that when an ant
is in a small colony and an ant in a large colony can use the same rule like i expect to meet another forager every three seconds but in a small colony it's likely
you i study ants and
