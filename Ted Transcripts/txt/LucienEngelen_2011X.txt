and i really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients and one of the things we did at radboud university is we appointed a chief listening officer not in a very scientific way she puts up a little cup of coffee or cup of tea and asks patients family relatives
it 's a very simple thing it 's got one knob on off
and every morning i hop on it and yes i 've got a challenge as you might see
and i put my challenge on ninety five kg but the thing is that it 's made this simple that whenever i hop on it sends my data through google health as well
but there 's another thing as some of you might know i 've got more than four thousand followers on twitter so every morning
but that 's the nicest thing that could happen since this is peer pressure
peer pressure used to help patients
since this could be used for obesity it could be used to stop smoking in patients
but on the other hand it also could be used to get people from out of their chairs and try to work together in some kind of gaming activity to get more control of their health as of next week it will soon be available there will be this little blood pressure meter
connected to an iphone or something or other
and people will be able from their homes to take their blood pressure
send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others for instance for over a hundred dollars
and this is the point where patients get into position and can collect not only their own control again be captain of their own ship
but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face like health care
cost explosion doubled demand and things like that
make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embrace patients in the team and you can do this with techniques like this
i would like to share with you introduced by a little video a
the other thing is we know where all the gas stations are and sure we could find fast food chains but where
would be the nearest aed to help this patient we asked around and nobody knew
so what we did we crowdsourced the netherlands we set up a website
and asked the crowd if you see an aed please submit it
tell us where it is tell us when it 's open since sometimes in office hours sometimes it 's closed of course and over ten thousand aeds already in the netherlands already have been submitted
and as of today we would like to introduce this not only as aed four eu which is what the product is called but also aed four us
and we would like to start this on a worldwide level
and we 're asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world colleague universities to help us to find and work and act like a hub to crowd source all these aeds all around the world that whenever you 're on holiday
and somebody collapses might it be your own relative
or someone just in front of you you can find this the other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us validate these aeds these might be courier services or cable guys for instance just to see whether the aed that 's submitted still is in place
