things that defines a tedster is you've taken your passion and you've turned it into stewardship you actually put action to the issues you care about
warped my framework so when you start to think about politicians you've got to realize these are strange creatures
the fact that they can't tell directions and they have very strange breeding habits how do you actually work with these things
what we need to understand is what drives the political creature and there are two things that are primary in a politician 's heart one is reputation and influence
these are the primary tools by which a politician can do his job the second one unlike most animals which is survival of the species this is preservation of self
now you may think it's money but that's actually sort of a proxy to what i can do to preserve myself now the challenge with you moving your issue forward is these animals are getting broadcast to all the time
so what doesn't work in terms of getting your issue to be important you can send them an email well unfortunately i've got so many viagra ads coming at me your email is lost it doesn't matter it's
yes contributions actually do make a difference and they set a context for having a conversation but it takes some time to build up so what actually works and the answer is rather strange it's a letter
we live in a digital world but we're fairly analog creatures letters actually work even the top dog himself takes time every day to read ten letters that are picked out by staff
i can tell you that every official that i've ever worked with will tell you about the letters they get and what they mean so how are you going to write your letter first of all you're going to pick up an analog device
i know these are tough and you may have a hard time getting your hand bent around it
but this is actually critical and it is critical that you actually hand write your letter it is so novel to see this that somebody actually picked up
an analog device and has written to me second of all i'm going to recommend that you get into a proactive stance and write to your elected officials at least once a month here 's my promise to you
if you are consistent and do this within three months the elected official will start calling you when that issue comes up and says what do you think
now i'm going to give you a four paragraph format to work with now when you approach these animals
you need to understand there's a dangerous end to them and you also need to approach them with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness so in paragraph number one what i'm going to tell you to do is very simply this you appreciate
paragraph number two you may actually have to get very blunt and say what's really on your mind
when you do this don't attack people you attack tactics ad hominem attacks will get you nowhere paragraph number three
by the way you sign your letter you do a number of things you're a vice president you volunteer you do something else why is is this important because
this establishes the two primary criteria for the political creature that you have influence in a large sphere and that my preservation depends on you
here is one very quick hack especially for the feds in the audience here 's how you mail your letter first of all you send the original to the district office
send the copy to the main office if they follow protocol they'll pick up the phone and say do you have the original then some droid in the back puts the name on a tick bar and says
this is an important letter and you actually get into the folder that the elected official actually has to read
so what your letter means i've got to tell you we are all in a party and political officials are
we are harangued lectured to sold marketed but a letter is actually one of the few times that we have honest communication i got this letter when i was first elected and i still carry it to every council meeting i go to
this is an opportunity at real dialogue and if you have stewardship and want to communicate
that dialogue is incredibly powerful so when you do that here 's what i can promise you're going to be the eight hundred pound gorilla in the forest get writing
