and what 's the brilliant idea he had he was going to tattoo little black dots on the right side
of my face and make me look very symmetric
when i got back to his office i wasn 't really sure i said can i see some evidence for this so he showed me some pictures of little cheeks with little black dots not very informative
but i was still concerned so i said you know what i 'm not going to do it and then came one of the biggest guilt trips of my life this is coming from a jewish guy all right so that means a lot none of those happened
and this was very surprising to me because i 've gone through many treatments there were many treatments i decided not to do and i never got this guilt trip to this extent
but i decided not to have this treatment and i went to his deputy and asked him what was going on where was this guilt trip coming from and he explained that they have done this procedure on two patients already and they need the third patient for a paper they were writing
but let me give you a different perspective on the same story
aside from one person there was one person in the group that was supposed to have very high performance that was actually performing terribly and he pulled the whole mean down destroying my statistical significance of the test
so i looked carefully at this guy he was twenty some years older than anybody else in the sample and i remembered that the old and drunken guy came one day to the lab wanting to make some easy cash and this was the guy fantastic i thought let 's throw him out who would ever include a drunken guy in a sample
but a couple of days later we thought about
would we have thrown him out then we probably wouldn 't have looked at the data at all and if we did look at the data we 'd probably have said fantastic what a smart guy who is performing this low because he would have pulled the mean of the group lower giving us even stronger statistical results than we could
so we decided not to throw the guy out and to rerun the experiment but you know these stories and lots of other experiments that we 've done on conflicts of interest basically kind of bring two points to the foreground for me
the first one is that in life we encounter many people who in some way or another try to tattoo our faces they just have the incentives that get them to be blinded to reality and give us advice that is inherently biased
and i 'm sure that it 's something that we all recognize and we see that it happens maybe we don 't recognize it every time but we understand that it happens
the most difficult thing of course is to recognize that sometimes we too
are blinded by our own incentives and that 's a much much more difficult lesson to take into account because we don 't see how conflicts of interest work on us
when i was doing these experiments in my mind i was helping science i was eliminating the data to get the true pattern of the data to shine through i wasn 't doing something bad in my mind i was actually a knight trying to help science move along but this was not the case i was actually interfering with the process with lots of good intentions
and i think the real challenge is to figure out where are the cases in our lives where conflicts of interest work on us and try not to trust our own intuition to overcome it but to try to do things that prevent us from falling prey to these behaviors because we can create lots of undesirable circumstances
i do want to leave you with one positive thought i mean this is all very depressing right people have conflicts of interest we don 't see it and so on
