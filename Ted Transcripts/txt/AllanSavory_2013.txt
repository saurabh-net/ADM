perfect storm is bearing down upon us
this perfect storm is mounting a grim reality increasingly grim reality and we are
and we are facing that reality
with the full belief that we can solve our problems with technology and that 's very understandable now this perfect storm that we are facing is the result of our rising population rising towards ten billion people
land that is turning to desert and of course climate change
now there 's no question about it at all we will only solve the problem of replacing fossil fuels with technology
but fossil fuels carbon coal and gas are by no means the only thing that is causing climate change desertification
desertification is a fancy word
for land that is turning to desert
and this happens only when we create too much bare ground there 's no other cause and i intend to focus on most of the world 's land that is turning to desert
but i have for you a very simple message that offers more hope than you can imagine
we have environments where humidity is guaranteed throughout the year
on those it is almost impossible to create vast areas of bare ground no matter what you do nature covers it up so quickly and we have environments where we have months of humidity followed by months of dryness and that is where desertification is occurring
fortunately with space technology now we can look at it from space and when we do
you can see the proportions fairly well
generally what you see in green is not desertifying and what you see in brown is and these are by far the greatest areas of the earth about two thirds i would guess of the world is desertifying
i took this picture in the tihamah desert while twenty five millimeters that 's an inch of rain was falling think of it in terms of drums of water each containing two hundred liters
over one thousand drums of water fell on every hectare of that land that day
the next day the land looked like this where had that water gone
some of it ran off as flooding
but most of the water that soaked into the soil simply evaporated out again exactly as it does in your garden if you leave the soil uncovered
now because the fate of water and carbon are tied to soil organic matter
when we damage soils you give off carbon carbon goes back to the atmosphere
now you 're told over and over repeatedly that desertification is only occurring in arid and semi arid areas of the world
and that tall grasslands like this one in high rainfall are of no consequence
but if you do not look at grasslands but look down into them you find that most of the soil in that grassland that you 've just seen is bare and covered with a crust of algae
leading to increased runoff and evaporation that is the cancer of desertification that we do not recognize till its terminal form
almost everybody knows this from nobel laureates to golf caddies or was taught it as i was
and so i grew up hating livestock because of the damage they were doing and then my university education as an ecologist reinforced my beliefs
we were once just as certain that the world was flat
we were wrong then and we are wrong again
and i want to invite you now to come along on my journey of reeducation and discovery
when i was a young man
now no livestock were involved but suspecting that we had too many elephants now i did the research and i proved we had too many
and i recommended that we would have to reduce their numbers and bring them down to a level that the land could sustain
now that was a terrible decision for me to have to make and it was political dynamite frankly
so our government formed a team of experts to evaluate my research they did they agreed with me and over the following years we shot forty thousand elephants to try to stop the damage
and it got worse not better
loving elephants as i do that was the saddest and greatest blunder of my life and i will carry that to my grave
one good thing did come out of it it made me absolutely determined to devote my life to finding solutions
when i came to the united states i got a shock
to find national parks like this one desertifying as badly as anything in africa
and there 'd been no livestock on this land for over seventy years
and i found that american scientists had no explanation for this except that it is arid and natural so i then began
looking at all the research plots i could over the whole of the western united states
where cattle had been removed to prove that it would stop desertification but i found the opposite as we see on this research station where this grassland that was green in one thousand nine hundred and sixty one by two thousand and two had changed to that situation
and the authors of the position paper on climate change from which i obtained these pictures attribute this change to unknown processes
clearly we have never understood what is causing desertification
which has destroyed many civilizations and now threatens us globally we have never understood
you have changed the microclimate now by the time you are doing that and increasing greatly the percentage of bare ground
but we have just simply not understood why was it beginning to happen ten thousand years ago why has it accelerated lately we had no understanding of that what we had failed to understand
was that these seasonal humidity environments of the world the soil and the vegetation developed with very large numbers of grazing animals
and that these grazing animals developed with ferocious pack hunting predators
now the main defense against pack hunting predators is to get into herds and the larger the herd the safer the individuals
now large herds dung and urinate all over their own food and they have to keep moving
and it was that movement that prevented the overgrazing of plants while the periodic trampling ensured good cover of the soil as we see where a herd has passed
has to decay biologically before the next growing season and if it doesn 't the grassland and the soil begin to die
now if it does not decay biologically it shifts to oxidation which is a very slow process and this smothers and kills grasses leading to a shift to woody vegetation and bare soil releasing carbon
to prevent that we have traditionally used fire but fire also
leaves the soil bare releasing carbon and worse than that
burning one hectare of grassland gives off more and more damaging pollutants than six thousand cars
and we are burning in africa every single year
more than one billion hectares of grasslands and almost nobody is talking about
okay we cannot reduce animal numbers to rest it more without causing desertification and climate change we cannot burn it without causing desertification and climate change what are we going to do
there is only one option i 'll repeat to you only one option left to climatologists and scientists and that is to do the unthinkable and to use livestock
bunched and moving as a proxy for former herds and predators and mimic nature there is no other alternative left to mankind
so let 's do that so on this bit of grassland we 'll do it but just in the foreground we 'll impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature and we 've done so and look at that all of that grass is now covering the soil as dung urine and litter or mulch and we did that
without using fire to damage the soil and the plants are free to grow
when i first realized that we had no option as scientists but to use much vilified livestock
i was faced with a real dilemma how were we to do it
and that had accelerated desertification as we first discovered in africa and then confirmed in the united states and as you see in this picture of land managed by the federal government
clearly more was needed than bunching and moving
the animals and humans over thousands of years had never been able to deal with nature 's complexity but we biologists and ecologists had never tackled anything as complex as this
so rather than reinvent the wheel i began studying other professions to see if anybody had
and i found there were planning techniques that i could take and adapt to our biological need
and from those i developed what we call holistic management and planned grazing a planning process and that does address all of nature 's complexity and our social environmental economic complexity
today we have young women like this one
teaching villages in africa how to put their animals together into larger herds plan their grazing to mimic nature and where we have them hold their animals overnight we run them in a predator friendly manner because we have a lot of lands and so on
and where they do this and hold them overnight to prepare the crop fields we are getting very great increases in crop yield as well
let 's look at some results this is land close to land that we manage in zimbabwe it has just come through four months of very good rains it got that year and it 's going into the long dry season
but as you can see all of that rain almost of all it has evaporated from the soil surface their river is dry despite the rain just having ended and we have one hundred and fifty thousand people on almost permanent food aid
our river is flowing and healthy and clean it 's fine
the production of grass shrubs trees wildlife everything is now more productive and we have virtually no fear of dry years
and we did that by increasing the cattle and goats four hundred percent planning the grazing to mimic nature and integrate them with all the elephants buffalo giraffe and other animals that we have
but before we began our land looked like that
this site was bare and eroding
for over thirty years regardless of what rain we got okay watch the marked tree and see the change as we use livestock to mimic nature
this was another site where it had been bare and eroding and at the base of the marked small tree we had lost over thirty centimeters of soil okay and again watch the change just using livestock
to mimic nature and there are fallen trees in there now because the better land is now attracting elephants etc
this land in mexico was in terrible condition and i 've had to mark the hill because the change is so profound
and look at the amazing change in this one where that gully has completely healed using nothing
but livestock mimicking nature and once more we have the third generation of that family on that land with their flag still flying
the vast grasslands of patagonia are turning to desert as you see here the man in the middle is an argentinian researcher and he has documented the steady decline of that land over the years as they kept reducing sheep numbers
they put twenty five thousand sheep in one flock
really mimicking nature now with planned grazing and they have documented a fifty percent increase in the production of the land in the first year
we now have in the violent horn of africa
and saving their culture ninety five percent of that land can only feed people from animals i remind you that i am talking about most of the world 's land here
that controls our fate including the most violent region of the world where only animals can feed people from about ninety five percent of the land
what we are doing globally is causing climate change as much as i believe fossil fuels and maybe more
than fossil fuels but worse than that
it is causing hunger poverty violence social breakdown and war and as i am talking to you millions of men women and children are suffering and dying and if this continues
we are unlikely to be able to stop the climate changing even after we have eliminated the use of fossil fuels
i believe i 've shown you how we can work with nature at very low cost to reverse all this
we are already doing so on about fifteen million hectares on five continents and people who understand far more about carbon than i do calculate that for illustrative purposes if we do what i am showing you here
we can take enough carbon out of the atmosphere and safely store it in the grassland soils
for thousands of years and if we just do that on about half the world 's grasslands that i 've shown you we can take us back to pre industrial levels while feeding people
i can think of almost nothing that offers more hope
where i offered a pound five note in a hundred mile drive if somebody could find one grass in a hundred mile drive and on that we trebled the stocking rate the number of animals in the first year with no feeding just by the movement mimicking nature
and using a sigmoid curve that principle it 's a little bit technical to explain here
