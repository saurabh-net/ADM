so i'm here to tell you that we have a problem with boys
and it's a serious problem with boys
their culture isn't working in schools and i'm going to share with you ways that we can think about overcoming that problem
to start by saying this is a
and this is a girl and this is probably stereotypically what you think of as a boy and a girl if i essentialize gender for you today then you can dismiss what i have to say so i'm not going to do that i'm not interested in doing that
this is a different kind of boy and a different kind of girl so the point here is that not all boys exist within these rigid boundaries of what we think of as boys and girls
the point is that for boys the way that they exist and the culture that they embrace isn't working well in schools now how do we know that
the one hundred girls project tells us
some really nice statistics for example for every one hundred girls that are suspended from school there are two hundred and fifty boys that are suspended from school
for every one hundred girls who are expelled from school there are three hundred and thirty five boys who are expelled from school
for every one hundred girls in special education there are two hundred and seventeen boys
for every one hundred girls with a learning disability there are two hundred and seventy six boys
for every one hundred girls with an emotional disturbance diagnosed we have three hundred and twenty four boys and by the way all of these numbers are significantly higher if you happen to be black
you happen to exist in an overcrowded school
and if you are a
four times as likely to be diagnosed with adhd attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
now there is another side to this
and it is important that we recognize that
women still need help in school
that salaries are still significantly lower even when controlled for job types and that girls have continued to struggle in math and science for years
that's all true nothing about that prevents us from paying attention to the literacy needs of our boys between ages three and thirteen
and so we should in fact what we ought to do is take a page from their playbook because
the initiatives and programs that have been set in place for women in science and engineering and mathematics are fantastic they've done a lot of good for girls in these situations
and we ought to be thinking about how we can make that happen for boys too in their younger years
we may be getting close to seventy percent female population in universities this makes university administrators very nervous because girls don't want to go to schools that don't have boys
we're starting to see the establishment of men centers and men studies to think about how do we engage men in their experiences in the university if you talk to faculty they may say
well they're playing video games and they're gambling online all night long and they're playing world of warcraft and that's affecting their academic
guess what video games are not the cause video games are a symptom
they were turned off a long time before they got here
so let 's talk about why they got turned off when they were between the ages of three and thirteen
there are three reasons that i believe that boys are out of sync with the culture of schools today
and when he did she had to go through and pull out all the little plastic guns
you can't have plastic knives and swords and axes and all
in a kindergarten classroom what is it that we're afraid that this young man is going to do with this gun i mean really
but here he stands as testament to the fact that you can't roughhouse on the playground today now i'm not advocating for bullies
i'm not suggesting that we need to be allowing guns and knives into school but when we say that an eagle scout in a high school classroom
to write poems and little moments in my life i don't want to write that stuff
well what do you want to write what do you want to write about i want to write about video games i want to write about leveling up i want to write about this really interesting world i want to write about
the answer is no he 's just a boy
he 's just a little boy
it's not okay to write these kinds of things in classrooms today
there are fewer male teachers anybody who 's over fifteen doesn't know what this means because in the last ten years the number of elementary school classroom teachers has been cut in half
now what's the problem with this
women are great yep absolutely but
male role models for boys that say it's all right to be smart they've got dads they've got pastors they've got cub scout leaders but ultimately six hours a day five days a week they're spending in a classroom
and most of those classrooms are not places where men exist and so they say i guess this really isn't a place for boys
teachers lounge and they're having a conversation about
you'll see the conversation changes depending upon who 's sitting around the table
third reason that boys are out of sync with school today kindergarten is the old second grade folks we have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there
in first grade you should be able to read paragraphs of
with maybe a picture maybe not in a book of maybe twenty five to thirty pages if you don 't we're probably going to be putting you into a title one special reading program and if you ask title one teachers they'll tell you they've got about four or five boys for every girl that's in their program in the elementary grades
is because the message that boys are getting is you need to do what the teacher asks you to do all the time
the teacher 's salary depends on no child left behind and race to the top and accountability and testing and all of this so she has to figure out a way
and so this is a very serious problem where is it coming from it's coming from
we want to live in lake wobegon where every child is above average
but what this does to our children is really not healthy it's not developmentally appropriate and it's particularly bad for boys
need to meet them where they are we need to put ourselves into boy culture
we need to change the mindset of acceptance in boys in elementary schools
very specific things we can design better games most of the educational games that are out there are really flashcards
they're glorified drill and practice they don't have the depth the rich narrative that
really engaging video games have that the boys are really interested in so we need to design better games
all of those conversations need to be happening there are some great examples out there of schools
the new york times just talked about a school recently a game designer from the new school put together a wonderful video gaming school
it only treats a few kids and so this isn't very scalable we have to change the culture and the feelings that politicians and school board members and parents have about the way we accept and what we accept in our schools today
we have to find more money for game design because good games really good games cost money and world of warcraft has quite a budget most of the educational games do not
and we discovered that they talk about the kids in their school who talk about gaming in pretty demeaning ways
they say oh yeah they're always talking about that stuff they're talking about their little action figures and their little
nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence because of the zero tolerance policies they are sure that parents and administrators will never accept anything so we really need to think about looking at teacher attitudes and finding ways
to change the attitudes so that teachers are much more open and accepting of boy cultures in their classrooms
because ultimately if we don
have boys who leave elementary school saying you
