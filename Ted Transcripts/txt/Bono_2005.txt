thank you very much as another famous man jerry garcia said what a strange long trip
and he should have said what a strange long trip it's about to become at this very moment you are viewing my upper half my lower half is appearing at a different
two places at once but still i'm sorry i can't be with you in person i'll explain at another
time and though i'm a rock star i just want to assure you that none of my wishes will include a hot tub but what really turns me on about technology
is not just the ability to get more songs on mp three players the revolution this revolution is much bigger than that
if you wanted to make a film you needed a mass of equipment and a hollywood budget now you need a camera that fits in your
and a couple of bucks for a blank dvd imagination has been
from the old constraints and that really really excites me i'm excited when i glimpse that kind of thinking
writ large what i would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints political economic psychological whatever
the geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world from the
with which you swept away obstacles that no one knew could even be budged and that's actually what i'd like to talk about today
first though i should probably explain why
and how i got to this place it's a journey that started twenty years ago
you may remember that song we are the world or do they know it's christmas band aid live aid another very tall
was a great moment and it utterly changed my life that summer my wife ali and myself went to ethiopia
we went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on we lived in ethiopia for a month working at an orphanage the children had a name for me they called me the girl with the
don't ask anyway we found africa to be a magical place
big shining continent beautiful royal people anybody who ever gave anything
to africa got a lot more back ethiopia didn't just blow my mind it opened my mind
anyway on our last day at this orphanage a man handed me his baby and said
would you take my son with you he knew in ireland that his son would live and that in ethiopia his son would die it was the middle of that awful famine well
i turned him down and
was a funny kind of sick feeling but i turned him down and it's a feeling i can't ever quite forget
and in that moment i started this journey in that moment i became the worst thing of all i became a rock star with
except this isn't the cause is it six and a half thousand africans dying every single day from aids
a preventable treatable disease for lack of drugs we can get in any pharmacy
that's not a cause that's an emergency eleven million aids orphans in africa twenty million by the end of the decade that's not a cause an emergency
so what we're talking about here is human rights the right to live like a human
the right to live period and what we're facing in africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality
this is about justice really this is not about charity this is about justice
that's right and that's too bad because we're very good at charity americans like irish people are good
even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford we like to give and we give a lot look at the response to the tsunami it's inspiring
but justice is a tougher standard than charity you see africa makes a fool of our idea of justice
it makes a farce of our idea of equality it mocks our pieties it doubts our concern it questions our
because there is no way we can look at what's happening in africa and if we're honest conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else
as you heard in the film anywhere else not here not here not in america not in europe
a head of state that you're all familiar with admitted this to me
really true there is no chance this kind of hemorrhaging of human life would be accepted anywhere else other than africa
africa is a continent in flames and deep down if we really accepted that africans were equal to us we would all do more to put the fire out we're standing around with watering cans
what we really need is the fire brigade you see it's not as dramatic as the tsunami
crazy really when you think about it does stuff have to look like an action movie these days
to exist in the front of our brain the slow extinguishing of countless lives is just not dramatic enough it would appear
anyway i believe that that kind of thinking offends the intellectual rigor in this room
i want to argue with you tonight that that's our crisis i want to argue that though africa is not the front line in the war against terror it could be soon
every week religious extremists take another african village they're attempting to bring order to chaos well
why aren't we poverty breeds despair we know this despair breeds violence we know this in turbulent times isn't it cheaper
and smarter to make friends out of potential enemies than to defend yourself against them later the war against terror is bound up in the war against poverty
and i didn't say that colin powell said that now when the military are telling us that this is a war that cannot be won
by military might alone maybe we should listen there's an opportunity here
and it's real it's not spin it's not wishful thinking the problems facing the developing world afford us in the developed world a chance to re describe ourselves to the world
we will not only transform other people 's lives but we will also transform the way those other lives see us and that might be smart in these nervous dangerous times
don't you think that on a purely commercial level that anti retroviral drugs
great advertisements for western ingenuity and technology doesn't compassion look well on us and let 's cut the
crap for a second in certain quarters of the world brand eu brand usa is not at its shiniest the neon sign is fizzing and
someone 's put a brick through the window
the regional branch managers are getting nervous
never before have we in the west been so scrutinized our values do we have any our credibility
these things are under attack around the world brand usa could use some polishing and i say that as a fan you know
as a person who buys the products but think about it more anti retrovirals make sense but that's just the easy part
equality for africa that's a big expensive idea
you see the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference what on earth can we all do
well much more than we think we can't fix every problem but the ones we can i want to argue we must and because we can we must
this is the straight truth the righteous truth it is not a theory the fact is that ours is the first generation that can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye
look across the ocean to africa and say this and mean it we do not have to stand for this a whole continent written off we do not have to stand for this
let me say this without a trace of irony before i back it up to a bunch of ex hippies
forget the sixties we can change the world i can 't you can 't as individuals but we
can change the world i really believe that the people in this room look at the gates foundation they've done incredible stuff unbelievable stuff
but working together we can actually change the world we can turn the inevitable outcomes
and transform the quality of life for millions of lives who look and feel rather like us when
i'm sorry to laugh here but you do look so different than you did in haight ashbury in the sixties
but i want to argue that this is the moment that you are designed for it is the flowering of the seeds you planted in earlier headier days
ideas that you gestated in your youth this is what excites me this room was born for this moment is really what i want to say to you tonight most of you started out wanting to change the world
most of you did the digital world well now
actually because of you it is possible to change the physical
and they know much more than i do so
why then are we not pumping our fists into the air probably because when we admit we can do something about it we've got to do something about it it is
pain in the arse this equality business is actually a pain in the arse but for the first time in history we have the technology we have the know how we have the cash we have the life saving drugs
do we have the will i hope this is obvious but
i'm not a hippie and i'm not really one for the warm fuzzy feeling i do not have flowers in my hair actually i come from punk rock the clash wore big army boots not
but i know toughness when i see it and for all the talk of peace and love on the west coast there was muscle
to the movement that started out here you see idealism detached from action is just a dream
but idealism allied with pragmatism with rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit is
very exciting it's very real it's very strong and it's very present in a crowd like you
last year at data this organization i helped set up we launched a campaign to summon this spirit in the fight against aids and extreme poverty we're calling it the one campaign
it's based on our belief that the action of one person can change a lot but the actions of many coming together as one can change the world
well we feel that now is the time to prove we're right there are moments in history when civilization redefines itself
we believe this is one we believe that this could be the time when the world finally decides that the wanton loss of life in africa is just no longer
who live on planet earth momentum has been building lurching a little but it's building this year is a test for us all
especially the leaders of the g eight nations who really are on the line here
with all the world in history watching
i have been of late disappointed with the bush administration
they started out with such promise on africa they made some really great promises and actually have fulfilled a lot of them
but some of them they haven 't they don't feel the push from the ground is the truth
but my disappointment has much more perspective when i talk to american people and i hear their worries about the deficit
the fiscal well being of their country i understand that but there's much more push from the ground than you'd think if we got organized
what i try to communicate and you can help me if you agree is that aid for africa is just great value for money at a time when america really needs it putting it in the crassest possible terms
the investment reaps huge returns not only in lives saved but in goodwill stability and security that we'll gain
so this is what i hope that you will do if i could be so bold and not have it deducted from my number of wishes
what i hope is that beyond individual merciful acts that you will tell the politicians to do right by
by america and by the world
give them permission if you like to spend their political capital and your financial
your national purse on saving the lives of millions of people that's really what i would like you to do because we also need your intellectual capital your ideas your skills your ingenuity
and you at this conference are in a unique position some of the technologies we've been talking about you invented
pushed the boundaries and we'd like you to
a lot of people are getting together and working under this umbrella i told you about earlier the one campaign
i think they just have one idea in their mind which is
where you live in the world should not determine whether you live like
god is watching what we do when the history books get written i think our age will be remembered for three things really it's just three things
this whole age will be remembered for the digital revolution yes the war against terror yes and what we did
or did not do to put out the fires
some say we can't afford to i say
we can't afford not to
the ones that ted has offered to grant
you see if this is true and i believe it is that the digital world you all created has
the creative imagination from the physical constraints of matter this should be a piece
that this started out as a
wishes most of them impossible some of them impractical and one or two of them certainly immoral business
gets to be addictive you know what i mean when somebody else is picking up the
anyway here 's number one i wish for you to help
build a social movement of more than one million american activists
my first wish i believe it's possible a few minutes ago i talked about all the citizens campaigns that are springing up
you know there's lots out there and with this one campaign as our umbrella my organization data and other groups have been tapping into the energy and
the enthusiasm that's out there from hollywood into the heartland of america we know there's more than enough energy to power this movement we just need your help
in making it happen we want all of you here church america corporate america microsoft america apple america coke america pepsi america nerd america noisy america
we can't afford to be cool and sit this one out i do believe if we build a movement that's one million americans strong
we will have the ear of congress
be the first page in condi rice 's briefing book and right into the oval office if there's one million americans and i really know this
who are ready to make phone calls who are ready to be on email i am absolutely sure that we can actually change the course
of history literally for the continent of africa anyway so i'd like your help in getting that signed up i know john
number two i would like one media hit for every person on the planet who is living on less than one dollar a day
one billion media hits could be on google could be on aol steve case larry sergey they've done a lot already
could be nbc it could be abc actually we're talking to abc today about the oscars we have a film produced by jon kamen at radical media
but you know we want we need some airtime for our ideas we need to get the math we need to get the statistics out to the american people i really believe
that old truman line that if you give the american people the facts they'll do the right thing
and the other thing that's important is that this is not sally struthers this has to be described as an adventure not a burden
one by one they step forward a nurse a teacher a homemaker and lives are saved the problem is enormous every three seconds one person dies another three seconds one more
as one we can beat extreme poverty starvation aids
we need your help one more person letter voice will mean the difference between life and death for millions of people
please join us by working together americans have an unprecedented opportunity we can make history we can start to make poverty history
one by one by one please visit one at this address we're not asking for your money we're asking for your voice
all right i wish for ted
to truly show the power of information its power to rewrite the rules and transform lives by connecting every hospital health
and school in one african country and i would like it to be ethiopia i believe
we can connect every school in ethiopia every health clinic every hospital we can connect to the internet that is my wish my third wish i think it's possible i think we have the money and brains in the room to do that
and that would be a mind blowing wish to come true i've been to ethiopia as i said earlier it's actually where it all started for me
the idea that the internet which changed all of our lives can transform a country
and a continent that has hardly made it to analog let alone digital blows my mind but it didn't start
was just nine years later that addis ababa was connected by phone to harare which is five hundred kilometers away
since then not that much has changed the average waiting time to get a land line in ethiopia is actually about seven or eight
wireless technology wasn't dreamt up then anyway i'm irish and as you can see i know how important talking is well
