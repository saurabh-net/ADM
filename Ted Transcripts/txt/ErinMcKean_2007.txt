now have any of y 'all ever looked up this word you know in a dictionary
how about this word here i'll show it to you lexicography the practice of compiling dictionaries notice we're very specific that word compile
that you get to say really fun words like lexicographical lexicographical has this great pattern it's called a double dactyl and just by saying double dactyl i've sent the geek needle all the way into the red
is the same pattern as higgledy piggledy right it's a fun word to say and i get to say
one of the non perks of being a lexicographer is that people don't usually have a kind of warm fuzzy snuggly image of the dictionary right nobody hugs their dictionaries but
what people really often think about the dictionary is they think more like this just to let you know i do not have a lexicographical whistle
but the thing is i don't want to be a traffic cop for one thing i just do not do uniforms
words are good and what words are bad is actually not very easy and it's not very fun and
your job are not easy or fun you kind of look for an excuse not to do so
to think of some kind of occupation as a metaphor for my work i would much rather be
throw my big net into the deep blue ocean of english and see what marvelous creatures i can drag up from the bottom fishing well
really not changed our idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign the only thing queen victoria would not be amused by
so he 's really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionaries today when a guy who looks like
a job on any dictionary today there'd be virtually no learning
but computers don't do much else other than speed up the
compiling dictionaries they don't change the end
what a dictionary is is it's victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion it's steampunk what we have is an electric velocipede
you know we have victorian design with an engine on it that's all the design has not changed and ok what about online dictionaries right online dictionaries must be different
when you think about this what we have here is a ham butt problem does everyone know the ham butt problem woman 's making a ham for a big family dinner she goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away and she looks at this piece
that ham butt is delicious there's no reason to throw it away the bad words see when people think about a place and they don't find a place on the map
it's more likely to be a bad dictionary why are you blaming the ham for being too big
so you can't get a smaller ham the english language is as big as it is so if you have a ham butt problem and you're thinking about the ham butt problem the conclusion it leads you to is inexorable and counter intuitive
paper is the enemy of words how can this be i mean i love books i really love books some of my best friends are books
not going to be the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in so
think about it this way if you've got an artificial constraint artificial constraints lead to arbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview
what if biologists could only study animals that made people go aww right what if we made aesthetic judgments about animals and only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study
i think this is a problem i think we should study all the words because when you think about words you can make
from very humble parts lexicography is really more about material science we are studying the tolerances think
if we think words are the tools that we use to build the expressions of our
how can you say that screwdrivers are better than hammers
how can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball peen hammer
just the right tool for the job and so people say to me how do i know if a word is
that makes it real being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction it doesn't make a word any more real than any other way if you love a word it becomes real so if we're not worrying about directing
if we've transcended paper if we
worrying less about control and more about description then we can think of the english language as being this beautiful
and any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes is touched any time you touch a word you use it in a new context you give it a new connotation you verb it
you make the mobile move
just in a new position and that new position
maybe to count the cars that go by then more eyeballs are better
that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries and i find an un dictionaried word a word like un dictionaried for example in every book i read
a lot and i'm not even talking about magazines i'm not talking about blogs and i find more new words on boingboing in a given week than i do newsweek or time
if you think of the word a badger 's burrow
can be one of the pleats in an elizabethan ruff and there's one numbered definition in the oed the oed has thirty three different numbered definitions for set tiny little word thirty three numbered definitions
and we really need help and the thing is we could ask for help asking for help 's not that hard i mean lexicography is not rocket science see i just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers
we don't know very much and we don't even know the shape of the language if this was the dictionary if this was the map of american english look we have
kind of lumpy idea of florida
we don't even see that there's a gap on the map so again lexicography is not rocket science but even if it were
you know it can't be that
other disciplines are really asking people to help and they're doing a good job of it for instance there's ebird where amateur birdwatchers can upload information about their bird sightings and then ornithologists can go
so many comets they named a comet after him it's kind of out past mars it's a hike i don't think he 's getting his picture taken there anytime soon
be able to find words now y 'all know where i'm going with this because i'm going to the internet which is where everybody goes
happen to be the recipe for lexicography isn't that great so
is like an archaeological artifact if you don't know the provenance or the source of the artifact it's not science
it's a pretty thing to look at so a word without its source is like a cut flower you know it's pretty to look at for a while but then it dies it dies too fast so
well people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language they use it synecdochically
one of the problems of knowing a word like synecdochically is that you really want an excuse to say synecdochically this whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point where i could say synecdochically to all of you so i'm really sorry
but when you use a part of something like the dictionary is a part of the language or a flag stands for the united states a symbol of the country then you're using it synecdochically
we could make the dictionary the whole language if we get a bigger pan
then we can put all the words in we can put in
all the meanings doesn't everyone want more meaning
we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language we can make it be the whole language you see what i'm really hoping for is that my son who turns seven this month i
died because it wasn't useful enough it
really what people needed and the thing is if we can put in all the words no longer have that artificial distinction between good and bad we can really describe the language like scientists we can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers if we can do that
time fishing and i don't have to be a traffic cop anymore thank you very much for your kind
