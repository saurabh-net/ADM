so bpa mimics the body 's own hormones and causes neurological and reproductive problems and it 's everywhere a recent study found bpa in ninety three percent of people six and older
don 't become a cannibal
second we are both responsible for and the victims of our own pollution and third our bodies are filters and storehouses for environmental toxins
so what happens to all these toxins when we die the short answer is they return to the environment in one way or another
continuing the cycle of toxicity but our current funeral practices make the situation much worse if you 're cremated all those toxins i mentioned are released into the atmosphere and this includes five thousand pounds of mercury from our dental fillings alone every year
and in a traditional american funeral a dead body is covered with fillers and cosmetics to make it look alive it 's then pumped with toxic formaldehyde to slow decomposition
so by trying to preserve our dead bodies we deny death poison the living and further harm the
green or natural burials which don 't use embalming
i think there 's a better solution i 'm an artist so i 'd like to offer a modest proposal at the intersection of art science and culture the infinity burial project an alternative burial system that uses mushrooms to decompose and clean toxins in bodies
the infinity burial project began a few years ago with a fantasy to create the infinity mushroom a new hybrid mushroom that would decompose bodies clean the toxins and deliver nutrients to plant roots leaving clean compost
but i learned it 's nearly impossible to create a new hybrid mushroom
i also learned that some of our tastiest mushrooms can clean environmental toxins in soil so i thought maybe i could train an army of
toxin cleaning edible mushrooms to eat my body
so today i 'm collecting what i shed or slough off my hair skin and nails and i 'm feeding these to edible mushrooms
so when i die the infinity mushrooms will recognize my body and be able to eat it
is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to have with our food we want to eat not be eaten by our food but as i watch the mushrooms grow and digest my body i imagine the
and the relationship between my body and the
it 's a step towards accepting the fact that someday i will die and decay
it 's also a step towards taking responsibility for my
the infinity mushroom is a subset of decompiculture i 'm calling body decompiculture and toxin remediation the cultivation of organisms that decompose and clean toxins in bodies
and now about these ninja pajamas once it 's completed i plan to integrate the infinity mushrooms into a number of objects
first a burial suit infused with mushroom spores the mushroom death suit
the second prototype of this
the dendritic pattern you see mimics the growth of mushroom mycelia which are the equivalent of plant roots
a cocktail of capsules that contain infinity mushroom spores and other elements that speed decomposition and toxin remediation these capsules are embedded in a nutrient rich jelly a kind of second skin which dissolves quickly and becomes baby food for the growing mushrooms
so i plan to finish the mushroom and decompiculture kit in the next year or two and then i 'd like to begin testing them first with expired meat from the market and then with human subjects
and believe it or not a few people have offered to donate their bodies to the project to be eaten by mushrooms
i 've learned from talking to these folks is that we share a common desire to understand and accept death and to minimize the impact of our death on
so i formed the decompiculture society a group of people called decompinauts who actively explore their postmortem options seek death acceptance and cultivate decomposing organisms like the infinity mushroom
accepting death means accepting that we are physical beings who are intimately connected to the environment as the research on environmental toxins confirms
we see that the survival of our species depends on the survival of the planet
i believe this is the beginning of true environmental responsibility thank you
