in the next eighteen minutes when i do our chat four americans alive
alive the food that
the food that four years old
i'm from essex in england and the last seven years
to save lives in my own way i'm not a doctor i'm a chef i don't have expensive equipment
i profoundly believe that the power of food has a primal place in our homes that binds
to the best bits of life we have
please just see a raise of hands for how many of you have children in this room today please put your hands up aunties uncles you can continue put your hands up aunties and uncles as well most of you
your child will live a life ten years younger than you because of the landscape of food that we've built around
this room today in america are statistically overweight or obese
you lot you're all right but we'll get you eventually don't worry
the statistics of bad health are clear very clear
every single one of those in the red
diet related disease any doctor any specialist will tell you that fact diet related disease is the biggest killer in the united states right now
this is a global problem
a catastrophe it's sweeping the world england is right behind you as usual
i know they were close but not that
we need a revolution mexico australia germany india china all have massive problems of obesity and bad health think about smoking less than obesity now
obesity costs you americans ten percent
set to double three hundred billion dollars a year and let 's be honest guys you ain't got
i came here to start a food revolution that i so profoundly believe in we need it the time is now
in a tipping point moment i've been doing this for seven years i've been trying in america for seven years now is the time when it's
i went to the eye of the storm i went to west virginia the most unhealthy state in america or it was last year we've got a new one this year but we'll work on that next
around the statistics that we've become
so used to i want to introduce you to some of the people that i care about your public your children i want to show a picture of my friend brittany she's sixteen years old
she's got six years to live
of the food that she's eaten she's the third generation of americans that hasn't grown up within a food environment where they've been taught to cook at home or in school or her mom
she has six years to live
she's eating her liver to death stacy the edwards family
this is a normal family guys
the family 's obese justin here twelve years old he 's three hundred and fifty pounds he gets bullied for god 's sake the daughter there katie she's four years old she's obese before she even gets to primary school and now
you see the thing is
an inspirational man one of my early allies in huntington west virginia the sharp knife
the sharp knife edge of this problem
he has to bury the people ok and he 's fed up with it he 's fed up with burying his friends and his family his community
come winter three times as many people die
this is preventable disease waste of life by the way this is what they get buried up to do this
i see it as a triangle ok this is our landscape of food i need you to understand it you've probably heard all this before but let 's just go back over it over the last thirty years what's happened that's ripped the heart out of this country let 's be frank and honest well
modern day life let 's start with the main street
fast food has taken over the whole country we know that the big brands are some of the most important powers powerful powers in this country supermarkets as well big companies big companies
thirty years ago most of the food was largely local and largely fresh now it's largely processed and full of all sorts of additives extra ingredients and you know the rest of the story portion size is obviously a massive massive problem
labeling is a massive problem
the labeling in this country is
self they want to self police themselves the industry wants to self police themselves
what in this kind of climate they don't deserve
how can you say something is low fat when it's full of so much
happening anymore and you know as we go to work and as life changes and as life always evolves we kind of have to look at it holistically step back for a moment and re address the balance
is very normal right now the edwards family
this stuff goes through you
really sad and depressed right now
you know i want my kids to succeed in life
but i'm killing them jo yes you are you are but we can stop
something that i'm fairly much a specialist in ok school
school who invented it what's the purpose of school school was always invented to arm us with the tools to make us
do wonderful things make us earn a living etc etc etc you know it's been kind of in this sort of tight box for a long long time ok
but we haven't really evolved it to deal with the health catastrophes of america ok school
is something that most kids thirty one million a day actually have twice a day more than often breakfast and lunch
and eighty days of the year so you could say that school food is quite important really judging the circumstances
before i crack into my rant which i'm sure
i need to say one thing and it's so important in hopefully the magic that happens and unfolds in the next three months
the lunch ladies the lunch cooks of america
offer myself as their ambassador
i'm not slacking them off they're doing the best they can do
but they're doing what they're told and what they're being told to do is wrong the system is
and dive and write different things around things if you're an accountant and a box ticker the only thing you can do in these circumstances is now the reality is
the food that your kids get every day is fast food it's highly processed there's not enough fresh food in there at all you know the amount of additives
and the way i look at it is if you don't have knives and forks in your school you're purely endorsing from a state level
ten percent of what we spend on healthcare as i said
obesity and it's going to double
we're not teaching our kids there is no statutory right to teach kids about food elementary or secondary school ok we don't teach kids about food right and this is a little clip from an elementary school which is very common good old
good old if the kids
america england and america guess what fixed that guess what fixed that two one hour sessions
we've got to start teaching our kids about food in schools period tell you about something
i want to tell you about something that kind of epitomizes the trouble that we're in guys ok i want to talk about something so basic as milk
every kid has the right to milk at school your kids will be having milk at school breakfast and lunch right they'll be having two bottles okay and most kids
but milk ain't good enough anymore because someone at the milk board right and don't get me wrong i support milk but someone on the milk board probably paid a lot of money for some geezer to work out that if you put loads of flavorings and colorings and sugar in milk right more kids will drink it
and obviously now that's going to catch on the apple board is going to work out that if they make toffee apples they'll eat more apples as well do you know what i mean for me
no need to flavor the milk okay there is sugar in everything i know the ins and outs of those ingredients it's in everything even the milk hasn't escaped
the kind of modern day problems there's our milk there's our carton in that is nearly as much sugar as one of your favorite cans of fizzy pop and they are having two a day so let me just show you we've got one
you know eight tablespoons of sugar you
putting in just the five years of elementary school just from milk
now i don't know about you guys but judging the circumstances right any judge in the whole world would look at the statistics and the evidence and they would find any government of old guilty of child abuse that's
now if i came up here and i wish i could come up here today and hang a cure for aids or to get to
all this bad news is preventable
that's the good news it's very very preventable
so let 's just think about we got a problem here we need to reboot okay so
in my world what do we need to do here is the thing right it can not just come from one source to reboot and make real tangible change real change so that i could look you in the white of the eyes and say in ten years time
the history of your children 's lives happiness and let 's not forget you're clever if you eat well you know you're going to live longer all of that stuff it will look different
they need to help us shop they need to show us how to cook quick tasty seasonal meals for people that are busy this is not expensive it is done in some and it needs to be done across the board in america soon and quick
the big brands you know the food brands need to put food education at the heart of their businesses i know easier said than done
it's the future it's the only way fast food with the fast food industry you know it's very competitive
right so these guys are going to be part of the solution but we need to get the government to work with all of the fast food purveyors and the restaurant industry
and over a five six seven year period wean of us off the extreme amounts of fat sugar fat and all the other non food ok school
ok school proper fresh food
from local growers on site ok there needs to be a new standard of fresh proper food for your children
under the circumstances it's profoundly important that every single american child leaves school knowing how to cook ten recipes that will save their life
that means that they can be
young parents and be able to sort of duck and dive around the basics of cooking no matter what recession hits them next time if you can cook
the workplace we hadn't really talked about it
now time for corporate responsibility to really look at what they feed or make available to their staff the staff are the moms and dads of america 's children marissa
father died in her hand i think she'd be quite happy if corporate america could start feeding their staff properly definitely they shouldn 't be left out let 's go back to the home now
if we do all this stuff and we can it's so achievable you can care and be commercial absolutely but the home needs to start passing on cooking again for sure for sure pass it on as a philosophy
and for me it's quite romantic but it's about if one person teaches three people how to cook something and now they teach three of their mates that only has to repeat itself twenty five times and that's the whole population of america romantic yes
but most importantly it's about trying to get people to realize that every one of your individual efforts makes a difference we've got to put back what's been lost huntington kitchen
six and a half grand per school
five grand a month okay this can do five thousand people a year which is ten percent of their population and it's people on people
you know it's local cooks teaching local people it's free cooking lessons guys free cooking lessons in the main street this is real tangible change real tangible change
around america if we just look back now there is plenty of wonderful things going on farm to school set
garden set ups education there are amazing people doing this already the problem is they all want to roll out what their doing to the next school and the next but there is no cash
we need to recognize the experts and the angels quickly identify them and allow them to easily find the resource to keep rolling out
what they're already doing and doing well businesses of america need to support misters obama to do the things that she wants to do
i know it's weird having an english person standing here before you talking about all this all i can say is i care i'm a father and i love this country
and i believe truly actually that if change can be made in this country
i though if i had a magic wand
what would i do and i thought you know what i'd just love to be put in front of some of the most amazing movers and shakers in america
is for you to help a strong sustainable movement to educate every child
to inspire families to cook again
and to empower people everywhere to fight obesity
