pointed out every time you come here you learn something this morning the world 's experts from i guess three or four different companies
on building seats i think concluded that ultimately the solution is people shouldn 't sit down i could have told them
thirty and fifty years from today that they will be steering cars by wire without all that mechanical stuff that's reassuring
they then pointed out there'd be sort of the other controls by wire to get rid of all that mechanical stuff that's pretty good but
get rid of the wires then you don't need anything to control the car except thinking about
i would love to talk about the technology and sometime in what's past the fifteen minutes i'll be happy
talk to all the techno geeks around here about what's in here but if i had one thing to say about this before we get to first
it would be that from the time we started building this the big idea wasn't the technology it really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it in the ibot for the disabled community the big idea here
is i think a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation and maybe to put that in perspective
for instance in that time ninety one percent of america lived either on farms or in small towns so the car
the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage was a big deal it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage it was half as long
and a million of them urinating and doing other things and the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable so the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and
it also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm or their farm to a town or from a town to a city it all made sense with ninety one percent of the people living there
by the nineteen fifties we started connecting all the towns together with what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world the highway system and it is certainly
a wonder and by the way as i take shots at old technologies i want to assure everybody and
but think about where the world is today fifty percent of the global population now lives in cities that's three point two billion people
and fifty years ago locomotives got efficient enough steam power that we turned the continent into a country
over the last hundred years we started building cars and then over the fifty years we've connected every city to every other city in an extraordinarily efficient way and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence
but during that entire process
more and more people have been born and more and more people are moving to cities china alone is going to move four to six hundred million people into cities in the next decade and a half
and so nobody i think would argue that airplanes in the last fifty years have turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood
and i certainly wouldn't want to give up my airplane or my helicopter or my humvee or my porsche i love them all i don't keep any of them in my living room the fact is
the last mile is the problem and half the world now lives in dense cities and people spend depending on who they are between ninety and ninety five percent of their energy getting around on foot i think
i don't know what data would impress you but how about forty three percent of the refined fuel produced in the world is consumed by cars in metropolitan areas in the united states
three million people die every year in cities due to bad air and almost all particulate pollution on this planet is produced
by transportation devices particularly sitting in cities and again i say that not to attack any industry i think
i really do i love my airplane
and cars on highways moving sixty miles an hour are extraordinarily efficient both from an engineering point of view an energy consumption point of view
it's neither fun nor efficient nor productive it's not sustainable
if five percent of that population became quote middle class and wanted to
the way we've gone in the last hundred years at the same time that fifty percent of their population are moving into cities of the size and density of manhattan every six weeks it isn't sustainable environmentally
it isn't sustainable economically there just ain't enough oil and it's not sustainable politically i mean what are we fighting over right now we can make it complicated but
what's the world fighting over right now so it seemed to me
somebody had to work on that last mile and it was dumb luck we were working on ibots but once we made this we instantly decided it could be a great
alternative to jet skis you don't need the water or snowmobiles you don't need the snow or skiing it's just fun and people love to move around doing fun things
and every one of those industries by the way just golf carts alone is a multi billion dollar industry
rather than go license this off which is what we normally do it seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology but into an understanding of a world that's solved all its other problems but has somehow come to accept
that cities which right back from ancient greece on were meant to walk around cities that were architected and built for people
now have a footprint that while we've solved every other transportation problem and it's like moore 's law i mean look at the time it took to cross a continent in a conestoga wagon
railroad then an airplane every other form of transportation 's been improved in five thousand years we've gone backwards in getting around cities
they've gotten bigger they're spread out the most expensive real estate on this planet in every city wilshire boulevard or fifth avenue or tokyo
or paris the most expensive real estate is their downtowns sixty five percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars the twenty largest cities in the world
so you wonder what if cities could give to their pedestrians what we take for granted as we now go between cities
what if you could make them fun attractive clean environmentally friendly
access via this as that last link to mass transit
to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs and use our cars the way we want and then have our cities energized again
we thought it would be really neat to do that
and one of the problems we really were worried about is how do we get legal on the sidewalk because technically i've got motors i've got wheels i'm a motor vehicle
i don't look like a motor vehicle i have the same footprint as a pedestrian i have the same unique capability
to deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space i took this down to ground zero and knocked my way through crowds for an hour i'm a pedestrian but the law typically lags technology by a generation or two and
if we get told we don't belong on the sidewalk we have two choices
maybe we should be out in the street in front of a greyhound bus or a vehicle
we've been so concerned about that we went to the postmaster general of the united states as the first person we ever showed on the outside and said put your people on it everybody trusts their postman and they belong on the sidewalks and they'll use it
he agreed we went to a number of police departments that want their police officers back in the neighborhood on the beat carrying seventy pounds of stuff
they love it and i can't believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket
so we've been working really really hard but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop as an attitude about what's important and how to apply the technology we went out and we found some visionary people with enough
let us design and build these things and in hopefully enough time to get them accepted
so i'm happy really i am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want and yes it's really fun and yes you should all go out and try it
but if i could ask you to do one thing it's not to think about it as a piece of technology but just imagine that although we all understand somehow that it's reasonable
that we use our four thousand pound machine which can go sixty miles an hour that can bring you everywhere you want to go and somehow
it's also what we used for the last mile and it's broken and it doesn't work
one of the more exciting things that occurred to us about
why it might get accepted happened out here in california a few weeks ago after we launched it we were here with a news crew
on venice beach zipping up and back and he 's marveling at the technology and meanwhile bicycles are zipping by and skateboarders are zipping by
and a little old lady i mean if you looked in the dictionary a little old lady
came by me and now that i'm on this i'm the height of a normal adult now and
she just stops and the camera is there and she looks up at me and
says can i try that
and what was i you know how are you going to say anything and so i said sure so i get off and she gets on and with a little bit of the usual ah then she turns around and she goes about
twenty feet and she turns back around and she's all smiles and she comes back to me and she stops and she says
and the camera is looking down at her i'm thinking wow that was great
please lady don't say another word
and the camera is down at her and this guy has to put the microphone in her face said what do you mean by that
and she looks up and she says well
she's still watching these guys go she says i can't ride a bike no she says i can't use
a skateboard and i've never used roller blades she knew them by name she says and it's been
fifty years since i rode a bicycle then she looks up she's looking up and she says
and i'm eighty one years old and i don't drive a car anymore i still have to get to the store and i can't carry a lot of things and
it suddenly occurred to me that among my many fears were not just that the bureaucracy and the regulators and the legislators might not get it
it was that fundamentally you believe there's pressure among the people not to invade the most precious little bit of space left the sidewalks in these cities when you look at the
thirty six inches of legal requirement for sidewalk then the eight foot for the parked car then the three lanes and then the other eight feet it's that little piece is all that's there
but she looks up and says this and it occurs to me well kids aren't going to mind these things and they don't vote and business people and then young adults aren't going to mind these things they're pretty cool so i
i was worried that it's the older population that's going to worry so having seen this and having worried about it for eight years
the first thing i do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regulatory guys call aarp get an appointment right away we've got to show them this thing
and they took it to washington they showed them and they're going to be involved now watching how these things get absorbed
in a number of cities like atlanta where we're doing trials to see if it really can in fact help re energize their downtown
the bottom line is whether you believe the united nations or any of the other think tanks in the next twenty years all human population growth on this planet will be in cities
in asia alone it will be over a billion people they learned to start with cell phones they didn't have to take the one hundred year trip we took
being in a four thousand pound machine to do it cars were not meant for parallel parking they're wonderful machines to go between cities but just think about it we've solved all
long range high speed problems the greeks went from the theater of dionysus to the parthenon in their sandals you do it
in your sneakers not much has changed if this thing goes only three times as fast as walking three times a thirty minute walk becomes ten minutes your choice when living in a city
if it's now ten minutes
but if you could put a pin in most cities and imagine how far you could if you had the time walk in one half hour it's the city
if you could make it fun and make it eight or ten minutes you can't find your car un park your car move your car re park your car and go somewhere you can't get to a cab or
we could change the way people allocate their resources the way this planet uses its energy make it more fun and we're hoping to some extent history will say we were right
that's segway this is a stirling cycle engine this had been confused by a lot of things we're doing
this little beast right now is producing a few hundred watts of electricity yes it could be attached to this and yes
kilogram of propane you could drive from new york to boston if you so choose
ten watt hours per kilogram in lead twenty watt hours per kilogram nickel cadmium forty watt hours per kilogram in nickel metal hydride sixty watt hours per kilogram in lithium
eight thousand seven hundred and fifty watt hours of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline which is why nobody drives electric cars but in any event if you can burn it
with the same efficiency because it's external combustion as your kitchen stove if you can burn any fuel it turns out to be pretty neat it makes just enough electricity to for instance do this
which at night is enough electricity in the rest of the world as mister holly doctor holly pointed out can run computers and a light bulb
but more interestingly the thermodynamics of this
if you wanted to boil water and re condense it at a rate of ten gallons an hour it takes about twenty five a little over twenty five point three kilowatt twenty five thousand watts of continuous power to do it
so much energy you couldn't afford to desalinate or clean water in this country that way certainly in the rest of the world your choice is to devastate the place turning everything that will burn into heat or drink the water that's available
the number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water depending on whose numbers you believe it's between sixty and eighty five thousand people per day
we figured out how to put a vapor compression distiller on this thing with a counter flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat then using
a little bit of the electricity control that process and for four hundred and fifty watts which is a little more than half of its waste heat
it will make ten gallons an hour of distilled water from anything that comes into it to cool it so if we put this box on here in a few years could we have a solution to transportation
