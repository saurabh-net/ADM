english i start speaking english learning english about a year ago i speak french and i grew up with french so my english is franglais
in the western congo in an area around here and then went to university in kisangani
and after i finished i went to this area the ituri forest but what i've been doing when i was about fourteen
i grew in my uncle 's house and my father was a soldier and my uncle was a fisherman and
also a poacher what i've been doing from fourteen to seventeen was i was assisting
and whatever they were killing poaching hunting in the forest bring it in the main city to get access to the
but finally i got myself involved around seventeen to twenty years i became
even so i did it and for three to four years i went to university for three times i
to biomedical science to be a doctor i didn't succeed i was having my inscriptions my admission to biology
and i said no way i'm not doing it my family 's poor my area don't have better health care i want to be a doctor
that means three years and i start getting old i say oh no i continue so i did tropical ecology and plant botany
when i finished i went to ituri forest for my internship it's where i really getting passion with what i'm doing right
now i'm standing in front of you doing botany and wildlife conservation that time the ituri forest was created as a forest reserve
and also plants and the training center there was built around the scientific congolese staff and
so the okapi faunal reserve protects number i think that is the largest number of elephant we have right now in protected area in congo it has also chimpanzees and it
okapi faunal reserve because of this beautiful creature that is a forest giraffe i think you guys know it quite well here we have
giraffe but through evolutions we have this forest giraffe that
it has also some beautiful primates thirteen species highest diversity we can find in one single area in africa and it has the ituri forest itself about one thousand
teaching assistant at my university because i accomplished with honor but i didn't like the
i got was very poor and i wanted to be from to a training center and a research center with the end of
was completely difficult to do and to achieve
when kabila started his movement to liberate congo so mobutu soldiers started
moving and retreated so they started fleeing from the east to the west and the okapi faunal reserve is
so there was a road from goma somewhere here and coming like this so they might go through pass through okapi faunal reserve congo has five of
sites of protected area and okapi faunal reserve is one of them so soldier was fleeing in the okapi faunal reserve
way they looted everything torture wars oh my god you can't believe
every person was looking his way where to go we don't know and it was for us young the first time really we hear the language of
what was happening they were killing people they were doing whatever they want because they have power who have been doing that
young children child soldiers you can't ask him how old he is because he has guns but i was from the west working in the east i even that time was not speaking
and when they came they looted everything you can't speak lingala because lingala was from mobutu and everyone speaking lingala is soldier and i was from the same area
my friends said we are leaving because we are a target but i'm not going to the east because there i don't know swahili i
if i go i will be killed i can't go back to my area it's more than one thousand kilometers i stayed after they looted everything
we have been doing research on botany and we have a small herbarium of four thousand five hundred sheets of plants we cut we dry and we packed them we mounted them on a
so that we start them for agriculture for medicine for whatever and for science
the study of the flora and the change of the forest that is people moving around that's even pygmies and this is a bright guy
person and pygmies i've been working with him about ten years and with soldiers they went to the forest for
know how to track elephant in the forest he have been attacked by leopard and they abandon him in the forest they came to told me
and what i did i gave him just antibiotics that we care for that tuberculosis and fortunately
so on and what of important things i think all of you here
have killed a lot five millions of congolese have gone because of
that they use it to make cell phone and it have been in that area all over in congo extraction and good big business of the
and what i did for the first war after we have lost everything i have to save something even myself my life and life of the staff
i buried some of our new vehicle engine i buried it to save it and some of equipment went with them on the top of the canopy to save it he 's not collecting plants he 's going to save our equipment
with the material that's left because they wanted to destroy it to burn it they didn't understand it they didn't go to school
it and that is me going to hurrying to uganda try to save that four thousand material with people
them on the bikes bicycles and after that we succeeded i housed that four thousand material
the herbarium of makerere university and after the war i have been able to bring it back home so that
the second war came while we didn't expect it with friends we have been sitting and watching match football and having some good music with
when it started i think so it was so bad we heard that now from the east again
and it's going fast this time i think kabila will go in place of as he did with mobutu and the reserve was
that's the powerful men we have to meet and to talk to them what's the regulation of the reserve and what is the regulation of the parks and they can't do what they are doing so we went to meet them that is
gold mining so we started talking with them convincing them that we are in a protected area
there is regulations that it's prohibited to do logging mining and poaching specifically
we don't think so we have to do it because to let our movement advance i say no way you are not going to do it here
we started talking with them and i was negotiating tried to protect our equipment tried to protect our staff and the villages of about one thousand five hundred people
and we continued but i was doing that negotiating with them sometimes we are having meeting and they are talking with
and i'm there sometimes they talk to my own language that is lingala i hear it and what strategy they are doing what they are planning sometimes they are having helicopter to supply them with ammunition and so on they used me to
and i was doing counting what comes from where and where and where i
this equipment my satellite phone my computer and a plastic
that i hide it in the forest and every time daily after we have meeting what
we have whatever i go i write a short email send it i don't know how many people i
my address i sent the message what is going about the progress of the war and what they are planning to do they started suspecting that
what we do on the morning and the afternoon it's on the news bbc rfi something might be going on and one day we went for
we went to meet the chief commander he had the same iridium cell phone like me and he asked me do you know how to use this i said i have never
i don't know and i had mine on my pocket so it was a chance that they trusted me a lot they didn 't they was
on me so i was scared and when we finished the meeting i went to return it in the forest and i was
sending news doing whatever reporting daily to u n to unesco to our institution in new york
the first two rebellions they killed all animals in the zoo we have a zoo of fourteen okapis and one of them was pregnant
and during the war after a week of heavy war fighting in the area we succeeded we had the first okapi this is the only trouser and
after a week we celebrated the birthday of that okapi they killed elephant just fifty meters
area where the zoo where okapi was born and i was mad i oppose it that they are now going to dissect it until i do my
report and then i see the chief commander and i succeeded the elephant just decayed and
what we are doing after that that was the situation of the
some money i was paid one hundred and fifty dollars i
to rebuild the herbarium because we didn't have good infrastructure to start plants wildlife conservation society more dealing with plants
i started this with seventy dollars and start fundraising money to where i've been going i had opportunity to go all over where herbarium for my african material is and
they supported me a bit and i built this now it's doing work to train young congolese and also what one of the speciality we are doing
my design is tracking the global warming effect on biodiversity and what the impacts of the ituri forest is
uptake carbon this is one of the study we are doing on forty hectares plot where we have
to see how that forest is contributing to the carbon reductions and that is i think
it's difficult for me this is a very embarrassing talk i know i don't know where to start where to finish it when i was thinking to come here
you people now we are talking about reconstitution rebuild africa but is gun industries a tool to
is it a game i think we
see the war like a game like soccer football everybody is happy but see what it's doing see what
going in darfur now we say oh my god see what the wars in rwanda that's because of the language of guns i don't think that someone may blame google
story i suspect a lot of people here have the same question i have how can we
i did it myself if i know when i was young that killing elephant i'm destroying biodiversity i would not
many many of you have seen the talents of africans but there are few who are going to school
many are dying because of all those kind of pandemics hiv malaria poverty not going to school
but many of them are just here because they don't have money and they can't go even to university
