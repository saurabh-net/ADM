to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem it allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we're also so fortunate to eat so what do we call this i think we call it restorative seafood
where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain restorative is the ability to replenish and progress restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean
as a resource suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency it is a more hopeful it is a more human and is a more useful way of understanding our environment
guides standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world are very handy they're a wonderful tool
green yellow and red lists seafood species the association is very easy buy green don't buy red think twice about yellow
but in my mind it's really not enough to just eat green list we can't sustain this without the measure of our success really changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red
but what if we eat only in the green list you've got pole caught yellowfin tuna here comes from sustainable stocks pole caught no bycatch great for fishermen lots of money supporting local economies
but it's a lion of the sea it's a top predator what's the context of this meal am i sitting down in a steakhouse to a sixteen oz portion of
do i do this three times a week i might still be in the green list but i'm not doing myself or you or the oceans any favors
we have to have a context a gauge for our actions in all this example i've heard that red wine is great for my health
and minerals heart healthy that's great i love red wine i'm going to drink so much of it i'm going to be so healthy well how many bottles is it before you tell me that i have a problem
so the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs restorative seafood might best be represented not by jaws or by flipper or the gordon 's fisherman but rather by the jolly green giant
we must continue to eat the best seafood possible if at all but we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables
the best part about restorative seafood though is that it comes on the half shell with a bottle of tabasco and lemon wedges it comes in a five ounce portion of tilapia breaded with dijon mustard
this is an easy sell and the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood walmart jamie oliver
so i think we have this whole eating this wrong and so i think it's time we change what we expect from our food sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand so let 's start there
green foods often represent a way for us to disregard the responsibility as eaters just because it comes from a green source doesn't mean we can treat it with disregard on the
we have eco friendly shrimp we can make them we have that technology but we can never have any eco friendly all you can eat shrimp buffet it doesn't work
heart healthy dinner is a very important part of restorative seafood while we try and manage declining marine populations the media's recommending increased consumption of seafood
restorative options this is what we need to favor this is what the green list says but this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment
i have a recipe for you it pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean so here we go start with a sixteen oz portion of big fish
i expect a lot from food i expect health and joy and family and community i expect that producing ingredients preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the communion of human interests
i was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook and he taught me very early on about the privilege that eating represents i remember well the meals of my childhood they were
i get sick when i go to steakhouses i get the meat sweats it's like a hangover from protein it's disgusting
but of all the dire news that you'll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oceans i have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you possibly the very worst of it and that is this whole time
your mother was right eat your vegetables
it's pretty straightforward so what are we looking for in a meal well for health i'm looking for wholesome ingredients that are good for my body
for joy i'm looking for butter and salt and sexy things that make things taste less like penance for family i'm looking for recipes that genuflect to my own personal histories
for community though we start at the very beginning there's no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact so try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step to minimize it
so if we all take only what we need then we can begin to share the rest we can begin to celebrate we can begin to restore
we need to savor vegetables we need to savor smaller portions of seafood and we need to save dinner thank you
