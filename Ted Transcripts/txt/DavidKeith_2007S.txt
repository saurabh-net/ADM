and the reason i'm saying this is that you may have the idea this problem is relatively recent that people have just sort of figured out about it and now with
kyoto and the governator and people beginning to actually do something we may be on the road to a solution the fact is
we've known about this problem for fifty years depending on how you count it we have talked about it endlessly over the last decade or so and we've accomplished close to zip
this is the growth rate of co two in the atmosphere you've seen this in various forms but maybe you haven't seen this one what this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating
to make the projections look as bad as possible that emissions would never grow as fast as that red line but in fact they're growing
and the rate at which the arctic sea ice is going away is a lot quicker than models so despite all sorts of experts like me flying around the planet and burning jet fuel
really need to do to put the brakes on this very high inertial thing our big economy we've really hardly started really we're doing this basically really not very much
i don't want to depress you too much the problem is absolutely soluble and even soluble in a way that's reasonably cheap cheap meaning sort of the cost of the military not the cost of
medical care cheap meaning a few percent of gdp no this is really important to have this sense of scale
so the problem is soluble and the way we should go about solving it is say dealing with electricity production which causes something like forty three or so percent and rising of co two emissions
what you do if you don't stop the emissions quickly enough and you need to deal somehow break the link between human actions that change climate and the climate change itself
and that's particularly important because of course while we can adapt to climate change and it's important to be honest here there will be some benefits to climate change oh yes i think it's bad i've spent my whole life working to stop it but one of the reasons it's politically hard
so this problem is absolutely soluble this geo engineering idea in it's simplest form is basically the following you could put signed particles say sulfuric acid particles sulfates
into the upper atmosphere the stratosphere where they'd reflect away sunlight and cool the planet and i know for certain that that will work not that there aren't side effects but i know for certain it will work and the reason is it's been done
and it was done not by us
but by nature here 's mount pinatubo in the early nineties that put a whole bunch of sulfur in the stratosphere with a sort of atomic bomb like cloud the result of that was pretty dramatic
after that and some previous volcanoes we have you see a quite dramatic cooling of the atmosphere so this lower bar is the upper atmosphere the stratosphere and it heats up after these volcanoes
but you'll notice that in the upper bar which is the lower atmosphere and the surface it cools down because we shielded the atmosphere a little bit there's no big mystery about it there's lots of mystery in the details
and there's some bad side effects like it partially destroys the ozone layer and i'll get to that in a minute but it clearly cools down and one other thing it's fast
really important to say so much of the other things that we ought to do like slowing emissions are intrinsically slow because
is the sum of emissions over time so you can't step on the brakes very quickly but if you do this it's quick and there are times you might like to do something quick
another thing you might wonder about is does it work can you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added
with twice the amount of co two in the air the lower graph is with twice the amount of co two and one point eight percent less sunlight
and you're back to the original climate and this graph from ken caldera it's important to say came because ken at a meeting that i believe marty hoffart was also at in the mid nineties ken and i stood up at the back of the meeting and said geo engineering won 't work and
in fact which had all the modern climate science the only thing they talked about doing was geo engineering it didn't even talk about cutting emissions which is an incredible shift in our thinking about this problem i'm not saying we shouldn 't cut emissions we should
but it made exactly this point so in a sense there's not much new the one new thing is this essay so i should say i guess that since the time of
hot topic if i may make the pun in the last fifteen years this became so un pc we couldn't talk about it it just sunk below the surface we weren't allowed to speak about it but in the last year paul crutzen published this essay
saying roughly what's all been said before that maybe given our very slow rate of progress in solving this problem and the uncertain impacts we should think about things like this he said roughly what's been said before the big deal was he happened to have won the nobel prize for ozone chemistry and so people took him seriously
when he said we should think about this even though there would be some ozone impacts and in fact he had some ideas to make them go away there was all sorts of press coverage all over the world
going right down to doctor strangelove saves the earth from the economist and that got me thinking i've worked on this topic on and off but not so much technically and i was actually lying in bed thinking one night and i thought about this child 's toy hence the title of my talk
and it turns out i woke up the next morning and i started to calculate this it was very hard to calculate from first principles i was stumped but then i found out that there were all sorts of papers already published that addressed this topic because it happens already in the natural atmosphere
gas molecules that bounce off the warm side bounce away with some extra velocity because it's warm and so you see a net force away from the sun that's called the photophoretic force
but it looks like we could achieve long atmospheric lifetimes much longer than before because they're levitated we can move things out of the stratosphere into the mesosphere in principle solving the ozone problem
i'm sure there will be other problems that arise finally we could make the particles migrate to over the poles so we could arrange the climate engineering so it really focused on the poles
that if engineers and scientists really turned their minds to this it's amazing how we can affect the planet the one thing about this is that it gives us extraordinary leverage this improved science and engineering will whether we like it or not now suppose that
space aliens arrived maybe they're going to land at the un headquarters down the road here or maybe they'll pick a smarter spot but suppose they arrive and they give you a box
we're building that box the scientists and the engineers of the world are building it piece by piece in their labs even when they're doing it for other reasons
just working on protecting the environment they have no interest in crazy ideas like engineering the whole planet they develop science that makes it easier and easier to do
and so i guess my view on this is not that i want to do it i do not
but that we should move this out of the shadows and talk about it seriously because sooner or later we'll be confronted with decisions about this and it's better if we think hard about it even if we want to think hard about reasons why we should never do
give you two different ways to think about this problem that are the beginning of my
thinking about how to think about it but what we need is not just a few oddballs like me thinking about this we need a broader debate a debate that involves
so here 's one way to think about it which is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because it's cheaper i guess the thing i haven't said about this is it is absurdly cheap it's conceivable that say using the sulfates method or this method i've come up with you could
create an ice age at a cost of one percent of gdp it's very cheap we have a lot of leverage it's not a good idea but it's just important i'll tell you how big
the lever is the lever is that big and that calculation isn't much in dispute you might argue about the sanity of it but the leverage is
so because of this we could deal with the problem simply by stopping reducing emissions and just as the concentrations go up we can increase the amount of geo engineering i don't think anybody takes that seriously
because under this scenario we walk further and further away from the current climate we have all sorts of other problems like ocean acidification that come from co two in the atmosphere anyway
nobody but maybe one or two very odd folks really suggest this but here 's a case which is harder to reject
let 's say that we don't do geo engineering we do what we ought to do which is get serious about cutting emissions but we don't really know how quickly we have to cut them there's a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much climate change is too much
we've seen the worst of it but maybe on that day we also find that the greenland ice sheet is really melting unacceptably fast fast enough to put meters of sea level
on the oceans in the next one hundred years and remove some of the biggest cities from the map that's an absolutely possible scenario
that's a very different way to look at the problem it's using this as risk control not instead of action it's saying that you do some geo engineering for a little while to take the worst of the heat off not that you'd use it as a substitute for action
but there is a problem with that view and the problem is the following knowledge that geo engineering is possible makes the climate impacts look less fearsome
and that makes a weaker commitment to cutting emissions today this is what economists call a moral hazard
and that's one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about and in general i think it's the underlying reason that it's been politically unacceptable to talk about this but you don't make good policy by hiding things in a drawer
three questions and then one final quote
should we do serious research on this topic
should we have a national research program that looks at this not just at how you would do it better but also what all the risks and downsides of it are right now you have a few enthusiasts talking about it
some in a positive side some in a negative side but that's a dangerous state to be in because there's very little depth of knowledge on this topic
a very small amount of money would get us some many of us maybe now me think we should do that but i have a lot of reservations my reservations are principally about the moral hazard problem
and i don't really know how we can best avoid the moral hazard i think there is a serious problem as you talk about this people begin to think they don't need to work so hard to cut emissions another thing is maybe we need
they may not be very interested in our moral conversations about how to do this and they may just decide they'd really rather have a geo engineered world than a non geoengineered world and we'll have no international mechanism to figure out who makes the decision
so here 's one last thought which was said much much better twenty five years ago in the u s national academy report than i can say today and i think it really summarizes where we are here
that the co two problem the climate problem that we've heard about is driving lots of things innovations in energy technologies that will reduce emissions but also i think inevitably it will drive us towards thinking about climate and weather control whether we like it or not
begin thinking about it even if the reason we're thinking about it is to construct arguments for why we shouldn 't do it thank you very much
