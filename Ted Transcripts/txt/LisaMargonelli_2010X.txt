but before i talk about the political chemistry i actually need to talk about the chemistry of oil this is a photograph from when i visited prudhoe bay in alaska in two thousand and two to watch the minerals management service testing
their ability to burn oil spills in ice and what you see here is you see a little bit of crude oil you see some ice cubes and you see two sandwich baggies of napalm the napalm is burning there quite nicely
and the thing is is that oil is really an abstraction for us as the american consumer we're four percent of the world 's population we use twenty five percent of the world 's oil production
and we don't understand what oil is until you check out its molecules and you don't really understand that until you see this stuff burn
so this is what happens as that burn gets going it takes off it's a big woosh i highly recommend that you get a chance to see crude oil burn someday because you will never need to hear another
oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules it starts of with the very small ones which are one carbon four hydrogen that's methane it just floats off then there's all sorts of intermediate ones with middle amounts of carbon you've probably heard of benzene rings they're very carcinogenic
it goes all the way over to these big thick galumphy ones that have hundreds of carbons and they have thousands of hydrogens and they have vanadium and heavy metals and sulfur and all kinds of craziness
oil doesn't sink it floats if it sank it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill and the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water it spreads out to be really thin so you have a hard time corralling it the next thing that happens is
the light ends evaporate and some of the toxic things float into the water column and kill fish eggs and smaller fish and things like that and
and then the asphaltenes and this is the crucial thing the asphaltenes get whipped by the waves into a frothy emulsion something like mayonnaise it triples the amount
oily messy goo that you have in the water and it makes it very hard to handle it also makes it very viscous when the prestige sank off the coast of spain
there were big floating cushions the size of sofa cushions of emulsified oil with the consistency or the viscosity of chewing gum it's incredibly hard to clean up and every single oil is different when it hits water
when the chemistry of the oil and water also hits our politics it's absolutely explosive for the first time american consumers
will kind of see the oil supply chain in front of themselves they have a eureka moment when we suddenly understand oil in a different context
i am helpless over this and this is what happens to us at the gas pump and actually gas pumps are specifically designed to diffuse that anger
you might notice that many gas pumps including this one are designed to look like atmiss i've talked to engineers that's specifically to diffuse our anger because supposedly we feel good about
shows you how bad it is but actually i mean this feeling of helplessness comes in because most americans actually feel that oil prices are the result of a conspiracy not
we have designed this system where if you want to get a job
it's much more important to have a car that runs to have a job and keep a job than to have a ged and that's actually very perverse now there's another perverse thing about the way we buy gas which is that we'd rather be doing anything else
this is bp 's gas station in downtown los angeles it is green it is a shrine to greenishness now you think why would something so lame work on people so smart well
the reason is is because when we're buying gas we're very invested in this sort of cognitive dissonance i mean we're angry at the one hand
and we want to be somewhere else we don't want to be buying oil we want to be doing something green and we get kind of in on our own con
i mean and this is funny it looks funny here but in fact that's why the slogan beyond petroleum worked but it's an inherent part of our energy policy
parcel of the way that we deal with oil and it's really important to dealing with this oil spill okay so the politics of oil are very moral in the united states the oil industry is like a huge gigantic
octopus of engineering and finance and everything else but we actually see it in very moral terms this is an early on photograph you can see we had these gushers
early journalists looked at these spills and they said this is a filthy industry but they also saw in it that people were getting rich for doing nothing
they weren't farmers they were just getting rich for stuff coming out of the ground it's the beverly hillbillies basically but in the beginning this was seen as a very morally problematic thing long before it became funny
and then of course there was john d rockefeller and the thing about john d is that he went into this chaotic wild east of oil industry
and he rationalized it into a vertically integrated company a multinational it was terrifying you think walmart is a terrifying business model now imagine what this looked like in the eighteen sixties or eighteen seventies
and it also the kind of root of how we see oil as a conspiracy but what's really amazing is that
a thin nose like a thorn there were no lips there were puffs under the little colorless eyes with creases running from them
i mean this is a very pervasive this is part of our dna and then there's this guy okay so you might be wondering why it is that every time we have high oil prices or an oil spill we call these ceos down to washington
the whole oil industry into these ceos and we take it as you know we look at it on a moral level rather than looking at it on a legal and financial level and so
not saying these guys aren't liable to answer questions i'm just saying that when you focus on whether they are or are not a bunch of greedy bastards
really reducing the amount of oil and reducing our dependence on oil so i'm saying this is kind of a distraction but it makes for good theater and it's powerfully cathartic as you probably saw last week
so the thing about water oil spills is that they are very politically galvanizing i mean these pictures this is from the santa barbara spill
put in place the national environmental policy act the clean air act the clean water act everything that we are really stemmed from this period
i think it's important to kind of look at these pictures of the birds and understand what happens to us he we are normally we're standing at the gas pump and we're feeling kind of helpless we look at these pictures
and we understand for the first time our role in this supply chain we connect the dots in the supply chain and we have this kind of as voters we have kind of a eureka moment
this is why these moments of these oil spills are so important but it's also really important that we don't get distracted by the theater or the morals of it we actually need to go in and work on the roots of the problem
one of the things that happened with the two previous oil spills was that we really worked on some of the symptoms we were very reactive as opposed to being proactive
about what happened and so what we did was actually we made moratoriums on the east and west coasts on drilling we stopped drilling in
but we didn't actually reduce the amount of oil that we consumed in fact it's continued to increase the only thing that really reduces the amount of oil that we consume is much higher prices
as you can see our own production has fallen off as our reservoirs have gotten old and expensive to drill out we only have two percent of the world 's oil reserves sixty five percent of them are in the persian gulf
which is two times the size of maryland has had thousands of oil spills a year i mean we've essentially been exporting oil spills when we import oil from places without tight environmental regulations
but in fact these guys actually live in a war zone there's a thousand battle related deaths a year in this area twice the size of maryland and it's all related to the oil and these guys
i mean if they were in the u s they might be actually here in this room they have degrees in political science degrees in business they're entrepreneurs they don't actually want to be doing what they're doing and it's sort of one of the other
we put in a big oil project in chad with exxon so the u s taxpayer paid for it the world bank exxon paid for it we put it in there was a tremendous banditry problem i was there in two thousand and three we were driving along this dark
dark road and the guy in the green stepped out and i was just like ahhh this is it and then the guy in the exxon
chad has become much more unstable and we are not paying for that price at the pump we pay for it in our taxes on april fifteenth we do the same thing with the price of
pump we pay for it on april fifteenth and we can't even calculate the cost of this involvement
the other place that is sort of supporting our dependence on oil and our increased consumption is the gulf of mexico which was not part of the moratoriums
now what's happened in the gulf of mexico as you can see this is the minerals management diagram of wells for gas and oil it's become this intense industrialized zone it doesn't have the same resonance for us that the arctic national wildlife refuge has but it should i mean it's a bird sanctuary
also every time you buy gasoline in the united states half of it is actually being refined along the coast because the gulf actually has about fifty percent of our refining capacity
and a lot of our marine terminals as well so the people of the gulf have essentially been subsidizing the rest of us through a less clean environment
and finally american families also pay a price for oil now on the one hand the price at the pump is not really very high when you consider the actual cost of the oil
but on the other hand the fact that people have no other transit options means that they pay a large amount of their income into
they're actually spending more on their car and fuel than they are on taxes or on health care and the same thing happens at the fiftieth percentile around eighty thousand
so what i'm going to talk to you about now is what do we have to do this time what are the laws what do we have to do to keep ourselves focused one thing is we need to stay away from the theater we need to stay away from the moratoriums
we need to focus really back again on the molecules the moratoriums are fine but we do need to focus on the molecules on the oil
one of the things that we also need to do is we need to try to not kind of fool ourselves into thinking that you can have a green world before you reduce the amount of oil that we use we need to focus on reducing the
what you see in this top drawing is a schematic of how petroleum gets used in the u s economy it comes in on the side the useful stuff is the dark gray and the unuseful stuff which is called the rejected energy
the waste goes up to the top now you can see that the waste far outweighs the actually useful amount and one of the things that we need to do is not only fix the fuel efficiency of our vehicles
and make them much more efficient but we also need to fix the economy in general we need to remove the perverse incentives to use more fuel for example we have an insurance system where the person who drives twenty thousand miles a year
pays the same insurance as somebody who drives three thousand we actually encourage people to drive more we have policies that reward sprawl we have all kinds of policies we need to have more mobility choices
we need to make the gas price better reflect the real cost of oil and we need to shift subsidies from the oil industry which is at least ten billion dollars a year
into something that allows middle class people to find better ways to commute whether that's getting a much more efficient car and also kind of building markets for new cars and new fuels down the road this is where we need to be
we need to kind of rationalize this whole thing and you can find more about this policy it's called strong which is
now supposedly oil taxes are the third rail of american politics the no fly zone i actually i agree that a dollar a gallon on oil is probably too much
that we could actually significantly reduce our gasoline consumption and at the same time we would give people time to prepare time to respond and we would be raising money and raising consciousness at the same time let me give you a little sense of how this would work
this is a gas receipt hypothetically for a year from now the first thing that you have on the tax is you have a tax for a stronger america thirty three cents so you're not helpless at the pump
and the second thing that you have is a kind of warning sign very similar to what you would find on a cigarette pack
and what it says is the national academy of sciences estimates that every gallon of gas you burn in your car creates twenty nine cents in health care costs that's a lot
and so this you can see that you're paying considerably less than the health care costs on the tax and also the hope is that you
start to be connected to the whole greater system and at the same time you have a number that you can call to get more information on commuting or
low interest loan on a different kind of car or whatever it is you're going to need to actually reduce your gasoline dependence
but in order to do this one of the things we really need to do is we need to remember we are people of the hydrocarbon we need to keep or minds on the molecules and not get
distracted by the theater not get distracted by the cognitive dissonance of the green possibilities that are out there we need to kind of get down and do the gritty work of reducing our dependence upon this fuel and these molecules thank you
