we are drowning in news reuters alone puts out three and a half million news stories a year that's just one source my question is how many of those stories are actually going to matter in the long run
that's the idea behind the long news it's a project by the long now foundation which was founded by tedsters including kevin kelly and stewart brand
a lot falls by the wayside if you take the top stories from the a p this last year is this going to matter in a decade
is this going to matter in fifty or one hundred years
but the top story of this past year was the economy and i'm just betting that sooner or later this particular recession is going to be old news so what kind of stories might make a difference for the future
well let 's take someday little robots will go through our bloodstreams fixing things
that can crawl through the human body
as we heard yesterday there's over a billion people hungry
bill gates fortunately has bet a billion
the world 's going to be very different when and if china sets the agenda and they may they've overtaken the u s as the world 's biggest car market
we're finding all kinds of ways to push back the limits of what we know some recent discoveries there's an ant colony from argentina that has now spread to every continent but antarctica
there's a self directed robot scientist that's made a discovery soon science may no longer need us
my pick for the top long news story of this past year was this one water found on the moon
my point is this in the long run some news stories are more important than others
