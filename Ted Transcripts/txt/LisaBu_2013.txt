i was trained to become a gymnast for two years in hunan china in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s when i was in the first grade the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes all expenses paid
but my tiger mother said no my parents wanted me to become an engineer like them after surviving the cultural revolution they firmly believed there 's only one sure way to happiness a safe and well paid job it is not important if i like the job or not
but my dream was to become
a chinese opera singer that is me playing my imaginary piano
only my friends supported me but they were kids just as powerless as i was so at age fifteen
i knew i was too old to be trained
my dream would never come true
i was afraid that for the rest of my life
when confucian tradition requires obedience
books banned in china of course
the good earth is about chinese peasant life that 's just not convenient for propaganda got it the bible is interesting but strange
but the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany you shall honor your father and mother
and to restart my relationship with my parents
because this is what chinese students grew up with it had never occurred to me china doesn 't have to be at the center of the world
a map actually carries somebody 's view comparative reading actually is nothing new it 's a standard practice in the academic world there are even research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature
for the christ the temptations are economic political and spiritual
so if you know a foreign language it 's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages the way of chuang tzu thomas merton tao the watercourse way alan watts instead of lost in translation i found there is much to gain
for example it 's through translation that i realized happiness in chinese literally means fast joy
to connect with people of the past and the present i know i shall never feel lonely or powerless again
its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from where passion comes from where happiness comes from even a shattered dream can do that for you
so because of books i 'm here today
