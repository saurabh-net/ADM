then we get more personal with it have you ever had any diseases have you ever been divorced does your breath smell bad while you 're answering my interrogation right now what are you into who are you into what gender do you like to sleep with i get it
we are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves we start forming cliques as soon as we 're old enough to know what acceptance feels like
we bond together based on anything that we can music preference race gender the block that we grew up on
we seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices
sometimes though just the question what do you do can feel like somebody 's opening a tiny little box and asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it because
i was shielded from the pains of bigotry and the social restrictions of a religiously based upbringing
so when i was six i decided that i wanted to be a boy
i mean who knows right when you 're six maybe you can do that
i didn 't want anyone to know that i was a girl and they didn 't
i kept up the charade for eight years so
this is me when i was eleven i was playing a kid named walter in a movie called julian po i was a little street tough that followed christian slater around and badgered him see i was also a child actor which doubled up the layers of the performance of my identity because no one knew that i was actually a girl really playing a boy
at sleepovers i would have panic attacks trying to break it to girls that they didn 't want to kiss me without outing myself
if my family though had been the kind of people to believe in therapy they probably would have diagnosed me as something like gender dysmorphic and put me on hormones to stave off puberty but in my particular case i just woke up one day when i was fourteen and i decided that i wanted to be a girl again
they don 't exactly have to come out right no one is exactly shocked
but i wasn 't asked to define myself by my parents when i was fifteen and i called my father to tell him that i had fallen in love it was the last thing on either of our minds to discuss what the consequences were of the fact
three years later when i fell in love with
marriage equality debate was raising a lot of dust around this country and at the time getting married wasn 't really something i spent a lot of time thinking about but i was struck by the fact that america a country with such a tarnished civil rights record could be repeating its mistakes so blatantly and i remember watching the discussion on television and thinking how interesting it was that
the separation of church and state was essentially drawing geographical boundaries throughout this country between places where people believed in it and places where people
that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me
if this was a war with two disparate sides a tomboyish girl
who liked both boys and girls depending on the person
girls who had eyeshadow to match their scraped knees girls who liked girls and boys who all liked boys and girls who all hated being boxed in to anything
i loved these people and i admired their freedom but i watched as the world outside of our utopian bubble exploded into these raging debates where pundits started likening our love to bestiality on national television
and this powerful awareness rolled in over me that i was a minority
i wave no flags in my own life
but i was plagued by this question how could anyone vote to strip the rights of the vast variety of people that i knew
based on one element of their character how could they say that we as a group were not deserving of equal rights as somebody else were we even a group
and then it occurred to me
perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were casting into second class citizenship
obviously i couldn 't get twenty million people to the same dinner party so
i figured out a way where i could introduce them to each other photographically
without any artifice without any lighting or without any manipulation of any kind on my part
life magazine introduced generations of people to distant far off cultures they never knew existed through pictures
so i decided to make mugshots if you will
and i basically decided to photograph anyone in this country that was not one hundred percent straight
which if you don 't know is a limitless
this was a very large undertaking and to do it we needed some help so i ran out in the freezing cold and i photographed every single person that i knew that i could get to in february of about two years ago and i took those photographs and i went to the hrc and i asked them for some help
and they funded two weeks of shooting in new york and then we made this
my goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us through the simplicity of a face
the united states what does equality mean to you marriage freedom civil rights treat every person as you 'd treat yourself it 's when you don 't have to think about it simple as that the fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage today in twenty nine states more than half of this country you can legally be fired just for your sexuality
heard hundreds of people give the same answer
after that almost eighty five thousand people watched that video and then they started emailing us from all over the country asking us to come to their towns and help them to show their faces
and a lot more people wanted to show their faces than i had anticipated so i changed my immediate goal to ten thousand faces that video was made in the spring of two thousand and eleven and as of today i have traveled
i know that this is a talk so
after traveling and talking to people in places like oklahoma or small town texas we found evidence that the initial premise was dead on visibility really is key familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy
of course in my travels i met people who legally divorced their children for being other than straight but i also met people who were southern baptists who switched churches because their child was a lesbian sparking empathy
had become the backbone of self evident truths but
self evident truths doesn 't erase the differences between us in fact on the contrary
it highlights them it presents not just the complexities found in a procession of different human beings but the complexities found within each individual person
it wasn 't that we had too many boxes it was that we had too few at some point
i realized that my mission to photograph gays was inherently flawed because there were a million different shades of gay here i was trying to help
once they got over the shock though by and large people opted for somewhere between seventy to ninety five percent or the three to twenty percent marks
that most people fall on a spectrum of what i have come to refer to as grey
let me be clear though
and this is very important in no way am i saying that preference doesn 't exist
what i am saying though is that human beings are not one dimensional
the most important thing to take from the percentage system is this if you have gay people over here
and you have straight people over here and while we recognize that most people identify as somewhere closer to one binary or another there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between
and the reality that this presents is a complicated one because for example if you pass a law that allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior where exactly do you draw the line
is it over here by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far
where exactly does one become a second class citizen
another interesting thing that i learned
after traveling so much and meeting so many people let me tell you there are just as many jerks and sweethearts and democrats and republicans and jocks and queens and every other polarization you can possibly think of within the lgbt community as there are within the human race
aside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs
and once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle just being other than straight doesn 't necessarily mean that we have anything in common so
in the endless proliferation of faces that self evident truths is always becoming
as it hopefully appears across more and more platforms bus shelters billboards facebook pages screen savers
hopefully these categories these binaries these over simplified boxes will begin to become useless
and they 'll begin to fall away
because really they describe nothing that we see and no one that we know
and seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity so
is it me particularly that you would choose to deny the right to housing
the right to adopt children the right to marriage the freedom to shop here live here buy here
it 's too late because i already am all of those things we already are all of those things and we always have
