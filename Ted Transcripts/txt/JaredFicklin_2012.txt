are music technology and making things
so let 's play a five hundred and fifty herz frequency and watch what happens
so every time we hit a resonant frequency we get a standing wave
and that emergent sine curve of fire so let 's turn that off
i also have with me a flame table it 's very similar to a rubens tube and it 's also used for visualizing the physical properties of sound such as eigenmodes so let 's fire it up and see what it does
while the table comes up to pressure let me note here that the sound is not traveling in perfect lines it 's actually traveling in all directions and the rubens tube 's a little like bisecting those waves with a line and the flame table 's a little like bisecting those waves with a plane
and it can show a little more subtle complexity which is why i like to use it to watch geoff farina play guitar
so it 's a delicate dance if you watch closely
actually a lot of things are better with fire in my world but the fire 's just a foundation
it shows very well that eyes can hear and this is interesting to me because technology allows us to present sound to the eyes in ways that accentuate the strength of the eyes for seeing sound such as the removal of time so here i 'm using a rendering algorithm to paint
and the technique will also show the strengths of the visual cortex for pattern recognition so if i show you another song off this album
and another your eyes will easily pick out
the use of repetition by the band nirvana and in the frequency distribution the colors you can see the clean dirty clean sound that they are famous for
and here is the entire album as a single visual impression and i think this impression is pretty powerful at least it 's powerful enough that if i show you these four songs and i remind you that this is smells like teen spirit
you can probably correctly guess without listening to any music at all that the song a die hard nirvana fan would enjoy is this song i 'll stick around by the foo fighters whose lead singer is dave grohl who was the drummer in nirvana
the songs are a little similar but mostly i 'm just interested in the idea that someday maybe we 'll buy a song because we like the way it looks
davis skate park in austin texas
and voices occupy very unique frequencies in the skate park so if we were to render these sounds visually we might end up
with something like this this is all forty minutes of the recording and right away the algorithm tells us a lot more tricks are missed than are made and also a trick on the rails is a lot more likely to produce a cheer and if you look really closely we can tease out traffic patterns you see the skaters often trick in this direction
the obstacles are easier and in the middle of the recording the mics pick this up but later in the recording this kid shows up
and he starts using a line at the top of the park to do some very advanced tricks on something called the tall rail and it 's fascinating at this moment in time all the rest of the skaters turn their lines ninety degrees to stay out of his way you see there 's a subtle etiquette in the skate park and it 's led by key influencers and they tend to be the kids
so i wrote a steering algorithm it listens to the lecture and then it uses the amplitude of each word to move a point on the x axis and it uses the inflection of sentences to move a same point up and down on the y axis
and these trend lines you can see there 's more questions than answers in the laws of physics and when we reach the end of a sentence we place a star at that location so there 's a lot of sentences so a lot of stars and after rendering all of the audio this is what we get this is stephen hawking 's universe
all eight hours of the cambridge lecture series taken in as a single visual impression and i really like this image but a lot of people think it 's fake so i made a more interactive version and the way i did that
i can walk right into the lecture i 'm going to wave through the kinect here and take control and now i 'm going to reach out
and i 'm going to touch a star and when i do it will play the sentence that generated that star
let me close with a work in progress i think after thirty years the opportunity exists to create an enhanced version of closed captioning now we 've all seen a lot of tedtalks online so let 's watch one now with the sound turned off and the closed captioning turned on
there 's no closed captioning for the ted theme song and we 're missing it but if you 've watched enough of these you hear it in your mind 's ear and then applause starts
let 's watch this clip again
this time i 'm not going to talk at all there 's still going to be no audio but what i am going to do is i 'm going to render the sound visually in real time at the bottom of the screen so watch closely and see what your eyes can hear
this is fairly amazing to me even on the first view your eyes will successfully pick out patterns
but on repeated views your brain actually gets better at turning these patterns into information you can get the tone and the timbre and the pace of the speech things that you can 't get out of closed captioning
that famous scene in horror movies where someone is walking up
from behind is something you can see and i believe this information would be something that is useful at times when the audio is turned off or not heard at all and i speculate that deaf audiences might actually even be better at seeing sound than hearing audiences i don 't know it 's a theory right now actually it 's all just an idea
