in china and india and the question i want to explore with you is whether or not democracy has helped
or has hindered economic growth
you may say this is not fair because i 'm selecting two countries to make a case against democracy
actually exactly the opposite is what i 'm going to do i 'm going to use these two countries to make an economic argument for democracy
rather than against democracy the first question there is why china has grown so much faster than india over the last thirty years
in terms of the gdp growth rates china has grown at twice the rate of india in the last five years the two countries have begun to converge somewhat in economic growth
but over the last thirty years china undoubtedly has done much better than india
one simple answer is china has shanghai and india has mumbai look at the skyline of shanghai this is the pudong area the picture on india is the dharavi slum of mumbai in india
behind these two pictures is that the chinese government
steeped in humanistic values and yet he agrees with the high pressure tactics of shanghai
so let me call it the shanghai model of economic growth
the implication of that model is that democracy is a hindrance for economic growth
rather than a facilitator of economic growth
if you believe that infrastructures are not as important as many people believe then you will put less emphasis on strong government
so to illustrate that question let me give you two countries and for the sake of brevity i 'll call one country country one and the other country country two country one
has a systematic advantage over country two in infrastructures
country one has more telephones and country one has a longer system of railways
so if i were to ask you which is china and which is india and which country has grown faster
if you believe in the infrastructure view then you will say country one must be china they must have done better in terms of economic growth and country two is possibly india
actually the country with more telephones is the soviet union and the data referred to one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine after the country reported very impressive statistics on telephones the country collapsed
since one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine the country has performed at a double digit rate every year for the last twenty years if you know nothing about china and the soviet union other than the fact about their telephones you would have made a poor prediction about their economic growth in the next two decades
country one that has a longer system of railways is actually india and country two is china this is a very
little known fact about the two countries yes today china has a huge infrastructure advantage over india
is the railways and the british built a lot of railways in india india is the smaller of the two countries and yet it had a longer system of railways until the late one thousand nine hundred and ninety s so clearly infrastructure doesn 't explain why china did better
before the late one thousand nine hundred and ninety s as compared with india
in fact if you look at the evidence worldwide
the evidence is more supportive of the view that the infrastructure are actually the result of economic growth
and this is clearly the story of the chinese economic growth
let me look at this question more directly is democracy bad for economic growth
country b with dollar seven hundred per capita gdp as compared with dollar six hundred and fifty per capita gdp both countries are in asia if i were to ask you which are the two asian countries
the country that has a long period of military rule and it 's very common that we compare india with china
that 's because the two countries have
about the same population size
but the more natural comparison is actually between india and pakistan those two countries are geographically similar they have a complicated but shared common history by that comparison democracy looks very very good in terms of economic growth
so why do economists fall in love with authoritarian governments
one reason is the east asian model
have you won the lottery
and they all tell you yes we have won the lottery
and then you draw the conclusion the odds of winning the lottery are one hundred percent
if you look at the statistical evidence worldwide there 's really no support for the idea that authoritarian governments hold a systematic edge over democracies in terms of economic growth
so the east asian model has this massive selection bias it is known as selecting on a dependent variable something we always tell our students to avoid
so exactly why did china
under indira gandhi the question there is which country did better
so that 's when china was mad
the advantage the country had was human
is especially sharp between chinese women and indian women
i haven 't told you about the definition of literacy in china the definition of literacy is the ability to read and write one thousand five hundred chinese characters
in india the definition of literacy operating definition of literacy is the ability the grand ability to write your own name in whatever language you happen to speak
the gap between the two countries in terms of literacy is much more substantial than the data here indicated
if you go to other sources of data such as human development index that data series go back to the early one thousand nine hundred and seventy s you see exactly the same contrast china held a huge advantage in terms of human capital vis a vis india
life expectancies as early as one thousand nine hundred and sixty five china had
a huge advantage in life expectancy on average as a chinese in one thousand nine hundred and sixty five you lived ten years more than an average indian so if you have a choice between being a chinese and being an indian you would want to become a chinese in order to live ten years longer
if you made that decision in one thousand nine hundred and sixty five the down side of that is the next year we have the cultural revolution so you have to always think carefully about these decisions
this is an extremely strange
the good news is by two thousand and six india has closed the gap
financial times printed this picture of an indian textile factory with the title india poised to overtake china in textile
then the issue is what about the chinese political system you talk about human capital you talk about education and public health what about the political system isn 't it true that the one party political system has facilitated economic growth in china
actually the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that
when you explain change for example economic growth economic growth is about change when you explain change you use other things that have changed to explain change rather than using the constant to explain change
in terms of the political changes they have introduced village elections they have increased the security of proprietors and they have increased the security with long term land leases there are also financial reforms in rural china
there is also a rural entrepreneurial revolution in china to me the pace of political changes is too slow too gradual
you can apply exactly the same dynamic perspective on india in fact
a little known fact about india in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety s is that the country not only has undertaken economic reforms the country has also undertaken political reforms by introducing village self privatization of media
and introducing freedom of information acts so the dynamic perspective fits both with china and in india in terms of the direction
why do many people believe that india is still a growth
comparing with a superstar is the wrong benchmark
in fact if you compare india with the average developing country
even before the more recent period of acceleration of indian growth now india is growing between eight and nine percent even before this period india was ranked fourth in terms of economic growth among emerging economies this is a very impressive record indeed
some of the excellent raw fundamentals mostly the social
the public health the sense of egalitarianism that you don 't find in india but i believe that india has the momentum
india has the right institutional conditions for economic growth whereas china is still struggling with political reforms
i believe that the political reforms are a must for china to maintain its growth
