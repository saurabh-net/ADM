i wanted to be a paleontologist a dinosaur paleontologist
and i wanted to have a pet dinosaur
i was very fortunate early in my career
i was fortunate in finding things i wasn 't very good at reading things in fact i don 't read much of anything
i am extremely dyslexic and so
reading is the hardest thing i do
i have been fortunate enough to find things like
the first eggs in the western hemisphere and
the first baby dinosaurs in nests
the first dinosaur embryos and massive accumulations of bones
people were just starting to begin to realize that dinosaurs weren 't the big
stupid green reptiles that people had thought for so many years people were starting to get an idea that dinosaurs were special
and so at that time i was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues we were able to actually say that dinosaurs based on the evidence we had that dinosaurs
and cared for their young brought food to their babies
and traveled in gigantic herds
i have gone on to find more things and discover that dinosaurs really were very social we have found
a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults the appearance of them would have been different
which it is in all social animals in social groups of animals the juveniles always look different than the adults
the adults can recognize the juveniles the juveniles can recognize the adults
michael crichton and in his book he talked about the social animals and then steven spielberg of course depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures
the theme of this story is building a dinosaur and so
we come to that part of jurassic park michael crichton really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life
you all know the story right i mean i assume everyone here has seen jurassic park if you want to make a dinosaur you go out you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap otherwise known as amber
otherwise known as amber sucked dinosaur dna out
and you take your dna back to the laboratory and you clone it and i guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg or something like that and then
you wait and lo and behold out pops the dinosaurs being social
act out their socialness and they get together and they conspire
and of course that 's what makes steven spielberg 's movie conspiring dinosaurs
chasing people around so i assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it and you
drilled into it and you
got something out of that insect and you cloned it and you did it over and over and over again
you 'd have a room full of mosquitos
now if you want dinosaur dna i say go to the dinosaur
to attempt to extract dna from a dinosaur and we chose the dinosaur on the left a tyrannosaurus rex which was a very nice specimen and one of my former doctoral students dr mary schweitzer
actually had the background to do this sort of thing and so
she looked into the bone of this t rex one of the thigh bones
and she actually found some very interesting structures in there
they found these red circular looking objects
and they looked for all the world like red blood cells and they 're in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone and so she thought well what the heck
find some dinosaurs that had more material in them
and out in eastern montana
you can go out there and find a lot of stuff and we did find a lot of stuff we found a lot of tyrannosaurs but we found one special tyrannosaur and we called it b rex
and b rex was found under a thousand cubic yards of rock
it wasn 't a very complete t rex and it wasn 't a very big t rex
but it was a very special b rex
and i and my colleagues cut into it and we were able to determine by looking at lines of arrested growth some lines in it that b rex had died at the age of sixteen
we don 't really know how long dinosaurs lived because we haven 't found the oldest one yet
but this one died at the age of sixteen
we gave samples to mary schweitzer and she was actually able to determine that b rex was a female
based on medullary tissue found on the inside of the bone medullary tissue is the calcium build up
the calcium storage basically when an animal is pregnant when a bird is pregnant
so here was the character that linked birds and dinosaurs
but mary went further she took the bone and she dumped it into acid
and so if you dump it into acid there shouldn 't be anything left
but there was something left
there were blood vessels left
there were flexible clear blood vessels
and so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur
but she did find evidence of proteins
but we thought maybe well
and so we built a laboratory in the back of an eighteen wheeler trailer
where we could get better samples and we did we got the vessels looked better
found the protein collagen i mean it was wonderful stuff
but it 's not dinosaur dna birds are living dinosaurs
birds are living dinosaurs we actually classify them
as dinosaurs we now call them non avian dinosaurs and avian dinosaurs
so the non avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct
avian dinosaurs are our modern birds
so we don 't have to make a dinosaur because we already have
the sixth graders look at it and they say
the chicken is a dinosaur
we actually have some evolutionary tools
and we know selection works we started out with a wolf like creature and we ended up with a maltese
or any of the other funny looking little dogs
but there 's another thing there 's what we call atavism activation and atavism activation is and it 's because
it 's an ancestral characteristic
and so there are a number of atavisms that can happen
snakes are occasionally born with legs
and here 's an example this is a chicken
now that 's a good characteristic we can save that one we know we can use that
we can make a chicken with teeth
if you can find those i can just reverse them
and so he agreed and so
that 's what we 're looking into if you look at dinosaur hands a velociraptor has that cool looking hand with the claws on it archaeopteryx which is a bird a primitive bird still has that very primitive hand but as you can see the pigeon or a chicken or anything else another bird
has kind of a weird looking hand because the hand actually
but a gene turns on that actually fuses those together
and the same goes for the tails birds have basically
birds have basically rudimentary tails
but a gene turns on and resorbs the tail
but it 's just the very basics
so that really is what we 're doing and people always say why do that why make this thing what good is
well that 's a good question
actually i think it 's a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things and colonel sanders was to
be careful how he worded it he could actually advertise an extra piece
it will be obviously the poster child or what you might call a poster chick
for technology entertainment and design i had two dreams
