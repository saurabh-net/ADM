i'd like to start off with is an observation which is that if i've learned anything over the last year it's that the supreme irony of publishing a book about slowness is that you have to go around promoting it really fast
i seem to spend most of my time these days you know zipping from city to city studio to studio interview to interview serving up the book in really tiny bite size chunks
because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down but they want to know how to slow down really quickly so so i did a spot on cnn the other day where i actually spent more time in makeup than i did talking on air
and i think that that's not really surprising though is it because that's kind of the world that we we live in now a world stuck in fast forward
a world obsessed with speed with doing everything faster with cramming more and more into less and less time every moment of the day feels like
a race against the clock to borrow a phrase from carrie fisher which is is in my bio there i'll just toss it out again these days even instant gratification takes too long and
if you think about how we to try to make things better what do we do no we speed them up don't we so we used to dial now we speed dial we used to read now we speed read we used to walk now we speed walk and of course we used to date and now we speed date
you know salute the sun but only want to give over about twenty minutes to it i mean these are sort of the extreme examples and they're amusing and
of the damage that this roadrunner form of living does to us we're so marinated in the culture of speed
that we almost fail to notice the toll it takes on every aspect of our lives on our health our diet our work our relationships the environment and our community and sometimes it takes
a a wake up call doesn't it to to alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lives instead of actually living them that we're living the fast life instead of the good life and i think for many people that wake up call takes the form of an illness you
a burn out or eventually the body says i can't take it anymore and throws in the towel or maybe a relationship goes up in smoke because we haven't had the time or the patience or the tranquility to be with the other person to listen to them
my wake up call came when i started reading bedtime stories to my son and i found that at the end of day i would go into his room and i just couldn't slow down you know i'd be speed reading the cat
so we would quarrel and what should have been the most relaxing the most intimate the most tender moment of the day when a dad sits down to read to
became instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills a clash between his speed and my or my speed and his slowness
and this went on for some time until i caught myself scanning a newspaper article with time saving tips for fast people and one of them made reference to a series of books called the one minute bedtime story
and i i wince saying those words now but my first reaction at the time was very different my first reflex was to say hallelujah what a great idea this is exactly what i'm looking for to speed up bedtime even more but thankfully
a light bulb went on over my head and my next reaction was very different and i took a step back and i thought whoa you know has it really come to this am i really in such a hurry that i'm prepared to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day
the first was how did we get so fast and the second is is it possible or even desirable to slow down
now if you think about how our world got so accelerated the usual suspects rear their heads you think of you know urbanization consumerism the workplace technology but i think if you cut through
those forces you get to what might be the deeper driver the nub of the question which is how we think about time itself in other cultures time is cyclical it's seen as moving in great
unhurried circles it's always renewing and refreshing itself whereas in the west time is linear it's a finite resource it's always
draining away you either use it or lose it time is money as benjamin franklin said and i think what that that does to us psychologically
moment of every day into a race to the finish line a finish line incidentally that we never reach but a finish line nonetheless
tells us that faster is always better and that busier is best right across the world people are doing the unthinkable they're slowing down and finding that although conventional wisdom tells you that if you slow down you're roadkill
the opposite turns out to be true that by slowing down at the right moments people find that they do everything better they eat better they make love better they exercise better they work better they live better and in this kind of
cauldron of moments and places and acts of deceleration lie what a lot of people now refer to as the international slow movement now if you'll permit me a small act of hypocrisy
a very quick overview of what what's going on inside the slow movement if you think of food many of you will have heard of the slow food movement
and more health from our food when we cultivate cook and consume it at a reasonable pace i think also the explosion of
organic farming movement and the renaissance farmers markets is another are other illustrations of the fact that people are desperate to get away from
eating and cooking and cultivating their food on an industrial timetable they want to get back to slower rhythms and out of the slow food movement has grown something called the slow cities movement
which has started in italy but has spread right across europe and beyond and in this towns begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape so that people are encouraged to to slow down and smell the roses and connect with one another so they might
becomes officially a slow city it's kind of like a philosophical declaration it's saying to the rest of world and to the people in that town that we believe that in the twenty one st century slowness has a role to play
in medicine i think a lot of people are deeply disillusioned with the kind of quick fix mentality you find in conventional medicine and millions of them around the world are turning to to complementary and alternative forms of medicine
which tend to tap into sort of slower gentler more holistic forms of healing now obviously the jury is out on many of these complementary therapies and i personally doubt that the coffee enema will ever you know gain mainstream approval
other treatments such as acupuncture and massage and even just relaxation clearly have some kind of benefit and blue chip medical colleges everywhere
and i saw a magazine a men 's magazine and it said on the front how to bring your partner to orgasm in thirty seconds so you know even sex is on a stopwatch these days
now you know i like a quickie as much as the next person but i think that there's an awful lot to be gained from slow sex from slowing down in the bedroom you
you tap into that those deeper sort of you know psychological emotional spiritual currents and you get a better orgasm
with the buildup you can get more bang for your buck let 's say i mean the pointer sisters said it most eloquently didn't they when they sang the praises of a lover with a slow hand
now we all laughed at sting a few years ago when he went tantric but you fast forward a few years and now you find couples of all ages flocking to workshops or maybe just on their own in their own bedrooms finding ways
to put on the brakes and have better sex and of course in italy where i mean italians always seem to know where to find their pleasure they've launched an official slow sex movement the workplace
right across much of the world north america being a notable exception working hours have been coming down and europe is an example of that and people finding that their quality of life improves as they're working less and also that their
hourly productivity goes up now clearly there are problems with the thirty five hour work week in france too much too soon too rigid but other countries
in europe notably the nordic countries are showing that it's possible to have a kick ass economy without being a workaholic
and norway sweden denmark and finland now rank among the top six most competitive nations on earth and they work the kind of hours that would make the average american weep with envy
and if you go beyond sort of the country level down at the micro company level more and more companies now are realizing that they need to allow their staff either to work fewer hours or just
to take a lunch break or to go sit in a quiet room to switch off their blackberrys you at the back
mobile phones during the work day or on the weekend so that they have time to recharge and to for the brain to slide into that kind of creative mode of thought
it's not just though these days adults who overwork though is it it's children too i'm thirty seven and my childhood ended in the mid eighties and i look at kids now and i'm just amazed by the way they
race around with more homework more tutoring more extracurriculars than we would ever have conceived of a generation ago
and some of the most heartrending emails that i get on my website are actually from adolescents hovering on the edge of burnout pleading with me
to their parents to help them slow down to help them get off this full throttle treadmill
less can be more so there was a case up in scotland recently where a fee paying high achieving private school banned homework for everyone under the age of thirteen
and the high achieving parents freaked out and said what are you you know our kids will fall the headmaster said no no your children need to slow down at the end of the day and just this last month
the elite universities who are often cited as the reason that people drive their kids and hothouse them so much are starting to notice the caliber of students coming to them is falling these kids have wonderful marks
and so what these ivy league schools and oxford and cambridge and so on are starting to send a message to parents and students that they need to put on the brakes a little bit and in harvard for instance they send out a letter to undergraduates freshmen
telling them that they'll get more out of life and more out of harvard if they put on the brakes if they do less but give time to things the time that things need to enjoy them to savor them and even if they sometimes do nothing at all and that letter
is called very revealing i think slow down with an exclamation mark on the end so wherever you look the message it seems to me is the same that less is very often more that slower is very often
better but that said of course it's not that easy to slow down is it i mean you heard that i got a speeding ticket while i was researching my book on the benefits of slowness and that's true but that's not all of it i was actually en route to a dinner held by slow food at the time
and if that's not shaming enough i got that ticket in italy and if any of you have ever driven on an italian highway you'll have a pretty good idea of how fast i was going
but why is it so hard to slow down i think there are various reasons one is that that speed is fun you know speed is sexy it's all that adrenaline rush it's hard to give it up
i think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger deeper questions we fill our head with distraction with
so that we don't have to ask am i well am i happy are my children growing up right are politicians making good decisions on my
with being stupid i guess what the slow movement the purpose of the slow movement or its main goal really is to tackle that taboo and to say that that yes
but the new idea the sort of revolutionary idea of the slow movement is that there is such a thing as good slow too and good slow is you know taking the time to eat a meal with your family with the tv switched off
and savor your life now one of the things that i found most uplifting about all of this stuff that's happened around the book since it came out is the reaction to it
and i knew that when my book on slowness came out it would be welcomed by the new age brigade but it's also been taken up with great gusto by the corporate world
business press but also you know big companies and leadership organizations because people at the top of the chain people like you i think are starting to realize that there's too much
another encouraging sign i think is that it's not just in the developed world that this idea 's been taken up in the developing world in countries that are on the verge of making that leap into first world status china brazil thailand poland and so on these countries are
have embraced the idea of the slow movement many people in them and there's a debate going on in their media on the streets because i think they're looking at the west and
we like that aspect of what you've got but we're not so sure about that so all of that said is it i guess
is it possible that's really the main question before us today is it possible to slow down and i i'm happy to be able to say to you that the answer is a resounding
yes and i present myself as exhibit a a kind of reformed and rehabilitated speed aholic
i still love speed you know i live in london and i work as a journalist and i enjoy the buzz and the busy ness and the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things i play
and what that means is that i don't i no longer overload myself gratuitously my default mode is no longer to be a rush aholic
i no longer hear time 's winged chariot drawing near or at least not as much as i did before i can actually hear it now because i see my time is ticking off and the
of all of that is that i actually feel a lot happier healthier more productive than i ever have i feel like i'm i'm living my life rather than actually just racing
through it and perhaps the most important measure of the success of this is that i feel that my relationships are a lot deeper richer
stronger and for me the i guess the litmus test for whether this would work and what it would mean was always going to be bedtime stories because that's sort of where the
the journey began and there too the news is rosy i you know at the end of the day i go into my son 's room i don't wear a watch i switch off my computer so i can't hear the email pinging into the basket and i just
slow down to his pace and and we read and because children have their own tempo and internal clock they don't do quality time where you schedule ten minutes for them to open up to you
they need you to move at their rhythm i find that ten minutes into a story you know my son will suddenly say you know
used to be a kind of a box on my to do list something that i dreaded because it was so slow and i had to get through it quickly it's become
my reward at the end of the day something i really i really cherish and i have a kind of hollywood ending to my talk this afternoon which goes a little bit like this
a few months ago i was getting ready to go on another book tour and i had my bags packed i was downstairs by the front door
character tintin on the front and he said to me or he handed this to me and and i read it and it said to daddy love benjamin and i thought aah that's really sweet you know is
a good luck on the book tour card and he said no no no daddy this is a card for being the best story reader in the world and i thought yeah you know this slowing down thing thank you very much
