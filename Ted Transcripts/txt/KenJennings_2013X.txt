two weeks time that 's the ninth anniversary of the day i first stepped out onto that hallowed jeopardy set i mean nine years is a long time and given jeopardy 's average demographics i think what that means is most of the people who saw me on that show are now dead
if nothing else you realize very quickly as a teenager it is not a hit with girls to know captain kirk 's middle name
the deeply closeted kind of know it all for many years but if you go further back if you look at it it 's all there i was the kind of kid who was always bugging mom and dad with whatever great fact i had just read about
haley 's comet or giant squids or the size of the world 's biggest pumpkin pie or whatever it was i now have a ten year old of my own who 's exactly the same and i know how deeply annoying it is so karma does work
going to miss hollywood squares and
and we lived overseas we lived in south korea where my dad was working where there was only one english language tv channel there was armed forces tv and if you didn 't speak korean that 's what you were watching so me and all my friends would run home every day and watch jeopardy i was always
there 's a weird sense of mastery you get when you know some bit of boomer trivia that mom and dad don 't know you know some beatles factoid that dad didn 't know and you think ah hah knowledge really is power the
that thought you could major in trivia or be a professional ex game show contestant and so i sold out way too young i didn 't try to figure out what one does with that i studied computers because i heard that was the thing and i became a computer programmer not an especially
good one not an especially happy one at the time when i was first on jeopardy in two thousand and four but that 's what i was doing and it made it doubly ironic
my computer background a few years later i think two thousand and nine or so when i got another phone call from jeopardy saying it 's early days yet but ibm tells us they want to build a supercomputer
read a jeopardy clue in a natural language like english and understand all the double meanings the puns the red herrings unpack
a three or four year old human little kid could do very hard for a computer
performance on jeopardy tens of thousands of dots representing jeopardy champions up at the top with their performance plotted on number of
but then you see the line start to go up and it 's getting very close to what they call the winner 's cloud
it 's not the terminator 's gun sight it 's a little line coming closer and closer to the
thing you can do the only thing that makes you special the thing you 're best at
and when the game eventually happened about
like you 're going to play the chicago bulls and there 's the thing in the middle of their court and the crowd was full of ibm v p s and programmers cheering on their little darling having poured millions of dollars into this hoping against hope that the humans screw up and holding up go watson signs
handily and i remember standing there behind the podium as i could hear that little insectoid thumb clicking it had a robot thumb that was clicking on the buzzer and you could hear that little
i felt like a detroit factory worker of the eighty s seeing a robot that could now do his job on the assembly line i felt like
quiz show contestant was now the first job that had become obsolete under this new regime of thinking computers and it hasn 't been the last if you watch the news you 'll see occasionally and i see this all the time that
pharmacists now there 's a machine that can fill prescriptions automatically without actually needing a human pharmacist and a lot of law firms are getting rid of paralegals because there 's software that can sum up case laws and legal briefs and decisions you don 't need human assistants for that
do as clever or creative a job as the humans they 're replacing but they 're faster and crucially they 're much much cheaper so
i 've heard other people say quite the opposite that this is yet another tier of the middle class that 's having the thing they can do taken away from them by a new technology and that this is actually something ominous something that we should worry about i 'm not an economist myself all i know
here 's the one thing that i was ever good at and all it took was ibm pouring tens of millions of dollars and its smartest people and thousands of processors working in parallel and they could do the same thing they could do it a little bit faster and a little better on national tv and i 'm sorry ken we don 't need you anymore and it made me think
what does this mean if we 're going to be able to start outsourcing
not just lower unimportant brain functions i 'm sure many of you remember a distant time when we had to know phone numbers when we knew our friends phone numbers and suddenly there was a machine that did that and now we don 't need to remember that anymore i have read that there 's now actually evidence that the hippocampus the part of our brain that handles spacial relationships
physically shrinks and atrophies in people who use tools like gps because we 're not exercising our sense of direction anymore we 're just obeying a little talking voice on our dashboard and as a result a part of our brain that 's supposed to do that kind of stuff gets smaller and dumber
and it made me think what happens when computers are now better at knowing and remembering stuff than we are is all of our brain going to start to shrink and atrophy like that are we as a culture going to start
they say that the scope of human information is now doubling every eighteen months or so the sum total of human information that means between now and
this is terrifying because a lot of the big decisions we make require the mastery of lots of different kinds of facts a decision like
where do i go to school what should i major in who do i vote for do i take this job or that one these are the decisions that require correct judgments about many different kinds of facts if we have those facts at our mental fingertips we 're going to be able to make informed decisions if on the other hand we need to look them all up
if you can 't do that first step are you really going to look up the other thousand facts you 're going to need to know to master your knowledge of u s foreign policy quite probably not at some point you 're just going to be like you know what there 's too much to know screw it and you 'll make a less informed decision
the other issue is the advantage of time that you have if you have all these things at your fingertips i always think of the story of a little girl named tilly smith she was a ten year old girl from surrey england on vacation with her parents a few years ago in phuket thailand she runs up to them on the beach one morning and says mom dad we 've got to get off the beach
and they say what do you mean we just got here and she said in mr kearney 's geography class last month he told us that when the tide goes out abruptly out to sea and you see the waves churning way out there that 's the sign of a tsunami and you need to clear the beach
and they finally to their credit decided to believe her they told the lifeguard they went back to the hotel and the lifeguard cleared over one hundred people off the beach luckily because that was the day of the boxing day tsunami the day after christmas two thousand and four that killed thousands of people in southeast asia and around the indian ocean
but not on that beach not on mai khao beach because this little girl had remembered one fact from her geography teacher a month before
now when facts come in handy like that i love that story because it shows you the power of one fact one remembered fact in exactly the right place at the right time
meeting or job interview or first date or some relationship that gets lubricated because two people realize they share some common piece
my life by any kind of creed it 's probably that
where knowledge is obsolete i don 't want to live in a world where cultural literacy has been replaced by these little bubbles of specialty so that none of us know about the common associations that used to bind our civilization
together i don 't want to be the last trivia know it all sitting on a mountain somewhere reciting to himself the state capitals and the names of simpsons episodes and the lyrics of abba songs i
those movies are never about beautiful utopias it 's always a terminator or a matrix or an astronaut getting sucked out an airlock
and i feel like we 're sort of at the point now where we need to make that choice of what kind of future we want to be living in this is a question of leadership because it becomes a question of who leads the future on the one hand we can choose between
a new golden age where information is more universally available than it 's ever been in human history where we all have the answers to our questions at our fingertips
and on the other hand we have the potential to be living in some gloomy dystopia where the machines have taken over and we 've all decided it 's not important what we know anymore that knowledge isn 't valuable because it 's all out there in the cloud and why would we ever bother learning anything new
those are the two choices we have i know which future i would rather be living in and we can all make that choice we make that choice by being curious inquisitive people who like to learn who don 't just say well as soon as the bell has rung and the class is over i don 't have to learn anymore or
thank goodness i have my diploma i 'm done learning for a lifetime i don 't have to learn new things anymore no every day we should be striving
to learn something new we should have this unquenchable curiosity for the world around us that 's where the people you see on jeopardy come from these know it alls they 're not
we can live in one of these two worlds we can live in a world where our brains the things that we know continue to be the thing that makes us special or a world in which we 've outsourced all of that to evil supercomputers from the future like watson ladies and gentlemen the choice is yours thank you very much
