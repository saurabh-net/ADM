that there are new hidden tensions that are actually happening between people and institutions
that are the institutions that people inhabit in their daily life schools hospitals workplaces factories offices etc
and something that i see happening is something that i would like to call a sort of democratization of intimacy
and what do i mean by that i mean that what people are doing is in fact they are sort of with their communication channels they are breaking an imposed isolation
that these institutions are imposing on them how are they doing this they're doing it in a very simple way by calling their mom from work by iming from their office to their friends by texting under the
the pictures that you're seeing behind me are people that i visited in the last few months and i asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most
and somebody brought a boyfriend somebody a father one young woman brought her grandfather for twenty years i've been looking at how people use channels such as email
the mobile phone texting etc what we're actually going to see is that fundamentally people are communicating on a regular basis with five six seven of their most intimate sphere now lets take some data
an average user said cameron marlow from facebook has about one hundred and twenty friends but he actually talks to has two way exchanges with about four to six people on a regular base depending on his gender
academic research on instant messaging also shows one hundred people on buddy lists but
my own research on cellphones and voice calls show that eighty percent of the calls are actually made to four people eighty percent and when you go to skype it's down to two people
closure it's a cocooning that we're disengaging from the public and i would actually i would like to show you that if we actually look at who is doing it and from where they're doing it actually there is an incredible social transformation
he just wants to wish her a good day because that's the start of her day and i've heard this story a number of times a young factory worker who works night shifts
who manages to sneak away from the factory floor where there is cctv by the way and find a corner where at eleven o'clock at night he can call his girlfriend
or a mother who at four o 'clock suddenly manages to find a corner in the toilet to check that her children are safely home then there is another
a brazilian couple they've lived in italy for a number of years they skype with their families a few times a week but once a fortnight
actually put the computer on their dining table pull out the webcam and actually have dinner with their family in sao paulo and they have a big event of it
and i heard this story the first time a couple of years ago from a very modest family of immigrants from kosovo in switzerland they had set up a big
screen in their living room and every morning they had breakfast with their grandmother but danny miller who is a very good anthropologist who is working on filipina migrant
their children back in the philippines was telling me about how much parenting is going on through skype and how much
these mothers are engaged with their children through skype and then there is the third couple they are two friends they chat to each other every day
a few times a day actually and finally finally they've managed to put instant messaging on their computers at work and now obviously they have it open whenever they have a moment they chat to
each other and this is exactly what we've been seeing with teenagers and kids doing it in school under the table and texting under the table to their friends
so none of these cases are unique i mean i could tell you hundreds of them but what is really exceptional is the setting so think of the three settings i've talked to you about factory migration
office but it could be in a school it could be an administration it could be a hospital three settings that if we just step back fifteen years if you just think back fifteen years
when you clocked in when you clocked in to an office when you clocked in to a factory there was no contact for the whole duration of the time there was no contact with your private sphere if you were
there was a public phone hanging in the corridor or somewhere if you were in management oh that was a different story maybe you had a direct line
if you were not maybe you had to go through an operator but basically when you walked into those buildings the private sphere was left behind you
and this has become such a norm of our professional lives such a norm and such an expectation and it had nothing to do with technical
and this has become such a cultural norm that we actually school our children for them to be capable to do this cleavage
if you think nursery kindergarten first years of school are just dedicated to take away the children to make them used to staying long hours away from their family
and then the school enacts perfectly well mimics perfectly all the rituals that we will start in offices rituals of entry rituals of exit the
in this country things that identify you team building activities team building that will allow you to basically
random group of kids or a random group of people that you will have to be with for a number of time and of course the major thing
learn to pay attention to concentrate and focus your attention this only started about one hundred and fifty years ago it only started with the birth of modern bureaucracy and of industrial revolution when people basically
go somewhere else to work and carry out the work and when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach where there was a clear distinction between the private sphere and the public sphere
so until then basically people were living on top of their trades they were living on top of the land they were laboring they were living on top of the workshops where they were working
and if you think it's permeated our whole culture even our cities if you think of medieval cities medieval cities the boroughs all have the names of the guilds and professions that lived there
now we have sprawling residential suburbias that are well distinct from production areas and commercial areas
and actually over these one hundred and fifty years there has been a very clear class system that also has emerged so the lower the status of the job and of the person carrying out the more removed he would be from his personal sphere
good data on a regular basis on for instance in the states says that and i think that this number is conservative fifty percent of anybody with email
access at work is actually doing private email from his office i really think that the number is conservative
in my own research we saw that the peak for private email is actually eleven o'clock in the morning whatever the country seventy five percent of people admit doing private conversations from work on their mobile phones one hundred percent
are using text the point is that this reappropriation of the personal sphere is not terribly successful with all institutions i'm always surprised
but there are many institutions that are actually blocking this access and every day every single day i read news that makes me cringe like
behind issues of security and safety which have always been the arguments for social control in fact what is going on is that
these institutions are trying to decide who in fact has a right to self determine their attention to decide whether they should or not be isolated
and they are actually trying to block in a certain sense this movement of a greater possibility of
