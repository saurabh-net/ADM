by armed gangs using child slaves what the u n security council calls blood minerals then traveled into some components and ended up in a factory in shinjin in china
that factory over a dozen people have committed suicide already this year
one man died after working a thirty six
we all love chocolate we buy it for our kids eighty percent of the cocoa comes from cote d 'ivoire and ghana and it's harvested by children
we have a huge problem of child slaves children have been trafficked from other conflict zones to come and work on the coffee plantations
heparin blood thinner a pharmaceutical product starts out in artisanal workshops like this in china
the second biggest exporter of cotton on earth every year when it comes to the cotton harvest the government shuts down the schools puts the kids in buses
and all of those products probably end their lives in a dump like this one in manila these places these origins represent governance gaps
that's the politest description i have for them these are the dark pools where global supply chains begin the global supply chains which bring us our favorite brand name products
some these governance gaps are run by rogue states
some of them are not states anymore at all they're failed states some of them are just countries who believe that deregulation or no regulation is the best way to attract investment promote trade
now i didn't come here to depress you about the state of the global supply chain
we need a reality check we need to recognize just how
serious a deficit of rights we have this is an independent republic
probably a failed state it's definitely not a democratic state
and right now that independent republic of the supply chain is not being governed in a way that would satisfy us
that we can engage in ethical trade or ethical consumption
now that's not a new story
you've seen the documentaries of sweatshops making garments all over the world even in developed countries you want to see the classic sweatshop meet me at madison square garden i'll take you down the street and i'll show you a chinese
but take the example of heparin
you expect that the supply chain that gets it to the hospital probably squeaky clean
the problem is is that the active ingredient in there as i mentioned earlier comes from pigs
and when their factory in china which probably is pretty clean is getting all of the ingredients from backyard
some of the suppliers realized that they could substitute a product which mimicked heparin in
the answer is quite simple
the chinese define these facilities as chemical facilities not pharmaceutical facilities so
and the u s fda has a jurisdictional problem this is
five hundred of these facilities producing active ingredients in china
in fact about eighty percent of the active ingredients in medicines now come from offshore particularly china and india
and we don't have a governance system we don't have a regulatory system able to ensure that that production
we don't have a system to ensure that human rights basic dignity are ensured
so at a national level
and we work in about sixty different countries at a national level we've got a serious breakdown in the ability of governments to regulate
the real problem with the global supply chain is that it's supranational
so governments who are failing who are dropping the ball
at a national level have even less ability to get their arms around the problem at an international level and you can just look at the headlines take copenhagen last year
complete failure of governments to do the right thing in the face of an international challenge take the g twenty meeting a couple of weeks ago
stepped back from its commitments of just a few months ago
you can take any one of the major global
simple answer is they can 't they're national voters are local
voters are local they have parochial interests
they can't subordinate those interests to the greater global public good
so if we're going to ensure the delivery of the key public goods at an international level
in this case in the global supply chain
we have to come up with a different mechanism we need a different machine
fortunately we have some examples
in the nineteen nineties there were a whole series of scandals concerning the production of brand name goods in the u s child labor forced labor serious health and safety abuses
how to prevent that but i'm at least going to use my good offices to get you folks together to come up with a response
so they formed a white house task force and they spent about three years
arguing about who takes how much responsibility in the global supply chain companies didn't feel it was their responsibility
those facilities they don't employ those workers they're not legally liable
agreed okay what we'll do is we agree on a common set of standards
make it part of the contract and that was a stroke of absolute genius
because what they did was they harnessed the power of the contract private power to deliver public goods
and let 's face it the contract from a major multinational brand to a supplier in india or china has much more persuasive value than the local labor law the local environmental regulations the local human rights standards
those factories will probably never
be amazing if they were able to
even if they did their jobs and they cited those facilities for their violations
the fine would be derisory but you lose that contract for a major brand name that's the difference between staying in business or going bankrupt
makes a difference so what we've been able to do is we've been able to harness
the power and the influence of the only truly transnational institution in the global supply chain
that of the multinational company and get them to do the right thing
get them to use that power for good to deliver the key public goods
now of course this doesn't come naturally to multinational companies they weren't set up to do this they're set up to make money
but they are extremely efficient organizations
they have resources and if we can add the will the commitment they know how to deliver that product
now getting there is not easy those supply chains i put up on the screen earlier they're not
safe space you need a place where people can come together
sit down without fear of judgment without recrimination
to actually face the problem agree on the problem and come up with solutions we can do it the technical solutions are there the problem is the lack of trust the lack of confidence the lack of partnership
between ngo 's campaign groups
we can put those two together in a safe space
get them to work together we can deliver public goods right now or in extremely short supply
this is a radical proposition
and it's crazy to think that if you're fifteen year old bangladeshi girl
leaving your rural village to go and work in a factory in dhaka
crazy multinationals are protecting human rights
i know there's going to be disbelief you'll say how can we trust well we
and then we publish the results
you can call yourself responsible but responsibility without accountability often doesn't work
need to believe me you shouldn 't believe me go to the website look at the audit results ask yourself is this company behaving
in a socially responsible way can i buy that product without compromising my ethics that's the way the system works
i hate the idea that governments are not protecting human rights around the world
i hate the idea that governments have dropped this ball and i can't get used to the idea that somehow we can't get them to do their jobs
i've been at this for thirty years and in that time i've seen the ability the commitment the will of government to do this decline and i don't see them making a comeback right now
so we started out thinking this was a stopgap measure
companies and ngo 's are going to have to get together to face the major challenges we are going to face just look at pandemics swine flu bird flu h one n one
look at the health systems in so many countries do they have the resources to face up to a serious pandemic
could the private sector and ngo 's get together and marshal a response absolutely
what they lack is that safe space to come together agree and move to action
that's what we're trying to provide
as well that this often seems like overwhelming level of responsibility for people to
you want me to deliver human rights
it seems too daunting too dangerous for any company to take on
but there are companies we have four thousand companies who are members
some of them are very very large companies the sporting goods industry in particular stepped up to the plate and have done it
the example the role model
and whenever we discuss one of these problems that we have to address child labor in cottonseed farms in india this year we will monitor fifty thousand cottonseed farms in india
it seems overwhelming the numbers just make you
but we break it down to some basic realities and human rights comes down to a very simple proposition can i give this person their dignity back
poor people people whose human rights have been violated
the crux of that is the loss of dignity the lack of
it starts with just giving people back their dignity
i was sitting in a slum outside gurgaon just next to delhi one of the
flashiest brightest new cities popping up in india right now and i was talking to workers who worked in garment sweatshops down the road and i asked them what message they would like me to take the brands
they didn't say money they said the people who employ us treat us like we are less than human
please ask them to treat us like human beings
that's my simple understanding of human rights
in this room everybody out there we can all make a decision to come together and pick up the balls and run with the balls that governments have dropped if we don't do it
we're abandoning hope we're abandoning our essential humanity
