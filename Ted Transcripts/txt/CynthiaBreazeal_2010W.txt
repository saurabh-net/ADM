i 've been fascinated by this idea of personal robots
and as a little girl i loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us much more like a helpful trusted sidekick
something that would delight us so twenty years pass
and i remember thinking about all the reasons why that was the case but one really struck me
robotics had really been about interacting with things not with people
certainly not in a social way that would be natural for us and would really help people accept robots into our daily lives
for me that was the white space that 's what robots could not do yet
and so that year i started to build this robot kismet the world 's first social robot
this little robot was somehow able to tap into something deeply social within us and with that the promise of an entirely new way we could interact with robots
so over the past several years i 've been continuing to explore this interpersonal dimension of robots now at the media lab with my own team of incredibly talented students
and one of my favorite robots
can you find cookie monster
leo cookie monster is very bad
he 's very bad leo
cookie monster is very very bad
he 's a scary monster he wants to get your cookies
so what i 've learned through building these systems is that robots are actually a really intriguing social technology where it 's actually their ability to push our social buttons and to interact with us like a partner
that is a core part of their functionality and with that shift in thinking we can now start to imagine new questions new possibilities for robots that we might not have thought about otherwise
but what do i mean when i say push our social buttons well one of the things that we 've learned is that if we design these robots to communicate with us using the same body language the same sort of non verbal cues that people use like nexi our humanoid robot is doing here
what we find is that people respond to robots a lot like they respond to people
it 's turning out now that robots are actually becoming a really interesting new scientific tool to understand human behavior
mimicry 's believed to play a role
but with the robot you can and so in this video here
this is a video taken from david desteno 's lab at northeastern university he 's a psychologist we 've been collaborating with there 's actually a scientist carefully controlling nexi 's cues to be able to study this question
and the bottom line is the reason why this works is because it turns out people just behave like people even when interacting with a robot
so given that key insight we can now start to imagine new kinds of applications for robots
maybe the next best thing to really being there
did a study where we brought human participants people into our lab to do a collaborative task with a remote collaborator the task involved things like looking at a set of objects on the table discussing them in terms of their importance and relevance to performing a certain task this ended up being a survival task
and then rating them in terms of how valuable and important they thought they were
the next was to add mobility so have the screen on a mobile base this is like if you 're familiar with any of the telepresence robots today this is mirroring that situation
so after the interaction we asked people to rate their quality of interaction with the technology with a remote collaborator through this technology in a number of different ways
we looked at psychological involvement how much empathy did you feel for the other person we looked at overall engagement we looked at their desire to cooperate and this is what we see when they use just the screen it turns out when you add mobility the ability to roll around the table you get a little more of a boost
today we know that families are living further and further apart and that definitely takes a toll on family relationships and family bonds over distance
so i love the idea of thinking about robots as a new kind of distance play technology i imagine a time not too far from now
i could imagine grandmothers being able to do social plays with their granddaughters with their friends
so in the united states today over sixty five percent of people are either overweight or obese and now it 's a big problem with our children as well
and we know that as you get older in life if you 're obese when you 're younger that can lead to chronic diseases that not only reduce your quality of life but are a tremendous economic burden on our health care system
but if robots can be engaging if we like to cooperate with robots if robots are persuasive maybe a robot can help you maintain a diet and exercise program maybe they can help you manage your weight
to help you form healthy habits
so we actually explored this idea in our lab
this is a robot autom cory kidd developed this robot for his doctoral work and it was designed to be a robot diet and exercise coach
it had a couple of simple non verbal skills it could do it could make eye contact with you it could share information looking down at a screen you 'd use a screen interface to enter information like how many calories you ate that day how much exercise you got
and then it could help track that for you and the robot spoke with a synthetic voice to engage you in a coaching dialogue modeled after trainers and patients and so forth and it would build a working alliance with you through that dialogue it could help you set goals and track your progress and it would help motivate you so an interesting question is
one case was the robot you saw there autom
and the longer you could interact with one of these interventions well that 's indicative potentially of longer term success
so the first thing i want to look at is how long how long did people interact with these systems
it turns out that people interacted with the robot significantly more even though the quality of the advice was identical to the computer
when it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance people rated the robot higher
and they trusted the robot more
they would dress the robots
and even when we would come up to pick up the robots at the end of the study they would come out to the car and say good bye to the robots they didn 't do this with a computer the last thing i want to talk about today is the future of children 's media
we know that kids spend a lot of time behind screens today whether it 's television or computer games or whatnot my sons they love the screen they love the screen
but i want them to play as a mom i want them to play like real world play and so i have a new project in my group i wanted to present to you today called playtime computing that 's really trying to think about how we can take what 's so engaging about digital media and literally bring it off the screen into the real world of the child
first exploration of this idea where characters can be physical or virtual and where the digital content can literally come off the screen into the world and back
i like to think of this as the atari pong of this blended reality play
but we can push this idea further what if
what if turns out that kids
when it goes into the virtual world so they are now sending the character back into that world and now it 's got number power
and then finally what i 've been trying to do here is create a really immersive experience for kids where they really feel like they are part of that story a part of that experience and i really want to spark their imaginations the way mine was sparked as a little girl watching star wars
but i want to do more than that i actually want them to create those experiences i want them to be able to literally build their imagination into these experiences and make them their own so we 've been exploring a lot of ideas in telepresence and mixed reality to literally allow kids to project their ideas into this space where other kids
can interact with them and build upon them i really want to come up with new ways of children 's media that foster creativity and learning and innovation i think that 's very very important
but i can tell you the thing that they love the most is the robot
what they care about is the robot
robots touch something deeply human within us and so whether they 're helping us to become creative and innovative
