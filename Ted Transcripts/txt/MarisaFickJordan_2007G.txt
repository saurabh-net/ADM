rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials started to replace hard to come by
away from the ethnic a little bit more contemporary
so i developed a whole range around mass produced range that obviously fitted into a much higher end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market we started experimenting as you can see in terms of shapes forms the scale became very important
and it 's become our pet project it 's successful it 's been running for twelve years
and we supply the conran shops and donna karan and so it 's kind of great this is our group our main group of weavers they come on a weekly basis to durban they all have bank accounts they 've all moved back to the rural area where they came from it 's a weekly turnaround of production
and the rest says it all thank you very much
