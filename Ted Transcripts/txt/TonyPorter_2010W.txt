new york city between harlem and the bronx growing up as a boy we were taught that men had to be tough had to be strong had to be courageous dominating no
pain no emotions with the exception of
anger and definitely no fear that men are in charge which means women are not
and you should just follow and do what we say that men are superior women are inferior that men are strong women that women
men and objects particularly sexual objects
later come to know that to be the collective socialization of men the man box
being a man but at the same time
really need to begin to challenge look at it and really get in the process of deconstructing redefining what we come to know
when they were about five and six four and five jay could come to me come to me crying
it didn't matter what she was crying about she could get on my knee she could snot my sleeve up just cry cry it out daddy 's got you that's all that's important
kendall on the other hand and like i said he 's only fifteen months older than her
he came to me crying
by the time he got to me i was already saying things like why
tell me what's wrong i can't understand you why are you crying and out of my own frustration of my role and responsibility of building
wrong with me what am i doing why would i
my brother henry he died tragically when we were teenagers we lived in new york city as i said we lived in the bronx at the time
city and as we were preparing to come back from the
the cars stopped at the bathroom
my father and i stayed in
and no sooner than the women got out me
but he knew he wasn't going to make it back to the city and it was better me
than to allow himself to express these feelings and emotions in front of the women and this is a man who ten minutes ago had just put his teenage son
something i just can't even imagine the
that sticks with me the most is that he was apologizing to me in front of me
and at the same time he was also giving me props lifting me up
i come to also look at this as this fear that we
paralyzed holding us hostage to this man box
i can remember speaking to a twelve year old boy a football player
and i asked him i said how would you feel
all the players your coach told you you were playing like
say something like i'd be sad i'd be mad i'd be angry or something like
that no the boy said to me the boy said to me it would destroy me
and i said to myself
if it would destroy him to be called a girl
what are we then teaching him about girls
it took me back to a time when i was about twelve years old
in tenement buildings in the inner city at this time we're living in the bronx and in the building next to where i lived there was a
and he did spend a lot of time up to no good he was a troubled kid his mother had died from a heroin overdose he was being raised by his grandmother his father wasn't on the set his grandmother had two jobs home
home he was having sex
we all looked up to
so one day i'm out in front of the house doing something just playing around doing something i don't know what he looks out his window he calls me upstairs he said hey anthony they called my anthony growing up as a kid
johnny call you go so i run right
as he opens the door he says to me do you want some now i immediately knew what he meant because for me growing up at that time and our relationship with this man box do you or drugs
or drugs and we weren't doing
and we weren't doing in jeopardy
i never had sex we don't talk about that
as men you only tell your dearest closest friend sworn to secrecy for life the first time you had sex for everybody else we go around like we've been having sex especially sexual objects anyway
i couldn't tell him any of that so like my mother would say make a long story short i just simply said to johnny yes he told me to go in his room i go in his room
is a girl from the neighborhood named sheila she's sixteen years old she's
what i know today to be mentally ill higher functioning at times than others we had a whole choice 's worth of inappropriate names
just gotten through having sex with her well actually he raped her but he would say he had sex with her because while sheila never said
no she also never said yes so he was offering me the opportunity to do the same so when i go in the room i close the door folks i'm petrified
i stand with my back to the door so johnny can't bust in the room and see that i'm not doing anything and i stand there long enough that i could have actually done something so now i'm no longer trying to figure out what i'm going to do i'm trying to figure out how i'm going to get out of this room so in my twelve years
i zip my pants down i walk out into the room and lo and behold to me while i was in
room with sheila johnny was back at the window calling guys
so now there's a living room full of guys it was like the waiting room in the doctor 's office and they asked me how was
and i say to them it was good
and i zip my pants up in front of them and i
now i say this all with remorse and i was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time but i was conflicted because while i was feeling remorse i was excited because i didn't get caught but i knew i felt bad about what was happening
this fear getting outside the man box totally enveloped me it was way more important to me about me and my man box
than about sheila and what was happening to her
see collectively we as men are taught to have less value in women to view them as property and the objects of men we see that as an equation that equals violence against women
we as men good men the
we operate on the foundation of this whole collective socialization we kind of see ourselves separate but we're very much a part of it you see
we have to come to understand that less value property and objectification is the foundation and the violence can't happen without it so we're very much a part of the solution as well as the problem
the center for disease control says that men 's violence against women is at epidemic proportions is the number one health concern for women in this country and abroad
so quickly i'd like to just say
this is the love of my life my
the world i envision for her
how do i want men to be acting and behaving i need you on board i need you with me i need you working with me and me working with you on how we raise our
teach them to be men that it's okay to not be dominating that it's okay to have feelings and emotions
is tied to your liberation as a
