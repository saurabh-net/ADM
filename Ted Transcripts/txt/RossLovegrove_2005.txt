name is lovegrove i only know nine lovegroves two of which are my parents they are first cousins and you know what happens when you know
so there's a terribly weird freaky side to me which i'm fighting with all the time so to try and
get through today i've kind of disciplined myself with an eighteen minute talk i was hanging on to have a pee i thought perhaps if i was hanging on long enough that would guide me through the eighteen minutes i
known as captain organic and that's a philosophical position as well as an aesthetic position but today what i'd like to talk to you about is that love of form and how form can touch
not very long ago not many
thousands of years ago we actually lived in caves and i don't think we've lost that coding system we respond so well to form
but i'm interested in creating intelligent form i'm not interested at all in blobism or any of that superficial rubbish that you see coming out as design these
this artificially induced consumerism i think it's atrocious my world is the world of people like amory lovins
janine benyus james watson i'm in that world but i work purely instinctively i'm not a scientist i could have been perhaps but i work in this world where i trust my instincts so i am
twenty one st century translator of technology into products that we use every day
and relate beautifully and naturally with and we should be developing things we should be developing packaging for ideas
which elevate people 's perceptions and respect for the things that we dig out of the earth and translate into products for everyday use so
a drawing by leonardo da vinci five hundred years ago before photography it shows how observation curiosity
this is all created digitally here you see the machining the milling of a block of acrylic this is what i show to the client to say that 's what i want to do at that point i don't know if that's possible at all
it's a seductor but i just feel in my bones that that's possible
so we go we look at the tooling we look at how that is produced these are the invisible things that you never see in your life this is the background noise of industrial design
that is like an anish kapoor flowing through a richard serra it is more valuable than the product in my eyes i don't have one when i do make some money i'll have one machined for myself this is the final product when they
sent it to me i thought i'd failed it felt like nothing it has to feel like nothing it was when i put the water in that i realized that i'd put a skin on water itself it's an icon of water itself and it elevates people 's perception
of contemporary design each bottle is different meaning the water level will give you a different shape it's mass individualism from a single product
it fits the hand it fits arthritic hands it fits children 's hands it makes the product strong the tessellation it's a millefiori of ideas in the future
they will look like that because we need to move away from those type of polymers and use that for medical equipment and more important things perhaps in life biopolymers these new ideas for materials will come in to play in probably
this video in cape town last year
this is the freaky side coming out
this special interest in things like this which blow my mind i don't know whether to you know drop to my knees cry i don't know what i think
but i just know that nature improves with ever greater purpose that which once existed
and that strangeness is a consequence of innovative thinking when i look at these things
they look pretty normal to
but these things evolved over many years and now what we're trying to do i get three weeks to design a telephone how the hell do i do a telephone in three weeks when you get these things
that take hundreds of million years to evolve how do you condense
only nature really creates how that flows through me and how that comes out is what i'm trying to understand this is a scan through the human forearm it's then blown up through rapid
to reveal the cellular structure i have these in my office my office is a mixture of the natural history museum and a nasa space lab it's a weird kind of freaky place
this is one of my specimens this is made bone is made from a mixture of inorganic minerals and polymers i studied cooking in school
for four years and in that experience which was called domestic science it was a bit of a cheap trick for me to try and get a science qualification
actually i put marijuana in everything i cooked
and i had access to all the best girls it was fabulous all the guys in the rugby team couldn't understand but anyway this is a meringue this is another sample i have a meringue is made exactly the same way in my estimation as a bone
it's made from polysaccharides and proteins if you pour water on that it dissolves could we be manufacturing from food stuffs in the future
not a bad idea i don't know i need to talk to janine and a few other people about that but i believe instinctively that that meringue can become something
i'm also interested in growth patterns the unbridled way that nature grows things so you're not restricted by form
these interrelated forms they do inspire everything i do although i might end up making something incredibly simple
this is a detail of a chair that i've designed in magnesium it shows this interlocution of elements and the beauty of kind of engineering
it's the world 's first chair made in magnesium it cost one point seven million dollars to develop it's called go by bernhardt usa it went into time magazine
two thousand and one as the new language of the twenty one st century boy for somebody growing up in wales in a little village that's enough
it shows how you make one holistic form like the car industry and then you break up what you need this is an absolutely beautiful way of working it's a godly way of working
there is it's organic and it's essential it's an absolutely fat free design and when you look at it you see human
when that moves into polymers you can change the elasticity the fluidity of the form this is an idea for a gas injected one piece polymer chair
what nature does is it drills holes in things it liberates form it takes away anything extraneous
that's what i do i make organic things which are essential i don't and they look funky too but i don't set out to make funky things because i think that's an absolute disgrace i set out to look at natural forms if you took the idea of fractal technology further
take a membrane shrinking it down constantly like nature does that could be a seat for a chair it could be a sole for a sports shoe it could be a car blending into seats
when you see a henry moore still
amazing spiritual connect if he was a car designer phew we'd all be driving one in his day he was the highest taxpayer in britain
is the power of organic design it contributes immensely to
sense of being our sense of relationships with things our sensuality and you know the sort of even
which is very important this is my artwork this is all my process these actually are sold as artwork they're very big prints
data images i see new things i'm self it's self inspired diatomic structures radiolaria the things that we couldn't see but we can do now these again are cored out they're made virtually from nothing they're made from silica
why not structures from cars like that coral all these natural forces
take away what they don't need and they deliver maximum beauty
we need to be in that
i want to do stuff like that this is a new chair which should come on the market in september it's for a company called moroso in italy it's a gas injected polymer chair
those holes you see there are very filtered down watered down versions of the extremity of the diatomic structures it goes with the flow of the polymer and you'll see there's an image coming up right now that shows the full thing
it's great to have companies in italy who support this way of dreaming if you see the shadows that come through that they're actually probably more important than the
but it's the minimum it takes the coring out of the back lets you breathe it takes away any material you don't need and it actually garners flexure too so i was going to break into a dance
this is some current work i'm doing i'm looking at single surface structures and how they flow how they stretch and flow
it's based on furniture typologies but that's not the end motivation it's made from aluminum
and it's grown it's grown in my mind and then it's grown in terms of the whole process that i go through
this is two weeks ago in ccp in coventry who build parts for bentleys and so on it's being built as we speak and it will be on show in phillips next year in new york i have a big show with phillips auctioneers
when i see these animations oh jesus i'm blown away this is what goes on in my studio every day i walk i'm traveling i come back some guy 's got that on a computer there's this like oh my goodness
so i try to create this energy of invention every day in my studio this kind of effervescent fully charged
sense of soup that delivers ideas single surface products furniture 's a good one how you grow legs out of a surface
i would love to build this one day and perhaps i'd like to build it also out of flour sugar
human hair i don't know i'd love a go at that i don't know if i just got some time that's the weird side coming out again and a lot of companies don't understand that three weeks ago i was with sony in tokyo
they said give us the dream what is our dream how do we beat apple i said well you don't copy apple that's for sure i said you get into biopolymers they looked straight through me what a waste you know i mean
three hundred it's got a vacuum formed carbon nylon pan everything 's holistically integrated it opens and closes like a bread bin there is no engine
a solar panel on the back and there are batteries in the wheels they're fitted like formula one you take them off your wall you plug them in off you jolly well go a three wheeled car slow feminine
and there's a reason for that it's a city car you drive along you get out you drive on to a proboscis you get out
it lifts you up it presents the solar panel to the sun and at night it's a street lamp
what happens if you get inspired by the street lamp first and then do the car second these bubbles i can see these bubbles with these hydrogen packages floating around on the ground
driven by ai when i showed this in south africa everybody after was going yeah hey car on a stick like this can you
if you put it next to contemporary architecture it feels totally natural to me and that's what i do with my furniture i'm not putting charles eames furniture in buildings any more forget that we move on i'm trying to build furniture that fits architecture i'm trying to build
i'm going to finish on two things this is the steriolithography of a staircase it's a little bit of a dedication to james james watson
i built this thing for my studio it cost me two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to build this most people go and buy the aston martin
i built this this is the data that goes with that incredibly complex took about two years because i'm looking for fat free design
efficient things healthy products this is built by composites it's a single element which rotates round to create a holistic element and this is a carbon fiber handrail
which is only supported in two places modern materials allow us to do modern things this is a shot in the studio this is how it looks pretty much every day
you wouldn't want to have a fear of heights coming down it there is virtually no handrail it doesn't pass any standards
yeah and it has an internal handrail which gives it it's strength it's this holistic integration that's my studio it's subterranean it's in notting hill next
that you'll see in the video it's a homemade video made it myself at three o'clock in the morning just to show you
how my real world is you never see that
this is called a plasnet a
new chair i'm doing in italy
it's full of prototypes and objects
it's self inspirational again i mean the rare times when i'm there i do enjoy it
and i get lots of kids coming this
that's a solar seed it's a concept for new architecture that thing on the top is the world 's first solar powered garden lamp the first produced
on the wall is my book called supernatural which allows me to remember what i've done because i forget there's an aerated brick i did in limoges last year in concepts for new ceramics in architecture
at three o'clock in the morning and i don't pay overtime
is the passion of design so join the club
then i'm in beijing on friday you work that one out and when i see ed 's photographs i think why the hell am i going to china soul in this whole
so there's a new x light system i'm doing in japan
shoes from north africa there's a kifwebe mask these are my sculptures a copper jelly mold show
thank you james for your great inspiration
