a historian steve told us about the future of little technology i'm going to show you some of the past of big technology this was
a project to build a four thousand ton nuclear bomb propelled spaceship to go to saturn and jupiter this took place
if all goes well next year i'll be back and i'll have a lot more to show you and if all doesn't go well i'll be in jail like wen ho lee
the people that worked on it in the beginning was my father freeman there in the middle that's me and my sister esther who 's a frequent ted
but all this time i was out there doing these strange kayak voyages in odd beautiful parts of this planet i always thought in the back of my mind about project orion and
the people who worked on it were a lot of los alamos people who had done the hydrogen bomb work it was the first project funded by arpa that's the contract where arpa gave the first million dollars to get this thing started
some of the sizes of the ships ranging all the way up to ship mass of eight million tons so that was the outer extreme here was the version two two thousand bombs these are
five kiloton yield bombs about the size of small volkswagens it would take eight hundred to get into orbit here we see a ten thousand
going to mars all this was done by hand with slide rules the little orion ship and what it would take to do what orion does with chemicals you have a ship the size of the empire state building
nasa had no interest they tried to kill the project the people who supported it were the air force which meant that it was all secret that's why when you get something declassified that's what it looks like
secret stuff how to get directed energy explosions so you're sending the energy of a nuclear explosion not like just a stick of dynamite but you're directing it at the ship and this is still a very active subject
it's quite dangerous but i believe it's better to have dangerous things in the open than think you're going to keep them secret this is what happened at six hundred microseconds the air force
this is ed day putting so each of these coffee cans has three pounds of c four in it they're building a system that ejects these at quarter second intervals that's my dad in the sport coat there holding the briefcase
so they had a lot of fun doing this but no children were allowed my dad could tell me that he was building a spaceship and he was going to go to saturn but he could not say anything more about it so all my life i have wanted to find this stuff out and spent the last four years
system yield we're looking at a twenty kiloton yield for an effect for us of ten million newtons well here we have a little problem the radiation doses at the crew station seven hundred rads per shot
fission yields during development they were hoping to get clean bombs they didn 't eye burn this is what happens to the people in miami who are looking up
eight man version that would go to mars they liked it because the guys could kind of live there like living in a submarine this is crew compartment
it switches so what's upside down is right side up when you go to artificial gravity mode the scientists were still going to go along and they would take seven astronauts and seven scientists this is a twenty man version for going to jupiter
bunks storm cellars exercise room you know it was going to be a nice long trip the air force version here we have a military version
outside the vehicle and one part of nasa was interested but the headquarters in nasa they killed the project so to a halt results
none this project is hereby terminated so that's the end all i can say in closing is we heard yesterday that one of the ten bad things that can happen to us
what are we going to do and orion is really one of the only if not the only off the shelf technologies that could do something
so i'm going to tell you the good news and the bad news the good news is that nasa has a small secret contingency plan division that is looking at this trying to keep
