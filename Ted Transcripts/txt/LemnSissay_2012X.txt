eighteen years as a child of the state in children 's homes and foster care you could say that i 'm an expert on the subject
and in being an expert i want to let you know that being an expert does in no way make you right in light of the truth
if you 're in care
legally the government is your parent loco parentis margaret thatcher was my mother
superman was a foster child cinderella was a foster child lisbeth salander the girl with the dragon tattoo was fostered and institutionalized batman
was orphaned lyra belacqua from philip pullman 's northern lights was fostered jane eyre adopted roald dahl 's james from james and the giant peach matilda moses moses
or orphaned it seems that writers know that the child outside of family
reflects on what family truly is more than what it promotes itself to be that is they also use extraordinary skills to deal with extraordinary situations on a daily basis
how have we not made the connection and why have we not made the connection between how has that happened between these incredible characters of popular culture and religions
and the fostered adopted or orphaned child in our midst it 's not our pity
i know famous musicians i know actors and film stars and millionaires and novelists and top lawyers
television executives and magazine editors and national journalists and dustbinmen and hairdressers all who were looked after children fostered adopted or orphaned and many of them grow into their adult lives in
fear of speaking of their background as if it may somehow weaken their standing in the foreground as if it were somehow kryptonite as if it were a time bomb strapped on the inside children in care
who 've had a life in care deserve the right to own and live the memory of their own childhood
it is that simple my own mother
and i should say this here
she same to this country in the late sixty s and she was you know she found herself pregnant as women did in the late sixty s you know what i mean they found themselves pregnant and she sort of she had no idea of
you were separated from your family by the state you were separated from your family and placed into mother and baby homes you were appointed a social worker
the adoptive parents were lined up it was the primary purpose of the social worker the aim to get the woman at her most vulnerable time in her entire life to sign the adoption papers so the adoption papers
the adoption papers were signed the child was given to the adoptive parents and the mother shipped back to her community to say that she 'd been on a little break a little break
a little break the first secret of shame for a woman for being a woman a little
the mother the earth and the child the crop
it 's kind of easy to patronize the past to forego our responsibilities in the present what happened then is a direct reflection
of what is happening now everybody believed themselves to be doing the right thing by god and by the state for the big society fast tracking adoption
so anyway she comes here one thousand nine hundred and sixty seven she 's pregnant
it was a summer of hate
you know i have to say this in the houses it 's her plan
to have me fostered for a short period of time while she studies but the social worker he had a different agenda
he found the foster parents and he said to them treat this as an adoption he 's yours forever his name
i was a message they said i was a sign from god they said i was norman mark greenwood
i tried praying i swear i tried praying god can i have a bike for christmas but i would always answer myself
and then i was supposed to determine whether that was the voice of god or it was the voice of the who knew
and i was on the cusp of sort of adolescence
so i was starting to take biscuits from the tin without asking i was starting to stay out a little bit late etc etc now in their religiosity in their naivete my mom and dad which i believed them to be forever as they said they were
my mom and dad conceived that i had the devil inside of me
i should say this here because this is how they engineered my leaving
my most honest and truthful answer
so this was an opportunity if they were asking me whether i loved them or not then i mustn 't love them which led me to the miracle of thought that i thought they wanted me to get to i will ask god for forgiveness and his light will shine through me to them how fantastic
this was an opportunity the theology was perfect the timing unquestionable and the answer as honest as a sinner could get i mustn 't love you i said to them
but i will ask god for forgiveness because you don 't love us norman clearly you 've chosen your path
twenty four hours later my social worker this strange man who used to visit me every couple of months he 's waiting for me in the car as i say goodbye to my parents i didn 't say goodbye to anybody not my mother my father my sisters my brothers my aunts my uncles my cousins my grandparents nobody
on the way to the children 's home i started to ask myself what 's happened to me it 's not that i 'd had the rug pulled from beneath me as much as the entire floor had been taken away
when i got to the for the next four
five years i was held in four different children 's homes
on the third children 's home at fifteen i started to rebel and what i did was i got three tins of paint airfix paint that you use for models
and i was it was a big children 's home big victorian children 's home and i was in a little turret at the top of it and i poured them red yellow and green the colors of africa down the tiles
they could do anything to me
they had a padded cell
they would march me down corridors in last size order they
i was put in a dormitory with a confirmed nazi sympathizer all of the staff were ex police interesting and ex probation officers
the man who ran it was an ex army officer every time i had a visit by a person who i did not know who would feed me grapes once every three months i was strip searched
that home was full of young boys who were on remand for things like murder
and this was the preparation that i was being given after seventeen years as a child of the state
i have to tell this story i have to tell it because there was no one to put two and two together
i 'm not defining a good family from a bad family i 'm just saying that you know when your birthday is by virtue of the fact that
somebody tells you when your birthday is a mother a father a sister a brother an aunt an uncle a cousin a grandparent it matters to someone and therefore it matters to you understand i was fourteen years old tucked away in myself into myself and i wasn 't touched either physically touched i 'm reporting back
was to find my family and the other was to write poetry in creativity i saw light in the imagination i saw the endless possibility of life the endless truth
the permanent creation of reality the place where anger was an expression in the search for love
i 've just got to say it to you all i found all of my family in my adult life i spent all of my adult life finding them and i 've now got a fully dysfunctional family just like everybody else
but i 'm reporting back to you to say quite simply that you can define how strong a democracy is
