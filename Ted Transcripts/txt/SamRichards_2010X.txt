students often ask me what is sociology
and i tell them it 's the study
of the way in which human beings are shaped by things that they don 't see
how can i understand those invisible forces and i say empathy start with empathy it all begins with empathy take yourself
if a hundred years ago china had been the most powerful nation in the world and they came to the united states in search of coal and they found it and in fact they found lots of it right here and pretty soon they began shipping that coal
and they got fabulously wealthy in doing so and they built beautiful cities
all powered on that coal
i saw people struggling to get by
not knowing what was what and what was next
and then i asked myself the question i say how 's it possible that we could be so poor here in the united states because the coal is such a wealthy resource it 's so much money and i realized because the chinese
and sophisticated technology in order to ensure that people like me would not speak out against this relationship
and everywhere were symbols of the chinese everywhere a constant reminder
and it gets really ugly and the chinese respond in a very ugly way
and before we know it they send in the tanks and then send in the troops
and lots of people are dying and it 's a very very difficult situation
can you imagine what you would feel
if you were in my shoes can you imagine walking out of this building and seeing a tank sitting out there or a truck full of soldiers
if you can that 's empathy that 's empathy you 've left your shoes and you 've stood in mine
okay so that 's the warm up that 's the warm up now we 're going to have
the real radical experiment and so for the remainder of my talk what i want you to do is put yourselves in the shoes of an ordinary arab muslim living in the middle east in particular in iraq
and so to help you
perhaps you 're a member of this middle class family in baghdad
and what you want is the best for your kids you want your kids to have a better life and you watch the news
you pay attention you read the newspaper you go down to the coffee shop with your friends and you read the newspapers from around the world and sometimes you even watch satellite cnn from the united states so you have a sense of what the americans are thinking but really you just want a better life for yourself that 's what you want
everybody knows that people here back in the united states know it 's about oil it 's because somebody else has a design for your resource it 's your resource it 's not somebody else 's it 's your land
it 's your resource somebody else has a design for it
and you know why they have a design you know why they have their eyes set on it because they have an entire
and they have big cities and the cities
are all dependent on oil
something else you see that you talk about americans don 't talk about this but you do there 's this thing this militarization of the world and it 's centered right in the united states and the united states
is responsible for almost one
four percent of the world 's population and you feel it you see it every day it 's part of your life and you talk about it with your friends you read about it and back
when saddam hussein was in power somehow suddenly things mattered
and what you see something else the united states
there are a lot of countries oil producing countries that aren 't very democratic but supported by the united states
these incursions these two wars the ten years of sanctions the eight years of occupation the insurgency that 's been unleashed on your people the tens of thousands the hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths all because of oil
you can 't help but think that you talk about
it it 's in the forefront of your mind always
once a life of happiness and joy and suddenly pain and sorrow
everyone in your country has been touched by the violence the bloodshed the pain the horror everybody not a single person in your country has not been touched but there 's something else there 's something else about these
people these americans who are there there 's something else about them that you see they don 't see themselves and what do you see
god they have crosses they carry bibles their bibles have a little insignia that says u s army
before they send their sons and daughters off to war in your country and you know the reason before they send them off they go to a christian church and they pray to their christian god and they ask for protection and guidance from that god why
of course you do and they do wonderful things
you read about it you hear about it they 're there to build schools and help people and that 's what they want to do they do wonderful things but they also do the bad things and you can 't tell the difference and this guy you get a guy like lt gen william boykin i mean here 's a guy who says that your god
invade subdue them take their resources if they won 't submit kill them
that 's what this is about and you 're thinking my god these christians are coming to kill us
this is frightening you feel frightened of course you feel frightened
these christians who are these christians they 're so evil they 're so mean this is what they 're about
this is what you 're thinking as an arab muslim as an iraqi of course you 're going to think this and then your cousin says hey cuz check out this website you 've got to see this bible boot camp these christians are nuts they 're training their little kids to be soldiers for jesus
and they take these little kids and they run them through these things till they teach them how to say sir yes sir and things like grenade toss and weapons care and maintenance and go to the website
when you see them they 're something else they 're something else that 's what they are to you
we don 't see it that way in the united states but you see it that way
you 're generalizing it 's wrong you don 't understand the americans it 's not a christian invasion we 're not just there for oil we 're there for lots of reasons you have it wrong
you 've missed it and of course most of you don 't support the insurgency you don 't support killing americans you don 't support the terrorists of course you don 't very few people do
now here comes the radical experiment so we 're all back home
this photo this woman man i feel her
i feel her she 's my sister my wife my cousin
so it 's all about coal and the chinese are here in the united states
because her loved one has died in america in the coal uprising
and the soldiers are chinese and everybody else is chinese
as an american how do you feel about this picture
this is the scene here it 's an american american soldiers american woman who lost her loved one in the middle east in iraq or afghanistan now put yourself in the shoes go back to the shoes of an arab muslim living in iraq
what are you feeling and thinking about this photo about this
because i 'm taking a big risk here
and so i 'm going to invite you to take a risk with me these gentlemen here they 're insurgents they were caught by the american soldiers trying to kill americans
maybe they succeeded put yourself in the shoes of the americans who caught them
can you feel the rage can you feel that you just want to take these guys and wring their necks can you go there
it shouldn 't be that difficult
you just oh man now put yourself in or patriotic defenders
i 'll be back later
i 'm going out to defend your freedom your lives i 'm going out to look out for us
and walk an inch one tiny inch
in all other aspects of your life
you can walk a mile when it comes to understanding why that person 's driving forty miles per hour in the passing lane or your teenage son
or your neighbor who annoys you by cutting his lawn on sunday mornings whatever it is you can go so far
and then do it again and do it again and do it again and suddenly all these tiny little worlds they come together in this complex web and they build a big complex world and suddenly without realizing it you 're seeing the world differently everything has changed everything in your life has changed
other lives other visions listen to other people enlighten ourselves
i 'm not saying that i support the terrorists in iraq
but as a sociologist what i am saying is
