i think it 's extremely important that we have sustainable transport and sustainable energy production that sort of overall sustainable energy problem is the biggest problem that we have to solve this century independent of environmental concerns
in fact even if producing co two was good for the environment given that we 're going to run out of hydrocarbons we need to find some sustainable means of operating
so if you take say natural gas which is the most prevalent hydrocarbon source fuel if you burn that in a modern general electric natural gas turbine you 'll get about sixty percent efficiency if you put that same fuel in an internal combustion engine car you get about twenty percent efficiency
and the reason is in the stationary power plant you can afford to have something that weighs a lot more is voluminous and you can take the waste heat and run a steam turbine and generate a secondary power source
so in effect even after you 've taken transmission loss into account and everything even using the same source fuel you 're at least twice as better off charging an electric car then burning it at the power plant
so that means making it incredibly light and so what you 're seeing here is the only all aluminum body and chassis car made in north america in fact we applied a lot of rocket design techniques to make the car light despite having a very large battery pack
and then it also has the lowest drag coefficient of any car of its size so as a result the energy usage is very low and it has the most advanced battery pack and that 's what gives it the range that 's competitive so you can actually have on the order of a two hundred and fifty mile range
i think somebody recently got four hundred and twenty miles out of a single charge ca bruno
i mean you can certainly drive if you drive it sixty five miles an hour under normal conditions two hundred and fifty miles is a reasonable number
medium priced and medium volume and then version three would be low price high volume so we 're at step two at this point so we had a dollar one hundred thousand sports car which was the roadster then we 've got the model s which starts at around fifty thousand dollars and our third generation car which should hopefully be out in about three or four years will be a dollar thirty thousand car
and so this is something that maybe a lot of people don 't realize we actually have california and nevada covered and we 've got the eastern seaboard from boston to d c covered by the end of this year you 'll be able to drive from l a to new york
and the key thing is to have a ratio of drive to stop to stop time of about six or seven so if you drive for three hours you want to stop for twenty or thirty minutes because that 's normally what people will stop for so if you start a trip at nine a m by noon
you want to stop to have a bite to eat hit the restroom coffee and keep going
this is only one string to your energy bow you 've been working on this solar company solarcity what 's unusual about that
i 'm quite confident that the primary means of power generation will be solar i mean it 's really indirect fusion is what it is we 've got this giant fusion generator in the sky called the sun and we just need to tap a little bit of that energy for purposes of human civilization
fracked natural gas how are you going to build a business here
and the thing about solar power is that it doesn 't have any feed stock or operational costs so once it 's installed it 's just there it works for decades it 'll work for probably a century
how long is a typical lease em typical leases are twenty years but the value proposition is as you 're sort of alluding to quite straightforward it 's no money down and your utility bill decreases
and they have an expected return on that capital with that capital solarcity purchases and installs the panel on the roof and then charges the
new type of distributed utility em exactly what it amounts to is a giant distributed utility i think it 's a good thing because utilities have been this monopoly and people haven 't had any choice so effectively it 's the first time

you decided to build a space company why on earth would someone do that
the future to be an exciting and inspiring one
you could still get copied right you haven 't patented this stuff it 's really interesting to me em no we don 't patent ca you didn 't patent because you think it 's more dangerous to patent than not
took a ten thousand person group nine months to refurbish for flight so the space shuttle ended up costing a billion dollars per flight
traveling on cruises would be if you had to
so now it 's hovering at about forty meters
my theory is that you
have an ability to think at a system level of design that pulls together design technology and business so if ted was tbd design technology and business into one package synthesize it in a way that very few people can and and this is the critical thing feel so damn confident
in that clicked together package that you take crazy risks you bet your fortune on it and you seem to have done that multiple times i mean almost no one can do that
and you have to do that otherwise mentally you wouldn 't be able to get through the day but when you want to do something new you have to apply the physics approach physics is really figuring out how to discover new things that are counterintuitive like quantum mechanics it 's really counterintuitive
