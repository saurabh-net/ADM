and so really so much of what we do in medicine and life in general
is focused on mopping up the floor without also turning off the faucet
i love doing this work because it really gives many people new hope and new choices that they didn a t have before
and it allows us to
aldous huxley called the perennial wisdom when you get past the named and forms and rituals that really divide people
really about our nature is to be happy our nature is to be peaceful our nature is to be healthy and so it a s not something happiness is not something you get health is generally not something that you get but rather all of these different practices
powerful tools for transformation for quieting down our mind and bodies to allow us to experience what it feels like
i studied yoga for many years with a teacher named swami satchidananda and people would say what are you a hindu he a d say no i a m an undo and
about identifying what a s causing us to disturb our innate health and happiness and then to allow that natural healing to occur to me that a s the real natural wonder
so within that context that larger context we can talk about diet stress management which are really these spiritual practices moderate exercise smoking cessation support groups and community which i a ll talk more about and some vitamins and supplements
going to live longer you a re going to feel better you a re going to lose weight and so on and in our studies what we a ve been able to do is to use very expensive high tech state of the art measures
to prove how powerful these very simple and low tech and low cost and in many ways ancient interventions can be
we used quantitative arterioography showing the narrowing this is one of the arteries that feeds the heart one of the main arteries and you can see the narrowing here a year later it a s not as clogged a normally it goes the other direction
these minor changes in blockages caused a three hundred percent improvement in blood flow and using cardiac positron emission tomography or pet scans blue and black is no blood flow
within a month like most people was pain free and within a year climbing more than one hundred floors a day on a stairmaster this is not unusual and it a s part of what enables people to maintain these kinds of changes because it makes such a big difference in their quality of life
we also found that the more people change the better they got it wasn a t a function of how old or how sick they were it was mainly how much they changed and the oldest patients improved as much as the young ones
i got this as a christmas card a few years ago from two of the patients in one of our programs the younger brother is eighty six the older one a s ninety five they wanted to show me how much
and what we found was that ninety nine percent of the patients start to reverse the progression of their heart disease
so we began through our nonprofit institute training hospitals around the country and we found that most people could avoid surgery and not only was it medically effective it was also cost effective and
or they eat when they get depressed or they use alcohol to numb the pain or they work too hard or watch too much tv there are lots of ways we have of avoiding and
bypassing pain but the point of all of this is to deal with the cause of the problem and the pain is not the problem it a s the symptom and
not emphysema what was the biggest selling drug of all time when it was introduced a few years ago viagra right why because a lot of guys need it it a s not like you say hey joe i a m having erectile dysfunction how about you and yet look at the number of prescriptions that are being sold
so the very behaviors that we think of as being so sexy in our culture are the very ones that leave so many people feeling tired lethargic depressed and
blood flow is measurably less and you a ve all experienced this at thanksgiving when you eat a big fatty meal how do you feel you feel kind of sleepy afterwards on a low fat meal the blood flow doesn a t go down it even goes up
you get big benefits and you feel so much better so quickly for many people those are choices worth making not to live longer but to live better
and just to show you this this is from the cdc these are not election returns these are the percentage of people who are overweight and if you see from eighty five to eighty six to eighty seven eighty eight
eighty nine ninety ninety one you get a new category fifteen to twenty percent ninety two ninety three ninety four ninety five ninety six ninety seven you get a new category
ninety eight ninety nine two thousand and two thousand and one mississippi more than twenty five percent of people are overweight why is this well this is one way to lose weight
well but it doesn a t last which is the problem now
how you lose weight you either burn more calories by exercise or you eat fewer calories now
the other way is to change the type of food and fat has nine calories per gram whereas protein and carbs only have four so when you eat less fat you eat fewer calories without having to eat less food so you can eat the same amount of food
and the myth that you hear about is americans have been told to eat less fat the percent of calories from fat is down americans are fatter than ever therefore fat doesn a t make you fat
a half truth actually americans are eating more fat than ever and even more carbs and so the percentage is lower the actual amount is higher and so the goal is to reduce both
and i debated each other many times before he died and we agreed that americans eat too many simple carbs the bad carbs and these are things like
and they get absorbed quickly so your blood sugar zooms up your pancreas makes insulin to bring it back down which is good but insulin accelerates the conversion of calories into fat
so the goal is not to go to pork rinds and bacon and sausages these are not health foods but to go from bad carbs to what are called good carbs and these are things like whole foods or unrefined carbs fruits vegetables whole wheat flour brown rice in their natural forms are rich in
but also what you include that a s protective just as all carbs are not bad for you all fats are not bad for you there are good fats and these are
the omega three fatty acids you find these for example in fish oil and the bad fats are things like trans fatty acids and processed food and saturated fats which we find
now the problem with the atkins diet everybody knows people who have lost weight on it but you can lose weight on amphetamines you know and fen phen i mean there are lots of ways of losing weight that aren a t good for you you want to lose weight in a way that enhances your health rather than the one that harms it
same the research findings have changed now what
your heart when you go on an atkins diet the red is good at the beginning and a year later this is from a study done in peer reviewed journal called angiology there a s more red after a year on a diet like i would recommend there a s less red less blood flow after a year
type diet so yes you can lose weight but your heart isn a t happy
now one of the studies funded by the atkins center found that seventy percent of the people were constipated sixty five percent had bad breath fifty four percent had headaches a this is not a healthy way to eat and so you might start to lose weight and start to attract people towards you but when they get
case reports now of sixteen year old girls who died after a few weeks on the atkins diet of bone disease kidney disease and so on and that a s how your body excretes waste is through your breath your bowels and your perspiration so when you go on these kinds of diet they begin to smell
now there are ecological reasons for eating lower on the food chain too whether it a s the deforestation of the amazon or making more protein available to the
you know four billion people who live on a dollar a day not to mention you know whatever ethical concerns people have so there are lots of reasons for eating this way that go beyond just your health
and we took ninety men who had biopsy proven prostate cancer and who had elected for reasons unrelated to the study not to have surgery so then we could randomly divide them into two groups
what we found was that after a year none of the experimental group patients who made these lifestyle changes needed treatment whereas six of the control group patients needed surgery or radiation
when we looked at their psa levels which is a marker for prostate cancer they got worse in the control group but they actually got better in the experimental group and these differences were highly significant
and then i wondered was there any relationship between how much people changed their diet and lifestyle whichever group they were in and the changes in psa and sure enough we found a dose response relationship just like we found in the arterial blockages in our cardiac studies
down to ucla they added it to a standard line of prostate tumor cells growing in tissue culture and it inhibited the growth seven times more in the experimental group than in the control group seventy versus nine percent
so if it a s true for prostate cancer it a ll almost certainly be true for breast cancer as well and whether or not you have conventional treatment
in addition if you make these changes it may help reduce the risk of recurrence the last thing i want to talk about apropos of the issue of the pursuit of happiness is that
study after study have shown that people who are lonely and depressed and depression is the other real epidemic in our culture are many times more likely to get sick and die prematurely in part because as we talked about they a re more likely to smoke and overeat and drink too much and work too hard and so on
but also through mechanisms that we don a t fully understand people who are lonely and depressed are many times three to five to ten times in some studies more likely to get sick and die prematurely and depression is treatable we need to do something about that
now on the other hand anything that promotes intimacy is healing it can be sexual intimacy a i happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy are just different forms of the same thing
friendship altruism compassion service a all the perennial truths that we talked about that are part of all religion and all cultures once you stop trying to see the differences
women with metastatic breast cancer randomly divided them into two groups one group of people just met for an hour and a half once a week in a support group it was a nurturing loving environment
five years later those women lived twice as long and you can see that the people and that was the only difference between the groups it was a randomized control study published in the lancet other studies have shown this as well
so these simple things that create intimacy are really healing and even the word healing it comes from the root to make whole the word yoga comes from the sanskrit meaning union to yoke to bring together
and the last slide i want to show you is from i was again this swami that i studied with for so many years and i did a combined oncology and cardiology grand rounds at the university of virginia medical school a couple of years ago and at the end of it somebody said hey swami
