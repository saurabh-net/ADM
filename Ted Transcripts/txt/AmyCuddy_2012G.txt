and all it requires of you is this that you change your posture
for two minutes but before i give it away i want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you 're doing with your body so how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller maybe you 're hunching crossing your legs maybe wrapping your ankles sometimes we hold onto our arms like this
sometimes we spread out laughter i see you laughter so i want you to pay attention to what you 're doing right now we 're going to come back to that in a few minutes
and i 'm hoping that if you learn to tweak this a little bit it could significantly change the way your life unfolds so we 're really fascinated with body language and we 're particularly interested in other people 's body language you know we 're interested in like you know
an awkward interaction or a smile or a contemptuous glance or maybe a very awkward wink or maybe even something like a handshake
obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior or body language but we call it nonverbals as social scientists
it 's language so we think about communication when we think about communication we think about interactions so what is your body language communicating to me what 's mine communicating to you and there 's a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this so social scientists have spent a lot of time
looking at the effects of our body language or other people 's body language on judgments and we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language and those judgments
can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote who we ask out on a date for example nalini ambady a researcher at tufts university shows that when people watch thirty second soundless clips of real physician patient interactions
their judgments of the physician 's niceness
predict whether or not that physician will be sued
so it doesn 't have to do so much with whether or not that physician was incompetent but do we like that person and how they interacted
even more dramatic alex todorov at princeton has shown us that judgments of political candidates faces in just one second predict seventy percent of u s senate and gubernatorial race outcomes
and even let 's go digital emoticons used well in online negotiations can lead to you claim more value from that negotiation if you use them poorly bad idea right so
i 'm a social psychologist i study prejudice and i teach at a competitive business school so
it was inevitable that i would become interested in power dynamics i became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance and what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance
this expression which is known as pride jessica tracy has studied she shows that people who are born with sight and people who are congenitally blind do this when they win at a physical competition so when they cross the finish line and they 've won it doesn 't matter if they 've never seen anyone do it they do this
so the arms up in the v the chin is slightly lifted
what do we do when we feel powerless we do exactly the opposite we close up we wrap ourselves up we make ourselves small we don 't want to bump into the person next to us so again both animals and humans do the same thing
and this is what happens when you put together high and low power so what we tend to do when it comes to power is that we complement the other 's nonverbals so if someone is being really powerful with us we tend to make ourselves smaller we don 't mirror them we do the opposite of them so
i 'm watching this behavior in the classroom and what do i notice i notice that
you have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in as soon they come in you see it you see it on their faces and their bodies and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny and they go like this when they raise their hand i notice a couple of things about this one you 're not going to be surprised it seems to be related to gender
so women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men
business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap
you get these equally qualified women and men coming in
and then you get these differences in grades and it seems to be partly attributable to participation so i started to wonder you know okay so you have these people coming in like this and they 're participating is it possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more so my main collaborator dana carney
do our nonverbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves
there 's some evidence that they do so for example we smile when we feel happy but also when we 're forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this it makes us feel happy so it goes both ways when it comes to power
it also goes both ways so when you feel powerful you 're more likely to do this but it 's also possible that when you pretend to be powerful you are more likely to actually feel powerful
so the second question really was you know so we know that our minds change our bodies but is it also true that our bodies change our minds
and when i say minds in the case of the powerful what am i talking about so i 'm talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings and in my case that 's hormones i look at hormones so what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like so powerful people
tend to be not surprisingly more assertive and more confident more optimistic they actually feel that they 're going to win even at games of chance they also tend to be able to think more abstractly so there are a lot of differences they take more risks there are a lot of differences between powerful and powerless people
physiologically there also are differences on two key hormones testosterone which is the dominance hormone and cortisol which is the stress hormone
so what we find is that high power alpha males in primate hierarchies have high testosterone and low cortisol and
powerful and effective leaders also have high testosterone and low cortisol so what does that mean when you think about power people tended to think only about testosterone because that was about dominance
but really power is also about how you react to stress so do you want the high power leader that 's dominant high on testosterone but really stress reactive
probably not right you want the person who 's powerful and assertive and dominant but not very stress reactive the person who 's laid back so
we know that in primate hierarchies if an alpha needs to take over if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly
within a few days that individual 's testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly so we have this evidence both that the body can shape the mind at least at the facial level
and also that role changes can shape the mind so what happens okay you take a role change what happens if you do that at a really minimal level like this tiny manipulation this tiny intervention for two minutes you say i want you to stand like this and it 's going to make you feel more powerful
and run a little experiment and these people adopted for two minutes either high power poses or low power poses and i 'm just going to show you five of the poses although they took on only two so here 's one
so here 's one a couple more
this one has been dubbed the wonder woman by the media
here are a couple more so you can be standing or you can be sitting and here are the low power poses so you 're folding up you 're making yourself small
this one is very low power when you 're touching your neck you 're really protecting yourself
so this is what happens they come in they spit into a vial we for two minutes say you need to do this or this they don 't look at pictures of the poses we don 't want to prime them with a concept of power we want them to be feeling power right so two minutes they do this
we then ask them how powerful do you feel on a series of items and then we give them an opportunity to gamble
and then we take another saliva sample that 's it that 's the whole experiment so this is what we find risk tolerance which is the gambling what we find is that when you 're in the high power pose condition eighty six percent of you will gamble when you 're in the low power pose condition only sixty percent and that 's a pretty whopping significant difference
here 's what we find on testosterone
from their baseline when they come in high power people experience about a twenty percent increase
and low power people experience about a ten percent decrease so again two minutes and you get these changes here 's what you get on cortisol high power people experience about a twenty five percent decrease
and the low power people experience about a fifteen percent increase so two minutes lead to these hormonal changes that configure your brain to basically be either
but the next question of course is can power posing for a few minutes really change your life in meaningful ways so this is in the lab it 's this little task you know it 's just a couple of minutes where can you actually apply this which we cared about of course
situations where are you being evaluated either by your friends like for teenagers it 's at the lunchroom table it could be you know for some people it 's speaking at a school board meeting it might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this
talking to other people it 's you talking to yourself what do you do before you go into a job interview you do this right you 're sitting down you 're looking at your iphone or your android not trying to leave anyone out you are you know you 're looking at your notes you 're hunching up making yourself small when really what you should be doing maybe is this like in the
so for five minutes nothing and this is worse than being heckled people hate this it 's what marianne lafrance calls standing in social quicksand so this really spikes your cortisol so this is the job interview we put them through because we really wanted to see what happened
we then have these coders look at these tapes four of them they 're blind to the hypothesis they 're blind to the conditions they have no idea who 's been posing in what pose and they end up
looking at these sets of tapes and they say oh we want to hire these people all the high power posers we don 't want to hire these people
we also evaluate these people much more positively overall
but what 's driving it it 's not about the content of the speech it 's about the presence that they 're bringing to the speech we also because we rate them on all these variables related to competence like how well structured is the speech how good is it what are their qualifications no effect on those things this is what 's affected these kinds of things
people are bringing their true selves basically they 're bringing themselves they bring their ideas but as themselves with no you know residue over them so this is what 's driving the effect or mediating the effect so
when i was nineteen i was in a really bad car accident i was thrown out of a car
rolled several times i was thrown from the car and i woke up in a head injury rehab ward and i had been withdrawn from college and i learned that my i q had dropped by two standard deviations
which was very traumatic i knew my i q because i had identified with being smart and i had been called gifted as a child so i 'm taken out of college i keep trying to go back they say you 're not going to finish college just you know
there are other things for you to do but that 's not going to work out for you
so i really struggled with this and i have to say having your identity taken from you your core identity and for me it was being smart having that taken from you there 's nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that
so i felt entirely powerless i worked and worked and worked and i got lucky and worked and got lucky and worked eventually i graduated from college
it took me four years longer than my peers and i convinced someone my angel advisor susan fiske to take me on and so i ended up at princeton and i was like i am not supposed to be here
she was like you are not quitting because i took a gamble on you and you 're staying you 're going to stay and this is what you 're going to do
so that 's what i did five years in grad school
a few years you know i 'm at northwestern i moved to harvard
and that was the moment for me because two things happened one was that i realized
you know it 's not do it enough until you actually become it and internalize the last thing i 'm going to leave you with is this tiny tweaks
can lead to big changes so
this is two minutes two minutes two minutes two minutes before you go into the next stressful evaluative situation for two minutes try doing this in the elevator in a bathroom stall at your desk
both to try power posing
