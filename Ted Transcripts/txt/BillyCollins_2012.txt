give you your recommended dietary allowance of poetry
and the way i 'm going to do that is present to you
five animations of five of my poems and let me just tell you a little bit of how that came about because the mixing of those two media is a sort of unnatural or unnecessary act but when i was united states poet laureate
and i love saying that
when i was him back then i was approached by j walter thompson the ad company and they were hired
sort of by the sundance channel and the idea was to have me record some of my poems and then they would find animators to animate them and i was initially resistant because i always think poetry can stand alone by itself
attempts to put my poems to music have had disastrous results in all cases and the poem if it 's written with the ear already has been set to its own verbal music as it was composed
and surely if you 're reading a poem that mentions a cow you don 't need on the facing page a drawing of a cow i mean let 's let the reader do a little work
but i relented because it seemed like an interesting possibility and also i 'm like a total cartoon junkie since childhood
i think more influential than emily dickinson or coleridge or wordsworth on my imagination were warner brothers
merrie melodies and loony tunes cartoons bugs bunny is my muse
i created a poetry channel on delta airlines that lasted for a couple of years so you could tune into poetry as you were flying and my sense is it 's a good thing to get poetry off the shelves and more into public life
start a meeting with a poem that would be an idea you might take with you when you get a poem on a billboard or on the radio or on a cereal box or whatever it happens to you so suddenly that you don 't have time to deploy your anti poetry deflector shields
that were installed in high school
so let us start with the first one it 's a little poem called budapest and in it i reveal or pretend to reveal the secrets of the creative process video narration budapest
my pen moves along the page like the snout of a strange animal shaped like a human arm and dressed in the sleeve of a loose green sweater i watch it sniffing the paper ceaselessly intent as any forager
it wants only to be here tomorrow dressed perhaps in the sleeve of a plaid shirt
nose pressed against the page writing a few more dutiful lines while i gaze out the window and imagine budapest or some other city where i have never been
she said you know poetry is harder than writing which i found both erroneous and profound
legs at the knees if they come with that feature and fix them into the tiny wooden chairs
all afternoon they face one another the man in the brown suit the woman in the blue dress perfectly motionless perfectly
then lowered into the dining room of a dollhouse to sit with the others at the long table
very funny but how would you like it if you never knew from one day to the next
or sitting down there amidst the wallpaper staring straight ahead with your little plastic
slippage and the poem begins with a certain species of forgetfulness that someone called literary amnesia in other words forgetting the things that you have read
of the author is the first to go followed obediently by the title the plot the heartbreaking conclusion
the entire novel which suddenly becomes one you have never read never even heard of
it is as if one by one
the memories you used to harbor decided to retire to the southern hemisphere
long ago you kissed the names of the nine muses good bye
and you watched the quadratic equation
the address of an uncle the capital of paraguay
not even lurking in some obscure
well on your own way to oblivion
where you will join those who have forgotten even how to swim
no wonder the moon in the window seems to have drifted out of a love poem
deer hunting which meant getting lost with a gun basically
i wondered about you when you told me never to leave a box of wooden strike anywhere matches just lying around the house because the mice might get into them and start a fire but your face was absolutely straight
against rough hewn beam the sudden flare and the creature for one bright shining moment suddenly thrust ahead of his time
and who could fail to notice lit up in the blazing insulation
the tiny looks of wonderment on the faces of his fellow mice one time inhabitants of what once was your house in the country
thank you and the last poem is called the dead i wrote this after a friend 's funeral but not so much about the friend as something the eulogist kept saying as all eulogists tend to do which is
how happy the deceased would be to look down and see all of us assembled and that to me was a bad start to the afterlife having to witness your own funeral and feel gratified so the little poem is called
the dead are always looking down on us they say
and when we lie down in a field or on a couch
drugged perhaps by the hum of a warm afternoon they think we are looking back at them which makes them lift their oars and fall silent and wait like parents for us to close our eyes
and schlepping is an ancient and honorable art
if it has a subject the subject is adolescence
and it 's addressed to a certain person it 's called to my favorite seventeen year old high school girl
do you realize that if you had started building the parthenon on the day you were born you would be all done in only one more year
of course you couldn 't have done that all alone so never mind you 're fine just being yourself
you 're loved for just being you
but did you know that at your age judy garland was pulling down one hundred and fifty thousand dollars a picture
joan of arc was leading the french army to victory
and blaise pascal had cleaned up his room no wait i mean he had invented the calculator
of course there will be time for all that later in your life
after you come out of your room and begin to blossom or at least pick up all your socks
for some reason i keep remembering that lady jane grey was queen of england when she was only fifteen
but then she was beheaded so never mind her as a role model
when he was your age franz schubert was doing the dishes for his family
but that did not keep him from composing two symphonies four operas and two complete masses as a youngster
not here in the suburbs of cleveland
playing with your food and staring into space give you your recommended
