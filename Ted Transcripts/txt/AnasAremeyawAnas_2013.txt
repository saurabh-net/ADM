because if i do the bad guys will come for me
my journey started fourteen years ago
i was a young reporter i had just come out of college
from hawkers who were hawking on the streets
as a young reporter i thought that i should
so i decided to go there
as part of selling i was able to document the hard core evidence the impact was great
i am an undercover journalist
my journalism is hinged on three basic principles naming shaming and jailing
i have worked on this is spirit child
is spirit child it was about children
who were born with deformities and their parents felt that once they were born with those deformities
and i went into the village
pretended as though this baby had been born with a deformity and here was the guys who do the killing they got themselves ready
i phoned the police and fortunately they came and busted them
as i speak now they are before the courts don 't forget the key principles naming shaming and jailing
another key story that comes to mind which relates to this spirit child phenomenon
it it was time to go undercover again so i went undercover
as a man who was interested in this particular business of course again a prosthetic arm was built for the first time i filmed on hidden camera the guys who do this and they were ready to buy
i am glad today the tanzanian government has taken action
my journalism is about hard core evidence
if i say you have stolen i show you the evidence that you have stolen i show you how you stole it and when or what you used what you had stolen to do what is the essence of journalism if it doesn 't benefit society
my kind of journalism is a product of my society
i know that sometimes people have their own criticisms
he brought out some money from his pockets
you see a hand counting money just in front of me the next moment you see the money in my hands counting whereas i have not come into contact with anybody i have not done any business with anybody
i have been there for a long time that it ever happens
how can you obtain the hard core evidence
so i was in the prison
from his sick bed till death and i can tell you it was not a nice thing at all toilet facilities very bad
if you have extreme diseases
you need to get extreme remedies
you see we on the continent are able to tell the story better because we face the conditions and we see the conditions
that is why i was particularly excited when we launched our africa investigates series where we investigated a lot of african countries this will not stop
i 'm going to carry on with this kind of journalism because i know that when evil men destroy good men must build and bind thank you very much
how do you do that
