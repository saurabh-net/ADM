i wanted to be a biker chick laughter i wanted to race cars
and i wanted to be mowgli from the jungle book
because they were all about being free
not that we could have afforded i drive but to give me the dream of driving
and on my seventeenth birthday i accompanied my little sister in complete innocence
as i always had all my life
my visually impaired sister to go to see an eye specialist because big sisters are always supposed to support their little sisters
and my little sister wanted to be a pilot god help her
so i used to get my eyes tested just for fun
and on my seventeenth birthday after my fake eye exam
the eye specialist just noticed it happened to be my birthday and he said on my seventeenth birthday
as janis ian would best say
i learned the truth at seventeen
every man in this room even you steve is george clooney no special needs schools
and they decided to tell me
a boy given a girl 's name
i would grow up and learn from experience how to be tough and how to survive
but more significantly they gave me the ability to believe totally to believe
and i swear to god i walked out of his office i will drive
i will drive you 're mad i 'll drive i know i can drive
and with the same dogged determination that my father had bred into me since i was such a child he taught me how to sail knowing i could never see where i was going i could never see the shore and i couldn 't see the sails and i couldn 't see the destination but he told me to believe and feel the wind in my face
and that wind in my face made me believe that he was mad and i would drive and for the next eleven years i swore nobody would ever find out that i couldn 't see because i didn 't want to be a failure and i didn 't want to be weak and i believed i could do it so i rammed through life as only a casey can do
and i was an archeologist and then i broke things and then i managed a restaurant and then i slipped on things and then i was a masseuse and then i was a landscape gardener and then i went to business school and you know disabled people are hugely educated
and then i went in and i got a global consulting job with accenture and they didn 't even know
and it 's extraordinary how far belief can take you
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine two and a half years into that job very unexpectedly
and two years in i really could see very little
and i found myself in front of an hr manager
and you all know what it is you don 't need to have a disability to know that we all know how hard it is to admit weakness and failure and it 's frightening isn 't
it 's such a small thing
and you know how exhausting it can be to try to
and that eye specialist he didn 't bother testing my eyes god no it was therapy and he asked me several questions of which many were
why why are you fighting so hard not to be yourself
and do you love what you do
and as i left his office he called me back
and he said i think it 's time i think and my chest ached
and i had no idea where i was going i had no idea but i did know the game was up and i went home and because the pain in my chest ached so much i thought i 'll go out for a run really not a very sensible thing to do and broken fallen
and i was broken and i was angry
and i didn 't know what to do
i just simply had no answers i had lost my belief look where my belief had brought me to and now i had lost it and now i really couldn 't see i was crumpled and then i remember thinking about that
and really slowly slowly slowly
i 'm going to be an elephant handler
and i had no idea how i was going to be an elephant handler from global management consultant
and you know what when you really believe in yourself and everything about you it 's extraordinary what happens and you know what that trip that thousand kilometers it raised enough money for six thousand cataract eye operations six thousand people got to see because of that when i came home off that elephant
because my organization was always going to be named after my elephant because disability is like the elephant in the room and i wanted to make you see it in a positive way no charity no pity but i wanted to work only and truly with business and media leadership to totally reframe disability in a way that was and possible
and possible it was extraordinary
i was petrified and i speak but this is an amazing audience
but as i was traveling here you 'll be very happy to know i did use my white symbol stick cane because it 's really good to skip queues in the airport
and i got my way here
you can make change happen and we need to make it happen disabled perfect normal whatever
we are extraordinary different wonderful people
