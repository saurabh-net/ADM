but to an outsider it seems to be as impenetrable as the great wall of china
over the past few years i 've been wondering if i can break down this wall so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so i started thinking about how a new fast method of learning chinese might be useful
since the age of five i started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence i learned new characters every day during the course of the next fifteen years since we only have five minutes it 's better that we have a fast and simpler way
you get a mouth this is a person
this is a tree tree this is
a person if someone walks behind that is to follow as the old saying goes two is company three is a crowd
it 's burning for us the sun is the source of prosperity two suns together prosperous three together that 's sparkles put the sun and the moon shining together it 's brightness it also means tomorrow after a day and a night
