the slide show that i gave here two years ago about two thousand times i'm giving a short slide show this morning that i'm giving for the very first time
on our house and dug the geothermal wells and did all of that other stuff
but as important as it is to change the light bulbs it is more important to change the laws and when we in order
to be optimistic about this we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy in
many years ago when i was a young congressman i spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge of nuclear arms control the nuclear arms race and the military historians taught me during that quest
that military conflicts are typically put into three categories
put into three categories local battles
local battles regional or theater wars
and the rare but all important global world war
a different organizational model environmental challenges fall into the same three categories and most of what we think about are local environmental problems air pollution water pollution hazardous waste dumps
but there are also regional environmental problems like acid rain from the midwest to the northeast and from western europe to the arctic and
not because venus is slightly closer to the sun it's three times hotter than mercury which is right next to the
you've seen this slide before but there's a change
the only two countries that didn't ratify and now there's only one
heard a couple of days ago about the value of
about the value of have to somehow understand
that history has presented us with a choice
figuring out how to save her life while she was distracted
by the amazing experience that she was going through
we now have a culture of distraction
but we have a planetary emergency
and we have to find a way
to create in the generation of those alive today a sense of generational mission i wish i could find the words to convey this
this was another hero generation
that brought democracy to the planet another that ended slavery
another that ended slavery we can do this
we can do this have the capacity
at moments of great challenge
to set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge that history is presenting to us sometimes i hear people
by saying oh this is so terrible
what a burden we have
i would like to ask you to re frame that had the opportunity
to rise to a challenge
that is worthy of our best efforts
challenge that can pull from us
more than we knew we could do
i think we ought to approach this challenge with a sense of profound joy and gratitude
that we are the generation
about which a thousand years from now and poets and singers
will celebrate by saying they were the ones
so many people at ted there is deep pain that basically a design issue at the end of the day a design issue on a voting form
one bad design issue meant that your voice wasn't being heard like that in the last eight years in a position where you could make these things come true you have no idea
when you look at what the leading candidates in your own party are doing now i mean
are you excited by their plans on global
the answer to the question is hard for me because on the one hand i think that we should feel
really great about the fact that the
and forward leaning position on the climate crisis all three have offered leadership and all three are very different from the approach taken by the current administration
and i think that all three have also been responsible in putting forward plans and proposals the
campaign dialogue that as illustrated by the questions that was put together by the league of conservation voters by the way the analysis of all the questions
and by the way the debates have all been sponsored by something that goes by the orwellian label clean coal
every single debate has been sponsored by clean coal now even lower emissions
the richness and fullness of the dialogue in our democracy has not laid the basis for the kind of bold
that is really needed so they're saying the right things and they may whichever of them is elected may do the right thing but let me tell you
only one out of one hundred senators was willing to vote to confirm to ratify that treaty
to ratify that treaty whatever the candidates say
has to be laid alongside what the people say
this challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization co two is the exhaling breath of our civilization literally
and now we mechanized that process changing that pattern requires a scope
a scale a speed of change that is beyond what we have done in the past so that's why i began by saying
be optimistic in what you do but be an active citizen demand change the light bulbs but change the laws
change the global treaties we have to speak up we have to solve this democracy
this we have sclerosis in our democracy and we have to change that use the internet go on the internet
connect with people become very active as citizens have a moratorium we shouldn 't have any new
we have to quickly build these renewable sources now nobody is talking on that scale but i do believe that between now and november it is possible this alliance for climate protection
launch a nationwide campaign grassroots mobilization television ads internet ads radio newspaper with partnerships with everybody from the girl scouts to the hunters and fishermen we need help
your own personal role going forward al is there something more than that you would like to be doing i have prayed that
would be able to find the answer
it does depend on all of us but again not just with the light bulbs most of us here
most of us here are americans
are americans we have a democracy
we can change things but we have to actively change what's needed really is
a higher level of consciousness
and that's hard to that's hard to create but it is coming
if you want to go far go together
we have to go far
thank you so much for coming to ted i have given
