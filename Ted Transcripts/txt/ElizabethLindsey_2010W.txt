i was raised by native hawaiian elders
three old women who took care of me while my parents worked
the year is one thousand nine hundred and sixty three
and the shifting of the tides it 's a stretch of beach we know so well the smooth stones on the sand
if you saw these women on the street
in their faded clothes you might dismiss them as poor and simple
that would be a mistake
these women are descendants of polynesian navigators
trained in the old ways by their elders
and now they 're passing it on to me
they teach me the names of the winds and the rains of astronomy according to a genealogy of stars
there 's a new moon on the horizon hawaiians say it 's a good night for fishing they begin to chant
they sit in a circle
and ask me to come to join them
they want to teach me about my destiny
i thought every seven year old went through
people will forget their wisdom
it will take elders voices from the far corners of the world
to call the world into balance
you will go far away
it will sometimes be a lonely road we will not be there
but you will look into the eyes of seeming strangers
the year is two thousand and seven
i 'm on a remote island in micronesia by one mile wide
he 's also considered the greatest wave finder in the world
there are fewer than a handful of palu left on this island
their tradition is so extraordinary that these mariners sailed
three million square miles across the pacific without the use of instruments
they could synthesize patterns in nature using the rising and setting of stars the sequence and direction of waves
the flight patterns of certain birds even the slightest hint of color on the underbelly of a cloud would inform them and help them navigate with the keenest accuracy
when western scientists would join mau on the canoe and watch him go into the hull it appeared that an old man was going to rest
in fact the hull of the canoe is the womb of the vessel it is the most accurate place to feel the rhythm and sequence and direction of waves
it 's what he had been trained to do since he was five years old
now science may dismiss this methodology
but polynesian navigators use it today because it provides them
an accurate determination of the angle and direction of their vessel
the palu also had an uncanny ability to forecast weather conditions days in advance sometimes i 'd be with mau on a cloud covered night and we 'd sit at the easternmost coast of the island and he would look out
their achievements intellectually and scientifically are extraordinary and they are so relevant for these times that we are in when we are riding out storms
we are in such a critical moment of our collective history
they have been compared to astronauts
these elder navigators who sail vast open oceans in double hulled canoes
thousands of miles from a small island their canoes
we cannot afford to lose it
the year is two thousand and ten
just as the women in hawaii
that raised me predicted the world is in trouble
we live in a society bloated with data yet starved for wisdom
we 're connected twenty four seven
fear depression and loneliness is at an all time high we must course
your society worships the jester
while the king stands in plain clothes
the link between the past and the future is fragile
this i know intimately because even as i travel throughout the world
to listen to these stories and record them
by the fact that i no longer
remember the names of the winds and i am reminded
that throughout the world there are cultures with vast sums of knowledge in them
as potent as the micronesian navigators
that are going dismissed that this is a testament to brilliant
brilliant technology and science and wisdom
that is vanishing rapidly because when an elder dies a library is burned and throughout the world libraries are ablaze
and i realize through a lesson that he shared
that we continue to find our way and this is what he said
the island is the canoe
the canoe the island and what he meant was
if you are voyaging and far from home
your very survival depends on everyone aboard
you cannot make the voyage alone you were never meant to
this whole notion of every man for himself is completely unsustainable it always true navigation
begins in the human heart
