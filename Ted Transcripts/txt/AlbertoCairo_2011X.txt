my job is to make arms and legs well it 's not completely true we do more than that
we provide the patients the afghan disabled first with the physical rehabilitation then with the social reintegration it 's a very logical plan
quite many years for the program to become what it is now today i would like to tell you a story the story of a big change and the story of the people who made this change possible
and then not only for war victims but it was for any kind of patient i was also working in the orthopedic center we call it this is the place where we make the legs at that time
i found myself in a strange situation i felt not quite ready for that job there was so much to learn
there were so many things new to me but it was a terrific job but as soon as the fighting intensified the physical rehabilitation was suspended there were many other things to do
so the orthopedic center was closed because physical rehabilitation was not considered a priority
it was a strange sensation
and the orthopedic center was closed i was assigned to work for the homeless for the internally
i wanted to go home i was driving you know when you want to forget you don 't want to see things so you just want to go to your room to lock yourself inside and say that 's enough
a bomb fell not far from my car
everybody disappeared from the street the cars disappeared as well i ducked and only one figure remained in the middle of the road it was a man in a wheelchair
the man was without legs and only with one arm
so i took him into a safe place and i ask what are you doing out in the street in this situation i work he said i wondered what work
and then i ask an even more stupid question why don 't you have the prostheses why don 't you have the artificial legs
the center is closed no staff around maybe the machinery is broken who is going to make the legs for him so i hoped that he would not come this is the streets of kabul
i was ready to tell him listen if someone such and such comes tomorrow please tell him that it was a mistake nothing can be done
give him some money but mahmoud and his son were already there and they were not alone there were fifteen maybe twenty people like him waiting and there was some staff too
among them there was my right hand man najmuddin and the gatekeeper told me they come everyday to see if the center will open
but najmuddin told me listen now we 're here at least we can start repairing the prostheses the broken prostheses of the people and maybe try to do something for
people like mahmoud i said no please we cannot do that it 's really dangerous we have other things to do but they insisted when you have twenty people in front of you looking at you and you are the one who has to decide
so we started doing some repairs also one of the physical therapists reported that mahmoud could be provided with a leg but not immediately the legs were swollen and the knees were stiff so he needed a long preparation
i told them listen we are going to start a couple of hours per day just a few repairs maybe some of them are here now
so we started i was working i was going everyday to work for the homeless
a couple of times i crossed the front line in the very place where mahmoud and his son were crossing i tell you it was something so sinister
i was astonished he could do it every day
we could not possibly stay indoors with all these sandbags at the windows very sad dark so we chose a small spot in the garden
they started fighting two groups of mujahideen started fighting we could hear in the air the bullets passing so we dashed all of us towards the shelter
but we managed to reach the shelter inside all of us panting i sat a moment and i heard rafi telling his father father you can run faster than me
i can run and now you can go to school no need of staying with me all the day pushing my wheelchair
later on we took them home
and i will never forget mahmoud and his son walking together pushing the empty wheelchair and then i understood physical rehabilitation is a priority dignity cannot wait for better times
i met mahmoud one year later he was in good shape a bit thinner
thank you very much now help me not to be a beggar anymore that was the job
my children are growing i feel ashamed i don 't want them to be
teased at school by the other students he read my mind
and he said i ask for a job and then he added something i will never forget for the rest of my life he said i am a scrap of a man
but if you help me i 'm ready to do anything even if i have to crawl on the ground
and then he sat down i sat down too with goosebumps everywhere
legless with only one arm illiterate
unskilled what job for him
glue and to screw the sole of the feet we need to increase the production
excuse me i could not believe
and then he said no we can modify the workbench maybe to put a special stool a special anvil special vice and maybe an electric screwdriver
it 's cruel to offer him a job knowing that he 's going to fail but with najmuddin we cannot discuss so
the only things i could manage to obtain was a kind of a
i told najmuddin that 's a trick i can 't believe it the production was up twenty percent it 's a trick it 's a trick i said
and then i asked for verification it was true the comment of najmuddin was mahmoud has something to prove i understood that i was wrong again mahmoud had looked taller i remember him sitting behind the workbench
of course i understood that what made him stand tall yeah they were the legs thank you very much but as a first step it was the dignity he has regained his full dignity thanks to that job
and you know what it 's good for everybody everybody benefits from that
those employed of course because they get a job
and dignity but also for the newcomers they are seven thousand every year people coming for the first time and you should see the faces of these people when they realize that those assisting them are like them sometimes you see them they look
and you see the faces and then the surprise turns into hope and it 's easy for me as well to train someone
and when you start changing you cannot stop so
it is possible and it is not difficult all we have to do is to listen to the people that we are supposed assist to make them part
well now you should see me i never miss a single training session the night before a match i 'm very nervous and you should see me during the match i shout like a true italian
that was my story thank you very much
