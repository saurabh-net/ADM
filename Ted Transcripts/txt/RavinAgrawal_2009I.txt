right now is the most exciting time to see new indian art contemporary artists in india are having a conversation with the world like never before
i thought it might be interesting even for the many long time collectors here with us at ted local collectors to have an outside view of ten young indian artists i wish everyone at ted
first is bharti kher the central motif of bharti 's practice is the ready made store
that untold millions of indian women apply to their foreheads every day in an act closely associated with the institution of marriage
but originally the significance of the bindi is to symbolize the third eye between the spiritual world and the religious world
she also creates life size fiberglass sculptures often of animals which she then completely covers in
often with potent symbolism she says she first got started with ten packets of bindis and then wondered what she could do with ten thousand
our next artist balasubramaniam really stands at the crossroads of sculpture painting and installation working wonders with fiberglass
these comics are a fundamental way that children especially in the diaspora learn their religious and mythological folk tales i for one was steeped in these
jitish kallat successfully practices across photography sculpture painting and installation as you can see he 's heavily influenced by graffiti and street art
he also creates phantasmagoric sculptures made of bones from cast resin here he envisions the carcass of an autorickshaw he once witnessed burning in a riot
this next artist n s harsha actually has a studio right here in mysore he 's putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition he creates this fine delicate images which he then repeats on a massive scale
he uses scale to more and more spectacular effect whether on the roof of a temple in singapore
or in his increasingly ambitious installation work here with one hundred and ninety two functioning sewing machines fabricating the flags of every member of the united nations
mumbai based dhruvi acharya builds on her love of comic books and street art to comment on the roles and expectations of modern indian women she too mines the rich source material of amar chitra kathas but in a very different way than chitra ganesh
in this particular work she actually strips out the images and leaves the actual text to reveal something previously unseen and
is kolkata born kashmir raised and london trained he too is reinventing the miniature tradition
he creates these opulent tableaus inspired by hieronymus bosch but also by the kashmiri textiles of his youth
he actually applies metallic industrial paints to his work using porcupine quills to get this rich detailed effect
kind of cheating with this next artist since raqs media collective are really three artists working together raqs are probably the foremost practitioners of multimedia art in india today working across photography video and
this next artist is probably the alpha male of contemporary indian art subodh gupta he was first known for creating giant photo realistic canvases paintings of everyday objects the stainless steel kitchen vessels and tiffin containers
known to every indian he celebrates these local and mundane objects globally and on a grander and grander scale by incorporating them into ever more colossal sculptures and installations
these are actually wires wrapped in muslin and steeped in vegetable dye and she arranges them so that the viewer actually has to navigate through the space and interact with the objects and light and shadow are a very important part of her work
she also explores themes of consumerism and the environment such as in this work where these basket like objects look organic and woven and are woven but with the strips of steel salvaged from cars that she found in a bangalore junkyard
ten artists six minutes i know that was a lot to take in but i can only hope i've whet your appetite to go out and see and learn more about the amazing things that are happening in art in india today thank you very much for looking and listening
