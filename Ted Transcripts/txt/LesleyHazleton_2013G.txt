is a strange thing to do it 's a journey into the foreign territory of somebody else 's life
five years ago for instance i found myself waking each morning in misty seattle to what i knew was an impossible question
what actually happened one desert night half the world and almost half of history away what happened that is on the night in the year six hundred and ten when muhammad received the first revelation of the koran on a mountain just outside mecca
this is the core mystical moment of islam and as such of course it defies empirical analysis yet the question wouldn 't let go of me
and i plead guilty as charged because all exploration physical or intellectual is inevitably in some sense an act of transgression of crossing boundaries
still some boundaries are larger than others
so a human encountering the divine as muslims believe muhammad
there were no choirs of angels no music of the spheres no elation no ecstasy no golden aura surrounding him no sense of an absolute fore ordained role as the messenger of god
that is he did none of the things that might make it easy to cry foul to put down the whole story as a pious fable quite the contrary
in his own reported words he was convinced at first that what had happened couldn 't have been real
in fact he was so sure that he could only be majnun possessed by a jinn that when he found himself still alive his first
impulse was to finish the job himself to leap off the highest cliff and escape the terror of what he 'd experienced by putting an end to all experience
so the man who fled down the mountain that night trembled not with joy but with a stark primordial
and that panicked disorientation that sundering of everything familiar that daunting awareness of something beyond human comprehension
this might be somewhat difficult to grasp now that we use the word awesome to describe a new app or a viral video with the exception perhaps of a massive earthquake we 're protected from real awe we close the doors and hunker down convinced that we 're in control
or at least hoping for control we do our best to ignore the fact that we don 't always have it and that not everything can be explained yet whether you 're a rationalist or a mystic
whether you think the words muhammad heard that night came from inside himself or from outside what 's clear is that he did experience them
and that he did so with a force that would shatter his sense of himself and his world and transform this otherwise modest man into a radical advocate for social and economic
justice fear was the only sane response the only human response
too human for some like conservative muslim theologians who maintain that the account of his wanting to kill himself shouldn 't even be mentioned despite the fact that it 's in the earliest islamic biographies
they insist that he never doubted for even a single moment let alone despaired demanding perfection
they refuse to tolerate human imperfection yet what exactly is imperfect about doubt because doubt is essential
if this seems a startling idea at first consider that doubt as graham greene once put it is
the heart of the matter abolish all doubt and what 's left is not faith but absolute heartless conviction
you 're certain that you possess the truth inevitably offered with an implied uppercase t
in short the arrogance of fundamentalism
it has to be one of the multiple ironies of history that a favorite expletive of muslim fundamentalists is the same one once used by the christian fundamentalists known as crusaders
they found the perfect antidote to thought and the ideal refuge of the hard demands of real faith they don 't have to struggle for it like jacob wrestling through the night with the angel or like jesus in his forty days and nights in the wilderness or like muhammad not only that night on the mountain but throughout his years as a prophet
and yet we the vast and still far too silent majority have ceded the public arena to this extremist minority
we 've allowed judaism to be claimed by violently messianic west bank settlers christianity by homophobic hypocrites and misogynistic bigots islam by suicide
it involves an ongoing struggle a continual questioning of what we think we know a wrestling with issues and ideas it goes hand in hand with doubt in a never ending conversation with it and sometimes
in conscious defiance of it and this conscious defiance is why i as an agnostic can still have faith
i have faith for instance that peace in the middle east is possible despite the ever accumulating mass of evidence to the contrary
i 'm not convinced of this i can hardly say i believe it i can only have faith in it commit myself that is to the idea of it
and i do this precisely because of the temptation to throw up my hands in resignation and retreat into silence because despair
in fact most of us do whether we 're atheist or theist or anywhere in between or beyond for that matter
we insist on faith in the future and in each other
call it impossibly idealistic if you must but one thing is sure call it human
could muhammad have so radically changed his world without such faith without the refusal to cede to the arrogance of closed minded certainty i think not
he 'd be torn apart by the bitter divisiveness of sectarianism
he 'd call out terrorism for what it is not only criminal but an obscene travesty of everything he believed in and struggled
and he 'd commit himself fully to the hard and thorny process
