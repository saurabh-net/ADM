and i come from a slightly different point of view i've been watching since i grew up the expressions of truth and beauty
in the arts and truth and beauty in the sciences and while these are both wonderful things in their own right they both have very wonderful things going for them truth and beauty
as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences and by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twins that a scientist would want to date are expressions of
as awe ful things by meaning they are things you can worship they are ideals that are powerful they are irreducible they are unique they are useful sometimes often a long time after the fact
and you can actually roll some of the pictures now because i don't want to look at me on the screen
truth and beauty are things that are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences they are things that describe
beauty in a way that is often only accessible if you understand the language and the syntax
of the person who studies the subject in which truth and beauty is expressed if you look at the math e equal mc squared if you look at the cosmological constant
where there's an anthropic ideal where you see that life had to evolve from the numbers that describe the universe
these are things that are really difficult to understand and what i've tried to do since i had my training as a medical illustrator since i was taught animation by my father who was a sculptor and my visual mentor
i wanted to figure out a way to help people understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences
by using animation by using pictures by telling stories so that the things that are not necessarily evident to people they learn is
drawn down to the point where the truth and beauty are not always evident it's almost like that old recipe for chicken soup where you boil the chicken until the flavor is just
want to do that to our students so we have an opportunity to really open up education and i had a telephone call
from robert lue at harvard in the molecular and cellular biology department a couple of years ago he asked me if my team and i would be interested and willing to
really change how medical and scientific education is done at harvard so we embarked on a project that would explore the cell that would
that they could hang all of these facts on they could have a mental image of the cell as a large bustling
hugely complicated city that's occupied by micro machines and these micro machines really are at the heart of life these micro machines which are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over are
powerful precise accurate devices that are made out of strings of amino acids and these micro machines
power how a cell moves they power how a cell replicates they power our hearts they power
minds and so what we wanted to do was to figure out how we could make this story into an animation that would be the center piece of biovisions at harvard
which is a website that harvard has for its molecular and cellular biology students that will
in addition to all the textual information in addition to all the didactics stuff put everything together visually so that these students would have an internalized view of what a cell really is in all of its truth and beauty
and be able to study with this view in mind so that their imaginations would be sparked so that their passions would be sparked and so that they would be able to go on and use these visions in their head
to make new discoveries and to be able to find out really how life works so we set out by looking at
how these molecules are put together
we worked with a theme which is you've got
and they are given this information that there's an inflammation somewhere outside where they can't see and sense but they get the information that causes them to stop
causes them to internalize that they need to make all of the various parts that will cause them to change their shape
and try to get out of
and find out what's going on so these molecular motors we had to work with the harvard scientists and
models of the atomically accurate molecules and figure out how they moved and figure out what they did and figure out how to do this in a way
that was truthful in that it imparted what was going on but not so truthful that the compact crowding in a cell would
it's an ongoing project that's going to go another four or five years and i want you to look at this and
see the paths that the cell manufactures these little walking machines they're called kinesins that take these huge loads that would challenge an ant in relative size run the movie please
but these machines that power the inside of the cells are really quite amazing and they really are the basis of all life because all of these machines
interact with each other they pass information to each other they cause different things to happen inside the cell and the cell will actually
no life from the smallest life to everybody here would be possible without these little micro machines in fact it would really in the absence of these machines have made the attendance here chris really quite sparse
this is the fedex delivery guy of the cell
this little guy is called the kinesin and he pulls a sack that's full of brand new manufactured proteins to wherever it's needed in the cell
whether it's to a membrane whether it's to an organelle whether it's to build something or repair something and each of us
has about one hundred thousand of these things running around right now inside each one of your one hundred trillion cells so no matter how lazy you feel you're not really intrinsically doing nothing
so what i want you to do when you go home is think about this and think about how powerful our cells are and think about some of the things that
we're learning about cellular mechanics once we figure out all that's going on and believe me we know almost a percent of what's going on
once we figure out what's going on we're really going to be able to have a lot of control over what we do with our health with what we do with
future generations how long we're going to live and hopefully we'll be able to use this to discover more truth and more beauty these cells
these cells these micro machines
aware enough of what the cell needs that they do their bidding they work together they make the cell do what it needs to do and a medical illustrator
