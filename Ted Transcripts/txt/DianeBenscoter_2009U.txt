my journey to coming here today
i was seventeen and going on a peace walk what i didn't know though was most of those people standing there with me were moonies and
a week i had come to believe
that the second coming of christ had occurred that it was sun myung moon and that i had been specially chosen and prepared by god
now as cool as that sounds my family was not that thrilled with this
and they tried everything they could to get me out of there there was an underground railroad of sorts that was going on during those years maybe some of you remember it they were called deprogrammers and after about
five long years my family had me deprogrammed and i then became a deprogrammer
i started going out on cases and after about five years of doing i was arrested for kidnapping
most of the cases i went out on were called involuntary what happened was that the family had to get their loved ones some safe place somehow
and so they took them to some safe place and we would come in and talk to them usually for about a week
and so after happened i decided it was a good time to turn my back on this work and about twenty years went by
and so i decided to write a book a memoir about this decade of my life
and toward the end of writing that
book there was a documentary that came out it was on jonestown
and it had a chilling effect
these are the dead in jonestown about nine hundred people died that day most of them taking their own lives
women gave poison to their babies and watched foam come from their mouths as they died
the top picture is a group of moonies that have been blessed by their messiah their mates were chosen for them
this is the leg of a suicide bomber
the thing i had to admit to myself with great repulsion
was that i get it i understand how this could happen i understand
how someone 's brain how someone 's mind can come to the place where it makes sense in fact it would be wrong when your brain is working like that not to try to save the world through genocide
and so what is this how does this work and how i've come to view what happened to me is a viral memetic infection
for those of you who aren't familiar with memetics a meme has been defined as an idea that replicates in the human brian and moves from brain to brain like a virus
much like a virus the way a virus works is
it can infect and do the most damage to someone who has a compromised immune system
and i was pretty lost in my world i was really idealistic
these easy ideas to complex questions are very appealing when you are emotionally vulnerable what happens is that circular logic takes over moon is one with
fix all this it becomes impenetrable
the most dangerous part of this
is that is creates us and them
right and wrong good and evil
and it makes anything possible makes anything rationalizable
and the thing is though if you looked at my brain
during those years in the moonies neuroscience is expanding exponentially as ray kurzweil said yesterday science is expanding we're beginning to look inside the brain
and so if you looked at my brain or any brain that's infected with a viral memetic infection like this and compared it to anyone in this room or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis i am convinced it would look very very different
and that strange as it may sound gives me hope
the reason that gives me hope is that the first thing is to admit that we have a problem
but it's a human problem it's a scientific problem if you will it happens in the human brain there is no evil force out there to get us
and so this is something that through research and education i believe that we can solve and so
and so is to realize
that we can do this together and that there is no us and them thank you very much
