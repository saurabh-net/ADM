with troops stationed around the world i 'm really honored to be here today
when i look around this tedxamsterdam venue i see a very special audience you are the reason why i said yes to the invitation to come here today
when i look around i see people who want to make a contribution i see people who want to make a better world by doing groundbreaking scientific work by creating impressive works of art
by writing critical articles or inspiring books
by starting up sustainable businesses and you all have chosen your own instruments
to fulfill this mission of creating a better world some chose the microscope ladies and gentlemen
i did not choose to take up
the pen the brush the camera i chose this instrument i chose the gun for you
and you heard already being so close to this gun may make you feel uneasy
it may even feel scary a real gun at a few feet 's distance let us stop for a moment and feel this uneasiness you could even hear it let us cherish the fact
it means soldiers are not needed to patrol our streets guns are not a part of our lives in many countries it is a different story in many countries
people are confronted with guns they are oppressed they are intimidated by warlords by terrorists by criminals weapons can do a lot of harm they are the cause of much distress
why then am i standing before you with this weapon why did i choose the gun as my instrument today i want to tell you why today i want to tell you why i chose the gun to create a better world
in the east of the netherlands the city where i was born my father
my father was a hardworking baker
but when he had finished work in the bakery he often told me and my brother stories and most of the time he told me this story i 'm going to share with you now the story of what happened when he was a conscripted soldier
in the dutch armed forces at the beginning of the second world war the nazis invaded the netherlands their grim plans were evident they meant to rule by means of repression diplomacy had failed to stop the germans only brute force
on the bank of the river waal
he fired nothing happened he fired again no german soldier fell to the ground
my father had been given an old gun that could not even reach the opposite riverbank
hitler 's troops marched on
he could have done something but with an old gun not even the best marksman in the armed forces could have hit the mark
so this story stayed with me then in high school i was gripped by the stories of the allied soldiers soldiers who left the safety of their own homes and risked their lives to liberate a country
and a people that they didn 't know they liberated my birth town it was then that i decided
i would take up the gun out of respect and gratitude for those men and women who came to liberate us
from the awareness that sometimes only the gun can stand between good and evil and that
to defend democratic values to stand up for the freedom we have
to talk here today in amsterdam about how we can make the world a better place
i do not like guns
and once you have been under fire yourself it brings home even more clearly that a gun is not some macho instrument to brag about i stand here today to tell you about the use of the gun as an instrument
of peace and stability the gun may be one of the most important instruments of peace and stability that we have in this world
now this may sound contradictory to you
since the end of the cold war statistics show that we are living in a relatively peaceful era
why why has violence decreased has the human mind changed well we were talking on the human mind this morning did we simply lose our beastly impulses for revenge
for violent rituals for pure rage or is there something else
in his latest book harvard professor steven pinker
such a state monopoly on violence first of all serves as a reassurance
it removes the incentive for an arms race between potentially hostile groups in our societies
secondly the presence of penalties that outweigh the benefits of using violence tips the balance even further abstaining from violence becomes more profitable than starting a war
with trade there 's mutual interdependency and mutual gain between parties and when there is mutual gain both sides stand to lose more than they would gain if they started a war
this ladies and gentlemen is the rationale behind the existence
of my armed forces the armed forces implement the state monopoly on violence we do this in a legitimized way only after our democracy has asked us to do so
it is this legitimate controlled use of the gun that has contributed greatly to the statistics of war conflict and violence around the globe
my soldiers use the gun as an instrument of peace and this is exactly why failed states are so dangerous failed states have no legitimized democratically controlled use of force
failed states do not know of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability
that is why failed states can drag down a whole region into chaos and conflict that is why spreading the concept of the constitutional state is such an important aspect
of our foreign missions that is why we are trying to build a judicial system right now in afghanistan that is why we train police officers we train judges we train public prosecutors around the world and that is why
and in the netherlands we are very unique in that
ladies and gentlemen looking at this gun we are confronted with the ugly side of the human mind
every day i hope that politicians diplomats development workers can turn conflict into peace and threat into hope and i hope that one day armies can be disbanded
and humans will find a way of living together without violence and oppression
but until that day comes we will have to make ideals and human failure meet somewhere in the middle
until that day comes i stand for my father who tried to shoot the nazis with an old gun i stand for my men and women
who are prepared to risk their lives for a less violent world for all of us i stand for this soldier
who suffered partial hearing loss and sustained permanent injuries to her leg which was hit
by a rocket on a mission in afghanistan ladies and gentlemen
until the day comes when we can do away with the gun often behind the scenes
it takes good equipment and well trained dedicated soldiers
instead of the bad gun my father was given i hope you will support our soldiers when they are out there when they come home
and when they are injured and need our care they put their lives on the line for us for you and we cannot let them down i hope you will respect
my soldiers this soldier with this gun because she wants a better world because she makes an active contribution to the better world just like all of us here today thank you very much of the netherlands
