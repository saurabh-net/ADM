i wanted to share with you today is my challenge as an iranian artist
as an iranian woman artist
as an iranian woman artist living in exile
if you 're living outside like me
psychological and political space to distance ourselves from the reality
herself also in the position of being the voice the speaker of my people even if i have indeed no access to my own country
we are there to take pride and insist our atrocious government
because we are considered as artists central to the cultural political social discourse in iran
we are there to inspire to provoke to mobilize
to provoke to mobilize to bring hope
to bring hope art is our weapon
culture is a form of resistance
i envy sometimes the artists of the west
for their freedom of expression
for the fact that they can distance themselves from the question of politics
but also i worry about the west
and culture is beyond communication
my journey as an artist started from a very very personal place
i did not start to make social commentary about my country
i was facing my own personal dilemmas and questions i became immersed in the study of the islamic revolution
the political transformation so in a way by studying a woman you can read the structure and the ideology of the country so i made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse the subject
of love of god faith but violence and crime and cruelty
of the government or the ideology of the islamic revolution
and i fell into a life in exile
who are all looking for an idea of change freedom and democracy while the country of iran equally as if another character also struggled for an idea of freedom and democracy and independence from the foreign interventions
about our history as a country
by the american government by the british government
in the way we had intellectual life
and most of all in the way that we fought for democracy
these are some of the shots actually from my film
these are some of the images and the characters of the film what is unbelievably ironic
i then discovered why i take so much inspiration from iranian women
i stand here to say that iranian women have found a new voice
and their voice is giving me my voice
