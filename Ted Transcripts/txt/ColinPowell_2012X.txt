this was last wednesday afternoon at a school in brooklyn new york at cristo rey high school run by the jesuits
and i was talking to this group of students and take a look at them
they were around me in three directions you 'll noticed that almost all of them are minority
you 'll notice that the building is rather austere it 's an old new york school building nothing fancy they still have old blackboards and whatnot
twenty two people are graduating and all twenty two are going to college
they all come from homes where there is for the most part just one
person in the home usually the mother or the grandmother and that 's it and they come here for their education and for their structure now i had this picture taken and it was put up on my facebook page last week and somebody wrote in
why does he have him standing at attention like that
and then they said but he looks good
and the trick i play in all of my school appearances is that when i get through with my little homily to the kids
i then invite them to ask questions and when they raise their hands i say come up and i make them come up and stand in front of me i make them stand at attention like a soldier
this young man his name is his last name cruz he loved it that 's all over his facebook page and it 's gone viral
people think i 'm being unkind to this kid no we 're having a little fun and the thing about it i 've done this for years environment of structure
environment of structure put them in ranks
and telling them to do all kinds of awful things
but then the most amazing thing happens over time
once that structure is developed once they understand the reason for something
once they understand mama ain 't here
but you 'd be amazed at what you can do with them once you put them in that structure in eighteen weeks they have a skill they are mature
and you know what they come to admire the drill sergeant and they never forget the drill sergeant
they come to respect him and so we need more of this kind of
structure and respect in the lives of our children
that isn 't the whole answer
it 's part of the answer but the real answer begins with bringing a child to the school with structure in that child 's heart and soul to begin with
when does the learning process begin does it begin in first grade no no it begins the first time a child in a mother 's arms
looks up at the mother and says oh this must be my mother she 's the one who feeds me
oh yeah when i don 't feel so good down there she takes care of me it 's her language i will learn
and at that moment they shut out all the other languages that they could be learning at that age but by three months
you are different from every other child in the world
and we 're going to read to you
and i watched my own young grandchildren now come along and they 're much to the distress of my children they are we need preschool
we need preschool we need head start
we need head start we need prenatal care
the education process begins even before the child is born and then they realize
and by the third grade the kids who didn 't have that structure
and minding in the beginning
i was privileged to have that kind of good start i was not a great student i was a public school kid in new york city and i didn 't do well at all i have my entire new york city board of education transcript from kindergarten through college i wanted it when i was writing my first book
i wanted to see if my memory was correct and my god it was straight c everywhere
and i finally bounced through high school got into the city college of new york with a seventy eight point three average which i shouldn 't have been allowed in with and then i started out in engineering and that only lasted six months laughter and then i went into geology rocks for jocks this is easy and then i found rotc
and when you find those two things together man you got it that 's what 's going on and that 's what i found
now the authorities at ccny were getting tired of me being there i 'd been there four and a half going on five years and my grades were not doing particularly well
and lo and behold many years later i 'm considered one of the greatest sons the city college of new york has ever had
country that no matter where you start you have opportunities so long as you believe in yourself
you believe in the society and the country and you believe
but it begins with the gift of a good start at the earliest age
we 're going to be running into difficulties
it 's why we have a dropout rate of roughly twenty five percent overall and almost fifty percent of our minority population living in low income areas
because they 're not getting the gift of a good start
my gift of a good start was not only being in a nice family a good family but having a family that said to me now listen
we came to this country in banana boats
we worked like dogs down in the garment industry every single day
and don 't even think about dropping out
if i had ever gone home and told those immigrant people
they had expectations for all of the cousins and the extended
family of immigrants that lived in the south bronx
but they had more than just expectations for
they stuck into our hearts like a dagger a sense of shame
don 't you shame this family
sometimes i would get in trouble and my parents were coming home and i was in my room waiting for what 's going to happen and i would sit there saying to myself okay look take the belt and hit me but god don 't give me that shame the family bit again it devastated me when my mother did that to me
and i also had this extended network children need a network children need to be part of a tribe a family a community
in my case it was aunts who lived in all of these tenement buildings i don 't know how many of you are new yorkers but there were these tenement buildings and these women were always hanging out one of the windows leaning on a pillow they never left
and they didn 't care whether you became
and they never expected any generals in the family
as long as you got an education and then you got a job culture back into our
culture back into our families all families
and it is so important that all of you here today who are successful people
and i 'm sure have wonderful families and children and grandchildren it 's not enough you 've got to reach out and back and find kids like mr cruz
if you work with your school system make sure it 's the best school system and not just your kid 's school but the school uptown in harlem not just downtown montessori on the west side
those that we call minorities now are going to be the majority
and we have to make sure that they are ready to be the majority we have to make sure they 're ready to be the leaders of this great country of ours
a country that is like no other
a country that amazes me every single day a country that 's fractious we 're always arguing with each other that 's how the system 's supposed to work it 's a country of such contrasts but it 's a nation of nations we touch every nation every nation touches us
we are a nation of immigrants that 's why we need sound immigration policy
or we can send back home with an education to help their people rise up out of poverty
and get a hot dog from the immigrant pushcart peddler
gotta have a dirty water dog
and no matter where i am or what i 'm doing i 've got to do that
walking up the street and i would hit around fifty fifth street looking for the immigrant pushcart
in those days i had five bodyguards around me
i 've got no bodyguards i 've got no police cars i 've got nothing but i gotta have my hot dog
i did it just last week it was on a tuesday evening
down by columbus circle and the scene repeats itself so often
but now i 'm an american sir thank you
so we are still that magnificent country but we are fueled by young people coming up from every land in the world
and it is our obligation as contributing citizens to this wonderful country of ours to make sure that no child gets left behind thank you very much
