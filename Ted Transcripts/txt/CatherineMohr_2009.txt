talk about surgical robots is also a talk about surgery and while i've tried to make my images not too graphic keep in mind that surgeons have a different relationship with blood than normal people do
because after all what a surgeon does to a patient if it were done without consent would be a felony
surgeons are the tailors the plumbers the carpenters some would say the butchers of the medical world
cutting reshaping reforming bypassing fixing but you need to talk about
some kind of a perspective of where we are right now with surgical robots and where we're going to be going in the future i want to give you a little bit of perspective of how we got to this point
how we even came to believe that surgery was ok that this was something that was possible to do that this kind of cutting and reforming was ok so a little bit of perspective
about ten thousand years of perspective this is a trephanated skull
five to ten thousand years now imagine this you are a healer in a stone age village and you have some guy that you're not quite sure what's wrong with him oliver sacks is going to be born way in the future
he 's got some seizure disorder and you don't understand this but you think to yourself i 'm not quite sure what's wrong with this guy but maybe if i cut a hole in his head i can fix it
now that is surgical thinking now we've got the dawn of interventional surgery here what is astonishing about this is even though we don't know really how much of this was intended to be
and so what we are seeing is evidence of a refined technique that was being handed down over thousands and thousands of years
all over the world this arose independently at sites everywhere that had no communication to one another we really are seeing the dawn of interventional surgery
now we can fast forward many thousands of years into the bronze age and beyond and we see new refined tools coming out but surgeons in these eras are a little bit more conservative than their bold trephanating ancestors
these guys confined their surgery to fairly superficial injuries and surgeons were tradesmen rather than physicians
this persisted all the way into and through the renaissance that may have saved the writers but it didn't really save the surgeons terribly much they were still a mistrusted lot surgeons still had a bit of a pr problem
because we were in the age before anesthesia the agony of the patient is really as much of the public spectacle as the
surgery itself one of the most famous of these guys frere jacques shown here doing a lithotomy
the removal of the bladder stone one of the most invasive surgeries they did at the time had to take less than two minutes you had to have quite a flare for the dramatic and be really really quick and so here you see him doing a lithotomy
and he is credited with doing over four thousand of these public surgeries wandering around in europe which is an astonishing number when you think that surgery must have been a last resort i mean who would put themselves through that
until anesthesia the absence of sensation
this was truly a revolution in surgery but there was a pretty big problem with this after these very long painstaking operations attempting to cure things they'd never been able to touch before the patients died
they died of massive infection surgery didn't hurt anymore but it killed you pretty quickly
and infection would continue to claim a majority of surgical patients until the next big revolution in surgery which was the aseptic technique
joseph lister was asepis 's or sterility 's biggest advocate to a very very skeptical bunch of surgeons
and they said they had learned it was as important to wash your hands before doing surgery as it was to wash up afterwards
with the patient insensitive to pain and a sterile operating field
all bets were off the sky was the limit you could now start doing surgery the gut
on the liver on the heart on the brain transplantation you could take an organ out of one person you could put it in another person and it would
surgeons didn't have a problem with respectability anymore they had become gods the era of the big surgeon big incision had arrived
but at quite a cost because they are saving lives but not necessarily quality of life because healthy people
don't usually need surgery and unhealthy people have a very hard time recovering from a cut like that the question had to be asked well
can we do these same surgeries but through little incisions laparoscopy is doing this kind of surgery surgery with long instruments through small incisions
and it really changed the landscape of surgery some of the tools for this had been around for a hundred years but it had only been used as a diagnostic technique
until the nineteen eighties when there was changes in camera technologies and things like that that allowed this to be done for real operations
so what you see this is now the first surgical image as we're coming down the tube this is a new entry into the body it looks very different from what you're expecting surgery to look like
we bring instruments in from two separate cuts in the side and then you can start manipulating tissue
within ten years of the first gallbladder surgeries being done
a majority of gallbladder surgeries were being done laparoscopically truly
pretty big revolution but there were casualties of this revolution
these techniques were a lot harder to learn than people had anticipated the learning curve was very long and during that learning curve the complications went
quite a bit higher surgeons had to give up their three d vision they had to give up their wrists they had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments
has over three thousand hours of laparoscopic experience now this is a particularly frustrating placement of the needle but this is hard
and one of the reasons why it is so hard
is because the external ergonomics are terrible you've got these long instruments and you're working off your center line and the instruments are essentially working backwards
so what you need to do to take the capability of your hand and put it on the other side of that small incision is you need to put a
on that instrument and so i get to talk about robots the da vinci robot put just that wrist on the other side of that
and you can pass it all the way through and follow it in a trajectory and the reason why this becomes so much easier is you can see
the bottom the hands are making the motions and the instruments are following those motions exactly now what you put between
those instruments and those hands is a large fairly complicated robot the surgeon is sitting at a console and
which is a prostate deep in the pelvis and it requires fine dissection and
without cracking the chest this is all done in between the ribs and you can go inside the heart itself and repair the valves from the inside you've got these technologies
i talked about the large complicated robot with all its bells and whistles one of those robots will cost you about as much as a solid gold surgeon
but there are other barriers so something like a prostatectomy the prostate is small and it's in one spot and you can set your robot up very precisely to work in that one spot
but if you need to reach more places than just one you need to move the robot and you need to put some new incisions in there and you need to re set it up and you need to add some more ports and more
and the problem is it gets time consuming and cumbersome and for that reason there are many surgeries that just aren't being done with the da vinci so we had to ask the question well how do we fix that
what if we could change it so that we didn't have to re set up each time we wanted to move somewhere different what if we could bring all the instruments in together in one place how would that change the capabilities of the surgeon
and how would that change the experience for the patient now to do that we need to be able to bring a camera
and instruments in together through one small tube like that tube you saw in the laparoscopy video
or not so coincidentally like a tube like this
so what's going to come out of that tube is the debut of this new technology this new robot that is going to be able to reach anywhere
so here it comes this is the camera
it has to be able to come off of the center line and then be able to work back toward that center line he 's a cheeky little devil
but it's worth it for the freedom that this gives us as we're going around for the patient however
it's transparent this is all they're going to see
it's very exciting to think where we get to go with this
we get to write the script of the next revolution in surgery
as we take these capabilities and we get to
go to the next places we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be and i think to really get the rest of the way in that revolution
we need to not just take our hands in in new ways we also need to take our eyes in in new ways we need to see beyond the surface we need to be able to guide what we're cutting in a much better way
this is a cancer surgery one of the problems with this even for surgeons who 've been looking at this a lot is you can't see the cancer especially when it's hidden below the surface
go bind to the cancer and we can make those markers glow and we can take special cameras
and we can look at it now we know where we need to cut even when it's below the surface we can take these markers and we can inject them in a tumor site
we can inject these dyes into the bloodstream so that when we sew on a new vessel and we bypass a blockage on the heart
we can see if we actually made the connection before we close that patient back up again something that we haven't been able to do without radiation before we can light
and we don't even need to confine ourselves to this macro vision we have flexible microscopic probes that we can bring down into the body
and we can look at cells directly i'm looking at nerves here so these are nerves you see down on the bottom and the microscope probe that's being held by the robotic hand up at the top so this is all very prototypey at this point
but you care about nerves if you are a surgical patient because they let you keep continence bladder control and sexual function after surgery all of which is generally fairly important to the patient
so with the combination of these technologies we can reach it all and we can see it all we can
heal the disease and we can leave the patient whole and intact and functional afterwards
i've talked about the patient as if the patient is somehow someone abstract outside this room and that is not the case
many of you all of you maybe will at some point or have already faced a diagnosis of cancer or heart disease or some organ disfuction that's going to buy you a date with a surgeon
and when you get to that point
these maladies don't care how many books you've written how many companies you've started
that nobel prize you have yet to win how much time you planned to spend with your children these maladies come for us all
and the prospect i'm offering you of an easier surgery is that going to make that diagnosis any less terrifying
i'm not sure i really even want it to
because facing your own mortality causes a re evaluation of priorities
and a realignment of what your goals are in life unlike anything else and i would never want to deprive you of that epiphany what i want instead
is for you to be whole
intact and functional enough to go out and save the world
