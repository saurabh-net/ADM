once upon a time in nineteenth century germany there was the book
now during this time the book was the king of storytelling it was venerable it was ubiquitous but it was a little bit boring because in its four hundred years of existence storytellers never evolved the book as a storytelling device
but then one author arrived and he changed the game
he grabbed his pen he snatched his scissors this man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold as who else
the world 's first true inventor of the children 's pop up book
meggendorfer 's spirit when they moved
and things got a lot more fun when the internet came around
one taiwanese production studio would
and one man would tell the stories of his father by using a platform called twitter to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate
and after all this everyone paused they took a step
they 've gone from depicting hunting on cave walls to depicting
the art of storytelling has remained unchanged and for the most part the stories are recycled
but the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with pure consistent novelty
and they remembered a man one amazing german
every time a new storytelling device the lovely beautiful audience
