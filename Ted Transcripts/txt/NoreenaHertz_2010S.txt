monday morning in washington the president of the united states is sitting in the oval office assessing whether or not to strike al qaeda in yemen
standing at the door listening to her baby crying and crying trying to work out whether she should let it cry until it falls asleep or pick it up and hold it and i am sitting by my father 's bedside in hospital
trying to work out whether i should let him drink the one and a half liter bottle of water that his doctors just came in and said you must make him drink today my father 's been nil by mouth for a week
or whether by giving him this bottle i might actually kill him
we face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions we talk things over with our friends we scour the internet we search through books
especially when the stakes are high
and the decision really matters because in a world of data deluge and extreme complexity we believe that experts are more able to process information than we can that they are able to come to better conclusions than we could come to on our own
and in an age that is sometimes nowadays frightening
or confusing we feel reassured by the almost parental like authority of experts who tell us so clearly what it is we can and cannot do
but i believe that this is a big problem
a problem with potentially dangerous consequences for us as a society as a culture and as individuals it 's not that experts have not massively contributed to the world of course they have the problem lies with us
and in the process we have ceded our responsibility substituting our intellect and our intelligence for their supposed words of wisdom we 've surrendered our power trading off our discomfort with uncertainty
this is no exaggeration in a recent experiment a group of adults had their brains scanned in an mri machine as they were listening to experts speak the results were quite extraordinary
but experts do get things wrong
our wealth and our collective security it 's imperative that we keep the independent decision making parts of our brains switched on
and i 'm saying this as an economist who over the past few years has focused my research on what it is we think and who it is we trust and why but also and i 'm aware of the irony here as an expert myself
to help you understand where i 'm coming from let me bring you into my world the world of experts now
but what my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps that within these camps a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition
that experts move with the prevailing winds
often hero worshipping their own gurus alan greenspan 's proclamations that the years of economic growth would go on and on not challenged by his peers until after the crisis of course for expressing sexual desire
funding studies of drugs that conveniently leave out their worst side effects or studies funded by food companies of their new products
and we 've also got to be
these are of course not the only insights i could share but i hope they give you a clear sense at least of why we need to stop kowtowing to them why we need to rebel and why we need to switch our independent decision making capabilities on
but how can we do this well for the sake of time i want to focus on just three strategies
why was it that when i had an operation
it recently came out that experts trialing drugs before they come to market typically trial drugs first primarily on male animals and then primarily on men it seems that they 've somehow
second we need to create the space for what i call managed dissent if we are to shift paradigms if we are to make breakthroughs if we are to destroy myths
we need to create an environment in which expert ideas are battling it out in which we 're bringing in new diverse discordant heretical views into the discussion fearlessly
and also from the knowledge that by surrounding ourselves by divergent discordant heretical views all the research now shows us that this actually makes us smarter
and that 's why i talk about the need to actively manage dissent
google ceo eric schmidt is a practical practitioner of this philosophy in meetings he looks out for the person in the room arms crossed looking a bit bemused
managing dissent is about recognizing the value
disagreement discord and difference but we need to go even further we need to fundamentally redefine who it is that experts
the conventional notion is that experts are people with advanced degrees fancy titles diplomas best selling books high status individuals
best buy the consumer electronics company gets
all its employees the cleaners the shop assistants the people in the back office not just its forecasting team
to place bets yes bets on things like whether or not a product is going to sell well before christmas on whether customers new ideas are going to be or should be taken on by the company on whether a project will come in on time
leveraging and by embracing the expertise within the company best buy was able to discover for example that
the store that it was going to open in china its big grand store was not going to open on time because when it asked its staff all its staff to place their bets on whether they thought the store would open on time or not
a group from the finance department placed all their chips on that not happening
it turned out that they were aware as no one else within the company was of a technological blip that neither the forecasting experts nor the experts on the ground in china were even aware of
the strategies that i have discussed this evening
embracing dissent taking experts on democratizing expertise rebellious strategies are strategies that i think would serve us all well to embrace as we try to deal with the challenges of these very confusing complex
difficult times for if we keep our independent decision making part of our brains switched on if we challenge experts if we 're skeptical if we devolve authority if we are rebellious but also
if we become much more comfortable with nuance
for the challenges of the twenty first century for now more than ever is not the time to be blindly following blindly accepting blindly trusting
now is the time to face the world with eyes wide open yes
using experts to help us figure things out for sure i don 't want to completely do myself out of a job here but being aware
