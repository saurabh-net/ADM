humble breakfast radio announcer from sydney australia to be here on the ted stage literally on the other side of the world and i wanted to let you know a lot of the things you 've heard about australians are true from the youngest of ages we display a prodigious sporting talent
on the field of battle we are brave and noble warriors what you 've heard is true australians we don 't mind a bit of a drink
sometimes to excess leading to embarrassing social situations laughter this is my father 's work christmas party december one thousand nine hundred and seventy three i 'm almost five years old fair to say i 'm enjoying the day a lot more than santa was but
i stand before you today not as a breakfast radio host not as a comedian but as someone who was
what do you want to do after lunch i 've got no plans it was an exercise in democratic schooling
and i am all for democratic schooling but we were only seven through a round hole
is less than the diameter of the circle
well the square peg will pass quite easily through the round
sitting next to me one of my friends one of the cool kids in class steven leaned across
i thought about it for a nanosecond i took one look
at the road map of life
and i ran off down the street marked geek as fast as my chubby asthmatic little legs would carry me
with which the symphony of the universe is written the great descartes said something quite similar the universe is written in the mathematical language and today i want to show you one of those musical notes a number
so beautiful so massive i think it will blow your mind today we 're going to talk about prime numbers most of you i 'm sure remember
because it 's one x seven but we can 't break it down into any smaller chunks or as we call them factors now a few things you might like to know about prime numbers one is not prime the proof of that is a great party trick that admittedly only works at certain parties
i 'm talking about five little number twos next to each other all multiplied together two x two x two x two x two so two five is two
those five little twos multiplied together two five one equal thirty one
thirty one is a prime number and that five in the power is also a prime number
and the vast bulk of massive primes we 've ever found are of that form two to a prime number take away one i won 't go into great detail as to why because most of your eyes will bleed out of your head if i do but
for primacy a random odd number is a lot harder to test but as soon as we go hunting for massive primes we realize it 's not enough just to put in any prime number in the power
two eleven one equal two thousand and
in the one thousand seven hundred s other mathematicians said he is simply the master of us all he was so respected they put him on european currency back when that was a compliment
thirty nine digits long proven to be prime in one thousand eight hundred and seventy six by a mathematician called lucas word up l dog
but he didn 't know what the factors were we knew it was like six but we didn 't know what are the two x three that multiply together to give us that massive number we didn 't know for almost forty years until frank nelson cole came along
and at a gathering of prestigious american mathematicians walked to the board
took up a piece of chalk
and started writing out the powers of two
it got even more exciting when he then wrote down these two large prime numbers in your standard multiplication format and for the rest of the hour of his talk
frank nelson cole busted that out
he had found the prime factors of two sixty seven one the room went berserk laughter as frank nelson cole sat down having delivered the only talk in the history of mathematics with no words
he admitted afterwards it wasn 't that hard to do it took focus it took dedication it took him by his estimate three years of sundays
the age of the computer goes along and things explode
it was the year i left university
i was torn between mathematics and media it was a tough decision i loved university my arts degree was the best nine and a half years of my life
put simply in a room full of randomly selected people i 'm a maths genius in a roomful of maths ph ds i 'm as dumb as a box of hammers
my skill is not in the mathematics it is in telling the story of the mathematics and during that time since i 've left university these numbers have got bigger and bigger each one dwarfing the last until along came this man dr curtis cooper
not years ago not months ago
to show you what this guy had done i still remember
this number is almost seventeen and a half million digits long
if you typed it out on a computer and saved it as a text file that 's twenty two meg for the slightly less geeky of you think about the harry potter novels okay this is the first harry potter novel
this is all seven harry potter novels because she did tend to faff on a bit near the end
if when ted had begun at eleven o 'clock on tuesday we 'd walked out and simply hit one slide every second it would have taken five hours to show you that number that 's
as confidently as we know the number seven is prime that fills me with almost sexual excitement
it 's got a remarkably clear yes no answer and just requires phenomenal grunt large prime numbers are a great way of testing the speed and accuracy of computer chips but secondly as curtis cooper was looking for that monster prime he wasn 't the only guy searching
but for me it 's amazing because it 's a metaphor for the time in which we live when human minds and machines can conquer together we 've heard a lot about robots in this ted we 've heard a lot about what they can and can 't do it is true you can now download onto your smartphone an app
that would beat most grandmasters at chess you think that 's cool here 's a machine doing something cool
it can take a randomly shuffled rubik 's cube using the power of the smartphone it can examine the cube and solve the cube in five seconds
how lucky are we to live in this age when mind and machine can work together
i was there it was the most emotional exciting day it wasn 't my highlight of two thousand and twelve people thought it might have been an interview i 'd done on my show it might have been a politician it might have been a breakthrough it might have been a book i read the arts no no no it might have been something my two gorgeous daughters had done no it wasn 't the highlight of two thousand and twelve so clearly was the discovery of the higgs boson
give it up for the fundamental
i 've clearly got mass
where does it come from and he postulated a suggestion that there 's this infinite
incredibly small field stretching throughout the universe and as other particles go through those particles and interact that 's where they get their mass the rest of the scientific community said great idea higgsy we 've got no idea if we could ever prove it it 's beyond our reach and within just fifty years
in his lifetime with him sitting in the audience
we had designed the greatest machine ever
to prove this incredible idea that originated just in a human mind
that 's what is so exciting for me about this prime number we thought it might be there
and we went and found it
is what we are all about
or as my friend descartes might put it we think
