i don 't think anyone in this room would disagree what worries me is when politicians with money and charismatic rock stars
use the words it all just sounds so so simple
now i 've got no bucket of money today and i 've got no policy to release
over the last twenty eight years this tough grinding dirty work
has been done by literally thousands of people around australia and more recently overseas and their work has proven
it can improve health and it can play a part in reducing if not eliminating poverty
i 'm going to start where the story began one thousand nine hundred and eighty five in central australia a man called yami lester an aboriginal man was running a health service
eighty percent of what walked in the door in terms of illness was infectious disease third world developing world infectious disease caused by a poor living environment
yami assembled a team in alice springs he got a medical doctor
which translated is a plan to stop people getting sick a profound brief
of local national and international health research that filled out the picture as to why these were the health targets the pictures that came a bit later
so we had the goals
and each one of these goals and i won 't go through them all puts at the center the person
and their health issue and it then connects them to the bits of the physical environment
if you get a green tick your shower 's working you and your kids are fine if you get a red cross well i 've looked carefully around the room and it 's not going to make much difference to this crew why because you 're all
washing is the antidote to the sort of bugs the common infectious diseases of the eyes the ears the chest and the skin that if they occur in the first five years of life permanently damage those organs
they leave a lifelong remnant
this is a big deal so the ticks and crosses on the screen are actually critical for young kids
those ticks and crosses represent the seven thousand eight hundred houses we 've looked at nationally around australia the same proportion what you see on the screen thirty five percent of those not so famous houses lived in by fifty thousand indigenous people
thirty five percent had a working shower ten percent of those same seven thousand eight hundred houses had safe electrical systems and fifty eight percent of those houses had a working toilet
does it have hot and cold water two taps that work
we arrive in the morning with tools tons of equipment trades and we train up a local team on the first day to start work by the evening of the first day a few houses in that community are better than when we started in the morning
at the end of six months to a year we test every house again it 's very easy to spend money it 's very difficult to improve the function of all those parts of the house and for a whole house the nine healthy living practices we test check and fix two hundred and fifty items in every house
i think there 's an obvious question that i hope you 're thinking about why do we have to do this work why are the houses in such poor condition seventy percent of the work we do is due to lack of routine maintenance the sort of things that happen in all our houses things wear out
should have been done by state government or local government simply not done the house doesn 't work twenty one percent of the things we fix are due to faulty construction literally things that are built upside down and back to front they don 't work we have to fix them
the final cause you will have heard always that indigenous people trash houses it 's one of the almost rock solid pieces of evidence which i 've never seen evidence for
we argue strongly that the people living in the house are simply not the problem and we 'll go a lot further than that the people living in the house are actually a major part of the solution
seventy five percent of our national team in australia over seventy five at the minute are actually local indigenous people from the communities we work in
they do all aspects of the work
second the eye doctors tell us that dust scours the eye and lets the bug in quick so what do we do we call up the doctor of dust and there is such a person
he was loaned to us by a mining company he controls dust on mining company sites
and he came out and within a day it worked out that most dust in this community was within a meter of the ground the wind driven dust so he suggested making mounds to catch the dust before it went into the house area and affected the eyes of kids so we used dirt
to stop dust we did it he provided us dust monitors we tested and we reduced the dust then we wanted to get rid of the bug generally so how do we do that well we call up the doctor of flies and yes there is a doctor of flies as our aboriginal mate said you white fellows ought to get out more
the dung beetles ate the camel dung the flies died through lack of food and trachoma dropped and over the year trachoma dropped radically in this place and stayed low we changed the
environment not just treated the eyes and finally you get a good
we went in with no grand plan no grand promises of a great program just the offer to build two toilets for two families it was during the design of the first toilet
how do we actually get the smoke down so two problems and design should be about more than one thing
solution take human waste take animal waste put it into a chamber out of that extract biogas methane gas the gas gives three to four hours cooking a day clean smokeless and free for the family
there are now over one hundred toilets built in this village and a couple nearby well over one thousand people use those toilets yami lama
he 's a young boy he 's got significantly less gut infection because he 's now got toilets and there isn 't human waste on the ground
she 's probably right now cooking lunch
the leader of the team has now understood that not only have we built toilets we 've also built
none of those are limited by geography by skin color or by religion none of them
the common link between all the work we 've had to do is one thing and that 's poverty poverty is not natural
it 's man made and can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings i want to end by saying it 's been the actions of
thousands of ordinary human beings doing i think extraordinary work
that have actually improved health
