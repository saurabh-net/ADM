hello voicemail my old friend
called for tech support again
i ignored my boss warning i called on a monday morning now it's evening and my dinner
the sounds of silence i
don't think you understand i think your phone lines are
i punched every touch tone i was told eighteen hours on
eighteen hours on it's not enough
it's not enough now the
now the wreaking vengeance on you
wreaking vengeance on you and
but you get me and you listen to
be sent the coolest hottest slickest new gadgets every week it'll arrive at your door you get to try them out play with them evaluate them until the novelty wears out before you have to send them back and you'll get paid for it
you can think about it if you want so i've always been a technology nut and i absolutely love it
the job though came with one small downside and that is they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column
and what i've noticed is first of all you get an incredible amount of email if you ever are feeling lonely get a new york times column because you will get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
and the email i'm getting a lot today is about frustration people are feeling like things ok i just had an alarm come up on my screen lucky you can't see it
help there's not enough thought put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use one time i wrote a column about my efforts to reach dell technical support
and within twelve hours there were seven hundred messages from readers on the feedback boards on the times website
from users saying me too and here 's my tale of woe i call it software rage and man let me tell you whoever figures out how to make money off of this that get up there
ok so why is the problem accelerating and part of the problem is ironically because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use i'll show you what i mean this is what the computer interface used to look like dos
over the years it's gotten easier to use this is the original mac operating system reagan was president madonna was still brunette
the entire operating system this is the good part the entire operating system fit in two hundred and eleven k you couldn't put the mac os ten logo in two hundred
so the irony is that as these things became easier to use a less technical broader audience were coming into contact with this equipment for the first time
i once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the apple call center for a day the guy had a duplicate
headset for me to listen to and the calls that you know how they say your call may be recorded for quality assurance your call may be
so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a cd
which they do and i have a copy
it's in your gift bag no no with your voices on
so some of the stories are just so classic and yet so understandable a woman called apple to complain that her mouse was squeaking making a squeaking noise
the technician said well ma 'am what do you mean your mouse is squeaking she says all i can tell you is that it squeaks louder the faster i move it across the screen
and the technician 's like ma 'am you've got the mouse up against the screen she goes well the message said click here to continue
well if you like that one how much time have we got another one
called this is absolutely true his computer had crashed and he told the technician he couldn't restart it no matter how many times he typed eleven
why are you typing eleven he said the message says error type eleven
we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users
but why is the technical overload crisis the complexity crisis accelerating now in the hardware world it's because we the consumers want everything to be smaller smaller smaller so the gadgets are getting tinier and tinier
but our fingers are essentially staying the same size so it gets more and more of a challenge software is subject to another primal force the mandate to release more and more versions when you buy a piece of software it's not like buying a vase or a candy bar where you own it
it's more like joining a club where you pay dues every year and every year they say we 've added more features and we'll sell it to you for ninety nine dollars i know one guy who 's spent four thousand dollars just on photoshop over the years
and software companies make thirty five percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades i call it the software upgrade paradox which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times you eventually ruin it i mean
nodding in acknowledgment because it died it tanked no one ever bought it i call this the sport utility principle people like to surround themselves with unnecessary
right they don't need the database and the website but they're like well i'll upgrade because i might you know i might need that someday
so the problem is as you add more features where are they going to go where are you going to stick them you only have so many design tools
you can do buttons you can do sliders pop up menus sub menus but if you're not careful about how you choose you wind up with this
is not a joke un retouched photo of
the copy that you have with all the toolbars open you've obviously never opened all
but all you have to type in is teeny window
and we've arrived at the age of interface matrices where there are so many features and options you have to do
you know a vertical and a horizontal you guys all complained about how microsoft word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically the off switch is in there somewhere
i'm telling you it's there part of the art of designing a simple good interface is knowing when to use which one of these features so here is the log off dialog box for windows two thousand there are only four choices
so why are they in a pop up menu it's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices they could have put them all out in view here 's apple 's take on the exact same dialog box i designed the
already we can see that apple and microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design microsoft 's approach to simplicity
tends to be let 's break it down let 's just make it more steps there are these wizards everywhere and you know there's a new version of windows coming out this fall if they continue at this pace there's absolutely no telling where they might wind up
the drop down menu choose the first letter you want
what is the answer how do you pack in all
in a simple intelligent way i believe in consistency when possible real world equivalents trashcan folder when possible label things mostly
but i beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all which is intelligence now what do i mean by that i'm going to give you some examples
you're supposed to put in your address and you're supposed to choose which country you're from okay there are two hundred countries in the world we like to think of the internet as a global village i'm sorry it's not one yet it's mainly like the united states europe and
so why is united states in the
have to scroll like seven screens full to get to it now it would be inconsistent to put united states first but it would be intelligent
this one 's been touched on before but why in god 's name do you shut down a windows pc by clicking a button called start
one of mine you have a printer most of the time you want to print one copy of your document in page order on that printer so why in god 's name do you see this every time you
and one of the buttons at the bottom you'll notice is not
i'm not saying that apple is the only company who has embraced the cult of simplicity palm is also especially in the old days wonderful about this i actually got to speak to palm when they were flying high in the
what he goes well jeff hawkins the ceo says if any task on the palm pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus
it's too long and it has to be redesigned so i'm the tap counter so i'm going to show you an example of a company that does not have a tap counter
this is microsoft word ok when you want to create a new blank document in word it could happen
you go up to the file menu and you choose new now what happens when you choose new do you get a new blank document you do not
a task bar appears and somewhere in those links by the way not at the top somewhere in those links yes i do
yes i do song
song a geek forever
and i wrote the very first dos
i put my software and ibm together i got profit and
i write the code that makes the whole world you buy the
you buy the every software company
every software company doing microsoft
doing microsoft good idea
good idea even windows
even windows on the
on the we've entered planet domination
we've entered planet domination have no choice
have no choice and i
are really two microsofts there's the old one responsible for windows and office they're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh but they can
good simple interface designs i liked the media center pc i liked the microsoft spot watch the wireless watch
the signs might indicate that the complexity crunch is only going to get worse so is there any hope the screens are getting smaller people are illuminating putting manuals in the boxes the things are coming out at a faster pace
but i'm like where have i seen this before i had just seen the movie evita
with madonna and i'm like you know what i've got to do one about steve jobs
it won 't be easy you'll think i'm
when i try to explain why
after telling the press apple 's
see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage with only a
you try rhyming with garage
is i never left you i know the ropes now know what
are i made a fortune over at and
in any weather it's just that these days they're gucci leather
had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty and the truth is for years i was a little depressed because
it turns out i was wrong right because the ipod came out and it violated every bit of common wisdom other products cost less other products
had more features they had voice recorders and fm transmitters the other products were backed by microsoft with an open standard not apple 's propriety standard
but the ipod won this is the one they wanted the lesson was simplicity sells and there are signs that the industry is getting the message
a little company that's done very well with simplicity and elegance the sonos thing it's catching on i've got just a couple of examples physically a really cool elegant thinking
coming along lately when you have a digital camera how do you get the pictures back to your computer well you either haul around a usb cable
or you buy a card reader and haul that around either one you're going to lose what i do is i take out the memory card and i fold it in half
revealing usb contacts i just stick it in the computer offload the pictures put it right back in the camera i never have
lose anything here 's another example
and i'm sure every one of you have done this at some point in your lives or one of your children you walk along and i'm about to pull this onto the floor i don't care it's
it's magnetic it doesn't pull the laptop onto the floor
in my very last example
i do a lot of my work using speech recognition software and you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous okay
and it's not just what i dictate
this is not an ideal situation because it's getting the echo from the hall and stuff but the point is i can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word and having it write out a much longer thing so if somebody sends me a fan letter i'll say
conversely if somebody sends me hate mail which happens daily i say off
so that's my dirty little secret don't tell anyone
so the point is this a really interesting story this is version eight of the software and do you know what they put in version eight no new features it's never happened before in software the company put no new features they just said we 'll make
work right right because for years people had bought this software tried it out ninety five percent accuracy was all they got which means one in twenty words is wrong
and so that's what they did this cult of doing things right is starting to spread so my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology remember if it doesn't work
not necessarily you ok it could be the design of the thing you're using be aware in life of good design and bad design and if you're among the people who create the stuff
easy is hard pre sweat the details for your audience count the taps remember the hard part is not deciding what features to add it's deciding what to leave out and best of all your motivation is simplicity sells
