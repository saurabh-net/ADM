thank you imagining a solo cello concert one would most likely think of johann sebastian bach unaccompanied cello suites
as a child studying these eternal masterpieces
late at night after hours of practicing i would listen to janis joplin and billie holiday as the sounds of tango music would be creeping from my parents stereo
it all became music to me i didn 't hear the boundaries
i still start every day practicing playing bach his music never ceases to sound fresh and surprising to me
but as i was moving away from the traditional classical repertoire and trying to find new ways of musical expression i realized that with today 's technological resources there 's no reason to limit what can be produced
at one time from a single string instrument the power and coherency that comes from one person hearing perceiving and playing all the voices
makes a very different experience
the excitement from using multi tracking the way i did in the piece you will hear next comes from
the attempt to build and create a whole universe with many diverse layers all generated from a single source
my cello and my voice are layered to create this large sonic canvas
when composers write music for me i ask them to forget what they know about the cello i hope to arrive at new territories to discover sounds i have never heard before
i want to create endless possibilities with this cello i become the medium through which the music is being channeled and in the process when all is right
the music is transformed and so am i
