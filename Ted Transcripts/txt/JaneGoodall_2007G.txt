good afternoon good evening whatever we can go jambo guten
that is the call that chimpanzees make before they go to sleep in the evening you hear it going from one side of the valley to the other from one group of nests to the next
and i want to pick up with my talk this evening from where zeray left off yesterday
he was talking about this amazing three year old australopithecene child selam
and we've also been hearing about the history the family tree of mankind through dna genetic profiling
and it was a paleontologist the late louis leakey who actually set me on the path for studying chimpanzees and it was pretty extraordinary way back then it's kind of commonplace now
but his argument was because he'd been searching for the fossilized remains of early humans in africa
and you can tell an awful lot about what those beings looked like from the fossils from the shape of the muscle attachments
that's what he wanted to know and of course behavior doesn't fossilize he argued and its now a fairly common theory that if we found
behavior patterns similar or the same in our closest living relatives the great apes and humans today
then maybe those behaviors were present in the ape like human like ancestor some seven million years ago and therefore perhaps we had brought those characteristics with us from that ancient ancient past
they are more like us than any other living creature and we've heard about that during this ted conference so
it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chimpanzees are so like us in certain aspects of their behavior
the female has her first baby when she's eleven or twelve thereafter she has one baby only every five or six years
a long period of childhood dependency when the child is nursing sleeping with the mother at night and riding on her back
and we believe that this long period of childhood is important for chimpanzees just as it is for us in relation to learning
as the brain becomes ever more complex during evolution in different forms of animals so we find that learning plays an ever more important role in an individual 's life history
and young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do we know now that they're capable of imitating behaviors that they see
and we believe that it's in this way that the different tool using behaviors that have now been seen in all the different chimpanzee populations studied in africa
how these are passed from one generation to the next through observation imitation and practice so that we can describe these tool using behaviors as primitive culture
greeting chimpanzees embracing they also kiss hold hands pat one another on the back and they swagger and they throw rocks
in chimpanzee society we find many many examples of compassion precursors to love and true altruism
and these really aggressive behaviors for the most part are directed against individuals of the neighboring social group they are very territorially
is no sharp line between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom it's a very blurry line and its getting
is still continuing to this day and these chimpanzees living their complex social lives in the wild have
so it's pretty sad to find that chimpanzees like so many other creatures around the world are losing their habitats this is just one photograph
from the air and it shows you the forested highlands of gombe and it was when i flew over the whole area about sixteen years ago
that a question came to my mind how can we even try to save these famous chimpanzees when the people living around the national park are struggling to survive
more people are living there than the land could possibly support the numbers increased by refugees pouring in from burundi and over the lake from congo and
very poor people they couldn't afford to buy food from elsewhere this led to a program which we call take care it's a very holistic
way of improving the lives of the people living in the villages around the park it started small with twelve villages it's now in twenty four
there isn't time to go into it but it's including things like tree nurseries methods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded almost desert like land up in these mountains
ways of controlling preventing soil erosion ways of reclaiming overused farmland so that within two years they can again be productive working to
help the villagers obtain fresh water from wells perhaps build some
loans and we've got as is the case around the world about ninety five percent of all loans returned
empowering women working with education providing scholarships for girls so they can finish secondary school in the
but when we began the take care program it was a tanzanian team going into the villages it was a tanzanian team
talking to the villagers asking what they were interested in were they interested in conservation absolutely not they were interested in health they were interested in education and as
time went on and as their situation began to improve they began to understand ever more about the need for conservation
as the upper levels of the hills were denuded of trees so you've got this terrible soil erosion and mudslides today
we are developing what we call the greater gombe ecosystem this is an area way outside the national park stretching out into all these various degraded lands
and as these villages have a better standard of life they are actually agreeing to put between ten percent and twenty percent of their land in the highlands aside so that once again
as the trees grow back the chimpanzees will have leafy corridors through which they can travel to interact as they must for genetic viability with other remnant groups outside the national park so
take care is a success we're replicating it in other parts of africa around other wilderness areas which are faced with extreme population pressure
and when you get large numbers of people living in land that is not that fertile particularly when you cut down trees and you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion
as desperate populations cut down more and more trees so that they can try and grow food for themselves and their families
what's going to happen something 's got to give
other problems not only in africa but the rest of the developing world and indeed everywhere what are we doing to our planet
you know the famous scientist e o wilson said that if every person on this planet attains the standard of living of the average european or american
we need three new planets today they are saying four but we don't have them we've got one
what's happened i mean the question here is here we are arguably the most intelligent being that's ever walked planet earth
with this extraordinary brain capable of the kind of technology that is so well illustrated by these ted conferences and yet were destroying the only home we have
the indigenous people around the world before they made a major decision used to sit around and ask themselves how does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead
today major decisions and i'm not particularly talking about africa here but the developed world major decisions
as i began traveling around africa talking about the problems faced by chimpanzees and their vanishing forests i realized more and more how so many of africa 's problems could be laid at the door of previous colonial exploitation
so i began traveling outside africa talking in europe talking in the united states going to asia and everywhere
these terrible problems and you know the kind i'm talking about i'm talking about pollution the air that we breathe that often poisons us the
is poisoning our foods the water water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues that were going to face in this century
and everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural industrial and household chemicals that still
being sprayed around the world seemingly with the inability to profit from past experience the
the reckless burning of fossil fuels along with other greenhouse gasses so called leading to climate change
finally all around the world people have begun to believe that there is something going on very wrong with our climate all around the world climates are mixed up
and it's the poor people who are affected worse it's africa that already is affected in many parts of sub saharan africa
the droughts are so much worse and when the rain does come it so often leads to flooding and added distress and the cycle of poverty and hunger and disease and the
wasn't surprising to me that as i was traveling around the world i met so many young people who seemed to have lost hope
we seem to have lost wisdom
the wisdom of the indigenous people
i asked a question why well do you think there could be some kind of disconnect
between this extraordinarily clever brain the kind of brain that the ted technologies exemplify
and the human heart talking about it in the non scientific term in terms of love and compassion is there some disconnect
and these young people when i talk to them basically they were either depressed or apathetic or bitter and angry
and they said more or less the same thing we feel this way because we feel you've compromised our future and there's nothing we can do about it
we have compromised their future i've got three little grandchildren and every time i look at them and i think how we've harmed this beautiful planet since i was their age i feel this desperation
and that led to this program we call roots and shoots which began right here in tanzania and has now spread to ninety seven countries around the world
it's symbolic roots make a firm foundation shoots seemed tiny to reach the sun they can break a brick wall see the brick wall as all these problems we've inflicted on the planet environmental and social
it's a message of hope hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through and can make this a better world for all living things
every one of us in this room we have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make the very poor have no choice its up to us to change things so that the poor have choice as well
the roots and shoots groups all choose three projects it depends on how old they are and which country whether they're in a city or rural as to what kinds of projects
but basically we have programs now from preschool right through university with more and more adults starting
so one of their projects will be to help their own human community and then if they're able they may raise money to help communities in other parts of the world
one of their projects will be to help animals not just wildlife domestic animals as well and one of their projects will be to help the environment that we all share and woven throughout all of this is
a message of learning to live in peace and harmony within ourselves in our families in our communities between nations between cultures between religions and
between us and the natural world we need the natural world we cannot go on destroying it at the rate we are we not do have more than this one
just picking one or two of the projects right here in africa that the roots and shoots groups are doing one or two projects only
in tanzania in uganda kenya south africa congo brazzaville sierra leone cameroon and other groups and as i say it's in ninety seven countries around the world
to ex child soldiers doing projects like this is bringing them out of themselves once again they're a useful member of society we have this program in prisons as well
so there's no time for more roots and shoots now but oh they're also working on hiv aids that's a very important component of roots and shoots with older kids talking to younger ones
deserts where once there was forest do you really have hope well yes you can't come to a conference like ted and not have hope can you
and of course there's hope one is this amazing human brain and i mean think of the technologies and i've just been so thrilled finally to come to people talking about
we as the elite around the world we can do something about it we can make choices as to how we live each day what we buy what we
and choose to make these choices with the question how will this affect the environment around me
how will it affect the life of my child when he or she grows up or my grandchild or whatever it is so
the human brain coupled with the human heart and we join hands around the world and that's what ted is helping so well with and google who help us and
and the next reason for hope nature is amazingly resilient you can take an area that's absolutely destroyed with time and perhaps some help
it can regenerate and an example is the take care program i told you where a seemingly dead tree stump if you stop hacking them for firewood which you don't need to because you have wood lots then in five years you can have a thirty foot tree
and animals almost on the brink of extinction can be given a second chance that's my next book it's inspiring
and it brings me to my last category of hope and we've heard about this so much in the last two days this indomitable human spirit
this determination of people the resilience of the human spirit so that people who you would think would be battered by poverty or disease or whatever can pull themselves up out of it sometimes with a helping hand
take their part in society and take their part in changing the world and just to think of one or two people out of africa
really inspiring we could make a very long list but obviously nelson mandela emerging from seventeen years of hard physical
ken saro wiwa in nigeria who took on the giant oil companies and although people around the world tried their best was executed
people like this are so inspirational people like this are the role models we need for young africans and we need some environmental role models as well and i've been hearing some of them today
so i'm really grateful for this opportunity to share this message again with everyone at ted and i hope that some of us can
get together and talk about some of these things especially the roots and shoots program and just a last word on that the young woman who 's running this entire conference center
i met her today she came up so excited with her certificate she was in roots and shoots she was in the leadership in dar es salaam she said it's helped her to do what she's doing and it was very very exciting for me to meet
and see just one example of how young people when they are empowered given the opportunity to take action to make the world a better place truly are our hope for tomorrow thank you
