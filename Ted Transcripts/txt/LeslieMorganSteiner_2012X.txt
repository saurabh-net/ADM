'm here today to talk about a disturbing question which has an equally disturbing answer
my topic is the secrets of domestic
and the question i 'm going to tackle
is the one question everyone always asks
why does she stay why would anyone stay with a man who beats her
i 'm not a psychiatrist a social worker
or an expert in domestic violence
i 'm just one woman with a story to tell
i was twenty two i had just graduated from harvard college i had moved to new york city for my first job as a writer and editor at seventeen magazine
i had my first apartment my first little green american express card
and i had a very big secret my secret was
pointed at my head by the man who i thought was my soulmate many many times
the man who i loved
more than anybody on earth
held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me
more times than i can even remember
i 'm here to tell you the story of crazy love
a psychological trap disguised as love one that millions of women and even a few fall into every year
it may even be your story i don 't look like a typical domestic violence survivor i have a b a in english from harvard college an mba in marketing from wharton business school i 've spent most of my career working for fortune five hundred companies including johnson johnson leo burnett and the washington post
i 've been married for almost twenty years to my second husband and we have three kids together
my dog is a black lab and i drive a honda odyssey minivan
all races all religions all income and education levels it 's everywhere
and my second message is that everyone thinks domestic violence happens to women that it 's a women 's issue not exactly
over eighty five percent of abusers are men
and domestic abuse happens only in intimate interdependent long term relationships
in other words in families the last place we would want or expect to find violence
which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing i would have told you myself that i was the last person on earth who would stay with a man who beats me but in fact i was a very typical victim because of my age i was twenty two and in the united states
women ages sixteen to twenty four are three times as likely to be domestic violence victims as women of other ages
and over five hundred women and girls this age are killed every year by abusive partners boyfriends and husbands in the united states
i was also a very typical victim because i knew nothing about domestic violence its warning signs or its patterns i met conor
on a cold rainy january night
he sat next to me on the new york city subway
and he started chatting me up
he told me two things one was that he too had just graduated from an ivy league school
and that he worked at a very impressive wall street bank
but what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting was that he was smart and funny
and he looked like a farm boy he had these big cheeks these big apple cheeks and this wheat blond hair and he seemed so sweet
one of the smartest things conor did from the very beginning was to create the illusion that i was the dominant partner in the relationship
he did this especially at the beginning by idolizing me
we started dating and he loved everything about me that i was smart that i 'd gone to harvard that i was passionate about helping teenage girls and my job he wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my hopes and dreams conor believed in me as a writer and a woman in a way that no one else
he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused by his stepfather and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade even though he was very smart and he 'd spent almost twenty years rebuilding his life which is why
that ivy league degree and the wall street job and his bright shiny future meant so much to him
if you had told me that this smart
funny sensitive man who adored me
would one day dictate whether or not i wore makeup
how short my skirts were
where i lived what jobs i took who my friends were and where i spent christmas
i would have laughed at you because there was not a hint of violence or control or anger in conor
that the first stage in any domestic violence relationship
is to seduce and charm the victim
i also didn 't know that the second step is to isolate the victim now conor did not
come home one day and announce
instead conor came home one friday evening
and he told me that he had quit his job that day his dream job
and he said that he had quit his job because of me
because i had made him feel so safe and loved that he didn 't need to prove himself on wall street anymore and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his abusive dysfunctional family and move to a tiny town in new england where he could start his life over with me by his side
now the last thing i wanted to do was leave new york and my dream job
but i thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate i had no idea
i was falling into crazy love
that i was walking headfirst into a carefully laid physical financial and psychological trap
the next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence and see how she reacts
and here 's where those guns come in
as soon as we moved to new england
you know that place where connor was supposed to feel so safe
he bought three guns he kept one in the glove compartment of our car
he kept one under the pillows on our bed
and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times
and he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma he 'd experienced as a young boy he needed them to feel protected but those guns were really a message for me
and even though he hadn 't raised a hand to me my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day conor first physically attacked
i was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment and i got frustrated
and conor used my anger as an excuse to put both of his hands around my neck
and to squeeze so tightly that i could not breathe or scream
and he used the chokehold
to hit my head repeatedly against the wall five days later
the ten bruises on my neck had just faded
despite what had happened i was sure we were going to live happily ever
it was an isolated incident and he was never going to hurt me again
it happened twice more on the honeymoon
the first time i was driving to find a secret beach
and i got lost and he punched me in the side of my head so hard
that the other side of my head repeatedly hit the driver 's side window
and then a few days later driving home from our honeymoon
he got frustrated by traffic
and he threw a cold big mac in my face conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage
i was mistaken in thinking that i was unique and alone in this situation one in three american women experiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life
and the cdc reports that fifteen million children are abused every year back to my question
i didn 't know he was abusing
even though he held those loaded guns to my head pushed me down stairs threatened to kill our dog pulled the key out of the car ignition as i drove down the highway poured coffee grinds on my head
as i dressed for a job interview i never once thought of myself as a battered wife
instead i was a very strong woman in love with a deeply troubled man
and i was the only person on earth
who could help conor face his demons
the other question everybody asks is
why didn 't i walk out
i could have left any time to me this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask
because we victims know something you usually don 't
it 's incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser because the final step in the domestic violence pattern is kill her
over seventy percent of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has ended the relationship
other outcomes include long term stalking
even after the abuser remarries denial of financial resources and manipulation of the family court system to terrify the victim and her children who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend unsupervised time with the man who beat their mother
and still we ask why doesn 't she just leave
i was able to leave
because of one final sadistic beating that broke through my denial
i realized that the man who i loved so much
was going to kill me if i let him
so i broke the silence i told everyone
and i 'm here today
because you all helped me
we tend to stereotype victims as grisly headlines self destructive women damaged goods the question why does she stay
is code for some people for
but since publishing crazy love
i have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also got out
who learned an invaluable life lesson
from what happened and who rebuilt lives joyous
happy lives as employees wives and mothers lives completely free of violence like me
i remarried a kind and gentle man
and we have those three kids i have that black lab
and i have that minivan what i will never have again i promise you
there are several people listening to me right now
who are currently being abused
or who were abused as children
or who are abusers themselves
abuse could be affecting your daughter your sister your best friend
talk about what you heard here
abuse thrives only in silence you have the power
you have the power to end domestic violence
simply by shining a spotlight on
we victims need everyone we need every one of you
to understand the secrets of domestic
show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children your coworkers your friends and family recast survivors as wonderful lovable people with full futures
recognize the early signs of violence and conscientiously intervene deescalate it show victims a safe way out
together we can make our beds thank you
