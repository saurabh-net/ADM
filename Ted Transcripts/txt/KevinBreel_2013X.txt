and in the life that everyone sees who i am is a friend a son a brother a stand up comedian and a teenager
and i wouldn 't be lying but i wouldn 't totally be telling you the truth either
because the truth is that 's just the life everyone else sees
that 's sadness that 's a natural thing that 's a natural human emotion real depression isn 't being
sad when something in your life goes wrong
real depression is being sad when everything in your life is going right that 's real depression and that 's what i suffer from and to be totally honest that 's hard for me to stand up here and say it 's hard for me to talk about and it seems to be hard for everyone to talk about so much so that no one 's talking about it
and no one 's talking about depression but we need to be because right now it 's a massive problem it 's a massive problem
and we have a tendency as a society to look at that
and go so what so what we look at that and we go that 's your problem that 's their problem
i was suicidal and if you were to look at my life on the surface
you wouldn 't see a kid who was suicidal you 'd see a kid who was the captain of his basketball team the drama and theater student of the year the english student of the year someone who was consistently on the honor roll and consistently at every party so you would say i wasn 't depressed you would say i wasn 't suicidal but you would be wrong
you would be wrong so i sat there that night beside a bottle of pills with a pen and paper in my hand and i thought about taking my own life and i came this close to doing it
i came this close to doing it
one of the lucky ones who survives well i survived and that just leaves me with my story and my story is this
four simple words i suffer from depression i suffer from depression and for a long time i think
i was living two totally different lives where one person was always afraid of the other i was afraid that people would see me for who i really was that i wasn 't the perfect popular kid in high school everyone thought i was that beneath my smile there was struggle and beneath my light there was dark and beneath my big personality just hid even
bigger pain see some people might fear girls not liking them back some people might fear sharks some people might fear death but for me for a large part of my life i feared myself
and so i thought about that way every single day i thought about it every single day and if i 'm being totally honest standing here i 've thought about it again since because that 's the sickness that 's the struggle that 's depression and depression isn 't chicken pox you don 't beat it once and it 's gone forever it 's something you live with
it 's something you live in it 's the roommate you can 't kick out it 's the voice you can 't ignore it 's the feelings you can 't seem to escape the scariest part is
but if you tell people you 're depressed everyone runs the other way that 's the stigma
we are so so so accepting of any body part breaking down other than our brains and that 's ignorance
i wish i did but i don 't but i think i think it has to start here
where we eliminate the ignorance of others
it 's in building a world where we teach the acceptance of ourselves where we 're okay with who we are because when we get honest we see that we all struggle and we all suffer whether it 's with this whether it 's with something else we all know what it is to hurt
just a part of life and as much
as i hate as much as i hate some of the places some of the parts of my life depression has dragged me down to in a lot of ways i 'm grateful for it
because yeah it 's put me in the valleys but only to show me there 's peaks and yeah it 's dragged me through the dark but only to remind me there is light my pain more than anything in nineteen years on this planet has given me perspective and my hurt my hurt has forced me to have hope
have hope and to have faith faith in myself faith in others faith that it can get better that we can change this that we can speak up
and speak out and fight back against ignorance fight back against intolerance
and more than anything learn to love ourselves
learn to accept ourselves for who we are the people we are not the people the world wants us to be because the world i believe in is one where embracing your light doesn 't mean ignoring your dark the world i believe in is one where we 're measured by our ability to overcome adversities not avoid them
the world i believe in is one where i can look someone in the eye and say i 'm going through hell
and they can look back at me and go me too and that 's okay and it 's okay because depression is okay we 're people we 're people and we struggle and we suffer and we bleed and we cry and if you think that true strength means never showing any weakness then i 'm here to tell you you 're wrong
you 're wrong because it 's the opposite
because the only way we 're going to beat a problem that people are battling alone is by standing strong together
