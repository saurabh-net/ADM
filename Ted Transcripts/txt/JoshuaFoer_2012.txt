'd like to invite you to close your eyes
imagine yourself standing outside the front door of your home
they are competing in a naked bicycle race and they are headed straight for your front door
i need you to actually see this they are pedaling really hard they 're sweaty they 're bouncing around a lot and they crash straight into the front door of your home
bicycles fly everywhere wheels roll past you
spokes end up in awkward places step over the threshold of your door
into your foyer your hallway whatever 's on the other side and appreciate the quality of the light
cookie monster cookie monster is waving at you from his perch on top of a tan horse it 's a talking horse you can
walk past him into your living room
in your living room in full imaginative broadband picture britney spears she is scantily clad she 's dancing on your coffee table
and she 's singing hit me baby one more time
and then follow me into your kitchen in your kitchen the floor has been paved over with a yellow brick road and out of your oven
are coming towards you dorothy the tin man the scarecrow and the lion from the wizard of oz
hand in hand skipping straight towards you okay as a science journalist
this was a bunch of guys and a few ladies
widely varying in both age and hygienic upkeep
they were competing to see who could memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards the fastest i was like this is unbelievable these people must be freaks of nature and i started talking
to a few of the competitors this is a guy called ed cook who had come over from england where he had one of the best trained memories and i said to him ed
when did you realize that you were a savant
and ed was like i 'm not a savant in fact i have just an average memory
everybody who competes in this contest will tell you that they have just an average memory we 've all trained ourselves to perform these utterly miraculous
feats of memory using a set of ancient techniques techniques invented two thousand five hundred years ago in greece the same techniques that cicero had used to memorize his speeches that medieval scholars had used to memorize entire books
and we were standing outside the competition hall and ed
who is a wonderful brilliant
but somewhat eccentric english guy says to me
do you know britney spears
i 'm not britney spears
but maybe you could teach me
i mean you 've got to start somewhere right
and that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me i ended up spending the better part of the next year not only training my memory but also investigating it trying to understand how it works why it sometimes doesn 't work and what its potential might be i met a host of really interesting people
this is a guy called e p he 's an amnesic who had very possibly the very worst memory in the world
and he was this incredibly tragic figure but he was a window into the extent to which our memories make us who we are
the other end of the spectrum
i met this guy this is kim peek he was the basis for dustin hoffman 's character in the movie rain man
we spent an afternoon together
in the salt lake city public library memorizing phone books
and i learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff
one of the really interesting things that i learned
is that once upon a time this idea of having
this idea of having trained disciplined cultivated memory
was not nearly so alien as it would seem to us to be today
in laboriously furnishing their minds
over the last few millenia we 've invented a series of technologies from the alphabet to the scroll to the codex the printing press photography the computer the smartphone
that have made it progressively easier and easier for us to externalize our memories for us to essentially outsource this fundamental human capacity
these technologies have made our modern world possible
having little need to remember anymore
it sometimes seems like we 've forgotten how
one of the last places on earth where you still find people passionate about this idea of a trained disciplined cultivated memory is at this totally singular memory contest it 's actually not that singular there are contests held all over the world and i was fascinated i wanted to know how do these guys do it
a few years back a group of researchers at university college london brought a bunch of memory champions into the lab
they wanted to know do these guys have brains that are somehow structurally anatomically different from the rest of ours the answer was no
when they put these guys in an fmri machine scanned their brains while they were memorizing numbers and people 's faces and pictures of snowflakes
they found that the memory champions were lighting up different parts of the brain than everyone else
the sport of competitive memorizing
is driven by a kind of arms race
where every year somebody comes up with a new way to remember more stuff more quickly and then the rest of the field has to play catchup this is my friend ben pridmore three time world memory champion on his desk in front of him are thirty six shuffled packs of playing cards
that he is about to try to memorize in one hour using a technique that he invented and he alone has mastered he used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of four thousand one hundred and forty random binary digits in half an hour
everything all of the techniques that are being used ultimately come down to a concept that psychologists refer to as elaborative encoding
and it 's well illustrated by a nifty paradox known as the baker baker paradox which goes like this
and i come back to you at some point later on
and i say do you remember that word that i told you a while back do you remember what it was
the person who was told his name is baker is less likely to remember the same word
same word different amount of remembering that 's weird what 's going on here well the name baker doesn 't actually mean anything to you it is entirely untethered from all of the other memories
floating around in your skull but the common noun baker
we know bakers bakers wear funny white hats
bakers have flour on their hands bakers smell good when they come home from work maybe we even know a baker and when we first hear that word we start putting these associational hooks into it that make it easier to fish it back out at some later date
and the entire art of remembering stuff better in everyday life
into lower case b bakers
in context in significance in meaning and transform it in some way so that it becomes meaningful in the light of all the other things that you have
dates back two thousand five hundred years to ancient greece
the story behind its creation goes like this
he was actually the hired entertainment because back then if you wanted to throw a really slamming party
you didn 't hire a d j you hired a poet
and he stands up delivers his poem from memory walks out the door
and at the moment he does the banquet hall collapses
it mangles the bodies beyond all recognition nobody can say who was inside
nobody can say where they were sitting the bodies can 't be properly buried it 's one tragedy compounding another and has this realization
he can see where each of the guests at the banquet had been sitting and he takes the relatives by the hand and guides them each to their loved ones amid the wreckage
is something that i think we all kind of intuitively know
which is that as bad as we are at remembering names and phone numbers and word for word instructions from our colleagues
we have really exceptional visual and spatial memories
who is sitting on top of a talking tan horse
in your foyer right now
is to create this imagined edifice in your mind 's eye
and populate it with images of the things that you want to remember the crazier weirder more bizarre funnier raunchier stinkier the image is the more unforgettable it 's likely to be this is advice that goes back two thousand plus years to the earliest latin
memory treatises so how does this work
let 's say that you 've been invited
to ted center stage to give a speech and you want to do it from memory
and you want to do it the way that cicero
and you 'd come up with some sort of an absolutely crazy ridiculous unforgettable image
to remind you that the first thing you want to talk about is this totally bizarre contest
and then you 'd go inside your house
and you would see an image of cookie monster on top of mister ed
and that would remind you that you would want to then introduce your friend ed cook
and then you 'd see an image of britney spears to remind you of this funny anecdote you want to tell
and you go into your kitchen
and the fourth topic you were going to talk about was this strange journey that you went on for a year and you have some friends to help you remember that
that 's like in the first place of your memory palace
i thought this was just fascinating and i got really into it and i went to a few more of these memory contests
the problem was that a memory contest
is a pathologically boring event
i mean the most dramatic it gets is when somebody starts massaging their temples and i 'm a journalist i need something to write about i know that there 's this incredible stuff happening in these people 's minds but i don 't have access to
i needed to walk in their shoes a little bit
and so i started trying to spend fifteen or twenty minutes every morning before i sat down with my new york times
maybe it was names from an old yearbook that i bought at a flea market and i found that this was
and i got pretty into it this is me wearing my standard competitive memorizer 's training kit
it 's a pair of earmuffs and a set of safety goggles that have been masked over
except for two small pinholes because distraction is the competitive memorizer 's greatest enemy
it 'd make i thought maybe a nice epilogue to all my research i won the contest
which really wasn 't supposed to happen
to memorize speeches and phone numbers and shopping lists
but it 's actually kind of beside the point
and you don 't have to be building memory palaces or memorizing packs of playing cards to benefit from a little bit of insight about how your mind works we often talk about people with great memories as though it were some sort of an innate gift but that is not the case great memories are learned
at the most basic level we remember when we pay attention we remember when we are deeply engaged we remember when we are able to take a piece of information and experience and figure out why it is meaningful to us why it is significant why it 's colorful when we 're able
to transform it in some way that it makes sense in the light of all of the other things floating around in our minds when we 're able to transform bakers
they work because they make you work they force a kind of depth of processing a kind of mindfulness
that most of us don 't normally walk around exercising but there actually are no shortcuts
and i think if there 's one thing that i want to leave you with
couldn 't even remember that he had a memory problem left me with which is
the notion that our lives
are the sum of our memories
not paying attention to the human being across from us who is talking with us
by being so lazy that we 're not willing to process
that there are incredible memory capacities
