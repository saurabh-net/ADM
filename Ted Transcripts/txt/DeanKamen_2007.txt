just almost exactly a year ago a little over a year ago from a very senior person at the department of defense came to see me and said one thousand six hundred
and we're doing the same thing we did for more
that we've done since the civil war a
and literally this guy sat in my office in new hampshire and said i want you to give me something
that we can put on these kids
he finishes explaining that and i'm waiting for the big
three hundred pound paper proposal and he said that 's what i want
that technology 's just not available right now
not in an envelope of a human
with twenty one degrees of freedom
my nights and weekends are already filled up with things like
let 's supply water to the world and power to the world and educate all the kids which chris i will not talk about
he says to me we 've done some work around the country we've got some pretty amazing neurology and other people
over the next month i visited lots of places some out here around the country found the best of the best
i went down to washington
i saw these guys and said i did what you asked me i looked at what's out there i still think you're
but not as nuts as i thought
i put a team together a little over thirteen months ago
got up to twenty some odd people
we said we're going to build a device
that does what he wants we have fourteen out of the twenty one degrees of freedom you don't need the ones in the last two fingers
we put this thing together
a couple of weeks ago we took it down to walter reed which is unfortunately more in the news these days we showed it to a bunch of guys one guy who described himself as being lucky because
good arm and then he pushed himself back from the table he had no legs
these kids have attitudes that you just
so i'm going to show you now without the skin on it a thirty second piece and then
but understand what you're looking at we made small enough to fit on a fiftieth percentile female
so that we could put it in any of these people
it's going to go inside something that we use in cat scans and mris of whatever is their good arm
and paint it in three d exact mirror image of their other limb so you won 't see all the really cool stuff
the more it attaches they take the load off and it becomes again compliant
to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this that we demonstrated in washington can we look at this thing
watch the fingers grab the thumb comes
wrist this weighs six point nine pounds going to scratch his nose
now he 's going to put that down pick up a piece of paper i got a visit
