i had an amazing mom who was just fiercely independent she worked at the local high school as a secretary in the dean 's office so she got to
so see kids like us we have a lot of things to deal with outside of school and
really do you think that doing my homework that night was at the top of my priority list
i needed teachers in the classroom every day who were going to say you can move beyond that
and then i told them i want to be a teacher and boy they were like what why why would you want to do that so i began my teaching career at the exact same middle school that i attended and
i really wanted to try to save more kids who were just like me and so every year i share my background with my kids because they need to know that everyone has a story everyone has a struggle
and everyone needs help along the way and i i created
i created opportunity
i had a kid one day come into my class having been stabbed the night before
i need to be in class because i need to graduate so he knew that i was not going to let him be a victim of his circumstance but we were going to push forward and keep moving on
and teachers turning over year after year after year how do you get to build those relationships
so we created a new school
and we created the san fernando institute for applied media
we made sure that we were still
attached to our school district for funding for support
but with that we were going to gain freedom
freedom to hire the teachers that we knew were going to be effective freedom
to control the curriculum so that we 're not doing lesson one point two on page five no and freedom to control a budget
to spend money where it matters not how a district or a state says you have to do it
we wanted those freedoms but now shifting an entire paradigm
but we had to do it our community deserved a new way of doing things and as the very first pilot middle school in all of los angeles unified school district
you better believe there was some opposition
and it was out of fear fear of well what if they get it wrong
so in our third year how did we do it
we make our curriculum rigorous and relevant to them
and they use all the technology that they 're used to laptops computers tablets you name it they have it animation software moviemaking software they have it all and because we connect it to what they 're doing for example they made public service announcements for the cancer society
these were played in the local trolley system teaching elements of persuasion
and it takes an active parent center who
not only there showing a presence every day but who is part of our governance
making decisions for their kids our kids
because why should our students have to go so far away from where they live
they deserve a quality school in their neighborhood a school that they can be proud to say they attend and a school that the community can be proud of as well
and they need teachers to fight for them
every day and empower them to move beyond their circumstances because it 's time that kids like me stop being the exception
