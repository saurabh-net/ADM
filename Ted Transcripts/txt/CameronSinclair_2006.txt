you on a journey very quickly to explain the wish i'm going to have to take you somewhere which many people haven't been and that's around the world when i was about twenty four years old
kate store and myself started an organization to get architects and designers involved in humanitarian work not only about responding to natural disasters but involved in systemic issues
we believed that where the resources and expertise are scarce innovative sustainable design can really make a difference in people 's lives
so this all began my i started my life as an architect or training as an architect and i was always interested in socially
many architects seemed to think that when you design you design a jewel and it's a jewel that you try and crave for whereas i felt that when you design
we started by responding to the issue of the housing crisis for returning refugees in kosovo and i didn't know what i was doing like i say mid twenties
and i'm the i'm the internet generation so we started a website we put a call out there and to my surprise in a couple of months we had hundreds of entries from around the world
that led to a number of prototypes being built and really experimenting with some ideas two years later we started doing a project on developing mobile health clinics in sub saharan africa responding to the hiv aids pandemic
fifty three countries we also have designers from around the world that participate and we had an exhibit of work that followed
two thousand and four was the tipping point for us we started responding to natural disasters and getting involved in iran and bam also following up on our work in africa
or go down to alabama or mississippi pre katrina and i could have shown you places that have far worse conditions than many developing countries i've been to so we got involved in and worked in inner cities and elsewhere and then also
i will go into some more projects two thousand and five mother nature kicked our arse i think we can pretty much assume that two thousand and five was a horrific year when it comes to natural disasters and because of the internet and because of
we run from a couple of laptops in the first couple of days i had four thousand emails from people needing help so we began to get involved in projects there and i'll talk about some others
and then of course this year we've been responding to katrina as well as following up on our reconstruction works this is a brief overview
in two thousand and four i really couldn't manage the number of people who wanted to help or the number of requests that i was getting it was all coming into my laptop and cell phone so we decided to embrace an open
problems are local all solutions are local so and that means you know somebody who is based in in mississippi knows more about mississippi than i do so
what happened is we used meetup and all these other kind of internet tools and we ended up having forty chapters starting up thousands of architects in one hundred and four countries
so the the bullet point sorry i never do a suit so i knew that i was going to take this off ok because i'm going to do it very quick so
the past seven years this isn't just about nonprofit what it showed me is that there's a grassroots movement going on
socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller and that we have the opportunity not the responsibility but the opportunity to really get involved in making change
i'm adding that to my time so
what you don't know is we've got these thousands of designers working around the world connected basically by a website and we have a staff of three
by doing something the fact that nobody told us we couldn't do it we did it and so there's something to be said about naivete so seven years later
we've developed so that we've got advocacy instigation and implementation we advocate for good design not only through student workshops and lectures and public forums op
we have a book on humanitarian work but also disaster mitigation and dealing with public policy we can talk about fema but that's another talk
a reality until it's built so it's really important that if we're designing and trying to create change we build that change
so here 's a select number of projects kosovo
this is kosovo in ninety nine we did an open design competition like i said it led to a whole variety of ideas and this
emergency shelter but transitional shelter that would last five to ten years that would be placed next to the land the resident lived in
and that they would rebuild their own home this wasn't imposing an architecture on a community this was giving them the tools and and the space to allow them to rebuild and regrow the way they want to
we have from the sublime to the ridiculous but they worked this is an inflatable hemp house it was built it works this is a shipping container
built and works and a whole variety of ideas that not only dealt with architectural building but also the issues of governance and the idea of creating communities through complex networks
so we've engaged not just designers but also you know a whole variety of technology based professionals using rubble from destroyed homes to create new homes using
and so we came up with the bright idea that instead of getting people to walk ten fifteen kilometers to see doctors you get the doctors to the people and we started engaging the the medical community
and i thought you know we thought we were real bright you know sparks we've come up with this great idea mobile health clinics that can widely distributed throughout sub saharan africa and the community the medical community there said we 've said this for the last decade
we know this we just don't know how to show this so in a way we had taken a pre existing need and shown solutions and so again we had a whole variety of ideas that came in
this one i personally love because the idea that architecture is not just about solutions but about raising awareness this is a kenaf clinic you get seed and you grow it in a plot of land and then
and it grows fourteen feet in a month and on the fourth week the doctors come and they mow out an area put a tensile structure on the top and
when the doctors have finished treating and seeing patients and villagers you cut down the clinic and you eat it it's an eat your own clinic so it's dealing with the fact that
if you have aids you also need to have nutrition rates and the idea that the idea of nutrition is as important as getting anti retrovirals out there so you know this is a serious solution
this one i love the idea is it's not just a clinic it's a community center this looked at setting up trade routes and economic engines within the community so it can be a self sustaining project every one of these projects is sustainable
you have to know where your energy is coming from you have to know where your resource is coming from and you have to keep the maintenance down so this is about getting an economic engine and then at night it turns into a movie theater so it's not an aids clinic it's
a community center so you can see ideas and these ideas
from that we also developed siyathemba which was a project the community came to us and said the problem is that the girls don't have education
and we're working in an area where young women between the ages of sixteen and twenty four have a fifty percent hiv aids
and that's not because they're promiscuous it's because there's no knowledge and so we decided to look at the idea of sports and create a youth sports center that doubled as an hiv aids outreach center
and the coaches of the girls team were also trained doctors so that there would be a very slow way of developing
they said this is our design because it's not only about engaging a community it's about empowering a community and about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding process
so the winning design is here and
then of course we actually go and work with the community and the clients so this is the designer he 's out there working with the first ever women 's soccer team in kwa zulu natal siyathemba and
a consultant and i'm also the national also play in
for the team called tembisa which has now changed to this is
in tanzania and we met literally a couple of months ago we've already developed a design and the team is over there working in partnership this was a matchmaking thanks to a couple of tedsters
and andrew zolli who connected me with this amazing african woman and we start construction in june and it will be opened by tedglobal so when you come to tedglobal you can check it out
but what we're known probably most for is dealing with disasters and development and we've been involved in a lot of issues such as
the tsunami and also things like hurricane katrina this is a three hundred and seventy dollar shelter that can be easily assembled
this is a community design a community designed community center and what that means is we actually live and work with the community
and they're part of the design process
the kids actually get involved in mapping out where the the community center should be and then eventually the community is actually through skills training end up building the building with us
here is another school this is what the u n gave these guys for six months twelve plastic tarps this was in august
so we said if the rain 's coming down let 's get fresh water so every one of our schools have rain water collection systems very low cost
it's built by the parents of the kids the kids are out there on site building the buildings and it opened a couple of weeks ago and there's six hundred kids that are now using the schools
so disaster hits home we've see the bad stories on cnn and fox and all that but we don't see the good stories
here is a community that got together and they said no to wait to waiting they formed a partnership a diverse partnership of
to actually map out east biloxi to figure out who is getting involved we've had one thousand five hundred volunteers rebuilding rehabbing homes
utility room for a woman who is on a walker she's seventy years old this is what fema gave her six hundred bucks happened two days ago
we put together very quickly a washroom it's built it's running and she just started a business today where she's washing other peoples clothes this is
the calhouns they're photographers who have documented the lower ninth for the last forty years that was their home and these are the photographs they took and we're helping working with them to create a new building
this is the u n tent
this is the new u n tent just introduced this year quick to assemble it's got a flap that's the invention
it took twenty years to design this and get it implemented in the field i was twelve years old
there's a problem here luckily we're not alone there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
more hemp houses it's a theme in japan
this is a grip clip designed by somebody who said all you need is some way to attach membrane structures to physical support beams
this guy designed for nasa is now doing housing i'm going to whip through this quickly because i know i've got only a couple of minutes china
the average age of a designer who gets involved in this project is thirty two that's how old i am so it's a young
the best designed toilet in the world if you're ever ever in india go use this toilet
chris luebkeman will tell you why i'm sure that's how he wanted to spend the party but
but the future is not going to be the sky scraping cities of new york but this and when you look at this you see crisis what i see is many many inventors
one billion people live in abject poverty we hear about them all the time four billion live in growing but fragile economies
one in seven live in unplanned settlements if we do nothing about the housing crisis that's about to happen in twenty years one in three people will live in an unplanned settlement or a refugee camp
look left look right one of you will be there how do we improve the living standards of five billion people
with ten million solutions so i wish to develop a community that actively embraces innovative and sustainable design to improve the living conditions that's my wish
that's my wish we
open source architecture is the way to go you have a diverse community of participants and we're not just talking about inventors and designers but we're talking about the funding model
my role is not as a designer it's a conduit between the design world and the humanitarian world and what we need is something that replicates me globally because i haven't slept in seven years
in the west taking their idea and basically profiting from it so creative commons has developed the developing nations license
and what that means that a designer can the siyathemba project i showed was the first ever building to have a creative commons license on it
why not allow designers the opportunity to do this but still protecting their rights here we want to have a community where you can upload ideas and those ideas can be tested in earthquake in flood
in all sorts of austere environments the reason that's important is i don't want to wait for the next katrina to find out if my house works
that's too late we need to do it now so doing that globally and i want this whole thing to work
when you look at the face of an architect most people think a gray haired white guy i don't see that i see the face of the world
so i want everyone from all over the planet to be able to be a part of this design and development the idea of needs based competitions x prize for the other ninety eight percent if you want to call it that
we also want to look at ways of matchmaking and putting funding partners together and the idea of integrating manufacturers fab labs in every country
when i hear about the one hundred dollar laptop and it's going to educate every child educate every designer in the world put one in every favela every
slum settlement because you know what innovation will happen and i need to know that it's called the leap back we talk about leapfrog technologies
i write with worldchanging and the one thing we've been talking about is i learn more on the ground than i've ever learned here so let 's take those ideas adapt them and we can use them
these ideas are supposed to have adaptable they're allowed to be they should have the potential for evolution they should be developed by every nation on the world and useful for every nation on the world
what will it take there should be a sheet i don't have time to read this because i'm going to be yanked off
well what will it take you guys are smart so it's going to take a lot of computing power because i want this to i want the idea that any laptop anywhere in the world can plug into the system
i want every arup engineer in the world to check and make sure that we're doing stuff that's standing because those guys are the best in the world
and so you know i want these and i just should note i have two laptops and one of them there is there and that has three thousand designs on it if i drop that laptop what happens
so it's important to have these proven ideas put up there easy to use easy to get
my mom once said there's nothing worse than being all mouth and no trousers
fed up of talking about making change you only make it by doing it we've changed fema guidelines we've changed public policy we've changed international response
based on building things so for me it's important that we create a real conduit for innovation and that it's free innovation think of free culture this is free innovation
somebody said this a couple of years back
i will give points for those who know it i think the man was
maybe twenty five years too early so let 's do it thank you
