i woke up the morning after i gave that talk
with the worst vulnerability hangover
the first time i left was to meet a friend
that i became a researcher to avoid vulnerability and that when being vulnerable emerged from my data
as absolutely essential to whole hearted living
i told these five hundred people that i had a breakdown
then we 'd have to break into his dorm room and then erase the tape 'm thinking to myself
so i looked back up and she said
are you really going to try to break in
and steal the video before they put it on youtube
if five hundred turns into one thousand
i had no contingency plan for four million
and maybe the hardest part about my life ending is that i
staying right under the radar
but i want to talk about what i 've learned there 's two things that i 've learned in the last year and that myth
how many of you honestly when you 're thinking about doing something vulnerable or saying something vulnerable
think god vulnerability 's weakness this is weakness how many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously vulnerability is not weakness
vulnerability is not weakness emotional risk
emotional risk exposure uncertainty
it fuels our daily lives
that vulnerability is our most accurate measurement of courage
to be vulnerable to let ourselves be seen to be honest
one of the weird things that 's happened is after the ted explosion i got a lot of offers to speak all over the country everyone from schools and parent meetings to fortune five hundred companies and so many of the calls went like this hey dr brown we loved your tedtalk we 'd like you to come in and speak
we 'd appreciate it if you wouldn 't mention vulnerability or shame
there 's three big answers this is mostly to be honest with you from the business sector innovation creativity and change
so let me go on the record
there 's nothing more vulnerable than that
adaptability to change is all about vulnerability
the second thing in addition to really finally understanding
the relationship between vulnerability and courage the second thing i learned is this
we have to talk about shame
and i 'm going to be really honest with you
and that became the focus because of the tedtalk and i 'm not kidding i 'll give you an example about
three months ago i was in a sporting goods store buying goggles and shin guards and all the things that parents buy at the sporting goods store about from a hundred
feet away this is what i hear vulnerability ted vulnerability ted
our family motto is lock and load i am not a natural vulnerability researcher
you 're the shame researcher who had the breakdown
and she looks back and does this
we watched your tedtalk in my book
then we read your book and we renamed ourselves the breakdown babes
she said our tagline is we 're falling apart and it feels
like ninja barbie but i 'm vulnerability ted
i thought i 'm going to leave that shame stuff behind because i spent six years studying shame before i really started writing and talking about vulnerability and i thought thank god because shame is this horrible topic no one wants to talk about it it 's the best way to shut people down on an airplane what do you do i study shame
i was reminded of a cardinal rule not a research rule but a moral imperative
and i did not learn about vulnerability and courage and creativity and innovation from studying vulnerability
i learned about these things from studying shame
and so i want to walk you in to shame
the swampland of the soul
and we 're going to walk in and the purpose is not to walk in and construct a home and live there
it is to put on some galoshes
and walk through and find our way around
because you cannot talk about race without talking about privilege and when people start talking about privilege they get paralyzed by shame
we heard a brilliant simple solution
to not killing people in surgery which is have a checklist
you can 't fix that problem without addressing shame because when they teach those folks how to suture
they also teach them how to stitch their self worth to being all powerful
and all powerful folks don 't need myshkin ingawale
and he said i saw this need so you know what i did i made it and everybody just burst into applause and they were like yes and he said and it didn 't work
and then i made it thirty two more times
because very few people here are afraid to fail
and no one who gets on the stage so far that i 've seen has not failed because of shame
there 's a great quote that saved me this past year by theodore roosevelt
a lot of people refer to it as the man in the arena quote
whose face is marred with dust and blood
but when he fails when he loses he does so daring greatly
and that 's what this conference to me is about
that 's what life is about about daring greatly about being in the arena when you walk up to that arena and you put your hand on the door and you think i 'm going in and i 'm going to try this
shame is the gremlin who says
i know your dad really wasn 't in luxembourg he was in sing sing
i know you don 't think that you 're pretty enough or smart enough or talented enough or powerful enough
and say i 'm going to do this
and if you can talk it out of that one
shame is a focus on self guilt is a focus on behavior shame is i am bad guilt is i did something bad
how many of you if you did something that was hurtful to me would be willing to say i 'm sorry i made a mistake how many of you would be willing to say that
guilt i 'm sorry i made a mistake shame i 'm sorry i am a mistake
shame is highly highly correlated with addiction depression violence aggression bullying suicide eating disorders
the ability to hold something we 've done or failed to do up against who we want to be is incredibly adaptive it 's uncomfortable but it 's adaptive
the other thing you need to know about shame is it 's absolutely organized by gender
if shame washes over me and washes over chris
it 's going to feel the same
everyone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame
we 're pretty sure that the only people who don 't experience shame are people who have no capacity for connection or empathy
which means yes i have a little shame no i 'm a sociopath
so i would opt for yes you have a little shame
shame feels the same for men and women but it 's organized by gender
i don 't know how much perfume that commercial sold but i guarantee you it moved a lot of antidepressants and anti anxiety meds
conflicting competing expectations about who we 're supposed to be
and it 's a straight jacket
for men shame is not a bunch of competing conflicting expectations
and he said that 's convenient
you say to reach out tell our story
because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else
so i started interviewing men and asking questions
and what i learned is this
you show me a woman who can actually sit with a man in real vulnerability and fear
i 'll show you a woman who 's done incredible work
you show me a man who can sit with a woman
can 't do it all anymore
and his first response is not i unloaded the dishwasher but he really listens
but he really listens shame is an epidemic
to find our way back to each other we have to understand how it affects us and how it affects the way we 're parenting the way we 're working the way we 're looking at each other
very quickly some research by mahalik at boston college
he asked what do women need to do to conform to female norms the top answers in this country
nice thin modest and use all available resources for appearance
when he asked about men what do men in this country need to do to conform with male norms the answers were always show emotional control
always show emotional control work is first
and know empathy because empathy 's the antidote to shame
if you put shame in a petri dish
it needs three things to grow exponentially secrecy silence and judgment
if you put the same amount of shame in a petri dish and douse it with empathy it can 't survive
the two most powerful words when we 're in struggle me too
and so i 'll leave you with this thought
if we 're going to find our way back to each other
vulnerability is going to be that
and i know it 's seductive to stand outside the arena because i think i did it my whole life
when i 'm bulletproof and when i 'm perfect
and that is seductive but the truth is
when you got in there that 's not what we want to see
we want you to go in
we want to be with you and across from you and we just want
for ourselves and the people we care about and the people we work with
