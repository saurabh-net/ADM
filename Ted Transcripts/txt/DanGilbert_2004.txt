have twenty one minutes to speak two million years seems like a really long time but evolutionarily two million years is nothing and yet in two million years
the human brain has nearly tripled in mass going from the one and a quarter pound brain of our ancestor here habilis to the almost three pound meatloaf that everybody here has between their ears what is it
about a big brain that nature was so eager for every one of us to have one well it turns out when brains triple in size they don't just get three times bigger they gain new structures
and one of the main reasons our brain got so big is because it got a new part called the frontal lobe and particularly a part called the pre frontal cortex
turns out the pre frontal cortex does lots of things but one of the most important things it does is that it is an experience simulator flight
before they try them out in real life this is a trick that none of our ancestors could do and that no other animal can do quite like we can
all of you have done this i mean you know ben and jerry 's doesn't have liver and onion ice cream it's not because they whipped some up tried it and went yuck
it's because without leaving your armchair you can simulate that flavor and say yuck before you make it
let 's see how your experience simulators are working let 's just run a quick diagnostic before i proceed with the rest of the talk
here 's two different futures that i invite you to contemplate and you can try to simulate them and tell me which one you think you might prefer
one of them is winning the lottery this is about three hundred and fourteen million dollars and the other is becoming paraplegic
so just give it a moment of thought you probably don't feel like you need a moment of thought interestingly there are data on these two groups of people data on how happy they are and this is exactly what you expected isn't
but these aren't the data i made these up these are the data you failed the pop quiz and you're hardly five minutes into the lecture because the fact is
after losing the use of their legs and a year after winning the lotto lottery winners and
are equally happy with their lives now don't feel too bad about failing the first pop quiz because everybody fails all of the pop quizzes all of the time
the research that my laboratory has been doing that economists and psychologists around the country have been doing have revealed something really quite startling to us
we see that winning or losing an election gaining or losing a romantic partner getting or not getting a promotion passing or not passing a college test on and on
have far less impact less intensity and much less duration than people expect them to have in fact a recent study this almost floors me a recent study showing how
major life traumas affect people suggests that if it happened over three months ago with only a few exceptions it has no impact whatsoever on your happiness
i have that in me that can convert poverty to riches adversity to prosperity i am more invulnerable than achilles fortune hath not one place to hit me
human beings have something that we might think of as a psychological immune system a system of cognitive processes largely non conscious cognitive processes
that help them change their views of the world so that they can feel better about the worlds in which they find themselves like sir thomas you have this machine unlike sir thomas you seem not to know it
we synthesize happiness but we think
is a thing to be found now you don't need me to give you too many examples of people synthesizing happiness i suspect though i'm going to show you some experimental evidence you don't have to look very far for evidence
as a challenge to myself since i say this once in a while in lectures i took a copy of the new york times
one minute 's regret it was a glorious experience i believe it turned out for the best who are these characters who are so damn happy well the first one is jim wright some of you are old enough to remember he was the chairman of the house of representatives
and he resigned in disgrace when this young republican named newt gingrich found out about a shady book deal he had done he lost everything the most powerful democrat in the country he lost everything he lost his money he lost his power
a really neat idea so he went to find them they said we can give you a franchise on this for three thousand bucks harry went back to new york asked his brother who 's an investment banker to loan him the three thousand dollars and his brother 's immortal words were you idiot nobody eats hamburgers
to say i 'm happier than i would have been with the beatles okay there's something important to be learned from these people and it is the secret of happiness here it is finally to be revealed
first accrue wealth power and prestige then
second spend as much of your life in prison as you possibly can
third make somebody else really really rich and finally never ever join the
ok now i like ze frank can predict your next thought which is yeah right because when people synthesize happiness as these gentlemen seem to have done
we all smile at them but we kind of roll our eyes and say yeah right you never really wanted the job oh yeah right you really didn't have that much in common with her and you figured that out just about the time she threw the engagement ring in your face
we smirk because we believe that synthetic happiness is not of the same quality as what we might call natural happiness what are these terms
and in our society we have a strong belief that synthetic happiness is of an inferior kind why do we have that belief well it's very simple
what kind of economic engine would keep churning if we believed that not getting what we want could make us just as happy as getting it
with all apologies to my friend matthieu ricard a shopping mall full of zen monks is not going to be particularly profitable because they don't want stuff
i want to suggest to you that synthetic happiness is every bit as real and
as the kind of happiness you stumble upon when you get exactly what you were aiming for now i'm a scientist so i'm going to do this not with rhetoric but by marinating you in a little bit of data
let me first show you an experimental paradigm that is used to demonstrate the synthesis of happiness among regular old folks and this isn't mine this is a fifty year old paradigm called the free choice paradigm it's very simple you bring in say six objects
we happen to have some extra prints in the closet we're going to give you one as your prize to take home we happen to have number three and number four we tell the subject
a bit of a difficult choice because neither one is preferred strongly to the other but naturally people tend to pick number three because they liked it a little better than number four
sometime later it could be fifteen minutes it could be fifteen days the same stimuli are put before the subject and the subject is asked to re rank the stimuli tell us how much you like them now
what happens watch as happiness is synthesized this is the result that has been replicated over and over again you're watching happiness be synthesized would you like to see it again happiness the
i got is really better than i thought that other one i didn't get
that's the synthesis of happiness now what's the right response to that yeah
here 's the experiment we did and i would hope this is going to convince you that yeah right was not the right response
we did this experiment with a group of patients who had anterograde amnesia these are hospitalized patients most of them have korsakoff 's syndrome a polyneuritic psychosis that
they drank way too much and they can't make new memories ok they remember their childhood but if you walk in and introduce yourself and then leave the room when you come back they don't know who you are
we took our monet prints to the hospital and we asked these patients to rank them from the one they liked the most to the one they liked the least
we then gave them the choice between number three and number four like everybody else they said gee thanks doc that's great i could use a new print i'll take number three
we explained we would have number three mailed to them we gathered up our materials and we went out of the room and counted to a half hour
if i've met you before i don't remember really jim you don't remember i was just here with the monet prints sorry doc i just don't have a clue no problem jim
all i want you to do for me is rank these from the one you like the most to the one you like the least what do they do well let 's first check and make sure they're really
we ask these amnesiac patients to tell us which one they own which one they chose last time which one is theirs and what we find is amnesiac patients just guess
here 's what normal controls do they synthesize happiness right
this is the change in liking score the change from the first time they ranked to the second time they ranked normal controls show that was the magic i showed you now i'm showing it to you in graphical form
the one i own is better than i thought the one i didn't own the one i left behind is not as good as i thought
yeah right is not the right response
what these people did when they synthesized happiness is they really truly changed their affective hedonic aesthetic reactions to that poster
they're not just saying it because they own it because they don't know they own it now
when psychologists show you bars
you know that they are showing you averages of lots of people and yet all of us have this psychological immune system this capacity to synthesize happiness
but some of us do this trick better than others and some situations allow anybody to do it more effectively than other situations do
to make up your mind and change your mind
is the friend of natural happiness because it allows you to choose among all those delicious futures
find the one you most enjoy but freedom to choose to change and make up your mind is the enemy of synthetic happiness and i'm going to show you why
my own paper egad man look at the quality of the free paper compared to your lousy regular paper only a fool or a liar would say that they look the same ah now that you mention it it does seem a little silkier
what are you doing i 'm helping people accept the things they cannot change indeed
the psychological immune system works best when we are totally stuck when we are trapped
find a way to be happy with
now what i want to show you is that people don't know this about themselves and not knowing this
can work to our supreme disadvantage here 's an experiment we did at harvard we created a photography course a black and white photography course and we allowed students to come in and learn how to use a darkroom
so we gave them cameras they went around campus they took twelve pictures of their favorite professors and their dorm room and their dog and all the other things they wanted to have harvard memories
blow two of them up and they have two gorgeous eight by ten glossies of meaningful things to them and we say which one would you like to give up they say i have to give one up oh yes we need one
to yeah headquarters i 'll be glad to swap it out with you in fact i'll come to your dorm room and give just give me an email better yet i'll check with you
want to change your mind it's totally returnable the other half of the students are told exactly the opposite
make your choice and by the way the mail is going out gosh in two minutes to england your picture will be winging its way over the atlantic you will never see it again now
half of the students in each of these conditions are asked to make predictions about how much they're going to come to like the picture that they keep and the picture they leave behind other students are just sent back
to their little dorm rooms and they are measured over the next three to six days on their liking satisfaction with the pictures and look at what we find first of all here 's what students think is going to happen
think they're going to maybe come to like the picture they chose a little more than the one they left behind but
these are not statistically significant differences it's a very small increase and it doesn't much matter whether they were in the reversible or irreversible condition wrong
bad simulators because here 's what's really happening both right before the swap and five days later people who are stuck with that
and people who are deliberating should i return it have i gotten the right one maybe this isn't the good one maybe i left the good one have killed themselves
they don't like their picture and in fact even after the opportunity to swap has expired they still don't like their picture why because the
we could do it so that when you take the two pictures you'd have four days to change your mind or we're doing another course where you take the two pictures and you make up your mind right away and you can never change it which course would you like to be in
sixty six percent of the students two thirds prefer to be in the course where they have the opportunity to change their mind hello sixty six percent of the students choose to be in the course in which they will ultimately be deeply with the picture
they do not know the conditions under which synthetic happiness grows
the bard said everything best of course and he 's making my point here but he 's making it hyperbolically tis nothing good or bad but thinking makes it so
it's nice poetry but that can't exactly be right is there really nothing good or bad is it really the case that gall bladder surgery
a trip to paris are just the same thing that seems like a one question
they can't be exactly the same in more turgid prose but closer to the truth was the father of modern capitalism adam smith and he said this this is worth contemplating the great source of both the misery and disorders of human life
seems to arise from overrating the difference between one permanent situation and another some of these situations may no doubt deserve to be preferred
to others but none of them can deserve to be pursued with that
passionate ardor which drives us to violate the rules either of prudence or of justice or to corrupt the future tranquility of our minds either by shame from the remembrance of our own folly
or by remorse for the horror of our own injustice in other words yes some things are better than others we should have preferences that lead us into one future over another
but when those preferences drive us too hard and too fast because we have overrated the difference between these futures we are
risk when our ambition is bounded it leads us to work joyfully when our ambition is unbounded it leads us to lie to cheat to steal to hurt others to sacrifice things of real value when our fears are bounded
we're prudent we're cautious we're thoughtful when our fears are unbounded and overblown
we're reckless and we're cowardly the lesson i want to leave you with from these data is that our longings and our worries are both to some degree overblown because we have within us
the capacity to manufacture the very commodity we are constantly chasing when we choose experience thank you
