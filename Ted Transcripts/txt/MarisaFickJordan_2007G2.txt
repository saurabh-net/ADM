use of wire in southern africa dates back hundreds of years but modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material in the form of telephone wire
the change from use starting to use contemporary materials these pieces date back from the forties to the late
in the nineties my interest and passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form which came from a squatter camp outside durban
and i got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point and started developing really and mentoring them in terms of scale in terms of the
and the project soon grew from five to fifty weavers in about a year soon we had outgrown the scrap yards what they could provide
at the same time i was thinking well there's lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products away from the ethnic a little bit more
so i developed a whole range around mass produced range that obviously fitted into a much higher end decor market that could be exported and also service our local
and we supply the conran shops and donna karan and so it's kind of great this is our group our main group of weavers
they come on a weekly basis to durban they all have bank accounts they've all moved back to the rural area where they came from it's a weekly turnaround of production
this is the community that i originally showed you the slide of and that's also modernized today and it's supporting work for three hundred weavers and the rest says it all thank you very
