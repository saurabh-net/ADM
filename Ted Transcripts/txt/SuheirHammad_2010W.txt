i will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum i will not dance to that beating
i know that beat it is lifeless
i know intimately that skin you are hitting it was alive hunted stolen stretched
i will not dance to your drummed up war i will not pop spin break for you i will not hate for you or even hate
you i will not kill for you especially i will not die for you
i will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide i will not side with you or dance to bombs because everyone is dancing
everyone can be wrong life is a right not collateral or casual i will not forget where i come from
i will craft my own drum gather my beloved near and our chanting will be dancing our humming will be drumming i will not be played i will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat i will dance
and resist and dance and persist and dance this heartbeat is louder than death
your war drum ain't louder than this up ted people
i understand i've been wrong
that means is prepping my outfit prepping options trying to figure out what i'm coming behind and going
but i'm going to need you to just sit for like ten minutes and hold a woman who is not here hold her now with you
this is break clustered all holy history banned unwritten books predicted
the future projected the past but my head unwraps around what appears limitless man 's creative violence
whose son shall it be
which male child will perish a new day our boys deaths galvanize we cherish corpses
we mourn women complicated bitches get beat daily profits made prophets ignored
i live cycles of light and darkness rhythm is half silence i see now i never was one and not the other
sickness health tender violence i think now i never was pure before form i was storm
blind ign 'ant still am human contracted itself blind malignant i never
was pure girl spoiled before ripened language can't math me i experience exponentially
everything is everything one woman loses fifteen maybe twenty members of her family one woman loses six one woman loses her head one woman searches rubble
one woman feeds on trash one woman shoots her face one woman shoots her husband one woman straps herself one woman gives birth to a baby one woman gives birth to borders one woman no longer believes love will ever find her one woman never did where do refugee hearts go
broken dissed placed where they're not from don't want to be missed faced with absence we mourn each one or we mean nothing at all
my spine curves spiral precipice running to and running from human beings cluster bombs left behind
de facto landmines a smoldering grief harvest contaminated tobacco
palms smoke harvest witness smoke resolutions smoke salvation smoke redemption smoke breathe
breathe not fear what has
blown up if you must fear the unexploded thank you
