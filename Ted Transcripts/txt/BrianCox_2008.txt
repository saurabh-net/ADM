this is the large hadron collider it's twenty seven kilometers in circumference it's the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted
ten thousand physicists and engineers from eighty five countries around the world have come together over several decades to build this machine
what we do is we accelerate protons so hydrogen nuclei around ninety nine point nine nine nine nine nine nine percent the speed of light
that speed they go around that twenty seven kilometers eleven thousand times a second and we collide them with another beam of protons going in the opposite direction
we collide them inside giant detectors they're essentially digital cameras and this is the one that i work on atlas you get some sense of the size you can just see these eu standard size people
the size forty four meters wide twenty two meters in diameter seven thousand tons and we re create the conditions that were present
less than a billionth of a second after the universe began up to six hundred million times a second inside that detector immense numbers
see those metal bits there those are huge magnets that bend electrically charged particles so it can measure how fast they're traveling this is a picture about a year ago
those magnets are in there and again an eu standard size real person so you get some sense of the scale and it's in there that those mini big bangs will be created sometime in the summer this year and actually this morning i got an email saying that we've just finished today
building the last piece of atlas so as of today it's finished i'd like to say that i planned that for ted but i didn 't so it's been completed as of today
wonderful achievement so you might be asking why why create the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began
the hundred billion suns in our galaxy and the hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe absolutely everything now you might say well ok but why not just look at it you know if you want to know what i'm made of let 's look at me well
we found that as you look back in time the universe gets hotter and hotter denser and denser and simpler and simpler now there's no real reason i'm aware of for that but that seems to be the case
so way back in the early times of the universe we believe it was very simple and understandable all this complexity all the way to these wonderful things human brains
are a property of an old and cold and complicated universe back at the start in the first billionth of a second we believe or we've observed it was very simple
but as you heat it up it'll melt into a pool of water and you would be able to see that actually it was just made of h twenty water
in that same sense that we look back in time to understand what the universe is made of and as of today it's made of these things just twelve particles of matter stuck together by four forces of nature
the quarks these pink things are the things that make up protons and neutrons that make up the atomic nuclei in your body the electron the thing that goes around the atomic nucleus
held around in orbit by the way by the electromagnetic force that's carried by this thing the photon the quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons and these guys here they're the weak nuclear force probably the least familiar but without it the sun wouldn't shine
up the road relative to the universe it's just up the road
so this thing was discovered in the year two thousand so it's a relatively recent picture one of the wonderful things actually i find is that we've discovered any of them when you realize how tiny
a step in size from the entire observable universe so one hundred billion galaxies thirteen point seven billion light years away
a step in size from that to monterey actually is about the same as from monterey to these things absolutely exquisitely minute and yet we've discovered
so one of my most illustrious forebears at manchester university ernest rutherford discoverer of the atomic nucleus once said all science is either physics or stamp collecting
i don't think he meant to insult the rest of science although he was from new zealand so it's possible what he
was that what we've done really is stamp collect there ok we've discovered the particles but unless you understand the underlying reason for that pattern you know why it's built the way it is really you've done stamp collecting you haven't done science fortunately we have this is
a little disingenuous because i've expanded it out in all it's gory detail this equation though allows you to calculate everything other than gravity that happens in the universe so you want to know why the sky is blue why atomic nuclei stick together
in principle you've got a big enough computer why dna is the shape it is in principle you should be able to calculate it from that equation
can anyone see what it is a bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me i'll make it easier actually by blowing one of the lines up
basically each of these terms refers to some of the particles so those ws there refer to the ws and how they stick together
these carriers of the weak force the zeds the same but there's an extra symbol in this equation h right h h stands for higgs particle
so all the exquisitely detailed calculations we can do with that wonderful equation wouldn't be possible without an extra bit so it's a prediction a prediction of a new particle
what does it do well we had a long time to come up with good analogies and back in the nineteen eighties when we wanted the money for the lhc from the uk government
the whole universe is full of something called a higgs field higgs particles if you will the analogy is that these people in a room are the higgs particles
now when a particle moves through the universe it can interact with these higgs particles but imagine someone who 's not very popular moves through the room then everyone ignores them
they can just pass through the room very quickly essentially at the speed of light they're massless and imagine someone incredibly important and popular and intelligent
heavy in a sense and massive because they're surrounded by higgs particles they're interacting with the higgs field if that picture 's true then we have to discover those higgs particles at the lhc
so that's one of the prime reasons we built this giant machine i'm glad you recognize margaret thatcher actually i thought about making it more culturally relevant but
so that's one thing that's essentially a guarantee of what the lhc will find there are many other things you've heard many of the big problems in particle physics one of them you heard about dark matter dark energy
so the electromagnetic force the force that holds us together gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures the strong force the strong nuclear force which sticks nuclei together gets weaker
what you see is the standard model you can calculate how these change is the forces the three forces other than gravity almost seem to come together at one point it's almost as if there was one beautiful kind of super force back at the beginning of time but they just
theory called supersymmetry which doubles the number of particles in the standard model which at first sight doesn't sound like a simplification but actually with this theory we find that the forces of nature do seem to unify together back at the big bang
many other things that the lhc could discover but in the last few minutes i just want to give you a different perspective
i think what particle physics really means to me particle physics and cosmology and that's that i think it's given us a wonderful
and i'd say that it deserves in the spirit of wade davis talk to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories of the peoples of the high andes and the frozen north this is a creation story i think equally as wonderful
the story goes like this we know that the universe began thirteen point seven billion years ago in an immensely hot dense state much smaller than a single atom
after the big bang gravity separated away from the other forces the universe then underwent an exponential expansion called inflation
in about the first billionth of a second or so the higgs field kicked in and the quarks and the gluons and the electrons that make us up got mass the universe continued to expand and cool after about
a few minutes there was hydrogen and helium in the universe that's all the universe was about seventy five percent hydrogen twenty five percent helium it still is today
to expand about three hundred million years then light began to travel through the universe it was big enough to be transparent to light and that's what we see in the cosmic microwave background that george smoot described as looking at the face of god
so the elements of life carbon and oxygen and iron all the elements that we need to make us up were cooked in those first generations of stars
fuel exploded threw those elements back into the universe they then re collapsed into another generation of stars
and planets and on some of those planets the oxygen which had been created in that first generation of stars could fuse with hydrogen to form water liquid water on the surface on at least one
and on maybe only one of those planets primitive life evolved which evolved over millions of years into things that walked upright and left footprints about three and a half million years ago in the mud flats of tanzania and eventually
left a footprint on another world and built this civilization this wonderful picture that turned the darkness into light and you can see the civilization from space as one of my great heroes carl sagan said these are the things
and actually not only these but i was looking around these are the things like saturn v rockets and sputnik and dna and literature and science these are the things that hydrogen atoms do when given thirteen point seven billion years
carbon and oxygen wouldn't be stable inside the hearts of stars and there would be none of that in the universe and i think
it makes me really feel that that civilization which as i say if you believe the scientific creation story
emerged purely as a result of the laws of physics and a few hydrogen atoms then i think to me anyway it makes me feel incredibly valuable
so that's the lhc the lhc is certainly when it turns on in summer going to write the next chapter of that book and i'm certainly looking forward with immense excitement to it being turned on thanks
