i want to help you re perceive what philanthropy is what it could be
and what your relationship to it
and in doing that i want to offer you a vision an imagined future if you will of how as
the poet seamus heaney has put it once in a lifetime
the longed for tidal wave of justice can rise up
and hope and history rhyme
i want to start with
we all know which side of these we'd like to be on
they didn't think of themsevles on the wrong side of these either
but by the end of the twentieth century a new generation of critics and reformers
had come to see philanthropy just this way
the thing to watch for as a global philanthropy industry comes about and that's exactly what is happening
is how the aspiration is to flip these old assumptions for philanthropy to become open and big and fast and connected
in service of the long term this entrepreneurial energy is emerging from many quarters and it's driven and propelled forward by new leaders like many of the people here by new tools like the ones we've seen here by new pressures
i've been following this change for quite a while now and participating in it this report is our main public report what it tells is the story of how today actually could be as historic as one hundred years ago
what i want to do is share some of the coolest things that are going on with you
and as i do that i'm not going to dwell much on the very large philanthropy that everybody already knows about
the gates and the soros and the google
what i want to do is talk about the philanthropy of all of us
first is mass collaboration represented here by wikipedia now this may surprise you
clay shirky that great chronicler of everything networked
he said we have lived in this world where little things are done for love and big things for money now we have wikipedia watch this spring
for paul hawken 's new book author and entrepreneur many of you may know about the book is called blessed unrest and when it comes out a series of wiki sites under the label wiser are going to launch at the same time wiser stands for world index for social and environmental responsibility
wiser sets out to document link and empower what paul calls the largest movement and fastest growing movement in human history
humanity 's collective immune response to today 's threats
now all of these big things for love experiments aren't going to take off
but the ones that do are going to be the biggest the most open the fastest the most connected form of philanthropy in human history
this is of course to philanthropy what ebay and amazon are to commerce
think of it as peer to peer philanthropy
and this challenges yet another assumption
which is that organized philanthropy is only for the very wealthy
take a look if you haven 't at donorschoose omidyar network has made a big investment in donorschoose it's one of the best known of these new marketplaces where a donor can go straight
into a classroom and connect with what a teacher says they need take a look at changing the present started by a tedster next time you need a wedding present or a holiday present
the third category is represented by warren buffet
there are now today so many new funds that are aggregating giving and investing bringing together people
around a common goal to think bigger
the best known is acumen fund led by jacqueline novogratz a tedster who got a big boost here at ted but there are many others
new profit in cambridge new school 's venture fund in silicon valley venture philanthropy partners in washington venture capital private equity
and eventually mutual funds are
to investing but with a twist because often a community forms around these funds as it has at acumen and other places
now imagine for a second these first three
the mash up if you will of these things in the future when these things come together in the experiments of the future imagine that somebody puts
hundred million dollars for an inspiring goal there were twenty one gifts of one hundred million dollars or more in the us last year not out of the question
but only puts it up if it's matched by millions of small gifts from around the globe
thereby engaging lots of people and building visibility and engaging people in the goal that's stated
look quickly at the fourth and fifth categories which are innovation competitions and social investing
betting a visible competition a prize can attract talent and money to some of the most difficult issues and thereby speed the solution
and the organization is at the center as opposed to putting the problem at the center
especially with things that require technological or scientific solution
that leaves the final category social investing which is really anyway the biggest of them all represented here by xigi net
this of course tackles the biggest assumption of all
that business is business and philanthropy is the vehicle of people who want to create change in the world
is a new community site that's built by the community linking and mapping this new social capital market to help us
that if we can leverage even a small amount of the capital that it seeks to return
the good that can be driven
now what's really interesting here is that we're not
we're acting our way into a new way of thinking
and even though all of the experiments and all of the big givers don't yet fulfill this aspiration i think this is the open big
long we have got to realize that it is going to take a long time to do these things
stick with it all of this stuff is just going to be
and i'm hopeful because it's not only philanthropy that's reorganizing itself
it's also whole other portions of the social sector and of business
and everywhere i go inculding here at ted
what we're seeing is people really wrestling to describe what is this new thing that's happening words like philanthrocapitalism and natural capitalism and philanthroentrepreneur and venture philanthropy we don't have a language for it yet whatever we call it
whatever we call it it's new it's beginning
and i think it's gong to quite significant
going to call the social singularity many of you will realize that i'm ripping a bit off of the science fiction writer vernor vinge 's notion of a technological singularity where a number of trends accelerate and converge and come together to create really a shockingly new reality it may be
that the social singularity ahead
is the one that we fear the most
a convergence of catastrophes of environmental degradation
our ability to confront the problems that we face has not kept pace with our ability to create them
we hold the future of our civilization in our hands as never before
the question is is there a positive social singularity is there a frontier
future doesn't have to be imagined we can create a future where hope and history rhyme our experience to date
a new generation of citizen leaders
willing to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning as rapidly as possible
i keep this photograph close by to me
in my office because i've always felt a mystical connection to these two men both this blank slide
this a photograph of you
i want you to think about the community that you want to be part of creating whatever that means to you
and i want you to imagine
that it's one hundred years from now
and your grandchild or great grandchild
or niece or nephew or god child
is looking at this photograph of you what is the story
