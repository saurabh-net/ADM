so i thought i will talk about death
so art buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video that appeared soon after he died saying hi i'm art buchwald and i just died
and mike who i met at galapagos
which i won at ted
leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling his journey through cancer
and my father left me a legacy of his handwriting through letters and a notebook
in the last two years of his life when he was sick
he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me about my strengths
and held a mirror to my life
after he died i realized that no one writes to me anymore handwriting is a disappearing art i'm all for email and thinking while typing but why give up old habits for new
why can't we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives
there are times when i want to trade all those years that i was too busy to sit with my dad and chat
and trade all those years for
i take out his letters
maybe we all need to leave our children with a value legacy and not a financial one
value for things with a personal touch an autograph book a soul searching letter if a fraction of this powerful ted audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper john it'll be a recycled one
and write a beautiful letter to someone they love we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes
so what do i plan to leave for my son i collect autograph books and those of you authors in the audience know i hound you for them and cds too tracy i plan to publish my own notebook
as i witnessed my father 's body being swallowed by fire
i sat by his funeral pyre and wrote i have no idea how i'm going to do it but i am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book
and leave that published book for my son
i'd like to end with a few verses of what i wrote at my father 's cremation and those linguists please pardon the grammar because i've not looked at it in the last ten years i took it out for the first time to come here
boundless energy confined in the bottle
i hear you and i know that you would want me to be strong
right now i am being sucked down surrounded and suffocated by these raging emotional waters craving to cleanse my soul trying to emerge on a firm footing one more time to keep on fighting
just as you taught me
your encouraging whispers in my whirlpool of despair holding me to shores of sanity
