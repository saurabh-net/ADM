when i bachelored majoring in zoology in tel aviv university
how can i be practical or plant protection plant protection
plant protection plant protection i came into the
use of living organisms to reduce populations of noxious plant pests so it's a whole of chemicals and
about they've existed in the world for thousands and thousands of years
long long time but only in the last one hundred and twenty years
people started or people knew more and more how to exploit or how to use this biological control phenomenon or to their own needs
to their own needs just
just open it you just twist leaves and you see a whole new world
long and you can distinguish between the good ones and the bad ones so this phenomenon of just have a
just have a and
just a few examples what is a pest what
going to talk about insects and spiders or mites let us call them insects those
or mites the eight legged organisms let 's have a look at that here is a pest devastating pest a spider mite because it
you see the mother in between and two daughters probably on the left and right and a single egg on the right hand side and then you see
on your right hand side you can see a cucumber leaf and on the middle cotton leaf and on the left a tomato leaf with these little leaves they can literally turn from green to the sucking piercing
the sucking piercing parts of those spiders
but here comes nature that provides us with a good spider this is a predatory mite just as small as a spider mite by the way
long not more than that running quickly hunting chasing the spider mites and here you can see this lady in action
just pierces such the body fluids on the the
satiated individuals of predatory mites a mother on the left hand side a young nymph on the right hand side by the way a meal for them for twenty four hours is about five individuals of the spider mites of or fifteen to twenty
or fifteen to twenty sharply you can see
sharply you can see those bad ones those
all over the plants in your hibiscus in your lantana in the young fresh foliage of the spring flush so
called honeydew and this just globs the upper parts of the plant here you see a typical cucumber leaf that
from green to black because of a black fungus sooty mold which is covering it and here comes the
through this parasitic wasp here we are not talking about a predator here we are talking a parasite not a two legged parasite
this is a parasitic wasp again two millimeters long slender a
sharp flier and here you can see this parasite in action like in an acrobatic maneuver of
of she
and bites and secretes different liquids but nothing will happen in fact only the egg of the parasite will be be inserted
the body fluids of the aphid and after a few days depending upon temperature the egg will hatch and the larva of this parasitoid will eat the aphid from the inside your
time is very short this female can live only three to four days and she needs to give rise to around four hundred hundred eggs that means she has four hundred
a whole wealth of other the last example
the pest the thrips by the way all these weird names i
you can see this sweet peppers this is not just an exotic ornamental sweet pepper this is a sweet pepper which is not consumable because it is suffering from a viral disease transmitted by those thrip adults
small here you can see the adult black and two young
the good ones for example in a sweet pepper
so this is a very positive situation by the way no harm to the developing fruit no harm to the fruit set everything is just fine under these
you saw them on a one to one actually this in
actually this in what we
what we the natural control
thirty five thousand sq meters of
state of the art greenhouses there we are are mass producing those predatory mites those minute pirate bugs those parasitic wasps etc etc many different parts
and a nice hot summer which is an excellent condition
those creatures and by the way mass production it is not genetic manipulation there are no gmo 's genetically modified organisms whatsoever
nature and the only thing that we do we give them the optimal conditions under the greenhouses or in the climate rooms in order to proliferate multiply and
in fact you see under a microscope
the whole bunch of predatory mites you see
this one i have one gram of those predatory mites eighty thousand individuals
eighty thousand individuals are good enough
and we can produce from this believe you me
on an annual basis so this is what i call amplification of the phenomenon and no we do not disrupt the balance on the contrary because we actually see what is
successful biological control by good bugs for example in israel where we
more than one thousand hectares ten thousand dunams in israeli terms of biological pest controlling sweet pepper under protection seventy five percent
eighty percent of the pesticides especially those aimed against pest mites so the impact is
but if we go for example to this place southeast
the arava area above the great rift valley where the really top notch the pearl of the israeli agriculture is located especially
or under screenhouse conditions if you drive all the way to eilat you see this just in the middle of the desert and if you zoom in you can definitely watch this growers why
from the idea of resistance
that the pests will become resistant to the chemicals just in our case
resistance which happens in the and thirdly
and thirdly the more
growers become aware of the fact they should wherever they can and wherever possible replace the chemical control
even here there is another grower you see very interested in the bugs the bad ones and the good ones wearing this magnifier already on her head just walking safely in her
finally i want to get actually to my vision or in fact to my
i think it's times one hundred or something like that twenty five
so there is a huge gap to bridge
more robust good and reliable biological solutions more or actually
create even more intensive and strict public demand to reduction of chemicals in the agricultural fresh produce and thirdly also to increase awareness by the growers to the potential of and
so i think my last slide is
all we are saying we can actually sing it give nature a chance so i'm saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol petitioners and implementors in israel and abroad really
