i thought it was interesting to think back to that time when richard got the whole thing started thank you very much richard it's been a big enjoyable part of my life coming here
and so thinking back i was thinking those of us in silicon valley were really focused on products or objects certainly technological objects
and so it was great fun in those days and some of you who are in the audience were my clients we'd come in with some
if you were here last year i probably wrestled you to the floor and tried to show you my new eyemodule two which was a camera that plugged into the handspring
i took a lot of pictures last year very few people knew what i was up to but i took a lot of pictures this year maybe you could show the slides
this year we're carrying this treo which we had a lot to do with and helped handspring design it also though we designed it a few years ago it's just become ubiquitous in the last year or so this
and we're just about to announce the zinio reader product that i believe will make magazines even more enjoyable to read so we really will continue to focus on products but
but for us we've really just started to climb maslow 's hierarchy a little bit
and so we're now focused more and more on human centered design human centeredness in an approach to design
that really involves designing behaviors and personality into products and i think you're starting to see that and it's making our job even more enjoyable
enough we used to primarily build three d models you know you've seen some today and
three d renderings then we'd go and we'd show those as communicating our ideas but firms like ours
having to move to a point where we get those objects that we're designing and get them in motion showing how they'll be used and so
in order to do that we've been forming internal video production groups in order to make these kind of experience prototypes
that show just what we mean about the man machine relationship and it's a much better way to see it's kind of like architects who show people in their houses
as opposed to them being empty so i thought that i would show you a few videos to show off this new broader
definition of design in products and services and environments i have a few of them they're no more than a minute or a minute and a half apiece
but i thought you might be interested in seeing some of our work over the last year and how it responds in video
so prada new york we were asked by rem koolhaas and oma to help us conceive the technology that's in their retail store in new york
he wanted a new kind of store a new one a store that had a cultural role as well as a retail
so there 're lots of things everything has rf tags there's rf tags on the user on the cards there's the staff devices that are all around the store
you pick them up and once you see something that you're interested in the staff person can scan them in and then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store you can look at color and sizes and how it appeared on the runway or whatever
and so then the object the merchandise that you're interested in can be scanned it's taken into the dressing room and in the dressing room there are scanners so that we know exactly what
in as you're trying it on it's been used a lot of places but i particularly like
the use here of liquid crystal
the the whole wall goes dark so you can
try to get approval or not for
a year and a half ago
we were asked to design an installation in the museum this is a new wing of the science museum in london and it's primarily about digital and biomedical issues and
a group at itch which is part of ideo designed this interactive wall that's about four stories tall i don't know if anybody 's seen this it's pretty spectacular in the room
anyway it's based on the london subway system and so you can see that the goal is to bring some of the feedback that the people who had gone to the museum
giving and get it up on the wall so everybody could see just for everybody to see so you enter your information then like the london tube system
the little trains go around with what you're thinking about and then when you get to a station it's expanded so that you can actually read it
then when you exit the imax theatre on the fourth floor mostly teenagers coming out of there there's this big open space that has these tables
in it that have interactive games which are quite fun also designed by durrel of itch and the topics
include things that the museum is about male fertility choosing the sex of your baby or what a driverless car might be like
lots of room so people can come up and understand what it is before they get involved and also it's not shown in the video but these are very beautiful they go to the top of the wall
and when they reach all the way to the top after they've bounced around they disperse into bits and go off into the atmosphere
the next video is not done by us this is cbs sunday morning they aired about two weeks ago scott adams what's wrong with cubicles
though they work in a wide open office space spectacularly set under san francisco 's oakland bay bridge
the team built their own little
to fully experience the problems actually
is the idea of making the cubicle
so here 's the final thing complete with orange lighting that follows the sun across that follows the tracks of the sun across the sky so you feel that in your cubicle
and my favorite feature which is a flower in a vase that wilts when you leave in disappointment
has homey touches like a built in
so this building actually celebrates the water as it comes out of the recycling plant and goes into the reed bed so that it can be filtered for the final time
wander around and gather information in a straightforward fashion about the recycling process and what's being done and how they're going to reuse the water once it comes through the
and then if you saw the panels actually rotate so you can get the information on the front side but as they rotate you can see the actual recycling plant behind with all the machines as they actually process
these are all very low budget videos
we're announcing a new product here
tonight which is the first time this ever been shown in public
it's called spyfish and it's a company called h two eye started by nigel jagger in london and it's a company that's trying to
the experience many people have boats or enjoy being on boats but a very small percentage of people actually
have the capability or the interest in going under the water and actually seeing what's there and enjoying what scuba divers do this product it has two cameras you throw it over the side of your boat and you basically
dive without getting wet there's the object for us it was two projects one to design the interface
so that the interface doesn't get in your way you could have that kind of immersive experience of being underwater of feeling like you're underwater seeing what's going on
this project and just ready to start building
is a revolutionary subaquatic video camera it can dive to five hundred feet to where sunlight does not penetrate and is
it becomes your eyes and ears as
battery powered spyfish sends the live video feed through a slender cable
this slender cable was a huge technological advancement and it allowed the whole thing to be the size the whole system together
you watch the video with graphics that
fluid graphics and ambient sounds combine to help you completely lose yourself
and the last thing i'll talk about is approtec which is a project that i'm very excited about
products in kenya with kenyan manufacturers designed by people like us but taken there and to this date he 's been gone for only a few years he 's started nineteen thousand companies
he 's made thirty thousand new jobs
the sales of the products this is a non profit the sales of these products is now six percent of the gdp of kenya
this is one guy doing this this is a pretty spectacular thing so we're in the process of helping them design deep well low cost manual pumps in order for these people who have a quarter acre
of land to be able to grow crops in the off season what they do now is they can grow crops in the rainy season but they can't grow them in the off season and so by doing that
the woman that you saw in the first thing she's a school teacher always wanted to send her kids to college and she's going to be able to do it because of these things so with seed squeezers and pumps and hay balers and very straightforward things that we're designing
we also were thinking about the experience of richard and so we designed this hat
and i needed to deal with him so i just have one more thing to say i
product to approtec it's really exciting that we're taking a more human centered approach to design that we're including behaviors and personalities in the things we do and i think this is great
