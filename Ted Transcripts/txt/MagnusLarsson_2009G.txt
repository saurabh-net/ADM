to be at a conference dedicated to things not seen and present my proposal to build a six thousand kilometer long wall across the entire african continent
about the size of the great wall of china this would hardly be an invisible structure and yet it's made from parts that are invisible or near invisible to the naked eye bacteria and grains of sand
now as architects we're trained to solve problems but i don't really believe in architectural problems i only believe in opportunities which is why i'll show you a threat
and an architectural response the threat is desertification my response is a sandstone wall made from bacteria and solidified sand stretching across the desert
now sand is a magical material of beautiful contradictions it is simple and complex
it is peaceful and violent it is always the same never the same endlessly fascinating one billion grains of sand
come into existence in the world each second that's a cyclical process as rocks and mountains die
some of those grains may then accumulate on a massive scale into a sand dune in a way the static stone mountain becomes a moving mountain of
but moving mountains can be dangerous let me try and explain why doctory areas cover more than one third of the earth 's land surfaces some are already deserts others are being seriously degraded by the
just south of the sahara we find the sahel the name means edge of the desert and this is the region most closely associated with desertification it was here in the late sixties and early seventies
that major droughts brought three million people to become dependent upon emergency food aid with about up to two hundred and fifty thousand dying
this is a catastrophe waiting to happen again and it's one that gets very little attention in our accelerated media culture desertification is simply too slow to reach the headlines
it's nothing like a tsunami or a katrina too few crying children and smashed up houses
is a major threat on all continents affecting some one hundred and ten countries and about seventy percent of the world 's agricultural drylands
it seriously threatens the livelihoods of millions of people
and it is largely an issue that we've created for ourselves through unsustainable use of scarce resources so we get climate change we get droughts increased desertification crashing food systems water scarcity
if we fail to take this seriously but how far away is it i went to sokoto in northern nigeria to try and find out how far away it is
the dunes here move southward at a pace of around six hundred meters a year that's the sahara eating up almost one meter a day of the arable land physically pushing people away
from their homes here i am i'm the second person on
this is where the village used to be it took us about ten minutes to climb up to the top of that dune which goes to show why they had to move to a
that's the kind of forced migration that desertification can lead to if you happen to live close to the desert border you can pretty much calculate how long it will be before you have to carry your kids away and abandon your home and your life as you know now
four years ago twenty three african countries came together to create the great green wall sahara a fantastic project the initial plan called for a shelter belt of trees to be planted right across the african continent from mauritania in the west
all the way to djibouti in the east if you want to stop a sand dune from moving what you need to make sure to do is to stop the grains from avalanching over its crest
and a good way of doing that the most efficient way is to use some kind of sand catcher trees or cacti are good for this but one of the problems with planting trees is that the people in these regions are so poor that
now there is an alternative to just planting trees and hoping that they
it creates physical spaces habitable spaces inside of the sand dunes if people live inside of the green barrier they can help support the trees protect them from humans and from some of the forces of nature
we can have the wind excavate it for us so the wind carries the sand onto the site and then it carries the redundant sand away from the structure for us
but by now you're probably asking how am i planning to solidify a sand dune how do we glue those grains of sand together
and the answer is perhaps that you use these guys bacillus pasteurii a micro organism that is readily available in wetlands and marshes and does precisely that it takes a pile of
and it creates sandstone out of it these images from the american society for microbiology show us the process what happens is you pour bacillus pasteurii onto a pile of
and it starts filling up the voids in between the grains a chemical process produces calcite which is a kind of natural cement that binds the grains together the whole cementation process takes about twenty four hours
here i am playing the part of the mad scientist working with the bugs at ucl in london trying to solidify them so how much would this cost
not an economist very much not but i did quite literally a back of the envelope calculation and it seems that for a cubic meter of concrete we would have to pay in the region of ninety dollars
and after an initial cost of sixty bucks to buy the bacteria which you'll never have to pay again one cubic meter of bacterial sand would be about eleven dollars
how do we construct something like this well i'll quickly show you two options the first is to create a kind of balloon structure fill it with bacteria then allow the sand to wash over the balloon
the balloon as it were disseminating the bacteria into the sand and solidifying it then a few years afterwards using permacultural strategies we green that part of the
the second alternative would be to use injection piles so we pushed the piles down through the dune and we create an initial bacterial surface we then pull the piles up through the
then creating these habitable spaces inside of the desert dunes but what should they look like well i was inspired for my architectural form by tafoni which look a little bit like this this is a
these are cavernous rock structures that i found on the site in sokoto and i realized that if i scaled them up they would provide me good
spatial qualities for ventilation for thermal comfort and for other things now part of the formal control over this structure would be lost to nature
do their work and i think this creates a kind of boundless beauty actually i think there is really something in that articulation that is quite
we see the result the traces if you like of the bacillus pasteurii being harnessed to sculpt the desert into these habitable environments some people believe
this would spread uncontrollably and that the bacteria would kill everything in its way that's not true at all it's a natural process it goes on in nature today and the bacteria die as soon as we stop feeding them so there it is
the world is likely to lose one third of its arable land by the end of the century in a period of
if nothing else i would like for this scheme to initiate a discussion but if i had something like a ted wish it would be to actually get it built to start building this
itself it's not only something that supports trees but something that connects people and countries together i would like to conclude by showing you an animation of the structure
and leave you with a sentence by jorge luis borges borges said that nothing is built on stone
ethical financial my design as it takes you down the rabbit hole is with many challenges
and difficulties in the real world
is really the time to
