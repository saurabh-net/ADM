made a very important impact on us it changed the way our history developed
but it's a technology so pervasive so invisible that we for a long time forgot to take it into account
about human evolution but we see the results of this technology still so let 's make a little test
so everyone of you turns to their neighbor please turn and face your neighbors please also on the balcony any canine teeth
the mouths of your neighbors of course not because our dental
actually made not for tearing down raw meat from bones
or chewing fibrous leaves for hours it is made for a diet which is soft
which is reduced in fibers which is very easily chewable and it's for cooked food
we carry in our face the proof
so i would suggest that we change how we classify ourselves we talk about ourselves as omnivores i would say we should call
we are the animals who eat cooked food
no no no no better to live of cooked food
so cooking is a very important technology it's technology
i don't know how you feel but i like to cook for entertainment and you need some design to be successful so cooking is a very important technology because it allowed us
to acquire what brought you all here the big brain
this wonderful cerebral cortex we have because brains
so as we have to pay tuition fees
but it's also metabolically speaking expensive
our brain is two to three percent of the body mass but actually it uses twenty five percent of the total energy we use it's very expensive where does the energy come from
if we eat raw food we cannot release really the energy
so this ingenuity of our ancestors to invent this most marvelous technology invisible everyone of us does it every day so to speak
so if we think about this unleashing human potential which was possible
by cooking and food why do we talk so badly about food
why is it always do and don'ts and it's good for you and it's not good for you
i think the good news for me
if we could go back and talk about the unleashing the continuation of the unleashing of human potential now cooking allowed also that we became a migrant species we walked out of africa
all the ecologies if you can cook
the brain and the gut which it actually affected the brain could grow but the gut actually shrunk okay it's not obvious
it shrunk to sixty percent of
so because of having cooked food it's easier to digest
now having a large brain as you know is a big advantage because you can actually influence your environment you can influence your own technologies you have invented
you can continue to innovate and invent now the big brain did this also with cooking but how did it actually run this show how did it actually interfere
what kind of criteria did it use and this is actually taste reward and energy you know we have up to five three of them sustain
sweet energy umami this is a meaty taste you need proteins for muscles recovery
poisonous and rotten material but of course
they are hard wired but we use them still in a sophisticated way think about bittersweet chocolate or think about the acidity of
mixed with strawberry fruits so we can make mixtures of all this kind of thing because we know
in cooking we can transform it to the form reward this is a more complex and especially integrative form of our brain with various different elements
the external states our internal states how do we feel and so on are put together
and the gut is a silent voice it's going more for feelings i use the
the gut is concerned with if you get a stomach ache if you get a
so my story is a tale of two brains because it might surprise you our gut has a full fledged brain
but what it means to have brain
that not only the big brain has to talk
with the food the food has to talk with the brain because
we have to learn actually how to talk to the brains now if there's a gut brain we should also learn to talk with this brain now one hundred and fifty years ago
and within this structure you see these two pinkish layers which are actually the muscle and between this muscle they found nervous tissues a lot of nervous tissues which penetrate actually the muscle
it penetrates the mucosa this is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing and you digest which is
now if you think about the gut the gut is if you could stretch it
could unroll it get out all the fold and so on it would have four hundred
and now this brain takes care over this to move it with the muscles and to do defend the surface and of course
so if we give you a specification this brain which is autonomous have five hundred million nerve cells one hundred million neurons
so around the size of a cat brain so there sleeps for itself optimizes
for itself optimizes it has twenty different
the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain where you have one hundred billion neurons
it has autonomous organized microcircuits has these programs which run it senses the food it knows exactly what to do
it senses it by chemical means and very importantly by mechanical means because it has to move the food it has to mix all the various elements which we need
of muscle is very very important because you know there can be reflexes if you don't like a food especially if you're a child you gag it's this brain which makes this
it's called the subsumption architecture what it means is that we have a layered control system the lower layer our gut brain
its own goals digestion defense and we have the higher brain with the goal of integration and generating behaviors
now both look and this is the blue arrows both look to the same food which is in the lumen and in the area of your intestine the big brain integrates signals which come from the running programs of the lower brain
but subsumption means that the higher brain can interfere with the lower it can replace or it can inhibit actually signals
so if we take two types of signals a hunger signal for example if you have an empty stomach your stomach produces a hormone called ghrelin it's a very big signal
it's sent to the brain they
what happens if the big brain in the integration overrides the
the big brain ignores it
and activates different programs in the the more usual case
is overeating it actually takes the signal and changes it and we continue even our eight signals would say stop enough
we have transferred enough energy now the interesting thing is that along this lower layer this
the signal becomes stronger and stronger if
be very very high so now back to the cooking question and back to the design we have learned to talk to the big brain taste and reward as you know
what would be the language we have to talk to the gut brain that it's signals are so strong that the big brain cannot ignore it then we would generate something all of us would like to have
a balance between the hunger
and the satiation now i give you from our research a very short claim this
now everyone would expect that when the degradation of the oil happens when the constituents are liberated they disappear they go away because they
this whole system generates a huge surface to allow more enzymes to attack the remaining oil
and finally on your right side you see a bubbly cell like structure appearing from which the body
now if we could take this language and this is a language of structures and make it
lasting that it can go through the passage of the intestine it would generate stronger signals
so our research and i think the research also at the universities are now fixing on these points to say how can we actually and this might sound trivial now to you how can we change cooking how can
that we have this language developed so what we have actually it's not an omnivore 's dilemma we have a coctivor 's opportunity because we have learned over the last two million years
which taste and reward quite sophisticated to cook to please ourselves to satisfy ourselves if we add the matrix if we add the structure language which we have to
when we learn it then we can put it back and around energy we could generate a balance which comes out from our really primordial operation cooking so
to make cooking really a very important element
i would say even philosophers have to change and have to finally recognize that cooking is what made us so i would say coquo
