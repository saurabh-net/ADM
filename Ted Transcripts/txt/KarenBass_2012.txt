i 've been privileged to see so much of our beautiful
and the people and creatures that live on it and my passion was inspired at the age of seven when my parents first took me to morocco at the edge of the sahara desert now imagine a little brit somewhere that wasn 't cold and damp like home what an amazing experience
and it made me want to explore more
i 'm really lucky because i get to share that with millions of people worldwide
you might think that it 's quite hard to find new stories and new subjects but new technology is changing the way we can film
it 's enabling us to get fresh new images and tell brand new stories
in nature 's great events
a series for the bbc that i did with david attenborough
we wanted to do just that
so what we did we went to alaska
which is where the grizzlies rely on really high almost inaccessible mountain slopes for their denning
and the only way to film
throughout alaska and british columbia thousands of bear families are emerging from their winter sleep there is nothing to eat up here but the conditions were ideal for hibernation
to find food mothers must lead their cubs down to the coast where the snow will already be melting
getting down can be a challenge for small
and indeed that of all bears around the north pacific depends
i love that shot i always get goosebumps every time i see it that was filmed from a helicopter using a gyro stabilized camera
and it 's a wonderful bit of gear because it 's like having a flying tripod crane and dolly all rolled into one
but technology alone isn 't enough
to really get the money shots it 's down to being in the right place at the right time
and that sequence was especially difficult the first year we got nothing we had to go back the following year all the way back to the remote parts of alaska and we hung around with a helicopter for two whole weeks and eventually we got lucky
the cloud lifted the wind was still and even the bear showed up and we managed to get that magic moment
but the other thing that really really excites me
now when i heard about one animal i knew we had to get it for my next series untamed americas for national geographic
in two thousand and five
a new species of bat was discovered in the cloud forests of ecuador and what was amazing about that discovery is that it also solved the mystery
of what pollinated a unique flower see what you think
see what you think the
the the bottom of
the bottom of longest relative to body
now people often ask me where 's your favorite place on the planet
and the truth is i just don 't have one there are so many wonderful places
it 's the altiplano in the high andes of south america
and it 's the most otherworldly place i know
but at fifteen thousand feet it 's tough it 's freezing cold
but the advantage of that wonderful thin atmosphere is that it enables you to see the stars in the heavens with amazing clarity have a look
it 's called the altiplano or high plains a place of extremes
some of the world 's astronomers have telescopes nearby very lucky person
