will sit in one room for a couple of hours and listen the idea that in that room at that moment everyone
at that moment we transcend space and time together theater awakens our senses and opens the door to our imagination
and our ability to imagine is what makes us explorers our ability to imagine makes us inventors and creators and unique
a modern day business man going to work with his life in a suitcase stuck between dream and reality and not able to decipher the two
i wanted upwake to have the same audiovisual qualities as a movie would and i wanted to let my imagination run wild so i began drawing the story that was moving in my head
if antoine de saint exupery the author of the little prince were here he would have drawn three holes inside that box and told you your sheep was inside
because if you look closely enough things will appear this is not a box these are the renderings of my imagination from head to paper to screen to life
in upwake buildings wear suits zero tap dances on a giant keyboard clones himself with a scanner tames and whips the computer mice sails away into dreamscape from a single piece of paper
and launches into space i wanted to create environments that moved and morphed like an illusionist go from one world to another in a second
i wanted to have humor beauty simplicity and complexity and use metaphors to suggest ideas at the beginning of the show for example zero deejays dream and reality
the use of animation and projection was a process of discovery i didn't use it as a special effect but as a partner on stage
there are no special effects in upwake no artifice it's as lavish and intricate as it is simple and minimal
three hundred and forty four frames four and a half years and commissions later what started as a one person show became a collaborative work of nineteen most talented artists and here are some excerpts
show that we're now beginning to tour and in austin texas i was asked to give small demonstrations in schools during the afternoon when i arrived at one of the schools i certainly did not expect this
six hundred kids packed in a gymnasium waiting i was a little nervous performing with out animation costume really and make up
but the teachers came to me afterward and told me they hadn't seen the kids that attentive and i think the reason why is that i was able to use their language and their reality in order to transport them into another
it's as much about bringing new disciplines inside this box as it is about taking theater out of its box
as a street performer i have learned that everybody wants to connect and that usually if you're a bit extraordinary if you're not exactly of human appearance then people
it's as though you made something resonate within them it's as though the mystery of the person they're interacting with and connecting allows them to be themselves just a bit more because through your mask they let theirs go
being human is an art form i know theater can improve the quality of people 's lives and i know theater can heal i've worked as a doctor clown in a hospital for two years
i have seen sick kids and sad parents and doctors be lifted and transported in moments of pure joy i know theater unites us
zero wants to engage the generation of today and tomorrow tell various stories through different mediums comic books
there is a revolution it's a human and technological revolution it's motion and emotion it's information it's visual it's musical it's
it's conceptual it's universal it's beyond words and numbers it's happening the natural progression of science and art finding each other to better touch and define the human experience
there is a revolution in the way that we think in the way that we share and the way that we express our stories
our evolution this is a time of communication connection and creative collaboration
charlie chaplin innovated motion pictures and told stories through music silence humor and poetry
he was social and his character the tramp spoke to millions he gave entertainment pleasure
in the science of today we become artists in the art of today we become scientists
we design our world we invent possibilities we teach touch and move
it is now that we can use the diversity of our talents to create intelligent meaningful and extraordinary work excel you
