because this is where it all really began isn't it looking at fossils dating back several millions of years it all points to evidence that life for the human species as we know it began right here
we are on an amazing journey the next four days you're going to hear stories of africa the next chapter famine
famine more
more genocide aids
we've all heard these things but this is about africa the story we have not heard
the stories that we want to know and the stories that do exist about positive tales a part of my
talk is going to be about investment opportunities that exist on this continent to separate the rhetoric from the reality the fact from the fiction
to go to the actual data and statistics that exist about the actual things that are happening on the ground that make africa
a realistic investment opportunity and option for you so let 's get going because africa to some degree is on a turnaround
a turnaround in terms of how it manages its image and how it takes control of its own destiny
and turnarounds are part and parcel of what i have focused on for most of my professional career and it all started almost a decade ago
as a young consultant at mckinsey company at their first african office in johannesburg and there we worked with leading ceos
on african issues and african companies on turnarounds making the companies not just the best in africa but the best
but i really formalized this focus on turnarounds when i was completing my mba in the united states it all began with a fantastic phone call it was from rosabeth moss kanter
harvard business school guru and a professor of mine and she said i want to write a case euvin a case on a public sector leader that has lessons for the corporate world
and the leader that came to mind was nelson mandela
as he took over power as the first democratically elected president of south africa faced a situation of a country that could have slid into the abyss of chaos but he started the country on a path of a positive cycle
now the case nelson mandela change leader became part of the research base for a chapter in rosabeth 's new book called confidence
and confidence became a new york times bestseller and topped business week 's hardcover bestseller list and why i tell you this story
is because later when i was interviewed on sabc africa on a pan african broadcast they asked what is your key lesson or the key thing you enjoy the most because it was a huge privilege to be part of such a project
the lesson from that was that it was africa an african story that was used to share news with the rest of the world
of what the benchmark can be for corporate turnarounds africa was being used as a success story
i found myself from the southern part of africa in south africa at the very north in egypt and i sought out the most remote places
i went to the siwa oasis that was one of my stops and the siwa oasis is famous for several things but the key thing is that it was the place that alexander the great
went to when he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him and legend has it that alexander trekked through this desert
this was three hundred bc so africa had long been seen as a place to go to for answers now the thing i remember about siwa
to two thousand and two i'm sitting in cambridge massachusetts at the healthcare development conference and i see the same picture but from the opposite side
a satellite picture looking down at the
and it was that picture that made such an profound impact on me because i'll never forget it i remember the very moment and i wanted to share that image with you of what i saw at that point
the first thing that i saw was north america
in all its glory a warm feeling
light and then i saw africa quite literally the
and while africa may be dark the thing that brought
the message home to me was that this is the challenge we are facing but it's also the opportunity because whilst africa may be dark other than the few specks
that exist north and in the south and other areas it's aglow with the light in the hearts of the millions of people that are there entrepreneurs dynamic people people with hope
was george kimble the geographer who said that the only thing dark about africa is our ignorance
so let 's start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent that has so much to offer let 's start unpacking it
africa is the second largest continent a land mass second from asia it also is the second most populated continent with nine hundred million people
in fact coming back to the land mass africa is so big that you could fit in the continental united states china and the entire europe into africa and still have space
as an investment banker i'm in the cross flow of information and the changes that are taking place in capital markets so i want to share with you some of these
i call it my z e n cluster zambia from two thousand and four to two thousand and six moves from the eighteen percent in inflation to the nine percent egypt from the sixteen percent to about eight point four percent
more fascinating you have other countries south africa mauritius namibia all in single digits
is not a country it's made up it's made up
fifty three different countries so the very definition to say invest in africa is a no go it's meaningless
each country has a unique value proposition you can make money you can lose money in africa but opportunities boy oh boy they exist and this is what today is about it's about discussing those
very opportunities so let 's start getting into the countries and into the specific material and data
i was recently elected as emeka mentioned as the president of the south african chamber of commerce in america and i'm very proud and happy to be in that role because it is a fascinating position to be in
other headlines that have recently reached south africa were bain capital and kkr the big boys of private equity headline in south africa they have landed quite ominous
what were they there for to acquire assets bing capital 's acquisition of edcon a large retailer
it is a play on the belief that this middle class that's growing will continue to grow that the boom and the confidence in consumer spending will continue
is clearly a hot spot challenges and we will hear a lot about nigeria in these four days but looking at goldman sachs work
anyone our banks our investors seriously thinking about going to nigeria if you haven 't why not what's going on in nigeria
a couple of things i want to talk about it from the perspective of capital markets bellwether signs again
off its own balance sheet without any sovereign backing that is an indication of the confidence that is taking place in that economy without any sovereign backing a nigerian company raising capital offshore it's just a sign of things to come looking at the oil industry
but with africa let 's start being careful about this and emeka and i have had these discussions we have to move away from what's called the curse of the commodities
see that clock counting down what else is going on there egypt
we had the launch of the east african organic produce standard again
it ties in with small scale farmers in terms of no pesticides no fertilizers again
problem it's more expensive to transport goods prices of goods go up inflation is affected nigeria seventy percent of roads are untarred in general more than fifty percent of roads
to ask you in two thousand and five what was the best performing stock market or stock exchange in the world would egypt come to mind
in two thousand and five the egyptian stock market stock exchange returned over one hundred and forty five percent
but in any investment decision the key question is what is my alternative investment
an overhang of capital in the u s and the key is yield pickup what africa is providing is a diversification play and also opportunities for yield pickup for the investor that's aware of what he or she is doing
when looking at africa vis a vis other things and countries in africa vis a vis other things comparisons become important ten years ago there were very few countries that
from the standard poors moody 's and fitch 's today sixteen african countries and growing have sovereign country ratings
what does this mean take nigeria again double b minus in the league of ukraine and turkey immediately we have a comparison
the backbone of making investment decisions for global holders of capital some other figures
south africa triple b plus bakino faso b minus and so on in fact one of the big agencies is setting up an office in africa why are they doing that
doing it because they are expecting things to happen me and you the investments we are going to be making the investments the world is going to be making that's the twenty four hour news channel
i want to turn back to that very slide that made such a deep impact on me all those years ago and this time give you the entire picture that i saw in two thousand and two
and ask you that when you think about what your role can be in africa think about your journey in terms of bringing light to this continent because there are amazing opportunities available
and think about the concept of transformation in the back of your mind because things can be turned around rather quickly along the congo river
if one looks carefully on the congo river is one of those bright lights and that's the very congo river generating light the old heart of darkness now generating light with hydro electric power
that is a transformation in power of ideas so the next step over the next four days is us exploring more of these ideas and perchance if you can always keep this picture in your mind
