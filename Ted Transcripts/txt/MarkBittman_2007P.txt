this year 's version of this now that is only a little bit hyperbolic and why do i say it
because only once before has the fate of individual people and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwined there was the bomb and there's now
and where we go from here is going to determine not only the quality and the length of our individual lives but whether if we could see the earth a century from now we'd recognize it it's a holocaust of a different kind
and hiding under our desks isn't going to help start with the notion that global warming is not only real but dangerous
since every scientist in the world now believes this and even president bush has seen the light or pretends to we can take this is a given
then hear this please after energy production livestock is the second highest contributor to atmosphere altering gases
nearly one fifth of all greenhouse gas is generated by livestock production more than transportation
now you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts but methane is twenty times more poisonous than co two and it's not just methane
livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation air and water pollution water shortages
and loss of biodiversity there's more like half the antibiotics in this country are not administered to people but to animals
like this become kind of numbing so let me just say this if you're a progressive if you're driving a prius or you're shopping green or you're looking for organic you should probably be a semi vegetarian
now i'm no more anti cow than i am anti atom but it's all in the way we use these things
that so called lifestyle diseases diabetes heart disease stroke some cancers are diseases that are far more prevalent here than anywhere in the rest of the world and that's the direct result of eating a western diet
our demand for meat dairy and refined carbohydrates the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of coke a day
our demand for these things not our need our want drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us and those calories are in foods that cause not prevent disease
now global warming was unforeseen we didn't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility maybe a few lung diseases here and there but you know that's not such a big deal
the current health crisis however is a little more the work of the evil empire we were told we were assured that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate the healthier
but the evidence is that plants and i want to make this clear it's not the ingredients in plants it's the plants it's not the beta carotene it's the
the evidence is very clear that plants promote health this evidence is overwhelming at this point you eat more plants you eat less other stuff you live longer not bad
but back to animals and junk food what do they have in common one we don't need either of them for health we don't need animal products and we certainly don't need white bread or coke
both have been marketed heavily creating unnatural demand we're not born craving whoppers or skittles
their production has been supported by government agencies at the expense of a more health and earth friendly diet now
let 's imagine a parallel let 's pretend that our government supported an oil based economy while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy knowing all the while that the result would be pollution war and rising costs
isn't it yet they do that and they do this here it's the same deal the sad thing is when it comes to diet is that even when well intentioned feds try to do right by us they fail
they're outvoted by puppets of agribusiness or they are puppets of agribusiness so when the usda finally acknowledged that it was plants rather than animals that made people healthy
they encouraged us via their overly simplistic food pyramid to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day along with more carbs
so called low fat diets so called low carb diets these are not solutions but with lots of intelligent people focusing on whether food is organic or local
or whether we're being nice to animals the most important issues just aren't being addressed now don't get me wrong
i like animals and i don't think it's just fine to industrialize their production and to churn them out like they were wrenches
but there's no way to treat animals well when you're killing ten billion of them a year that's our number ten billion if you strung all of them chickens cows pigs and lambs to the moon
go there and back five times there and back now my math 's a little shaky but this is pretty good and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long but you get the idea
that's just the united states and with our hyper consumption of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease
another red herring might be exemplified by the word locavore which was just named word of the year by the new oxford american dictionary seriously
for those of you who don't know is someone who eats only locally grown food which is fine if you live in california but for the rest of us it's a bit of a sad joke
the official story the food pyramid and the hip locavore vision you have two versions of how to improve our eating
they both get it wrong though the first at least is populist and the second is elitist how we got to this place
is the history of food in the united states and i'm going to go through that at least the last hundred years or so very quickly right now
a hundred years ago guess what everyone was a locavore even new york had pig farms nearby and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion
every family had a cook usually a mom and those moms bought and prepared food it was like your romantic vision of europe
there was no snack food and until the twenties until clarence birdseye came along there was no frozen food there were no restaurant chains there were neighborhood restaurants run by local people but none of them would think to open another one
in the nineteen seventies doing julia child imitations can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide
back in those days before even julia back in those days there was no philosophy of food you just ate you didn't claim to be anything
food hardly anything contained more than one ingredient because it was an ingredient the cornflake hadn't been invented the pop tart the pringle cheez whiz none of that stuff goldfish
it's hard to imagine people grew food and they ate food and again everyone ate local in new york an orange was a common christmas present because it came all the way from florida
from the thirties on road systems expanded trucks took the place of railroads fresh food began to travel more oranges became common in new york
the south and west became agricultural hubs and in other parts of the country suburbs took over farmland the effects of this are well known they are everywhere and the death of family farms is part of this puzzle as is
thus arrived convenience it was sold to protofeminist housewives as a way to cut down on housework now i know
i for one and i'm not kidding didn't eat real spinach or broccoli till i was nineteen who needed it though meat was everywhere
what could be easier more filling or healthier for your family than broiling a steak but by then cattle were already raised unnaturally
rather than spending their lives eating grass for which their stomachs were designed they were forced to eat soy and corn
they have trouble digesting those grains of course but that wasn't a problem for producers new drugs kept them healthy
well they kept them alive healthy was another story thanks to farm subsidies the fine collaboration between agribusiness and congress
soy corn and cattle became king and chicken soon joined them on the throne it was during this period that the cycle of dietary and planetary destruction began the thing we're only realizing just now
someone had to eat all that stuff
so we got fast food and this took care of the situation resoundingly home cooking remained the norm
but its quality was down the tubes there were fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts and soups because all of them could be bought at any store not that they were any good but they were there
most moms cooked like mine a piece of broiled meat a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup canned fruit salad
maybe baked or mashed potatoes or perhaps the stupidest food ever minute rice for dessert
store bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so i can say this now this kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself it wasn't all bad
by the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians we weren't all hippies either
some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well meanwhile
but mostly they didn't eat broccoli instead they were sold on yogurt yogurt being almost as good as broccoli
except in reality the way the industry sold yogurt was to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream similarly let 's look at a granola bar
you think that that might be healthy food but in fact if you look at the ingredient list it's closer in form to a snickers than it is to oatmeal
sadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma if not actually killed the beginning
of the heyday of value added food which contained as many soy and corn products as could be crammed into it think of the frozen chicken
the chicken is fed corn and then its meat is ground up and mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder and then it's fried in corn oil
all you do is nuke it what could be better and zapped horribly pathetically by the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state
that the high fat and spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home
at the same time masses of women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden
so now you've got your pizza nights you've got your microwave nights you've got your grazing nights you've got your fend for yourself nights and so on
leading the way what's leading the way meat junk food cheese the very stuff that will kill you so now we clamor for organic food that's good
and as evidence that things can actually change you can now find organic food in supermarkets and even in fast food outlets
but organic food isn't the answer either at least not the way it's currently defined let me pose you a question can farm raised salmon be organic
when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet even if the feed itself is supposedly organic and the fish themselves
tightly in pens swimming in their own filth and if that salmon 's from chile
and it's killed down there and then flown five thousand miles whatever dumping how much carbon into the atmosphere i don't know packed in styrofoam of course
now here is where we all meet the locavores the organivores the vegetarians the vegans the
and those of us who are just plain interested in good food even though we've come to this from different points we all
on our knowledge to change the way that everyone thinks about food we need to start acting and this is not
only an issue of social justice as ann cooper said and of course she's completely right but it's also one of global survival
which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue the over production and over consumption of meat and junk food
as i said eighteen percent of greenhouse gases are attributed to livestock production how much livestock do you need to produce this
seventy percent of the agricultural land on earth thirty percent of the earth 's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted to raising the animals
and this amount is predicted to double in the next forty years or so and if the numbers coming in from china are anything like what they look like now it's not going to be forty years
there is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do and i say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life
the most common argument is that we need nutrients even though we eat on average twice as much protein as even
the industry obsessed usda recommends but listen experts who are serious about disease reduction
recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week what do you think we eat per day half a
a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables turn us into godless sissy liberals some of us might think that would be a good thing but
even if we were all steroid filled football players the answer is no in fact there's no diet on earth that meets basic nutritional needs that won 't promote growth
and many will make you much healthier than ours does we don't eat animal products for sufficient nutrition we eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition and it's killing us
to suggest that in the interests of personal and human health americans eat fifty percent less meat it's not enough of a cut but it's a start
it would seem absurd but that's exactly what should happen and what progressive
i've been writing about food more or less omnivorously one might say indiscriminately for about thirty years
during that time i've eaten and recommended eating just about everything i'll never stop eating animals
but i do think that for the benefit of everyone the time has come to stop raising them industrially and stop eating them thoughtlessly ann cooper 's right
is not our ally here we have to take matters into our own hands not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone and that's the hard part
but by improving our own and that happens to be quite easy less meat less junk more plants it's a simple formula eat food eat real food
we can continue to enjoy our food and we continue to eat well and we can eat even better we can continue the search for the ingredients we love and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals
reduce not only calories but our carbon footprint we can make food more important not less and save ourselves by doing so we have to choose that
