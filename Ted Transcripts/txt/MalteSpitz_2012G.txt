this is my mobile phone
mobile phone protest in egypt
and with a mobile phone you can record a song load it up to soundcloud and become famous all this is possible with your mobile phone i 'm a child of one thousand nine hundred and eighty four and i live in the city of berlin
let 's go back to that time to this city here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people stood up and protested for change this is autumn one thousand nine
hold it up an android a blackberry wow that 's a lot almost everybody today has a mobile phone but
today i will talk about me and my mobile phone and how it changed my life and
i will talk about this these are thirty five thousand eight hundred and thirty lines of information raw data
and why are these informations there
because in the summer of two thousand and six the e u commission tabled a directive this directive is called data retention directive this directive says that each phone company in europe
each internet service company all over europe has to store a wide range of information about the users
all this information is stored for at least six months up to two years by your phone company
they said we don 't want this data retention we want self determination in the digital age and we don 't want that phone companies and internet companies have to store all this information about
and some even said this would be stasi two point and
but then i said i want to have this information because this is my life you are protocoling so i decided to start a lawsuit against them because i wanted to have this information but deutsche telekom said no we will not give you this information
so at the end i had a settlement with them i 'll put down the lawsuit and they will send me all the information i ask for because in the mean time the german constitutional court ruled that the implementation of this e u directive into german law was unconstitutional
so i got this ugly brown envelope with a c d inside and on the c d this was on
thirty five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information
so i was a little bit skeptical what should i do with it because you can see where i am where i sleep at night
and you can even see how i go from frankfurt by train to cologne and how often i call in between all this is possible with this information
it is not only about me
it 's about all of us first it 's only like
and then there are some friends calling me and they call each other and after a while you are calling you and you are calling you and you have this great communication network
you can see all of this you can see the hubs like who are the leaders in the group if you have access to this information you can see what your society is doing if you have access to this information you can control your society
this is a blueprint for countries like china and iran
like i said at the beginning
today state agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can
get about us online and offline they want to have the possibility to track our lives and they want to store them for all time
but self determination and living in the digital age is no contradiction but you have to fight for your self determination today you have to fight for it every day
so when you go home tell your friends that privacy is a value of the twenty first century and it 's not outdated when you go home tell your representative only because
companies and state agencies have the possibility to store certain information they don 't have to do it and if you
and if you so in the future
every time you use your mobile phone let it be a reminder to you that you have to fight for self determination in the digital age thank you this is my
