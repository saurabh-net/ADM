mockingbirds that 's mimus polyglottos are the emcees of the animal kingdom they listen and mimic and remix what they like they rock the mic outside my window every morning i can hear them sing the sounds of the car alarms like they were songs of spring i mean if you can talk it
where in the world is this world heading on one end gold bars on the other an entire planet
we are twelve billion light years from the edge that 's a guess space is length and breadth continued indefinitely but you cannot buy a ticket to travel commercially to space in america because countries are beginning to eat like us
per job it 's a very strange world inside a nanotube women can talk black men ski white men build strong buildings we build strong suns the surface of the earth is absolutely riddled with holes and here we are right in the middle
when all the little mockingbirds fly away they 're going to sound like the last four days
i will get uptown gurus downtown teachers broke ass artists and dealers and filipino preachers leaf blowers bartenders boob job doctors hooligans garbage men your local congressmen in the spotlight guys in the overhead helicopters everybody gets heard everybody gets this one honest mockingbird as a witness
and i 'm on this i 'm on this til the whole thing spreads with chat rooms and copycats and moms maybe tucking kids into bed singing hush little baby
i can unlock the air i 'll listen for what 's missing and i 'll put it there thank you ted
