aside from keeping the rain out and producing some usable space architecture is nothing but a special effects machine
that delights and disturbs the senses our work is across media the work comes in all shapes and sizes it's small and large this is
stuff the thing that all the work has in common is that it challenges the assumptions about conventions of space
and these are everyday conventions conventions that are so obvious that we are blinded by their familiarity and i've assembled a sampling of
work that all share a kind of productive nihilism that's used in the service of creating a particular special effect and that is something like nothing or something next to nothing
it's done through a form of subtraction or obstruction or interference in a world that we naturally
sleepwalk through this is an image that won us a competition for an exhibition pavilion for the swiss expo two thousand and two on lake neuchatel near geneva
and we wanted to use the water not only as a context but as a primary building material we wanted to make an architecture of atmosphere
so no walls no roof no purpose just a mass of atomized water a big cloud and this proposal was a reaction to the over saturation of emergent technologies in recent national and world expositions
which feeds or has been feeding our insatiable appetite for visual stimulation with an ever greater digital virtuosity high definition in our opinion has become the new orthodoxy
and we ask the question can we use technology high technology in to to make an expo pavilion that's decidedly low definition
that also challenges the conventions of space and skin and rethinks our dependence on vision
so this is how we sought to do it water 's pumped from the lake and is filtered and shot as a fine mist through an array of high pressure fog nozzles thirty five thousand of them
and it processes this data in a central computer that calibrates the degree of water pressure and distribution of water throughout
and it's a responsive system that's trained on actual weather so this is just in construction and
the interface and basically the system is kind of reading the real weather and producing kind of semi artificial and real weather so we're very interested in creating weather the
so this is an exhibition sustained by
by the fog and this is very much so
you know once disoriented can actually ascend to the angel deck above and then just come down under those lips into the water bar so all the waters of the world are served there so we thought that you know after being
at the water and moving through the water and breathing the water you could also drink this building and
so it is sort of a theme but it goes a little bit you know deeper than that we really wanted
to bring out our absolute dependence on this master sense and maybe share our kind of sensibility with our other senses you know when we did this project
it was a kind of tough sell because the swiss said well why are we going to spend you know ten million dollars producing an effect that we already have in natural abundance that we hate
and you know we thought well we tried to convince them and in the end you know they adapted this as a national icon
that came to represent swiss doubt which we you know it was kind of a meaning machine that everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of anyway it's a temporary structure that was ultimately destroyed and so it's now a memory
of an apparition actually but it continues to live in edible form and this is the highest honor to be bestowed upon an architect in switzerland
to have a chocolate bar anyway moving along so in the eighties and nineties we were mostly known for independent work
such as installation artist architect commissioned projects by museums and non for profit organizations
and we did a lot of media work also a lot of experimental theater projects in two thousand and three the whitney mounted a retrospective
of our work that featured a lot of this work from the eighties and nineties however the work itself
resisted the very nature of a retrospective and this is just some of the stuff that was in the show this was a piece on tourism
the problem of the retrospective was something we were very we were very uncomfortable with it's a kind of invention of the museum that's supposed to
and one of the recurring themes that by the way in the work was a kind of hostility toward the museum itself
and what you see is actually the red dotted line shows the track of this performing element which was a new piece that created that we created for the
which was a robotic drill basically that went all the way around cruised the museum went all around the walls and did a lot of damage
so the drill was mounted on this robotic arm we worked with by the way honeybee robotics this is the brain honeybee robotics designed the mars doctoriller and it was really very
much fun to work with them they weren't doing their primary work which was for the government while they were helping us with this in any case the way it works is that
an intelligent navigator basically maps the entire surface of these walls so unfolded it's about three hundred linear feet
both sides of the wall aligned opening views from gallery to gallery clusters of holes randomly opened up sections of wall and so this was a three month performance piece in which
the wall was made into kind of an increasingly unstable element and also the acoustic separation was destroyed also the visual separation and there was also this constant
groan which was very annoying and this is one of the blackout spaces where there's a video piece that became totally
and this acoustical nuisance and visual nuisance basically exposed the discomfort of the work to this encompassing nature of the retrospective
was really great when it started to break up all of the curatorial text moving along to a project that we finished about a year ago
in the institute of contemporary art in boston which is on the waterfront and there's not enough time to really introduce the building but i'll simply say that the building negotiates between this
outwardly focused nature of the site you know it's a really great waterfront site in boston
and this contradictory other desire to have an inwardly focused museum so the nature of the building is that it looks at looking i mean that's its primary objective both its program and its architectural conceit
the building incorporates the site but it dispenses it in very small doses in the way that the museum is choreographed so you come in
and you're basically squeezed by the theater by the belly of the theater into this very compressed space where the view is turned off then you come up
in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall this is this elevator 's about the size of a new york city studio apartment and then this is a
view going up and then you could come into the theater which can actually deny the view or open it up and become a backdrop and many musicians choose to use the
theater glass walls totally open the view is denied in the galleries where we just receive just natural light and then exposed again in the north gallery with a panoramic view the original intention of this space
which was unfortunately never realized was to use lenticular glass which allowed only a kind of perpendicular view out in this very narrow space that connects east and west galleries the intention was really to not get a climax
but to have the view stalk you so the view would open up as you walked from one end to the other
this was eliminated because the view was too good and the mayor said no we just want this open the architect lost here but culminating and that's where this hooks into the theme of my little talk
is this mediatheque which is suspended from the cantilevered portion of the building so this is an eighty foot cantilever it's quite substantial so it's already sticking out into space enough and then from that is this
is this small area called the mediatheque the mediatheque has something like sixteen stations where the public can get onto the server and look at digital artworks
or also curated artworks off the web and this was really a kind of very important
part of this building and here is a point where architecture this is like technology free architecture is only a framing device
it only edits the harbor view the industrial harbor just through its walls its floors and its ceiling
to only expose the water itself the texture of water much like a hypnotic effect created by electronic snow or a lava lamp or something like that
and here is where we really felt that there was a great convergence of the technological and the natural in the project but there is just no information it's just it's just hypnosis
moving along to lincoln center these are the guys that did the project in the first place fifty years ago we're taking over now doing work
that ranges in scale from small scale repairs to major renovations and major facility expansions
but we're doing it with a lot less testosterone this is the extent of the work that's to be completed by two thousand and ten and for the purposes of this talk i wanted to isolate
just a part of a project that's even a part of a project that touches a little bit on this theme of architectural special effects and it happens to be our current
obsession and it plays a little bit with the purging and adding of distraction it's
hall and it's tucked under the juilliard building and descends several levels under the street so this is the entrance to tully hall as it used to be
and one of the things that we were asked to do was give it a street identity expand the lobbies and make it visually accessible and this building which is just naturally hermetic
canopy the underside of three levels of expansion of juilliard about forty five thousand square feet cutting it to the
angle of broadway and then exposing using that canopy to frame tully hall before and after shot
the hall itself which is kind of where we're really doing a massive amount of work so the hall is a multi purpose hall the clients have asked us to produce a great
they asked us to bring an intimacy how do you bring an intimacy into a hall intimacy for us means a lot of different things it means acoustic intimacy and it means visual intimacy one thing is that the subway is running and rumbling right under the hall another thing that could be fixed is the shape of the hall it's like a coffin it basically sends all the sound
gutter ball effect down the aisles the walls are made of absorptive surface half absorptive half reflective which is not very good for concert sound this is avery fisher hall
but the notion of junk visual junk was very very important to us to get rid of visual noise because we can't eliminate a single seat
the architecture is restricted to eighteen inches so it's a very very thin architecture first we do a kind of partial box and box separation to take away the distraction of the subway noise
next we wrap the entire hall almost like this olivetti keyboard with a material with a wood material that basically covers all the surfaces wall ceiling floor stage
steps everything boxes but it's acoustically engineered to focus the sound into the house and back to the stage and here 's an acoustic shelf looking up the hall just a section of the stage
just everything is lined it incorporates every single thing that you could possibly imagine is tucked into this high performance skin
house the audience with the performers we add one little detail one piece of architectural excess a special effect lighting we very strongly believe that
the theatrics of a concert hall is as much in the space of intermission and the space of arrival as it is
when the concert starts so what we wanted to do was produce these this effect this lighting effect which made us have to bioengineer the wood walls
and what it entails is the use of resin of this very thick resin with a veneer of the same kind of wood that's used throughout the hall in a kind of seamless
that wraps the hall in light like a belt of light
rather than separating like a proscenium would separate the audience from performers it connects audience with players and this is
a mockup that is in salt lake city that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full scale
and this is a guy from salt lake city this is what they look like
and for us i mean it's really kind of a very strange thing but the moments in the hall that the buzz kind of dies down when the
waiting for the performance to begin very similar to the parting of curtains or the raising of a chandelier the walls will
just exude this glow temporarily stealing attention from the stage and this is tully in construction now i have no ending to say except that i'm a couple of minutes over thank you very much
