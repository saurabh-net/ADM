the really big stuff to go to the middle of nowhere black rock desert where dangerous things happen and the boys get bigger and the rockets get bigger and they use motors they literally use on cruise missile boosters they rumble the belly and leave even photographers in awe of watching the spectacle
just explode before your eyes or come down supersonic and
a burning metal hunk coming back these things would drop down from above all through the weekend of rocket launch after rocket launch after rocket launch it's a cadence you can't quite imagine
