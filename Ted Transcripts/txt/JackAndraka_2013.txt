you ever experienced a moment in your life
to make sense of it all
when i was thirteen a close family friend
who was like an uncle to me passed away from pancreatic cancer when the disease hit so close to home i knew i needed to learn more
so i went online to find answers using the internet i found a variety of statistics on pancreatic cancer and what i had found shocked me over eighty five percent of all pancreatic cancers are diagnosed late
when someone has less than a two percent chance of survival
why are we so bad at detecting pancreatic cancer
the reason today 's current modern medicine is a sixty year old technique
that 's older than my dad
so i set up a scientific criteria as to what a sensor would have to look like in order to effectively diagnose pancreatic cancer
the sensor would have to be inexpensive rapid
now there 's a reason why this test hasn 't been updated in over six decades
and that 's because when we 're looking for pancreatic cancer we 're looking at your bloodstream which is already abundant in all these tons and tons of protein and you 're looking for this miniscule difference in this tiny amount of protein just this one protein that 's next to impossible
however undeterred due to my teenage optimism
and what i had found was an article that listed a database of over eight thousand different proteins that are found when you have pancreatic cancer
so i decided to go and make it my new mission to go through all these proteins and see which ones could serve as a biomarker for pancreatic cancer and to make it a bit simpler for myself
i decided to map out a scientific criteria and here it is essentially first the protein would have to be found in all pancreatic cancers at high levels in the bloodstream in the earliest stages but also only in cancer
and so i 'm just plugging and chugging through this gargantuan task and finally on the four thousandth try when i 'm close to losing my sanity i find the protein
and it 's just your ordinary run of the mill type protein unless of course you have pancreatic ovarian or lung cancer in which case it 's found at these very high levels in your bloodstream but also the key is that it 's found in the earliest stages of the disease when someone has close to one hundred percent chance of survival
i then shifted my focus to actually detecting that protein and thus pancreatic cancer
now my breakthrough came in a very unlikely place possibly the most unlikely place for innovation my high school biology class the absolute stifler of innovation
and i had snuck in this article on these things called carbon nanotubes and that 's just a long thin pipe of carbon that 's an atom thick and one fifty thousandth the diameter of your hair and despite their extremely small sizes they have these incredible properties they 're kind of like the superheroes of material science
and while i was sneakily reading this article under my desk in my biology class we were supposed to be paying attention to these other kind of cool molecules called antibodies and these are pretty cool because they only react with one specific protein but they 're not nearly as interesting as carbon nanotubes
and so then i was sitting in class and suddenly it hit me i could combine what i was reading about carbon nanotubes with what i was supposed to be thinking about antibodies
essentially i could weave a bunch of these antibodies into a network of carbon nanotubes such that you have a network that only reacts with one protein but also due to the properties of these nanotubes
it would change its electrical properties based on the amount of protein present
however there 's a catch these networks of carbon nanotubes are extremely flimsy and since they 're so delicate they need to be supported so that 's why i chose to use paper making a cancer sensor out of paper is about as simple as making chocolate chip cookies which i love
i can 't really do cancer research on my kitchen countertop my mom wouldn 't really like that
so instead i decided to go for a lab so i typed up a budget a materials list a timeline and a procedure and i emailed it to two hundred different professors at johns hopkins university and the national institutes of health essentially anyone that had anything to do with pancreatic cancer
he went through and said why each and every step was like the worst mistake i could ever make
clearly the professors did not have as high of an opinion of my work as i did
however there was a silver lining one professor said maybe i might be able to help you kid so i went in that direction
and they 're just firing these questions at me and by the end i kind of felt like i was in a clown car there were twenty ph d s plus me and the professor crammed into this tiny office space with them firing these rapid fire questions at me trying to sink my procedure how unlikely is that i mean
this makes it one hundred and sixty eight times faster over twenty six thousand times less expensive and over four hundred times more sensitive than our current standard for pancreatic cancer detection
and so in the next two to five years this sensor could potentially lift for pancreatic cancer survival rates from a dismal five point five percent to close to one hundred percent and it would do similar for ovarian and lung cancer
but it wouldn 't stop there
by switching out that antibody you can look at a different protein thus a different disease potentially any disease in the entire world so that ranges from heart disease to malaria hiv aids as well as other forms of cancer anything and so hopefully one day
we can all have that one extra uncle that one mother that one brother sister we can have that one more family member to love
and that our hearts will be rid of that one disease burden that comes from pancreatic ovarian and lung cancer and potentially any disease that through the internet anything is possible
theories can be shared and you don 't have to be a professor with multiple degrees to have your ideas valued
it 's a neutral space where what you look like age or gender it doesn 't matter it 's just your ideas that count
for me it 's all about looking at the internet in an entirely new way to realize that there 's so much more to it than just posting duck face pictures of yourself online
you could be changing the world
could find a new way to detect pancreatic cancer
