go browsing a very old magazine i found this observation test about the story
the artist that drew this observation test did some errors had some mistakes there are more or less twelve mistakes some of them are very easy
lamp and clockwork key on the ark some of them are about the animals the number
and this problem is where are the plants so now we have god that is going to
or at least for a very long period and no one is taking care of plants
to take two of every kind of bird of every kind of animal of every kind of creature that moves but no mention about plants why
in another part of the same story all the living creatures are just the living creatures that came out from the ark so birds livestock and
nice code that is coming from a renaissance book here we have the description of the order of nature it's a nice description because it's starting from left you have the stones
immediately after the stones the plants that are just able to live we have the animals that are able to live and to
and on the top of the pyramid there is the man this is not the common man the homo studiosus the studying man this is quite comforting for people like me i'm a professor
to be over there on the top of creation but it's something completely wrong you know very well about professors but it's also wrong about plants
because plants are not just able to live they are able to sense they are much more sophisticated in sensing than animals
just to give you an example every single root apex is able to detect and to monitor concurrently and continuously at least fifteen different chemical and physical parameters
and they also are able to show and to exhibit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be described just with the term of intelligence
well but this is something this underestimation of plants is something that is always with us
some of the most beautiful movies about plant behavior now when he speaks about plants everything is
when he speaks about animals tends to remove the fact that plants exist the blue whale the biggest creature that exists on the planet that
completely wrong the blue whale it's a dwarf if compared with the real biggest creature that exists on the planet that is this wonderful
this is a living organism that has a mass of at least two thousand tons now the story that plants
some low level organisms has been formalized many times ago by aristotle that in de anima that is a very influential book for western civilization wrote that
the plants are on the edge between living and not living they have just a kind of very low level soul it's called the
because they lack movement and so they don't need to sense
let 's see okay some of the movements of the plants are very well known this is a very fast movement this is a dionaea a venus fly trap hunting snails sorry for the snail
this has been something that has been refused for centuries despite the evidence no one could say that the plants were able to eat an animal because it was against the order of nature
but plants are also able to show a lot of movement some of them are very well known like the flowering it's just a question
to use some techniques like the time lapse some of them are much more sophisticated look at this young
that is moving to catch the light every time and it's really so graceful it's like a dancing
they are also able to play they are really playing these are young
and what they are doing cannot be described with any other terms than playing they are training
as many young animals do to the adult life where they will be called to track the sun all the day
they are able to respond to gravity of course so the shoots are growing against the vector of gravity and the roots toward the vector of gravity but they are also able to sleep
this is one mimosa pudica so during the night they curl the leaves and reduce the movement and during the day you have the opening of the leaves there is much more movement this is interesting because
in animals and it's much more easy even ethically it's a kind of
they communicate with other plants they are able to distinguish kin and non kin they communicate with plants and other species
and they communicate with animals by producing chemical volatiles for example during the pollination now with the pollination it's a very serious issue for plants because they move the pollen from one flower to the other
they can not move from one flower to the other so they need a vector and this vector it's normally an animal
many insects have been used by plants as vectors for the transport of the pollination but not just insects even birds reptiles and mammals like bats rats
normally used for the transportation of the pollen this is a serious business we have the plants that are giving to the animals a kind of
like in the case of orchids that promise sex and nectar and give in change nothing for the transportation of the pollen
big man charles darwin publishes a wonderful astonishing book that
the title is the power of movement in plants no one was allowed to speak about movement in plants before charles darwin in his book
was the first professor of plant physiology in the world in cambridge they took into consideration every single movement for five hundred pages and in the last paragraph of
it's a kind of stylistic mark because normally charles darwin stored in the last paragraph of a book
the most important message he wrote that it 's hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the
acts like the brain of one of the lower animals this is not a metaphor
so you can recognize this kind of movement the same movement that worms snakes and every animal that moving on the ground without legs is able to display
and it's not an easy movement because to have this kind of movement you need to move different regions of the root and to synchronize these different regions without having a brain
so we studied the root apex and we found that there is a specific region that is here depicted
call it a transition zone and this region it's a very small region it's less than one
and in this small region you have the highest consumption of oxygen in the plants and more important you have these kinds of signals here
the signals that you are seeing here are action potential are the same signals that the neurons of my brain of our brain use to exchange information
now we know that a root apex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of feature
we know how big the root apex of a small plant like a plant of rye we have almost fourteen million
we have eleven and a half million root apex and a total length of six hundred or more kilometers and a very high surface area now let 's
that each single root apex is working in network with all the others here were have on the left the internet and on the right the root apparatus
they work in the same way they are a network of small computing machines working in networks and why are they so similar because they evolved for the same reason
to survive predation they work in the same way so you can remove ninety percent of the root apparatus and the plants
to work you can remove ninety percent of the internet and it is to work so a suggestion for the people working with networks
plants are able to give you good suggestions about how to evolve networks and
another possibility is a technological possibility let 's imagine that we can build
or the animals in producing a robot we have the animaloid the normal robots
by animals insectoid so on we have the androids that are inspired by man but why have we not
any plantoid well if you want to fly it's good that you look at birds to be inspired by birds but if you want
to explore soils or if you want to colonize new territory to best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants that are masters in doing this
something that's half living and half machine it's much more easy to work with plants than with animals they have computing power
they have electrical signals the connection with the machine is much more easy much more even
possible and these are three possibilities that we are working on
well thank you for your attention and before i finish i would like to reassure that no snails were harmed in making
