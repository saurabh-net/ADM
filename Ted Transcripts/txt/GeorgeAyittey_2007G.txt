well first of all let me thank
ted global for putting this conference together this conference is going to rank as the most important in the beginning of the twenty one st century
to the ted fellows june
james shikwati andrew and the other ted fellows i call them the cheetah generation the
generation is a new breed of africans who brook no nonsense about corruption they understand what accountability and democracy is they're not going to wait for government to do things for them
the cheetah generation and africa 's salvation rests on the backs of these
in contrast of course we have the hippo generation
the hippo generation are the ruling elites they are stuck in their intellectual patch
one foot if you ask them to reform the economies they're not going to reform it because they benefit from the rotten status
now there are a lot of africans who are very angry angry at the condition of africa now we're talking about a continent which is not
it is rich in mineral resources natural mineral resources but
who want to help the people in africa they don't understand now we're not saying don't help africa helping africa is noble
but helping africa has been turned into a theater of the absurd it's like the blind leading
out of africa that's what the world bank says look at africa 's begging bowl it leaks horribly into this bowl which
into this bowl which what are
year yes put that aside capital flight out of africa eighty billion a year put that aside let 's take food
every year africa spends twenty billion dollars to import food
just add that up all these leakages that's far more than the
fifty billion tony blair wants to raise for africa now back in the nineteen sixties africa not only fed itself it also exported food not anymore
we know that something has gone fundamentally wrong you know it i know it but let 's not waste
our time talking about these mistakes because we'll spend all day here let 's move on
and flip over to the next chapter and that's what this conference is all about the next chapter the next chapter begins
asking ourselves this fundamental question
do we want to help in africa there is the people and then there is the government or now
the speaker before me the previous speaker before me idris mohammed indicated that
i belong to an internet discussion forum an african internet discussion forum
just twenty good leaders maybe you may want to take this leadership challenge yourself i asked them to name me just twenty
they couldn't go beyond fifteen
even if they had been able to name me twenty what does that tell you twenty out of two hundred and four
that the majority the vast majority of the african leaders failed their people and if you look at them the slate of the post colonial leaders
an assortment of military fufu heads swiss bank socialists crocodile liberators vampire elites quack revolutionaries
now this leadership is a far cry from the traditional leaders that africans have known for centuries
what you and i understand as a government doesn't exist in many african
what what we call our governments are vampire states vampires because they suck the economic vitality out of their people government is the problem in africa
a vampire state is the government which has been hijacked by a phalanx of bandits and crooks who use the instruments of state power to enrich themselves their cronies and tribesmen and exclude everybody else
the richest people in africa are heads of state and ministers and quite often the chief bandit is the head of state himself where do they get
by creating wealth no by raking it off the backs of their suffering people that's not wealth creation it's wealth redistribution
the third fundamental issue that we have to recognize is that if we want to help the african people we must know where the african people are
take any african economy an african economy can be broken up into three sectors there is the modern sector
there is the informal sector and the traditional sector the modern sector is the abode of the elites it's the seat of government
many african countries the modern sector is lost it's dysfunctional it is a meretricious fandango of imported systems which the elites themselves don't understand
that is the source of many of africa 's problems where the struggles for political power emanate and then spill over
the informal and the traditional sector claiming innocent lives now the modern sector of course is
the development aid and resources went into
the other sectors the informal
what we did as a matter of fact we neglected the informal and
the traditional sectors now traditional sector is where africa produces its agriculture which is one of the reasons why africa can't feed itself
and you can't develop the informal and the traditional sectors without an operational understanding of how these two sectors
these two sectors let me describe to you have their own indigenous institutions first one is the political system
the first one belongs to those ethnic societies who believe that the state was necessarily tyrannous so they didn't want to have anything to do with any centralized authority
sure that they surrounded the chiefs with councils upon councils upon councils to prevent them from abusing their power
and if the chief doesn't govern according to the will of the people he will be removed if not the people will abandon the chief
set up a new settlement and even if you look in ancient african empires they were all organized around one particular
a great deal of devolution of authority decentralization of power now this is what i have described to you this is
part of africa 's indigenous political heritage now compare that to the modern systems the ruling elites established on africa it is a total far cry
the economic system in traditional africa the means of production
the american will say i am because i am and i can damn well do anything i want anytime the accent is on the
in africa the africans say i am because we are the we connotes community the extended family system
on marketplaces when they make a profit it is theirs to keep not for the chief to sequester it from
what we had in traditional africa was a free market system there were markets in africa before the colonialists stepped foot on the continent timbuktu was one great big market town kano salaga they were all there
to west africa you notice that market activity in west africa has always been dominated by women so it's quite appropriate that this section is called a marketplace the market is not alien to africa
what africans practiced was a different form of capitalism but then after independence all of a sudden markets
and even then what kind of socialism did they practice the socialism that they practiced was a peculiar form of swiss bank socialism which allowed the heads of states and the ministers to rape and
to africa 's indigenous institutions and this is where we charge the cheetahs to go into the informal sectors the traditional sectors that's where you find the african people
and i'd like to show you a quick little video about the informal sector about the boat building that i myself tried to mobilize africans in the
to invest in could you please show that
also means that he will be able to generate what economists
what economists so that
the traditional medicine area this is where we need to mobilize africans in the diaspora especially to invest in this we also need to mobilize africans in the diaspora not only to go into the traditional
sectors also but to go into agriculture and also to instigate change from within we were able to mobilize ghanaians in
with the cheetahs we can take africa back one village at a time thank you very much
