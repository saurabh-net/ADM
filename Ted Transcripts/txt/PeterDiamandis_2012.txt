could have easily been the last six days or the last six years the point is that the news media preferentially feeds us negative stories because that 's what our minds pay attention to
now the amygdala is our early warning detector our danger detector it sorts and scours through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might harm us
so given a dozen news stories we will preferentially look at the negative news
and that old newspaper saying if it bleeds it leads
that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week twenty four hours a day it 's no wonder that we 're pessimistic it 's no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse
but perhaps that 's not the case
to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of abundance
now i 'm not saying we don 't have our set of problems
climate crisis species extinction water and energy shortage we surely do
and as humans we are far better at seeing the problems way in advance but ultimately we knock them down
so let 's look at what this last century has been
to see where we 're going over the last hundred years the average human lifespan has more than doubled average per capita income adjusted for inflation around the world has tripled
childhood mortality has come down a factor of ten
add to that the cost of food electricity transportation communication have dropped ten to one thousand fold
steve pinker has showed us that in fact we 're living during the most peaceful time ever in human history
and charles kenny that global literacy has gone from twenty five percent to over eighty percent in the last one hundred and thirty years we truly are living in an extraordinary time
and many people forget this
and we keep setting our expectations higher and higher in fact we redefine what poverty means think of this in america today the majority of people under the poverty line
still have electricity water toilets refrigerators television mobile phones
air conditioning and cars the wealthiest robber barons of the last century the emperors on this planet could have never dreamed of such luxuries
underpinning much of this is technology
and of late exponentially growing technologies
my good friend ray kurzweil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jumps on this
curve on moore 's law
and experiences price performance doubling every twelve to twenty four months
that 's why the cellphone in your pocket is literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer of the seventy s now look at this curve
this is moore 's law over the last hundred years i want you to notice two things from this curve number one how smooth it is through good time and bad time war time and peace time recession depression and boom time
this is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers
it doesn 't slow for any of our grand challenges and also even though it 's plotted on a log curve on the left it 's curving upwards
the rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster and on this curve
riding on moore 's law are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies available to all of us cloud computing what my friends at autodesk call infinite computing sensors and networks robotics three d printing which is the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production around the planet synthetic biology
i mean that was epic
in fact i scoured the headlines looking for the best headline in a newspaper i could and i love this watson vanquishes human opponents jeopardy 's not an easy game it 's about the nuance of human language
and imagine if you would a i s like this on the cloud available to every person with a cellphone
four years ago here at ted ray kurzweil and i started a new university called singularity university and we teach our students all of these technologies and particularly how they can be used to solve humanity 's grand challenges
and every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect positively the lives of a billion people within a decade think about that the fact that literally a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today
thirty years ago that would have sounded ludicrous today we can point at dozens of companies that have done just that
when i think about creating abundance
it 's about creating a life of possibility
it is about taking that which was scarce and making it abundant
you see scarcity is contextual
and technology is a resource liberating
all of napoleon 's troops were fed with silver utensils napoleon himself with gold utensils but the king of siam
he was fed with aluminum utensils you see aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet
worth more than gold and platinum
it 's the reason that the tip of the washington monument is made of aluminum
you see even though aluminum is eight point three percent of the earth by mass
it doesn 't come as a pure metal it 's all bound by oxygen and silicates
but then the technology of electrolysis came along
and literally made aluminum so cheap
that we use it with throw away mentality
so let 's project this analogy going forward
we think about energy scarcity
ladies and gentlemen we are on a planet that is bathed with five thousand times more energy than we use in a year
sixteen terawatts of energy hits the earth 's surface every eighty eight minutes it 's not about being scarce it 's about accessibility
and there 's good news here
for the first time this year the cost of solar generated electricity is fifty percent that of diesel generated electricity in india eight point eight rupees versus seventeen rupees the cost of solar dropped fifty percent last year last month mit put out a study showing that by the end of this decade
in the sunny parts of the united states solar electricity will be six cents a kilowatt hour compared to fifteen cents as a national average
and if we have abundant energy
we also have abundant water
do you remember when carl sagan turned the voyager spacecraft a pale blue dot
because we live on a water planet
we live on a planet seventy percent covered by water yes ninety seven
and there is technology coming online not ten twenty years from now right now
there 's nanotechnology coming on nanomaterials and the conversation i had with dean kamen this morning one of the great diy innovators i 'd like to share with you he gave me permission to do so
his technology called slingshot that many of you may have heard of it is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator it 's able to generate a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day out of any source saltwater polluted water latrine at less than two cents a liter
the chairman of coca cola has just agreed to do a major test of hundreds of units of this in the developing world and if that pans out which i have every confidence it will coca cola will deploy this globally to two hundred and six countries around the planet
this is the kind of innovation empowered by this technology that exists today
and we 've seen this in cellphones my goodness we 're going to hit seventy percent penetration of cellphones in the developing world by the end of two thousand and thirteen think about it that a masai warrior on a cellphone in the middle of kenya has better mobile comm than president reagan did twenty five years ago
and if they 're on a smartphone on google they 've got access to more knowledge and information than president clinton did fifteen years ago they 're living in a world of information and communication abundance that no one could have ever predicted
better than that the things that you and i spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for
probably the best part of it is what 's coming down the pike in health
last month i had the pleasure of announcing with qualcomm foundation something called the dollar ten million qualcomm tricorder x prize
we 're challenging teams around the world to basically combine these technologies into a mobile device
that you can speak to because it 's got a i you can cough on it you can do a finger blood prick and to win it needs to be able to diagnose you better than a team of board certified doctors
so literally imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors twenty five percent of the disease burden and one point three percent of the health care workers
when this device sequences an rna or dna virus that it doesn 't recognize it calls the cdc and prevents the pandemic from happening in the first place
but here here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of abundance i call it the rising billion
so the white lines here are population we just passed the seven billion mark on earth and by the way the biggest protection against a population explosion is making the world educated and healthy
in two thousand and ten we had just short of two billion people online connected
by two thousand and twenty that 's going from two billion to five billion internet users
three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation
and they will get healthier by using the tricorder and they 'll become better educated by using the khan academy and by literally being able to use three d printing and infinite computing become more productive than ever before
so what could three billion rising healthy educated productive members of humanity bring to us
how about a set of voices that have never been heard from before
what about giving the oppressed wherever they might be the voice to be heard and the voice
for the first time ever
what about contributions we can 't even predict the one thing i 've learned at the x prize is that small teams
driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things things that large corporations and governments could only do in the past let me share and close with a story that really got me excited
there is a program that some of you might have heard of it 's a game called foldit
it came out of the university of washington in seattle and this is a game where individuals can actually
take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein is going to fold
and how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality and it 's very important for research in medicine and up until now it 's been a supercomputer problem
and this game has been played by university professors and so forth and it 's literally
hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it and it showed that in fact today the human pattern recognition machinery is better at folding proteins than the best computers and when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein folder in the world
it wasn 't an mit professor it wasn 't a caltech student it was a person from england from manchester a woman
and at night was the world 's best protein folder
ladies and gentlemen what gives me tremendous confidence in the future
is the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet
we have the tools with this exponential technology we have the passion of the diy innovator we have the capital of the techno philanthropist and we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges to do that which we must do
we are living into extraordinary decades ahead thank you
