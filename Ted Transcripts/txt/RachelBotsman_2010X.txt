today i'm going to talk to you about the rise of collaborative consumption i'm going to explain what it is and try and convince you in just fifteen minutes that this isn't a flimsy idea or a short term
all the hands but it looks like all of you on our shelves at home we have a box set of the dvd series twenty four
around three years ago for a christmas present now my husband chris and
but let 's face it when you've watched it once maybe or twice you don't really want to watch it again because you know how jack bauer is going to defeat the terrorists so there is sits on our shelves obsolete to us but with immediate latent value to someone else
i have a confession to make i lived in new york for ten years and i am a big fan of sex and the city now i'd love to watch the first movie again as sort of a warm up to the sequel coming out next week
how easily could i swap our unwanted copy of twenty four for a wanted copy of sex and the city now you may have noticed there's a new sector emerging called swap trading now
all your unwanted media what it does is use the internet to create an infinite marketplace to match
whatever they may be the other week i went on one of these sites appropriately called swaptree
was rondoron who wanted swap his or her like new copy of sex and the city for my copy of twenty four
so in other words what's happening here is that swaptree solves my carrying company 's sugar rush problem a problem the economists call the coincidence of wants
in approximately sixty seconds what's even more amazing is it will print out a purchase label on the spot because it knows the
now there are layers of technical wonder behind sites such as swaptree but that's not my interest and
my passion and what i've spent the last few years dedicated to researching are the collaborative behaviors and trust mechanics inherent in these
with a total stranger whose real name i didn't know and without any money changing hands yet ninety nine percent of trades on swaptree happen successfully
and the one percent that receive a negative rating it's for relatively minor reasons like the item didn't arrive on time
so what's happening here an extremely powerful dynamic that has huge commercial and cultural implications is at play namely that technology is enabling trust between strangers
what i find fascinating is that we've actually wired our world to share whether that's our neighborhood our school our office or our facebook network and that's creating an economy of what's mine is yours
the grandfather of exchange marketplaces
to car sharing companies such as goget where you pay a monthly fee to rent cars by the hour
sharing and collaborating again in ways that i believe are more hip than hippie i call this groundswell collaborative consumption
now before i dig into the different systems of collaborative consumption i'd like to try and answer the question that every author rightfully gets asked which is
where did this idea come from
actually it was a complicated web of seemingly disconnected
see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display of all the dots that went on in my head
you know when you learn a new word and then you start to see that word everywhere that's
to me when i noticed that we are moving from passive to highly enabled collaborators
happening is the internet is removing the middleman
so that anyone from a t shirt designer to a knitter can make a living selling
force of this peer to peer revolution means that sharing is happening at
i mean it's amazing to think that in every single minute of this speech twenty five hours of youtube video
now what i find fascinating about these examples is how they're actually tapping in to our primate instincts
i mean we're monkeys and we're born and bred to share and cooperate and were doing so for thousands of years whether it's
system called hyper consumption came along and we built these fences and created out but things are changing
and one of the reasons why are the digital natives or
the reason why it's happening so fast is because of mobile collaboration we now live in a connected age
where we can locate anyone anytime in real time from a small device in our hands
this was going through my head towards the end of two thousand and eight when of course the great financial crash
now we rationally know that an economy built on hyper consumption is a ponzi scheme it's a house of cards yet it's hard for us to individually know what to
so all of this is a lot of twittering right well it was a lot of noise and complexity in my head until actually i realized it was happening because of four key drivers one a renewed belief in the importance of community and a very redefinition of what friend and neighbor really means
a torrent of peer to peer social networks and real time technologies fundamentally changing the way we behave three
global recession that has fundamentally shocked consumer behaviors
an inflection point where the sharing behaviors through sites such as flickr and twitter that are becoming second nature online are being applied to offline areas of our everyday lives
my co author roo rogers and i have actually gathered thousands of examples from all around the world of collaborative consumption
and although they vary enormously in scale maturity and purpose when we dived into them we realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems
the first is redistribution markets redistribution markets just like swaptree is when you take a used or pre owned item and move it from where it's not needed to somewhere or someone where it is
thought of as the fifth r reduce reuse recycle repair and redistribute because they stretch the life cycle of a product and thereby reduce waste
the second is collaborative lifestyles this is the sharing and resources of things like money skills and time
in a couple of years that phrases like coworking and couch surfing and time
this is where you pay for the benefit of the product what it does for you without needing to own the product outright
this idea is particularly powerful for things that have high idling capacity and that can be anything from baby
to fashions to how many of you have a power drill
right that power drill will be used around twelve to thirteen minutes in lifetime
it's kind of ridiculous right because what you need is the hole not
i want to just give you an example of how powerful collaborative consumption can be to change behaviors the average car costs dollar eight thousand a year to run
for twenty three hours a day
so when you consider these two facts it starts to make a little less sense that we have to own one outright
so this is where car sharing companies such as zipcar and goget
in in two thousand and nine zipcar took two hundred and fifty participants from across thirteen cities
and they're all self confessed car addicts and car sharing rookies and got them to surrender their keys for a month instead these people had to walk bike
take the train or other forms of public transport they could only use their zipcar membership when absolutely necessary
the results of this challenge after just one month we staggering it's amazing that four hundred and thirteen lbs were lost just from the extra exercise
but my favorite statistic is that one hundred out of the two hundred and fifty participants did not want their keys back
in other words the car addicts had lost their
a great quote that was written in the new york times that said sharing is to ownership what the ipod is to the eight track what solar power is to the coal mine
i believe also our generation
our relationship to satisfying what we want is far less tangible than any other previous generation i don't want the dvd i want the movie is carries
i don't want a clunky answering machine i want the message it saves i don't want a cd i want the music it plays in other words i don't want stuff
the needs or experiences it fulfills
this is fueling a massive shift from where usage trumps possessions or as kevin kelly the editor of wired magazine puts it where access is better than
now as our possessions dematerialize into the cloud a blurry line is appearing between what's mine what's yours and
i want to give you one example that shows how fast this evolution is happening
this represents and eight year time span we've gone from traditional car
to car sharing companies such as zipcar and goget to ride sharing platforms that match rides to the newest entry which is peer to peer car rental
where you can actually make money out of renting that car that sits idle for twenty three hours a day to
now all of these systems require a degree of trust
and the cornerstone to this working is reputation
much because our credit history was far more important that any kind of peer to peer review but now with the web we
with every idea we post comment we share we're actually signaling how well we collaborate and whether we can my first example
i can see that rondoron has completed five hundred and fifty three trades with a hundred percent success rate in other words i can trust him or her
now mark my words it's only a matter of time before we're going to be able to
and see a cumulative picture of our reputation capital and this reputation capital will determine our access to collaborative consumption
it's a new social currency so to speak that could become as powerful as our credit rating
now as a closing thought i believe we're actually in a period where we're waking up
from this humongous hangover of emptiness and
and we're taking a leap to create a more sustainable system built to serve our innate needs for community and individual
i believe it will be referred to as a revolution so to speak when society faced with great challenges
made a seismic shift from individual getting and spending towards a rediscovery
i'm on a mission to make sharing cool i'm on a mission to make sharing hip because i really believe it can disrupt outdated modes of business
help us leapfrog over wasteful forms of hyper consumption and teach us when enough really is enough thank you
