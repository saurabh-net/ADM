so where are the robots we've been told for forty years already that they're coming soon very soon
be doing everything for us they'll be cooking cleaning buying things shopping building but they aren't here meanwhile we have
illegal immigrants doing all the work but we don't have any robots so what can we do about that what can we say so i want to give a little bit of a different perspective of
how we can perhaps look at these things in a little bit of a different way and this is an x ray picture of a real beetle and a swiss watch back from eighty eight
you look at that what was true then is certainly true today we can still make the pieces we can make the right pieces we can make the circuitry of the right computational power but we can't actually put them together to make something
that will actually work and be as adaptive as these systems so let 's try to look at it from a different perspective let
the best designer the mother of all designers let 's see what evolution can do for us so we threw in we created a primordial soup
with lots of pieces of robots with bars with motors with neurons put them all together and put all this under kind of natural selection
so if you look you can see a lot of different machines come out of this they all move around they all crawl in different ways and
you can see on the right that we actually made a couple of these things and they work in reality these are not very fantastic robots but they evolved to do exactly what we reward them for for moving forward
that was all done in simulation but we can also do that on a real machine here 's a physical robot that we actually have a population of brains
fast or how far they can make the machine move forward and you can see these robots are not ready to take over the world yet but they gradually learn how to move forward and they do this autonomously
so in these two examples we had basically
that learned how to walk in simulation and also machines that learned how to walk in reality but i want to show you a different approach and this is this robot over here which
has four legs it has eight motors four on the knees and four on the hip it has also two tilt sensors that tell the machine which
and then it tries to figure out what it might look like and you're seeing a lot of things passing through its minds a lot
self models that try to explain the relationship between actuation and sensing and then tries to do a second action that creates the most disagreement
among predictions of these alternative models like a scientist in a lab then it does that and tries to explain that and prune out its self models this
last cycle and you can see it's pretty much figured out what its self looks like and once it has a self model it can use that to
derive a pattern of locomotion so what you're seeing here are a couple of machines a pattern of locomotion we were hoping that it's going to have a kind of evil spidery walk but instead it created
this pretty lame way of moving forward but when you look at that you have to remember that this machine did not do any physical trials on how to move forward
nor did it have a model of itself it kind of figured out what it looks like and how to move forward and then actually tried that so
move forward to a different idea so that was what happened when we had
a couple of that's what happened when you had a couple of
they don't like each other so there's a different robot that's what
the robots actually are rewarded for doing something what happens if you don't reward them for anything you just throw them in so we have these cubes like the diagram showed here the cube can swivel or flip on its side and we just throw one thousand of these
cubes into a soup this is in simulation and don't reward them for anything we just let them flip we pump energy into this and see what happens in a couple of mutations so initially nothing happens they're just flipping around there
but after a very short while you can see these blue things on the right there begin to take over they begin to self replicate so in absence of any reward the intrinsic reward
so you're feeding it with more material cubes in this case and more energy and it can make another robot so of course this is a very crude machine
but we're working on a micro scale version of these and hopefully the cubes will be like a powder that you pour in ok so what can we learn these robots are of course
not very useful in themselves but they might teach us something about how we can build better robots and perhaps how humans animals create self models
things that i think is important is that we have to get away from this idea of designing the machines manually but actually let them evolve and learn like children and perhaps that's the way we'll get there thank you
