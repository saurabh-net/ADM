just like twenty six point five million other americans i live in a food desert
south central los angeles home of the drive thru
for instance the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than say beverly hills which is probably eight ten miles away
if you had no access to healthy food if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects that the present food system has on your neighborhood
i see dialysis centers popping up
so i figured that the problem is the solution
food is the problem and food is the solution plus i got tired of driving forty five minutes round trip to get an apple that wasn 't impregnated with pesticides so what i did
so me and my group l a green grounds we got together and we started planting my food forest fruit trees you know the whole nine vegetables what we do we 're a pay it forward kind of group
where it 's composed of
the city came down on me and basically gave
that 's enough space to plant seven hundred and twenty five million tomato plants why in the hell would they not okay
just like a graffiti artist
i use the garden the soil like it 's a piece of cloth and the plants and the trees that 's my embellishment for that cloth you 'd be surprised
you 'd be surprised you 'd be surprised
how kids are affected by this gardening is the most
especially in the inner city
i remember this time there was this mother and a daughter came it was like ten thirty at night and they were in my yard
and i came out and they looked so ashamed so i 'm like man it made me feel bad that they were there and i told them you know you don 't have to do this like this this is on the street for a reason
it made me feel ashamed to see people
in downtown los angeles these are the guys they helped me unload the truck it was cool
so green grounds has gone on to plant maybe twenty gardens we 've had like
fifty people come to our dig ins and participate and it 's all volunteers if kids grow kale kids eat kale
so with gardening i see an opportunity where we can train these kids
to take over their communities to have a sustainable life
now this is one of my plans this is what i want to do i want to plant a whole
take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes now don 't get me wrong
i 'm not talking about no free shit
so what i want to do here we gotta make this sexy
so i want us all to become
let that be your weapon of choice
