often of things that don 't make much sense themselves
so my father might not understand what it is that i do for a living his part of my ancestry has been farmers he 's part of this ethnic minority called the pontic greeks they lived in asia minor
and fled to greece after a genocide about a hundred years ago
and ever since that migration has somewhat been a theme in my family
my father moved to germany studied there and married and as a result i now have this
half german brain with all the analytical thinking and that slight dorky demeanor that comes with that
and of course it meant that i was a foreigner in both countries
and that of course made it pretty easy for me to migrate as well in good family tradition if you like
but of course most journeys that we undertake from day to day are within a city
and especially if you know the city getting from a to b may seem pretty obvious right but the question is
and i 'm sure you 've all had this experience before yeah you arrive in a new city and your brain is trying to make sense of this new place once you find your base your home
you start to built this cognitive map of your environment it 's essentially this virtual map that only exists in your brain all animal species do it even though we all use slightly different tools
us humans of course we don 't move around marking our territory by scent like dogs we don 't run around emitting ultrasonic squeaks like bats
we just don 't do that
although a night in the temple bar district can get pretty wild
and we kind of ignore the little twists and turns that the streets make when we do however make a turn into a side street our mind tends to
adjust that turn to a ninety degree angle
this of course makes for some funny moments when you 're in some old city layout that follows some sort of circular city logic yeah maybe you 've had that experience as well right let 's say you 're on some spot on a side street that projects from a main cathedral square
and you want to get to another point on a side street just like that the cognitive map
go back to the main cathedral square take a ninety degree turn and walk down that other side street
but somehow you feel adventurous that day and you suddenly discover that the two spots were actually only a single building apart now i don 't know about you but i always feel like i find this wormhole or this inter dimensional portal
so we move along linear routes and our mind straightens streets and perceives turns as ninety degree angles the second thing that we do to make a place our own is we attach meaning and emotions to the things
with these markers of meaning what 's more we abstract
repeat patterns and recognize them we recognize them by the experiences and we abstract them into symbols and of course
we are all capable of understanding these symbols
and you are all capable of creating these cognitive maps yourselves
so next time when you want to tell your friend how to get to your place you grab a beermat grab a napkin and you just observe yourself create this awesome piece of communication design
it 's got straight lines it 's got ninety degree corners you might add little symbols along the way
and when you look at what you 've just drawn
if you were to put an actual street map on top of what you 've just drawn you 'd realize your streets and the distances they 'd be way off
from a to b the london underground map
was not designed by a cartographer or a city planner
it was designed by an engineering draftsman
in the one thousand nine hundred and thirty s harry beck
now the very key to the success of this map
is in the omission of less important information and in the extreme simplification so straightened streets
corners of ninety and forty five degrees but also the extreme geographic distortion in that map if you were to look at the actual locations of these stations you 'd see they 're very different
yeah but this is all for the clarity of the public tube map
go to baker street change over take another tube of course what you don 't know is that the two stations
now we 've reached the subject of public transport and public transport here in dublin is a somewhat touchy subject
that grew with the city for every outskirt that was added there was another bus route added running from the outskirt all the way to the city center
and as these local buses approach the city center they all run side by side and converge in pretty much one main street so when i stepped off the boat twelve years ago
i tried to make sense of that because exploring a city on foot only gets you so far
but when you explore a foreign and new public transport system you will build a cognitive map in your mind in pretty much the same way
typically you choose yourself a rapid transport route
and in your mind this route is perceived as a straight line
and like a pearl necklace
all the stations and stops are nicely and neatly aligned along the line and only then you start to discover some local bus routes
that would fill in the gaps and that allow you for those wormhole inter dimensional portal shortcuts
so i tried to make sense and when i arrived i was looking for some information leaflets that would help me crack this system and understand it and i found those brochures
they were having a lot of omission of information but unfortunately the wrong information say in the city center there were never actually any lines that showed the routes
there are actually not even any stations with names now the maps of
dublin transport have gotten better and after i finished the project they got a good bit better but still no station names still no routes so being naive and being half german i decided
so that 's what i did i researched how each and every bus route moved through the city nice and logical every bus route a separate line and i plotted it into my own map of dublin
and in the city center
i got a nice spaghetti plate
and making the streets at straight ninety degree corners forty five degree corners or fractions of that and filled it in with the bus routes and i built this city center bus map of the system how it was five years ago
as a public transport map this diagram
i now had a great visual representation of just how clogged up and overrun the city center really was
now call me old fashioned right but i think a public transport route map
my academic research loads of questionnaires case studies and looking at a lot of maps
was that a lot of the problems and shortcomings of the public transport system here in dublin was the lack of a coherent public transport map a simplified coherent public transport map because i think this is the crucial step
to understanding a public transport network on a physical level but it 's also the crucial step to make a public transport network mappable on a visual level
so i teamed up with a gentleman called james leahy a civil engineer and a recent master 's graduate of the sustainable development program at dit and together we drafted this simplified model network which i could then go ahead and visualize
so here 's what we did we distributed these rapid transport corridors throughout the city center
and extended them into the outskirts rapid because we wanted them to be served by rapid transport vehicles yeah
they would get exclusive road use where possible and it would be high quantity high quality transport james wanted to use bus rapid transport for that rather than light rail for me it was important
that the vehicles that would run on those rapid transport corridors would be visibly distinguishable from local buses on the street
now we could take out all the local buses that ran alongside those rapid transport means any gaps that appeared in the outskirts were filled again so in other words
if there was a street in an outskirt where there had been a bus
but connect to the nearest rapid transport mode one of these thick lines over there so the rest was merely a couple of months of work and a couple of fights with my girlfriend of our place constantly being clogged up with maps
this map only shows the rapid transport connections no local bus very much in the metro map style that was so successful in london and that since has been exported to so many other major cities and therefore is the language that we should use for public transport maps
what 's also important is
with a simplified network like this
it now would become possible for me to tackle the ultimate challenge and make a public transport map for the city center
one where it wouldn 't just show rapid transport connections but also all the local bus routes streets and the likes and this is what a map like this could like i 'll zoom in a little bit in this map
i 'm including each transport mode
so rapid transport bus dart tram and the likes
each individual route is represented by a separate line
the map shows each and every station each and every station name
and i 'm also displaying side streets
in fact most of the side streets even with their name and for good measure also a couple of landmarks some of them signified by little symbols others by these isometric three dimensional bird 's eye view drawings
the language of way finding in our brain so straightened lines cleaned up corners
and of course that very very important geographic distortion that makes public transport maps possible
if you for example have a look at the two main corridors that run through the city the yellow and orange one over here this is how they look in an actual accurate street map
and this is how they would look in my distorted simplified public transport map
so for a successful public transport map we should not stick to accurate representation but design them in the way our brains work the reactions i got were tremendous it was really good to see and of course for my own self i was very happy to see that my folks in germany and greece
finally have an idea what i do for a living
