a great honor to be here
the good news is i'm very aware of my responsibilities to get you out
the only thing standing between you
and the good news is
people remember pictures long after they've in a tough neighborhood
wednesday afternoon i was walking down the
never seen anything like that before
the art room and i said what is that and he said ceramics and who are you
to sign a piece of paper that says you can
so for the remaining two years of my high school
and i don't want it on my conscience
school and i'm taking you with
he drove me out to the university of pittsburgh where i filled out a college application
the guy who came from the neighborhood
who got into the place on probation don't give up on the poor kids because you never know what's going to happen to those children in life
i'm going to show you for a couple of minutes i
one is called bidwell training
center it is a vocational school for ex steel workers and the
the in very close
in very close as
and last year i spoke at his memorial service
i went out and hired a student of frank lloyd wright
built in a tough neighborhood where people have been given up for the life of
look like the solution and not the problem as you can it
their courtyard i noticed that they had a life
before you ever give them a speech and
and in my view
in my view is this kind of
is this kind of we also
we also created a boardroom
and i hired a japanese cabinetmaker from kyoto japan and commissioned him to do sixty pieces of furniture for our
custom furniture for rich people and i got sixty pieces out of it for my
because i felt that welfare
to come to a school where there was handcrafted furniture
because it sets a tone and an attitude about how you feel about people long before you give them the speech
even have flowers in the hallway
and they're not plastic those
and we were particularly touched by the flowers and we were curious as to how the flowers got there i said well i got in my car and i went out to the
what you need to know is that the children and the adults deserve flowers in their life
we believe in hope and human possibilities
and so the next thing you'll see a a million
heard about my desire to build a new building because i had a cardboard box and i put it in a garbage bag and i walking all over pittsburgh trying to raise money for this site and he called me into his office which is the equivalent of going to see the wizard of
john heinz had six hundred million dollars and at the time i had about
he said but we've heard about you we've heard about your work with the kids and the ex steel workers
and we're inclined to want to support your desire to build a new building and you could do us a great service if you would add a culinary program
to your program because back then we were building a trades program he said that way we could fulfilll our affirmative action goals
go into a field that i don't know much about but i promise you that if you'll support my school i'll get it built and in a couple of years i'll come back
and weigh out that program that you desire
said well what would your reaction be
i said senator it appears that we're going into the food training business
and john heinz did give me a million
and most importantly he loaned me the head of research for the heinz company and we kind of borrowed the curriculum from the culinary institute of america which in their mind is kind of the harvard
in this million dollar kitchen that happens to be our cafeteria
pastry day why because the students made puff pastry and that's what the school ate every day
the concept was that i wanted to take the stigma
good food 's not for rich people good food 's for everybody on the planet and there's no excuse why we can't all be eating it so at
we subsidize a gourmet lunch program for welfare
i wanted to let them know every day black kids and white
black kids and white and
no sophistication no class no dignity no history what we've discovered is the only thing wrong with poor people is they don't have any money
happens to be a curable condition
it's all in the way that you think about people that often determines
by a student after seven months in the program
done by a very brilliant young woman who was taught by our
actually eaten seven of those baskets and they're very
that's our dining room it looks like your average high school cafeteria in your average town this is my
we train medical technicians for the medical industry
and we train chemical technicians for companies like bayer and calgon carbon and fisher scientific and exxon and i will guarantee you that if you come to my center in pittsburgh
welfare mothers doing analytical chemistry with logarithmic calculators ten months from
people can't learn world class technology what we've discovered you have to give
you have to give and i have
children with high school diplomas that they can't read
in the twenty one st century
that we graduate children from schools who can't read the diplomas that they
the reason is that the system gets reimbursed for the kids they spit out at the other end not the children
i can take these children and in twenty weeks demonstrated aptitude
four hundred kids from the pittsburgh public school system that
for arts education and these are children
last year i put eighty eight percent of those kids in college and i've averaged over
for fifteen years we've made a fascinating and
and that
that i figured that if
treat children like human beings it increases the likelihood they're going to behave that way
and why we can't institute
in every school and in every city
let me show you what in fact
i brought in a mosaic artist from the vatican an african american woman who had studied the old vatican mosaic techniques and let me show you what sunlight
sunlight teach photography
teach photography four
we have a world class gallery because we believe that
so i designed this thing
we have smoked salmon at the
and i even have figured out a way to get their parents to come i couldn't buy a parent fifteen years ago so i hired a guy who got off i
i can't get these parents to come to the school he said i 'll get them to
art opening but you probably didn't have one
children at the manchester craftsmen 's guild because
there is no statistical difference between the white parents
between the white parents have to
have to i even
i even stuck
stuck just got this slide
i gave this little slide show at a place
and i did all right and the woman came out of the audience she said that was a great story and i was very
criticism is your computers are getting a little bit old and i said well what do you do for a living
you that hp and a furniture company called steelcase have adopted us as a demonstration model for all of their technology and all
you so it's kind of the world debut of our digital imaging center
i only have a couple more slides and this is where the story gets kind
so i just want you to listen up for a couple more minutes and
and a guy named dizzy gillespie showed up to play there because he knew this man over here marty ashby
and i stood on that stage with dizzy gillespie on sound
on a wednesday afternoon and i said dizzy why would you come to a black run center in the middle of an industrial park with a high crime rate that doesn't even have a reputation in music he said because i heard you built the center and i didn't believe that you
i wanted to see for myself and
i have i want to give you a gift i said you 're the gift he said no sir
and i recorded dizzy and he died a year later and
and a band called the count basie orchestra guy named gary burton
all have come to this center in the middle of an industrial park the greatest artists
but not before his last recording was
when the basie band came the band got so excited about the school they voted to give me the rights to the music jazz orchestra dropped
and we recorded them and got nominated for a second grammy back to back hot
city with a high crime
place all filled up with
bomb on that room you'd have wiped out all the money in
including my mother and father just like
just like and he was
was our first recording studio which was
and i can now tell you with absolute certainty
an appearance on oprah winfrey will sell ten thousand cds
we are currently number four on the billboard charts right
tony bennett and i think we're going to be
this was burned out during the riots this is next to my building
and so i had another cardboard box built and i walked back out on the streets again and that's the building and that's the model
and on the right 's the high tech greenhouse and in the middle 's the medical technology building and i'm very pleased to tell you that the also
also every building
the university of pittsburgh medical center are anchor tenants and they took half the building and we now train medical technicians through all their system and mellon bank 's a tenant and i love them because they pay the rent on that
and you will see the greenhouse that's going to open in october this year because we're going to
we have a handshake with one of the large retail grocers to sell our orchids
in all two hundred and forty
and our partners are zuma canyon orchids
which he readily agreed and we got the funding
this is what i want to do when i grow up
the brown building is the one you guys have been looking at and i'll tell you where i made my
i had a chance to buy this
whole industrial park which is less than one thousand feet from the riverfront
for four million dollars and i didn't do it
and i built the first building and guess what happened
i appreciated the real estate values beyond everybody 's expectations
and the owners of the park turned me down for eight and said mister strickland
this is in a place called
the reason this picture 's in here
i did this slide show a couple years ago at a big economics summit and there was a fellow in the audience who came up to me he said man that's a great story i want one
what do you do for a living he says willie brown
and so i kind of
the flattery and the praise and put it out of my mind and that weekend i was going back home
and herbie hancock was playing at our center that
and he said as god is
i've had a center like this in my mind for twenty five years and you've built it and now i really he
chance you know willie brown
as a matter of fact he did know willie brown and willie brown and herbie and i
four years ago and we started drawing out that center on the
willie brown said as sure as
he got me five acres of land on san francisco bay
we got an architect and we got a general contractor and we got herbie on the board
and our friends from hp and our friends from steelcase and our friends from cisco and our friends from wells fargo and
and along the way i met this real short
slide show in the silicon valley
to me afterwards he said
man that's a fabulous story
i want to help you and i said well thank you very much for that what do you do for a living he said well
very nice thanks very much and give me your card and sometime we'll talk i didn't know ebay from that
jar of water sitting on that piano
but i had the presence of mind to go back and talk to one of the techie kids at my center i said hey man what is ebay he said well that's the electronic commerce network
and he left me his card so i called him up on the phone and i said mister skoll i've come to have a much deeper appreciation of who you are
jeff and i did become friends
and he 's organized a team of
and we're going to build this
and i went down into the neighborhood
called bayview hunters point and i said
the mayor sent me down to work with you
and i want to build a center with you but i'm not going to build you anything if you and so
and so two hundred very angry
and i started showing these pictures and after about ten pictures they all settled down
of the room a woman stood up and she said in thirty five come down here
and she turned that audience around on a pin and i
i think we can get in the ground this year
the first replication of the center and
said i want to help you man
let 's do one in l a and so he 's
people and i've fallen in love with him as i have with herbie and with
said where did the idea
for centers like this come from
because mister ross used to bring in your albums when i was sixteen years old
when the world was all dark that's not true
i believe in your hopes and your dreams
i believe in your intelligence and i believe in your and i'm tired of
going into town after town with people standing around on corners with eyes used to be
eyes used to be their spirits damaged
we won 't make it as a country unless we can turn this thing around
and pennsylvania it costs sixty thousand dollars to keep people in jail most of whom look like me
forty thousand dollars to build the university of pittsburgh medical school
it's twenty thousand dollars cheaper to very decent people
i think we can build these all over the country
and i believe we can turn this whole story around to one of celebration
in my business it's very difficult work you're always fighting upstream like
never enough money too much
and so there is a tendency to have an occupational depression that accompanies my work and so i've figured out
the solution to the depression you make a friend
you make a friend made a few
made a few and
