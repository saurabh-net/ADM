so i am a jungian psychoanalyst and i went to afghanistan in january two thousand and four by chance on an assignment
is one of the poorest countries in the world and seventy percent of the people are illiterate war and malnutrition kills people together with hope you may know this from the media
but what you may not know is that the average age of the afghan people is seventeen years old which means they grow up in such an environment and i repeat myself in thirty years
this translates into ongoing violence foreign interests bribery
ethnic conflicts bad health shame fear and cumulative traumatic experiences
local and foreign military are supposed to build peace together with the donors and the governmental and non governmental organizations and people had hope yes
but until they realized their situation worsens every day either because they are being killed
because somehow they are poorer than eight years ago
figure for that fifty four percent of the children under the age of five years suffer from malnutrition yet there is hope
one day a man told me my future does not look brilliant but i want to have a brilliant future for my son
this is a picture i took in two thousand and five walking on fridays over the hills in kabul and for me it's a symbolic picture of an open future for a young generation so
by building schools and roads
to cope with it to get over it
so soon after my arrival i had confirmed something which i had already known that my instruments come from the heart of modern europe yes however
what can wound us and our reaction to those wounds they are universal and the big challenge was how to understand the meaning of the symptom
in this specific cultural context after a counseling session a woman said to me because you have felt me i can feel myself again and i want to participate again in my family
this was very important because the family is central in afghans
social system no one can survive alone and if people feel used worthless and ashamed because something horrible has happened to them
then they retreat and they fall into social isolation and they do not dare to tell this evil to other people or to their loved ones because they do not want to burden them and very often violence is a way to cope
and they cannot control it to compensate this loss of inner control
they try to control the outside very understandably mostly the family and unfortunately this fits very well
into the traditional side regressive side repressive side restrictive side of the cultural so
they did not want to do this it just happened they lost control the desperate try
the desperate try and normality
and if we are not able to cut this circle of violence it will be transferred to the next generation without a doubt and partly this is already happening
so everybody needs a sense for the future and the afghan sense of the future
let me repeat the words of the woman because you have felt me i can feel myself again so the key here is empathy everybody must be able
everybody must be able to know what
to cope with it and to learn from it and i want to engage myself in the bright future for my children and the children of my children and i will not marry off my thirteen year old daughter what happens too often in afghanistan
so something can be done even in such extreme environments as afghanistan and i started thinking about a counseling program but of course i needed help and funds and one evening i was sitting next to a very nice gentleman in kabul and
he asked what i thought would be good in afghanistan and i explained to him quickly i would train psycho social counselors i would open centers and i explained to him
this man gave me his contact details at the end of the evening and said if you want to do this call me
at that time it was the head of caritas germany so
i was able to launch a three year project with caritas germany and we trained thirty afghan women and men and we opened fifteen counseling centers in kabul
this was our sign it's hand painted and we had forty five all over kabul eleven thousand people
been taking place the european union delegation in kabul came into this and hired me to work inside the ministry of public health to lobby this approach
revised the mental health component of the primary health care services by adding psycho social care and psycho social counselors to the system
means certainly to retrain all health staff but for that we already have the training manuals which are approved by the ministry and moreover this approach is now part of the mental health strategy in afghanistan
so we also have implemented it already in some selected clinics in three provinces and you are the first to see the results
we wanted to know if what is being done is effective and here you can see the patients all had symptoms of
the green line is treatment with psycho social counseling only without medication and you can see the symptoms
to cope with them so this makes us very happy because now we also have some evidence that this is working
so here you see this is a health facility in northern afghanistan and every morning it looks like this all over and doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients but now this will change
they go to the clinics because they want to cure their immediate symptoms and they will find somebody to talk to and discuss these issues and talk about what is burdening them and find solutions develop their resources
learn tools to solve their family conflicts and gain some confidence in the future and i would like to share one short vignette one
to his pashtun counselor if we were to have met some years ago
then we would have killed each other and now you are helping me to regain some confidence in the future and another counselor said to me after the training you know i never knew why i survived the killings in my village now i know because
i am part of a nucleus of a new peaceful society in afghanistan so i believe this kept me running and this is a really emancipatory and political contribution to peace and
and also i think without psycho social therapy and without considering this in all humanitarian projects we cannot build up civil societies
i thought it was an idea worth spreading and i think it must be can be could be replicated elsewhere i thank you for your attention
