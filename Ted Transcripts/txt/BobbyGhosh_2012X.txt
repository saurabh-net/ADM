in that original idea the concept of jihad is as important to muslims as the idea of grace is to christians
it 's a very powerful word jihad if you look at it in that respect and there 's a certain almost mystical resonance to
and hindus my people name our daughters bhakti which means in sanskrit spiritual worship
and so the thousands of young muslim men who flocked to afghanistan in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s to fight against the soviet occupation of a muslim country
in their minds they were fighting a jihad they were doing jihad and they named themselves the mujahideen which is a word that comes from the same root as jihad
we forget this now but back then the mujahideen were celebrated in this country in america we thought of them as holy warriors who were taking the good fight to the ungodly communists america gave them weapons gave them money gave them support encouragement
but within that group a tiny smaller group a minority within a minority within a minority were coming up with a new and dangerous conception
and the things he did in the pursuit of this jihad were so horrendous so monstrous and had such great impact that his definition was the one that stuck
not just here in the west we didn 't know any better we didn 't pause to ask we just assumed that if this insane man and his psychopathic followers were calling what they did jihad then that 's what jihad must mean but it wasn 't just us even in the muslim world
his definition of jihad began to gain acceptance
a year ago i was in tunis and i met the imam of a very small mosque an old man fifteen years ago he named his granddaughter jihad after the old meaning he hoped that a name like that would inspire her to live a spiritual life
but he told me that after nine eleven he began to have second thoughts he worried that if he called her by that name especially outdoors outside in public he might be seen as endorsing bin laden 's idea of jihad
on fridays in his mosque he gave sermons trying to reclaim the meaning of the word
and it filled this old imam it filled him with great sadness
he didn 't so much appropriate it as kidnapped it and debased it and corrupted it
and turned it into something it was never meant to be and then persuaded all of us that it always was
it was dying well before he did and now it 's on its last legs opinion polls from all over the muslim world show that there is very little interest among muslims in a global holy war against the west against the far enemy
the supply of young men willing to fight and die for this cause is dwindling the supply of money just as important more important perhaps the supply of money to this activity is also dwindling the wealthy fanatics who were previously sponsoring this kind of activity are now less generous
what does that mean for us in the west does it mean we can break out the champagne
and so there 's now a lot of different violent jihads all over the world in somalia in mali in nigeria in iraq in afghanistan pakistan there are groups that claim to be the inheritors of the legacy of osama bin laden
they use his rhetoric they
so there is now an al qaeda in the islamic maghreb there 's an al qaeda in the arabian peninsula there is an al qaeda in mesopotamia there are other groups in nigeria boko haram in somalia al shabaab and they all pay homage to osama bin laden but if you look closely
they 're not fighting a global jihad they 're fighting battles over much narrower issues
from iraq to syria from mali to algeria
from somalia to kenya but they 're not fighting a global jihad against some far enemy
but they have been distracted recently last year they took control over a portion of southern yemen and ran it taliban style
and then the yemeni military got its act together and ordinary people rose up against these guys and drove them out and since then most of their activities most of their attacks have been directed at yemenis
so i think we 've come to a point now where we can say that just like all politics all jihad is local but that 's still not reason for us to disengage
because we 've seen that movie before in afghanistan when those mujahideen defeated the soviet union we disengaged and
the taliban had taken over in kabul and we said local jihad not our problem and then the taliban gave the keys of kandahar to osama bin laden he made it our problem local jihad if you ignore it becomes global jihad
the good news is that it doesn 't have to be we know how to fight it now we have the tools we have the knowhow and we can take the lessons we 've learned from the fight against global jihad the victory against global jihad and apply those to local jihad what are those lessons
we know who killed bin laden seal team six
there lie the answers to the solution to local jihad who killed bin ladenism let 's start with bin laden himself
he probably thought nine eleven was his greatest achievement in reality it was the beginning of the end for him he killed three thousand innocent people and that filled the muslim world with horror and revulsion
nine eleven didn 't empower him it doomed
who killed bin ladenism abu musab al zarqawi killed it he was the especially sadistic head of al qaeda in iraq who sent hundreds of suicide bombers to attack not americans but iraqis muslims sunni as well as shiites
who killed osama bin laden the seal team six who killed bin ladenism al jazeera did al jazeera and half a dozen other satellite news stations in arabic because they circumvented the old state owned television stations in a lot of these countries
which were designed to keep information from people al jazeera brought information to them showed them what was being said and done in the name of their religion exposed the hypocrisy of osama bin laden and al qaeda and allowed them gave them the information that allowed them to come to their own conclusions
who killed bin ladenism the arab spring did because it showed a way for young muslims to bring about change
and perhaps a time will come when they get the rightful credit for it so all these factors and many more besides we don 't even fully understand some of them yet these came together
we don 't have to reinvent the wheel the notion of violent jihad in which more muslims are killed than any other kind of people is already thoroughly discredited we don 't have to go back to that
satellite television and the internet are informing and empowering young muslims in exciting new ways and the arab spring has produced governments many of them islamist governments who know that for their own self preservation they need to take on
we don 't need to persuade them but we do need to help them because they haven 't really come to this place before
private investment fair terms of trade medicine education
technical support for training for their police forces to become more effective for their anti terror forces to become more
efficient we 've got plenty of these things some of the other things that they need we 're not very good at giving maybe nobody is time patience subtlety understanding these are harder to give
i live in new york now just this week posters have gone up in subway stations in new york that describe jihad as savage
but in all the many years that i have covered the middle east i have never been as optimistic as i am today
who are reclaiming this word and restoring to its original beautiful purpose bin laden is dead bin ladenism has been defeated his definition of jihad can now be expunged
