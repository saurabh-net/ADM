before not the way you 're thinking we were actually introduced because we both knew linda avey one of the founders of the first online personal genomic companies and because we shared our genetic information with linda she could see that harriet and i shared a very rare type of mitochondrial dna haplotype k one a one b one a which meant that we were distantly related
what i 'd like to talk about today is understanding these exponential technologies we often think linearly but if you think about it if you have a lily pad
and it just divided every single day two four eight sixteen in fifteen days you have thirty two thousand what do you think you have in a month we 're at a billion
so if we start to think exponentially we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us and many of these technologies speaking as a physician and innovator we can really start to leverage to impact the future of our own health and of health care and to address many of the major challenges
that we have in health care today ranging from the really exponential costs to the aging population the way we really don 't use information very well today the fragmentation of care and often the very difficult course of adoption of innovation
and one of the major things we can do we 've talked a bit about here today is moving the curve to the left we spend most of our money on the last twenty percent of life what if we could spend and incentivize positions in the health care system and our own self to move the curve to the left and improve our health leveraging technology as well now my favorite technology example of exponential technology we all have in our pocket
so if you think about it these are really dramatically improving i mean this is the iphone four imagine what the iphone eight will be able to do
now i 've gained some insight into this i 've been the track share for the medicine portion of a new institution called singularity university based in silicon valley and we bring together every summer about one hundred very talented students from around the world and we look at these exponential technologies from medicine biotech artificial intelligence robotics nanotechnology space
and address how can we cross train and leverage these to impact
major unmet goals we also have seven day executive programs and coming up next month is actually future med a program to help cross train and leverage technologies into medicine
so let 's see now how exponential technologies are taking health care let 's start with faster
well it 's no secret that computers through moore 's law are speeding up faster and faster we have the ability to do more powerful things with them they 're really approaching in many cases surpassing the ability of the human mind but where i think computational speed is most applicable is in that of imaging the ability now to look inside the body in real time with very high resolution
and molecular diagnostics to find and to seek things at different levels
here you 're going to see the very highest resolution mri scan done today reconstructed of marc hodosh the curator of tedmed and now we can see inside of the brain with a resolution and ability that was never before available
and essentially learn how to reconstruct and maybe even re engineer or backwards engineer the brain so we can better understand pathology disease and therapy we can look inside with real time fmri in the brain at real time
the scanners for these are getting small less expensive and more portable
and this sort of data explosion available from these is really almost becoming a challenge the scan of today takes up about eight hundred books or twenty gigabytes the scan in a couple of years will be one terabyte or eight hundred thousand books how do you leverage that information let 's get personal i won 't ask who here 's had a colonoscopy but if you 're over age fifty it 's time for your screening colonoscopy how would you like to avoid
the pointy end of the stick well now there 's essentially a virtual colonoscopy
compare those two pictures and now as a radiologist you can essentially fly through your patient 's colon and augmenting that with artificial intelligence identify potentially as you see here a lesion oh we might have missed it but using a i on top of radiology we can find lesions that were missed before and maybe this will encourage people to get colonoscopies that wouldn 't have otherwise
and this is an example of this paradigm shift we 're moving to this integration of biomedicine information technology wireless and i would say mobile now this era of digital medicine so even my stethoscope is now digital and of course there 's an app
and merging this now with the advent of electronic medical records in the united states we 're still less than twenty percent electronic here in the netherlands i think it 's more than eighty percent but now that we 're switching to merging medical data making it available electronically we can crowd source that information and now as a physician i can access my patients data from wherever i am just through my mobile device
and now of course we 're in the era of the ipad even the ipad two and just last month the first fda approved application was approved to allow radiologists to do actual reading on these sorts of devices
using simple motion detection using hundred dollar devices
we can actually now visit our patients robotically this is the rp seven if i 'm a hematologist visit another clinic visit a hospital
completely supplants the prior technology at a much lower price point with much more effectivity
now we 're also in the era today of quantified self consumers now can buy basically hundred dollar devices like this little fitbit i can measure my steps my caloric outtake i can get insight into that on a daily basis i can share that with my friends with my physician
there 's watches coming out that will measure your heart rate the zeo sleep monitors a whole suite of tools that can enable you to leverage and have insight into your own health
and as we start to integrate this information we 're going to know better what to do with it and how better to have insight into our own pathologies health and wellness there 's even mirrors today that can pick up your pulse rate and i would argue in the future we 'll have wearable devices in our clothes monitoring ourselves twenty four seven
and just like we have the onstar system in cars your red light might go on it won 't say check engine though it 's going to be check your body light and go in and get it taken care of
really possible even five years ago now this is being augmented with further layers of technology like augmented reality so the surgeon can see inside the patient through their lens where the tumor is where the blood vessels are
this can be integrated with decisions support a surgeon in new york can be helping a surgeon in amsterdam for example
and we 're entering an era of really truly scarless surgery called notes where the robotic endoscope can come out the stomach and pull out that gallbladder all in a scarless way and robotically and this is called notes and this is coming basically scarless surgery as mediated by robotic surgery
and they can control a curser or a wheelchair or eventually a robotic arm and these devices are getting smaller and going into more and more of these patients still in clinical trials but imagine when we can connect these
for example to the amazing bionic limb such as the deka arm built by dean kamen and colleagues which has seventeen degrees of motion and freedom and can allow the person who 's lost a limb to have much higher levels of dexterity or control than they 've had in the past so we 're really entering the era of
and i think by leveraging these sorts of technologies we 're going to change the definition of disability to in some cases be superability or super enabling this is aimee mullins who lost her lower limbs as a young child and hugh herr who 's a professor at mit who lost his limbs in a climbing accident and now both of these can climb better move faster swim differently with their prosthetics
than us normal abled persons
on the cardiac side pacemakers are getting smaller and much easier to place so you don 't need to train an interventional cardiologist to place them and they 're going to be wirelessly telemetered again to your mobile devices so you can go places and be monitored remotely these are shrinking even further here 's one that 's in prototyping by medtronic that 's smaller than a penny
artificial retinas the ability to put these arrays on the back of the eyeball and allow the blind to see again in early trials but moving into the future these are going to be game changing or for those of us who are sighted how about having the assisted living contact lens bluetooth wifi available beams back images to your eye now
if you have trouble maintaining your diet it might help to have some extra imagery to remind you how many calories
and this is really going to leverage technology to the rural and the under served and enable what used to be thousand dollar tests to be done
not something we usually think about in the era of medicine but hard disks used to be three thousand four hundred dollars for ten megabytes
and soon we 'll have millions of these tests available and that 's when it gets interesting when we start to crowdsource that information and we enter the era of true personalized medicine the right drug for the right person at the right time instead of what we 're doing today which is the same drug for everybody sort of blockbuster drug medications medications which don 't work for you the individual
but if i take that same data upload it to decodeme i can look at my risk for sample type two diabetes i 'm at almost twice the risk for type two diabetes i might want to watch how much dessert i have at the lunch break for example it might change my behavior
leveraging my knowledge of my pharmacogenomics how my genes modulate what my drugs do and what doses i need are going to become increasingly important and once in the hands of the individual and the patient will make better drug dosing and selection available
so again it 's not just genes it 's multiple details our habits our environmental exposure when was the last time your physician asked you where you 've lived geomedicine where you 've lived what you 've been exposed to can dramatically affect your health we can capture that information so genomics proteomics the environment all this data streaming at us
individually and us as poor physicians how do we manage it well we 're now entering the era of systems medicine or systems biology where we can start to integrate all of this information
and by looking at the patterns for example in our blood of ten thousand biomarkers in a single test
we can start to look at these little patterns and detect disease at a much earlier stage this has been called by lee hood the father of the field p four medicine we 're going to be predictive we 're going to know what you 're likely to have we can be preventative that prevention can be personalized and more importantly it 's going to become increasingly participatory
so i 'll finish up with exponentially better we 'd like to get therapies better and more effective now today we treat high blood pressure mostly with pills what if we take a new device and knock out the nerve vessels that help mediate blood pressure and in a single therapy to cure hypertension this is a new device that is essentially doing that it should be on the market within a year or two
and we 're entering the era of personalized oncology the ability to leverage all of this data together analyze the tumor and come up with a real specific cocktail for the individual patient
now i 'll close with regenerative medicine so i 've studied a lot about stem cells embryonic stem cells are particularly powerful we also have adult stem cells throughout our body we use those in my field of bone marrow transplantation geron just last year started the first trial using human embryonic stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries still a phase i trial but evolving
we 've been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about fifteen years to approach a whole range of topics particularly in cardiovascular disease we take our own bone marrow cells and treat a patient with a heart attack
we can see much improved heart function and actually better survival using our own bone marrow drive cells after a heart attack
i invented a device called the marrowminer a much less invasive way for harvesting bone marrow it 's now been fda approved and it 'll hopefully be on the market in the next year or so hopefully you can appreciate the device there curving through the patient 's body and removing the patient 's bone marrow instead of with two hundred punctures with just a single puncture under local anesthesia
when you were an embryo we can now reprogram your skin cells
to actually act like a pluripotent embryonic stem cell and to utilize those potentially to treat multiple organs in that same patient making your own personalized stem cell lines and i think they 'll be a new era of your own stem cell banking to have in the freezer your own cardiac cells myocytes and neural cells to use them in the future should you need them
and we 're integrating this now with a whole era of cellular engineering and integrating exponential technologies for essentially three d organ printing replacing the ink with cells and essentially building and reconstructing a three d organ that 's where things are going to head still very early days but i think as integration of exponential technologies this is the example
so in close as you think about technology trends and how to impact health and medicine we 're entering an era of miniaturization decentralization and personalization and i think by pulling these things together if we can start to think about how to understand and leverage these we 're going to empower the patient enable the doctor enhance wellness and begin to cure the well before they get sick
because i know as a doctor if someone comes to me with stage i disease i 'm thrilled we can often cure them but often it 's too late and it 's stage iii or iv cancer for example so by leveraging these technologies together i think we 'll enter a new era that i like to call stage zero medicine and as a cancer doctor i 'm looking forward to being out of a job a
