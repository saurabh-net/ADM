know the world wide web has absolutely transformed publishing broadcasting commerce and social connectivity but where did it all come from
and i 'll quote three people vannevar bush doug engelbart and tim berners lee so let 's just run through these guys this is vannevar bush vannevar bush was the u s government 's chief scientific adviser during the war and in one thousand nine hundred and forty five he published an article in a magazine called atlantic monthly and the article was called as we may think
and what vannevar bush was saying was the way we use information is broken
we don 't work in terms of libraries and catalog systems and so forth the brain works by association with one item in its thought it snaps instantly to the next item and the way information is structured is totally incapable of keeping up with this process
he built a system the system was designed to augment human intelligence it was called and in a premonition of today 's world of cloud computing and softwares of service his system was called nls for on line system
and he 's driving it all with this platform here with a five finger keyboard and the world 's first computer mouse which he specially designed in order to do this system so this is where the mouse came from as well
so this is doug engelbart
the trouble with doug engelbart 's system was that the computers in those days cost several million pounds so for a personal computer a few million pounds was like having a personal jet plane it wasn 't really very practical
but spin on to the eighty s when personal computers did arrive then there was room for this kind of system on personal computers and my company owl built a system called guide for the apple macintosh and we delivered the world 's first hypertext system
and this began to get a head of steam apple introduced a thing called hypercard and they made a bit of a fuss about it they had a twelve page supplement in the wall street journal the day it launched
so i took this system to a trade show in versailles near paris in late november one thousand nine hundred and ninety and i was approached by a nice young man called tim berners lee who said are you ian ritchie and i said yeah and he said i need to talk to you
and he told me about his proposed system called the world wide web and i thought well that 's got a pretentious name especially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office
but he was completely convinced that his world wide web would take over the world one day and he tried to persuade me to write the browser for it because his system didn 't have any graphics or fonts or layout or anything it was just plain text i thought well you know interesting but
and the very next year in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four we had the conference here in edinburgh and i had no opposition in having tim berners lee as the keynote speaker so that puts me in pretty illustrious company there was a guy called dick rowe who was at decca records and turned down the beatles
