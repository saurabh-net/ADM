access to a slide projector i actually find them a lot emotional
and personal and the neat thing about a slide projector is you can actually focus the work
unlike powerpoint and some other programs now i agree that you have to
yeah there are certain concessions and you know if you use a slide projector you're not able to have the bad type swing in from the back or the side down
maybe that's an ok trade off to trade that off for a focus
slides getting stuck and the thing you really hope for is occasionally they burn up tonight so with that
the first slide up here this as many of you have probably guessed is a recently emptied beer can in portugal
this i had just arrived in barcelona for the first time and i thought you know fly all night i looked up and i thought wow how clean you come into this major airport and they simply have a
i mean how nice is that everything 's gotten simpler in design and here 's this
mega airport and god i just i took a picture i thought god that is the coolest thing i've ever seen at an airport till a couple months later
i went back to the same airport same plane i think and looked up and it said c
was only then that i realized it was simply a gate that i was coming into
i'm a big believer in the emotion of design and the message that's sent before somebody begins to read before they get the rest of the information what is the
very simplified version of what i'm talking about these are a couple of garage doors painted identical situated next to each other so here 's the first door
you know you get the message you know it's pretty clear take a look at the second door and see if there's any different message ok which one would you park in front of
same color same message same words the only thing that's different is the expression that the individual door owner here put into the piece and again which is the psycho killer
yet it doesn't say that it doesn't need to say that i would probably park in front of the other one
i'm sure a lot of you are aware that graphic design has gotten a lot simpler in the last five years or so it's gotten so simple that it's already starting to kind of come back the other way again and get a little more
this graffiti artist has come along made this sign a little bit better and then moved on
he didn't overpower it like they have a tendency to do
for a book by metropolis i took some photos and this is
too cheap to tear the whole sign down so they just teared out sections of it and i would argue that it's possibly more effective than the original billboard
in terms of getting your attention getting you to look over that way and hopefully you don't stop and buy those awful pecan things stuckey 's this is from my
second book the first book is called the end of print and it was done along with a film working with william burroughs and the end of print is now in its fifth printing
when i first contacted william burrows about being part of it he said no he said he didn't believe it was the end of print
would love to have your input on this film and this book and he finally agreed to it and at the end of the film he says the end of painting
painting people are just going to take pictures now and of course that wasn't the case so this is from two nd sight
book i did on intuition i think it's not the only ingredient in design but possibly the most important it's something everybody has
not a matter of teaching it in fact most of the schools tend to discount intuition as an ingredient of your working process
because they can't quantify it it's very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card
or a newsletter so it tends to get discounted this is a quote from albert einstein who says the intellect has little to do on the road to discovery
a leap in consciousness call it intuition or what you will and the solution just comes to you and you
know from where or why so it's kind of like when somebody says who did that song and the more you try to think about it the further the answer gets from you and the minute you stop thinking about it your intuition gives you that answer in a sense
like this for a couple of reasons if you've had any design courses they would teach you you can't read this i think you eventually can and more importantly i think it's true
for communication just because something 's legible doesn't means it communicates more importantly it doesn't mean it communicates the right thing so what is the message sent before somebody actually gets into the material and i
think that's sometimes an overlooked area this is working with marshall mcluhan i stayed and worked with his wife and son eric and we came up with
just amazing in terms of being ahead of the times predicting so much of what has happened in the advertising television media
world and so this book is called probes it's another word for quotes and it's a lot of them are never have never been published before and basically i've interpreted the different quotes
so this was the contents page originally when i got done it was five hundred and forty pages and then the publisher gingko press ended up cutting it down
under four hundred pages now but i decided i liked this contents page i liked the way it looks so i kept it
it now has no relevance to the book whatsoever but it's a nice spread
so a couple spreads from the book here mcluhan says the new media are not bridges between man and nature
they are nature the invention of printing did away with
new technologies impose themselves on societies long habituated to older technologies anxieties of all kinds result
i hate this stuff it's hard to read
in the electronic age have no possible environment except the globe and no possible occupation except information gathering
that was it that's all he saw as the options and not too far off so this is a project for nine inch nails and i only show it because it seemed like it got all this relevancy all of a sudden and it was done right after nine eleven
and i had recently discovered a bomb shelter in the backyard of a house i had bought in la that the real estate person hadn't pointed out
some bomb shelter built apparently in the sixties cuban missile crisis and i asked the real estate guy what it was as we were walking by and he goes it 's something to do with the sewage system i was ok that's fine i finally went down there and it was this old rusted
circular thing and two beds and very kind of creepy and weird and also surprisingly it was done in kind of a cheap metal and it had completely rusted through
and water everywhere and spiders and i thought you know what where they thinking you'd think maybe cement possibly or something but anyway i
for a cover for the nine inch nails dvd and i've also now fixed the bomb shelter with duct tape and i think i'm ready
was a six shot sequence and trying to use print as a medium to get people to the web so this is a six shot sequence i've taken one shot i cropped it a few different ways and then the tiny line of copy says if you want to see this
sequence how this whole ride was go to the website and my guess is that a lot of the surf kids did go to the site to get this entire picture got no way of tracking it so i could be totally wrong
i don't have the site it's just the piece itself this is a group in new york called the coalition for a smoke free environment asked me to do these posters they were wild posted around new york city
you can't really well you can't see it at all but the second line is really the more kind of payoff in a sense it says if the cigarette companies can lie then so can we
i did these were literally wild posted all over new york one night and there were definitely some heads turning you know people smoking
this amazes me this is a product i just found out i was in the caribbean at christmas and i'm just blown away that in this day and age they will still sell
not that they will sell that there is felt a need for people to lighten the color of their skin this was either an old product with new packaging or a brand new package
how 's that still happening i do a lot of workshops all over the world really and this particular assignment was to come up with new symbols for the restroom doors
i felt this was one of the more successful solutions the students actually cut them up and put them up around bars and restaurants that night and i just always have this vision of this elderly couple going to use the
i did some work for microsoft a few years back it was a worldwide branding campaign and it was interesting to me my background is in sociology i had no design training and sometimes people say well that
but it was a very interesting experiment because there's no product that i had to sell it was simply the image of microsoft they were trying to improve they thought some people didn't like them
was to try to humanize them a bit and what i did was add type and people to the ad which the previous campaign had not had and nobody remembered them and nobody referenced them and we were trying to say that
some of these guys that work there are actually ok some of them actually have friends and family and they're not all
perceived as a negative their over competitiveness their you know long working hours and turn it into a positive and not run from it
thank god it's monday i get to go back to that little cubicle those fake gray walls and hear everybody else's conversations f or ten hours and then go home but anyway this is one of the ads i was most pleased with
because they were all elaborately art directed and this one i thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer it says wonder around and then it's a piece of the software and this is how the ad ran around the world
in germany they made one small change without checking with me nor did they have to because it was done through agencies but see if you can tell the difference this is how the ad ran throughout the world germany made one slight change in the
issues here if you're going to put a kid in the ad pick one that looks alive
have a feeling this kid 's been there for a week you know he 's just really hoping that boots up and
and then as the agency explained to me they said look
we don't have little green people in our country why would we put little green people in our ads for instance so i understand their logic i totally disagree with it i think it's a very small minded
approach the world is certainly much more global and i certainly think the people of germany could have handled a little black girl sitting in front of a computer though we'll never know this is some work from ray
and the point of this magazine was to read the articles listen to the music and try to interpret it there's no grid there's no system there's nothing set up in advance this is
for brian eno and it's just kind of my personal interpretation of the music this is rockstars talking about teachers they had lusted after
in school there's a lot of great writing in ray gun and i was fortunate to find a photograph of a teacher sitting on some
you could you could highlight it you could make it helvetica or something it is
article i suppose you could eventually decode it but it's really not very well written it really wouldn't be worthwhile
chosen to show the photo we'd already seen a million times which was basically the moment of impact and people magazine
got probably the best shot it's kind of horsey type but the
right hand page was not given up to the whole issue look at the image of this lady who knows what she's going through
this says one clean fits all there were a lot of orphans made this day and here 's a dead body being brought out it just seems to me possibly even a blank page would have been more appropriate and
i gave a talk in new york a couple months after this and afterwards somebody came up to me and they said that they actually emailed me and they said that they appreciated the talk and when they got back to their car
they found a note on their car that made them think maybe new york was getting back to being new york again after this event it had been a few months this was what they found on their car
very few times you'd be happy to find this on your car but it did seem to indicate that we were coming back this is my desktop somebody told me today there was this thing called folders
are these are my notes for the talk there might be a correlation here we are wrapping up this i saw on the plane flying in
for hot new products i'm not sure this is an improvement or a good idea because like if you don't spend quite enough time in front of your computer you can now get a plate in the keyboard
so there's no more faking it that you don't really sit at your desk all day and eat and work anyway now there's a plate and it would be really really convenient to get a piece of pizza then type a little
just not sure this is improvement if you ever doubt the power of graphic design this is a very generic sign that literally says vote for hitler it says nothing else and this to me is an extreme case of the power of
of graphic design even though in fact was a very generic poster at the time what's next what's next is going to be
this is i like found art hand lettering 's coming back in a big way and i thought this was a great example of both this lady 's advertising for her lost pit bull it's friendly she's underlined friendly that's probably why she calls it hercules or hercles
visions of people going down alleyways yelling out for hercles and you get charged by this thing and you go oh please be hercles please be
i'm sure she never found the dog because i took the sign but i was asked to give a talk at a conference in sacramento a few years back and the theme was courage
test pilot and he told me that when you signed up to become a test pilot they told you that there was a forty to fifty percent chance of death on the job that's pretty high for most occupations
and i started thinking about some of these decisions i have to make between
for the most part they're not real life threatening why not experiment why not have some fun
and the best one i've heard i'm sure some of you have heard this the definition of a good job is if you could afford to if money wasn't an issue would you be doing that same work
and if you would you've got a great job and if you wouldn 't what the heck are you doing you're going to be dead a really long time thank you very much
