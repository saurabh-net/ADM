question him rather than speaking in fact what we're going to talk about i think is in fact
a subject that is probably better served by a conversation
a bit of news clip to
since the september eleventh attack on the world trade center many people have flocked to downtown new york to see and pay respects at
what amounts to the sixteen acre burial ground
now as cbs 's jim axelrod reports they're putting the finishing touches on a new way for people to visit and view the
forget the empire state building or the statue of liberty there's a new place in new york where the crowds are thickest ground zero
my step daughter here from indianapolis
this was out of all the tourist sites in new york city this was her number one pick ja thousands now line up on lower broadway
even on the coldest winter days to honor and remember it's reality
so many in fact that seeing has become a bit of a problem but i think that people are very frustrated that they're not able to get closer to see what's going on
they'll get an incredible panorama and understand i think more completely the sheer totality of the destruction of the
if you think about it
the grand canyon or the washington monument
people come here to see what's no longer there
first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site but as moving burial
the walls are bare by design so people can fill them with their own memorials the way they already have along the current
from our hearts it affected us just as much ja the ramps are made of simple material the kind of plywood you see at construction sites which is really the whole point
in the face of america 's worst destruction
this is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment but certainly david you are known as i know a phrase you hate an entertainment architect
your work is highly sensual
even hedonistic dr i like that
it's about pleasure casinos and hotels and restaurants
how did the shock that all of us and especially all of us in new york felt on the
well the truth of the matter is post september eleventh
i felt myself in the role originally first of all as someone who lives in tribeca
and whose neighborhood was devastated and as someone who works less than a mile from there that i was in the role of forcing one hundred people who work
found myself the friday after september eleventh two days afterwards literally unable to motivate anyone and to do anything we
gave the office a few days off
in discussing this with other architects
and i thought it was astonishing to speculate as if this were a competition on something that was such a fresh wound and
had a series of discussions first with rick scofidio and liz diller who collaborated with us on this and several other people
and really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something
and that as people who create places the
way to help wasn't to pontificate or to make up scenarios but to help right now
so we tried to come up with a way as a group to have a kind of design swat team and that was the mission that we came up with
were you conscious of suddenly as a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants suddenly
well what i was aware of was there was this overwhelming need
we were asked to participate in a few projects before this there was a school ps two hundred and thirty four that had been evacuated down at
ground zero they moved to an abandoned school we took about twenty or thirty architects and designers and artists and over four days it was like this urban barn raising to renovate it and everyone wanted to help it was just extraordinary
tom otterness contributed maira kalman contributed and it became this cathartic experience for us
as this project and this is only one of four that you've designed to surround the site you
against the incredibly byzantine entrenched
that had to do with long term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city and the fact is that there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled and there was talk
white rich corporate group that was not representative of the city ka shocking dr yeah surprising so
rick and liz and kevin and i
came up with the idea
the city actually approached us we first approached the city about pier ninety four we saw how ps two hundred and thirty four worked the families the victims of the families were going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing ka on the hudson river dr yeah
and the city actually through tim zagat initially and then through christyne nicholas then we got to giuliani said you know we don't want to do anything with pier ninety four right now but we have an observation platform for the families down at ground zero
that we'd like to be a more dignified experience for the families and a way to protect it from the weather so i went down there with rick and liz and kevin
and i've got to say it was the most moving experience of my life it was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it where the families of the victims had left notes to them and
mediation between us and the experience there was no filter and i remembered on september eleventh on fourteenth street the roof of our building we can see the world trade towers
from a conference room on the eighth floor on a tv that we had set up and then everyone was up on the roof so i ran up there and it was amazing how much harder it was to believe in real life
was a very powerful experience so we went back to the city and said we're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a but
we've spent some time down there
at the same time the city had this need they were looking for a solution to deal with thirty or forty thousand people a day who
going down there that had nowhere to go
there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site so dealing with it is just an immediate master plan there was a way there had to be a way to get people to move around the site
we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits and getting everybody on board but simply funding this thing it looks like you know a fairly simple thing but this was a half a million dollar
we knew that if it wasn't privately funded
and we also frankly knew that if it didn't happen by the end of the giuliani administration then everyone who we were dealing with at the dot and the police department and all of
we were meeting with twenty or thirty people with the city at a time and it was set up by the office of emergency management this incredible
and there was therefore this ticking clock because giuliani was obviously out three months after that
so the first thing we had to do was find a way to
surprise and we also had to be as under the radar screen as we could be in new york because the key was not raising a lot of objection and sort of working
we came up with the idea of setting up a foundation mainly because when we found a contractor who would build this he would not agree to
his initials are js and he owns rockefeller center if that helps anyone
we met with him the prices from the contractors were between five to seven hundred thousand dollars
and atlantic heydt who 's the largest scaffolding contractor in the country volunteered to do it at cost
so this developer said you know what we'll underwrite the entire expense
the size that we had drawn it
the spinal tap scene where you get the tiny little stonehenge i guess
in fact it was as if this was going to be window washing scaffolding there was no sense of the fact that this is next to saint paul that this is really a place that needs to be kind of dignified and a place to reflect and remember
and i've got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together watching the crowds that gathered at saint paul which is just to the right and moving around the site and i
live down there so we spent a lot of time looking at the need and i think people were amazed at two things i think they were amazed at the destruction
but i think there was a sense of disbelief about the heroics of new yorkers
we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said i 'm going to lock the door because this developer will not
to have you leave till you've signed off on this and we said well this is half the size it
doesn't have any of the design features that have been agreed upon by everyone everyone in the city we'd have to go back to the beginning to do this
and i convinced him that we should leave the room with the agreement to build it as designed
the next day i got an email from the developer saying that he was withdrawing all funding so we
didn't know what to do but we decided to cast a very wide net we emailed out letters to as many people as we could
several people in the audience here who were very helpful
thought of abandoning ship at that point dr no in fact i told the contractor to go ahead he had already ordered materials based on my go ahead
we knew that one way or another this
we just felt it had
you were funding yourself then with contributions and this
richard i think very correctly made the point at the beginning before all the chair designers
about the history of chair designers imposing
seems to me with this that it was the opposite of that because this was an unprecedented singular design
here 's the issue we knew
we think about the site and think about the need for a memorial it was important that this not be categorized as a memorial
that this was a place for people to to remember
kind of quiet place so it led us to using design solutions that created as few filters between the viewer as we said about the families platform and the experience as possible
it's all incredibly humble material it's scaffolding and
and it allows by sort of the procession of the movement up by saint paul 's and down the other side it gives you about three hundred feet to go up thirteen feet from the ground to
where you get the three hundred and sixty degree view but the design was driven by a need to be
zero is ka your work i mean we've talked about this before a lot of your work i think is informed by your belief in or your focus on the
of all things and the evanescence of things and a kind of
eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die sort of sense of existence
sense of existence this is
clearly not a work for the ages you know
i think this is obviously substantially different from anything we'd ever thought about doing before just by the nature of it
where it overlaps with thoughts about our work in general is number one the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done and kevin kennon
rick scofidio liz diller and all the people within the city
norman lear who i spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding offered to give us a bridge loan
so the notion of collaboration i think this reinforces how important that is and in terms of the temporary nature of it
our goal was not to create something that would be there longer than it needed to be i think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue
we felt may not have been happening enough in this city about what's really happening there and a day
was giuliani 's farewell address where he proposed the idea of all of ground zero being a memorial which was very controversial but it resonated with a lot of people and i think regardless of
what the position is about how this
sacred piece of land is to be used having it come out of actually seeing it
in a real encounter i think makes it a more powerful dialogue
and that's what we were interested in so that very much is in the realm of
it seems to me among other things a lovely piece of civic infrastructure it enables that conversation to get serious and six months after the fact and only a few months away from the site
being cleaned we are very quickly
now getting to the point where those conversations about what should go there are getting serious
do you have having been as physically
site as you have been doing this project have any ideas about what should or shouldn 't be done
one thing that shouldn 't be done is evaluate i think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan
the protetch gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings which had some
planning and uses and i think there should be a broader which there's starting to be the dialogue is really opening up to what does this site really want to be
and i truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out that it's going to be very hard to
there's a few discussions right now that i think are very positive about depressing the west side highway and connecting this over so that there's one uninterrupted piece of
well i think that's interesting and it gets to another issue that was
not many of us love the world trade center as a piece of architecture as what it had done to this city and that
huge plaza is this an opportunity is the silver lining a silver lining here
to rebuild some more traditional city grid or not
i think there's a real opportunity to engage in a discussion of why we live in cities and why do we live in places where such dissimilar people collide up against us each day
i don't think it has much to do with fifty or sixty or seventy or eighty thousand new office spaces regardless of what the number is so yeah i think there is a chance to re look at
which was the building just north of the
right which the towers fell into
the rest of the city so i think a public dialogue i think
you know i'd like to see an international competition and a call for ideas for uses
whether it's arts whether it's housing whether it's
and we're looking for other things this small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help including taking a small piece adjacent to the site
and inviting ten architects who currently don't have a voice in new york to do artist housing and find other ways to encourage the discussion to be against sort of monolithic single solutions and more about a multiplicity of things
before we end i know you have
piece of digital video of the experience of being on
john kamen who 's here actually put together a two and a half minute piece that shows the platform in use so i thought that
a memorial but were you
we certainly did as much
research as we could and we were conscious of
the scaffolding you can see built up over the street
you on behalf of new yorkers for
and getting this done but the kind of
virtually instantaneous nature of its erection and its being there almost before
believe that a response of this magnitude could be
