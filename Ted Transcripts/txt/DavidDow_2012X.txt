i was sitting at the kitchen table with my wife katya and we were talking about what i was gonna talk about today
we have an eleven year old son his name is lincoln he was sitting at the same table doing his math homework
doing his math homework and during a pause
in my conversation with katya i looked over at lincoln and i was suddenly thunderstruck
by a recollection of a client of mine
my client was a guy named will
he was from north texas he never knew his father very well because his father
and i realized that when my client will was his age
he 'd been living by himself for two years
will eventually joined a gang and committed a number of very serious crimes
including most seriously of all a horrible tragic murder
and will was ultimately executed as punishment for that crime
but i don 't want to
talk today about the morality of capital punishment i certainly think that my client shouldn 't have been executed but what i would like to do today instead
in a way that is entirely noncontroversial
i think that 's possible
because there is a corner of the death penalty debate
maybe the most important corner where everybody agrees
where the most ardent death penalty supporters and the most vociferous abolitionists
are on exactly the same page
that 's the corner i want to explore
before i do that though i want to spend a couple of minutes telling you how a death penalty case unfolds and then i want to tell you two lessons that i have learned over the last twenty years as a death penalty lawyer from watching well more than a hundred cases unfold in this way
and it 's followed by a trial where the murderer is convicted and sent to death row and that death sentence is ultimately upheld by the state appellate court
the third chapter is an even more complicated legal proceeding known as a federal habeas corpus proceeding and the fourth chapter
so what all of these death row inmates had to do was rely on volunteer lawyers to handle their legal proceedings than there were lawyers who had both the interest and the expertise to work on these cases and so inevitably
some of these lawyers were successful they managed to get new trials for their clients years sometimes by months
but the one thing that didn 't happen annual executions in texas
so we have this paradox why is that
here 's the second thing i learned my client will
was not the exception to the rule he was the rule
i 'll write his biography for you
and eight out of ten times the details of that biography will be more or less accurate
and the reason for that is that eighty percent of the people on death row are eighty percent of the people on death row are people who had exposure to the juvenile justice system
that 's the second lesson
right on the cusp of that corner
where everybody 's going to agree
but i think everybody would agree
would be a story where no murder ever occurs
but every once in a while as dwight eisenhower said
the way you solve a problem is to make it bigger
the way we solve this problem
we have to say all right
we have these four chapters of a death penalty story but what happens before that story begins
how can we intervene in the life of a murderer
before he 's a murderer what options do we have to nudge that person
off of the path still think is a bad result
the murder of an innocent human being
well that 's rocket science that 's the mathematical expression for the thrust created by a rocket
what we 're talking about today is just as complicated
what we 're talking about today is also
rocket science my client will
in his early childhood years when he was in elementary school there were a wide variety of things that society could have done in fact if we just imagine
that doesn 't mean that we don 't know a lot already
i 'll just mention a few
we could be providing early childhood care
there are other states that do that
there 's one other thing we can be doing well there are a bunch of other things that we could be doing there 's one other thing that we could be that i say today
we could be intervening much more aggressively
if we 're gonna do that
it 's not yet too late
there 's still time to nudge them
if we think about nudging them rather than just punishing them
is we 're paying later but the thing is
even if you don 't agree that there 's a moral imperative that we do it
it just makes economic sense
the day that he was going to be executed
and we were talking about his life
and then about his mom
who he did know who is still alive
i know that she tried to kill you actually remember that
i said i don 't remember anything
from when i was five years old
maybe you just remember somebody telling you
he looked at me and he said
that 's something you don 't forget
i hope there 's one thing you all won 't forget
if we make the picture bigger
that begins the death penalty story
