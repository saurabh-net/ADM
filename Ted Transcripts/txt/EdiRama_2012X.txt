i was an artist i still paint
to our lives and to our communities and i try to bring something of the artist in me in my politics
and the role it can play for the better in our lives for eleven years
i was mayor of tirana
and use of colors in order to revive the hope
that had been lost in my city
but this use of colors was not just an artistic
amounted to zero comma something
when we painted the first building
by splashing a radiant orange on the somber gray
there was a traffic jam
and a crowd of people gathered as if it were the location of some spectacular accident
or the sudden sighting of a visiting pop star
but we will choose the colors
but i told him no i 'm sorry compromise in colors
and we have enough gray
it 's time for change
the rehabilitation of public spaces
of people about their own place of living deep for years
under the fury of the illegal barbaric constructions that sprang up in the public space
this action and to have buildings painted like that
and then the second question was
sixty three percent of people said yes we like it
thirty seven said no we don 't like
less litter in the streets for example started to pay taxes
and where we were in the process of planting trees
they had thrown the old shutter in the garbage collection place why did you throw away the shutters i asked
if we brought the same energy and hope to our politics
we could build a better life
for each other and for our country
we removed one hundred and twenty three thousand tons of concrete only from the riverbanks we demolished
more than five thousand illegal buildings all over the city
everybody accepted it and all businessmen paid it regularly by means of open competitions we managed to recruit in our administration many young people
and we thus managed to build a de politicized public institution where men and women were equally represented international organizations
have invested a lot in albania during these twenty years not all of it well spent
when i told the world bank directors that i wanted them to finance a project to build
a model reception hall for citizens
precisely in order to fight endemic daily corruption
they did not understand me
but people were waiting in long queues under sun and under rain in order to get a certificate or just a simple answer from two tiny windows
from two tiny windows of two metal kiosks
they were paying in order to skip the queue
coming from this dark hole
we could change the invisible clerks within the kiosks every week but
we could not change this corrupt practice i 'm convinced i told a german official with the world bank
with the world bank it
some being with a high conscience and some others having not a conscience it 's about system it 's about organization it 's also about environment and respect we removed the kiosks
we built the bright new reception hall that made people
we put the citizen first and not the clerks
is the answer and not reinventing people based on a ready made formula that the developed world often tries in vain to impose
things have come to this point because politicians in general
but especially in our countries let 's face it
they take it for granted that come what may people have to follow them
while politics more and more fails
a cynical team game played by politicians while the public has been pushed aside seen from those stairs
all politicians today seem the same and politics has come to resemble a sport
that inspires more aggressiveness and pessimism than social cohesion and the desire for civic protaganism barack obama won
with an admirable ingenuity he managed to transform them into activists by giving them all the possibility to hold in their hands the arguments and the instruments that each would need
to campaign in his name by making his own campaign i tweet i love it
i love it because it lets me get the message out but it also lets people get their messages to me this is politics not from top down but from the bottom up
and sideways and allowing everybody 's voice to be heard is exactly what we need they are not
they are human beings with different views and different visions for the world
when people say nothing can change just stop and think what the world was like
the use of color can make change happen i want to make more change president roosevelt
