speak today about the relationship between science and human values
now it's generally understood that questions of morality
thought that science can help us get what we value
and consequently most people i think most people probably here think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life
questions like what is worth living for what is worth dying for what constitutes a good life
so i'm going to argue that this is an illusion that the separation between science and human values is an illusion and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history
and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres
often thought that there is no description of the way the world is
but i think this is quite clearly untrue
values are a certain kind of fact
facts about the wellbeing of conscious creatures
why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks
we feel compassion for rocks
because we don't think rocks can suffer and if we're more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects as indeed we are
is something that we could be right or wrong about and if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience
well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects and there is no
notion no version of human morality and human values that i've ever come across that is not at some point
even if you get your values from religion
even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death either to an eternity of happiness with god or an eternity of suffering in hell
you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes and to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim which of course may or may not be true
now to speak about the conditions of well being in this life for human beings we know that there is a continuum of such facts
we know that it's possible to live in a failed state
where everything that can go wrong does go wrong where mothers can not feed their children
and we know that it's possible to move along this continuum
that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space
so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors probably not there are truths to be known about how human communities flourish
whether or not we understand these truths and morality relates to these truths so in talking about values we are talking about facts
now our situation in the world can be understood at many levels ranging from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements but if we're going to talk about human wellbeing
we are of necessity talking about the human brain because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain
the suicide bomber does get seventy two virgins
in the afterlife in this life
his personality his rather unfortunate personality is the product of his brain
so the contributions of culture if culture changes us as indeed it does it changes us by changing our brains and so therefore
whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can at least in principle be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind neuroscience psychology
so what i'm arguing is that value is reducable to facts to facts about the conscious
and we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings
i think of this as kind of a moral landscape with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well being of conscious creatures both personal and collective
and one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human wellbeing that we rarely access that few people access and these await our discovery
now let me be clear about what i'm not saying i'm not saying
that science is guaranteed to map this space
we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question
i don't think for instance that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child
or whether we should bomb iran 's nuclear facilities or whether you can deduct the full cost of ted as a business expense
if questions affect human wellbeing then they do have answers whether or not we can find them and just admitting this
there are twenty one states in our country
raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin
and hundreds of thousands of children incidentally are subjected to this every year
the locations of these enlightened districts i think will fail to surprise you
we're not talking about connecticut and the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious the creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod lest we spoil the child
this is in proverbs thirteen and twenty and i believe twenty three
but we can ask the obvious question
is it a good idea generally speaking to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior is there
that this question has an answer and that it matters
now many of you might worry that the notion of wellbeing is truly undefined
and seemingly perpetually open to be reconstrued and so how therefore can there be an objective
now around eighty in the developed world
notice that the fact that the concept of health is open genuinely open for revision does not make it vacuous
the distinction between a healthy person and a dead one
is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science an objective morality
well think of how we talk about food
i would never be tempted to argue to you
but there is nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison
the fact that there are many right answers to the question what is food
does not tempt us to say that there are no
a principle like don 't lose your queen is very good to follow
but clearly it admits of exceptions there are moments when losing your queen is a brilliant thing to do there are moments when it is the only good thing you can do
and yet chess is a domain of perfect objectivity the fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all
the sort of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere
consider the great problem of women 's bodies
is one thing you can do about them you can cover them up
now it is the position generally speaking of our intellectual community that
we may not like this
we might think of this as wrong in boston or palo alto
who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags
and who are we to say even that they are wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way
who are are we not to say this
that we know so little about human wellbeing that we have to be non judgmental about a practice like this
i'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil women should be able to wear whatever they want as far as i'm concerned but what does voluntary mean
where when a girl gets raped
her fathers first impulse rather often
is to murder her out of shame
just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute daughter gets raped
and what you want to do
now to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society
this is what it's like to go to a news stand almost anywhere in the civilized world
now granted for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images
if we are in a reflective mood we can ask
is this the perfect expression
of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women 's bodies i mean is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children
probably not okay so perhaps there is some place on the spectrum
between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance
now the irony from my perspective is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another
and of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind
not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well being
in fact the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering
this is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage
and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation
the demagogues are right about one thing we need a universal conception of human values
now what stands in the way of this well one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality especially secular academic scientist types
when talking about morality we value differences of opinion
so we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one 's time
most western intellectuals look at this situation and say well there is nothing for the dalai lama to be really right about really right about or for ted bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a
real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science he likes chocolate he likes vanilla there is nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other
notice that we don't do this in science
on the left you have edward witten he 's a string theorist
if you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around in my experience half of them will say ed witten
the other half will tell you they don't like the question
nothing would happen because i'm not a physicist i don't understand string theory i'm the ted bundy of string theory
i wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member
but this is just the point whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded that is what it is to have a domain of expertise that is what it is for knowledge to count
how have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise or moral talent
or moral talent or moral genius
have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering
the taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering
no how is their ignorance
any less obvious on the subject of human wellbeing
so this i think is what the world needs now
it needs people like ourselves
to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing and morality relates
for individuals and even for whole cultures to care about the wrong things
just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality
we live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less and they will one day mean nothing
we live in a world filled with destructive technology and this technology can not be uninvented it will always be easier to break things than to fix them
it seems to me therefore patently obvious that we can no more
respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human wellbeing than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads
or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes we simply must converge
on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life
combustible material there whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world hearing some of this may well be doing the screaming with rage thing after as well
in the muslim world spoken with a lot of
muslim women and some of them would say something else they would say
you know this is a celebration of female specialness it helps build that and it's a result of the fact that and this is arguable a sophisticated psychological view
that male lust is not to be trusted i mean can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without
you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don't veil yourself and so if anyone in this room wanted to
a very funny hat or tattoo their face i think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want but we have to be honest
about the constraints that these women are placed under and so i think we shouldn 't be so eager to always take their word for it especially when it's one hundred and twenty degrees out and they're wearing a full burqa
a a lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress but can you
i think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail then you have to admit that
going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail so we're going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion
we are inevitably going to converge on that fact space so everything is not going to be up for grabs it's not going to be like
veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and
well educated in the context of men who do desire women i mean i don't think we need an nsf grant to know that
interrogate them do people love their daughters just as much in these systems
and i think there are clearly right answers to that c a and if the
come out that actually they do are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgement on some of these issues
well yeah modulo one obvious fact that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system so you can say like because i knew my gay son was going to go to hell if
again then we have to talk about wellbeing in a larger context it's all of us in this together not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus
