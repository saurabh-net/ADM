to talk to you about today is two things one the rise of a culture of availability and two a request so we're seeing a rise of this availability being driven by mobile device proliferation globally across all social strata
we're seeing along with that proliferation of mobile devices an expectation of availability and with that comes the third point which is obligation and an obligation to that availability and the problem is we're still working through from a societal standpoint
how we allow people to be available there's a significant delta in fact between what we're willing to accept apologies to hans rosling he said anything that's not using real stats is a lie but the big delta there is
how we deal with this from a public standpoint so we've developed certain tactics and strategies to
the stretch ok the gentleman on the left is saying screw you i'm going to check my device but the guy here on the right he 's doing the stretch it's that
out the physical contortion to get that device just below the tabletop or my favorite the love you mean it
or this one coming to us from india you can find this on youtube the gentleman who 's recumbent on a motorcycle while text messaging or what we call the sweet gravy stop me before i kill again
that is actually the device what this is doing is we find a a direct collision
we find a direct collision between availability and what's possible through availability and a fundamental human need which we've been hearing about a lot the need
shared narratives we're very good at creating personal narratives but it's the shared narratives that make us a culture and when you're standing with someone
look around you there might be somebody on one right now participating in multi dimensional engagement
our reality right now is less interesting than the story we're going to tell about it later this one i love this poor kid clearly a prop don't get me wrong a willing prop but the kiss that's being documented kind of looks like
this is the sound of one hand clapping
so as we lose the context of our identity it becomes incredibly important that what you share becomes the context of shared narrative
we are creating the technology that is going to create the new shared experience which will create the new world and so my request is please let 's make technologies that make people more human and not less
