when we think of our senses
we don 't usually think of the reasons why they probably evolved from a biological perspective we don 't really think of the evolutionary need to be protected by our senses but that 's probably why our senses really evolved to keep us safe to allow us to live really when we think of our senses or when we think of the loss of the sense
we really think about something more like this the ability to touch something luxurious to taste something delicious to smell something fragrant to see something beautiful this is what we want out of our senses we want beauty we don 't just want function
and when it comes to sensory restoration we 're still very far away from being able to provide beauty and that 's what i 'd like to talk to you a little bit about today likewise for hearing when we think about why we hear we don 't often think about the ability to hear an alarm or a siren although clearly that 's an important thing
really what we want to hear is music
i 'd like to impress upon you how unusual it is that we can hear music music is just one of the strangest things that there is
it 's acoustic vibrations in the air little waves of energy in the air that tickle our eardrum somehow in tickling our eardrum that transmits energy down our hearing bones which get converted to a fluid impulse inside the cochlea and then somehow converted into an electrical signal in our auditory nerves that somehow wind up in our brains
as a perception of a song or a beautiful piece of music that process is entirely abstract and very very unusual and we could discuss that topic alone for days to really try to figure out how is it that we hear something that 's emotional from something that starts out as a vibration in the air
turns out that if you have hearing loss most people that lose their hearing lose it at what 's called the cochlea the inner ear
and it 's at the hair cell level that they do this
now if you had to pick a sense to lose i have to be very honest with you and say we 're better at restoring hearing than we are at restoring any sense that there is
in fact nothing even actually comes close to our ability to restore hearing and as a physician and a surgeon i can confidently tell my patients that if you had to pick a sense to lose we are the furthest along medically and surgically with hearing as a musician
there is a limitation to what a child who 's deaf an infant who was born deaf has in this world in terms of social educational vocational opportunities i 'm not saying that they can 't live a beautiful wonderful life i 'm saying that they 're going to face obstacles that most people who have normal hearing will not have to face
now hearing loss and the treatment for hearing loss has really evolved in the past two hundred years i mean literally they used to do things like stick ear shaped objects onto your ears and stick funnels in and that was the best you could do for hearing loss
back then you couldn 't even look at the eardrum so it 's not too surprising that there were no good treatments for hearing loss and now today we have the modern multi channel cochlear implant which is an outpatient procedure it 's surgically placed inside the inner ear it takes about an hour and a half to two hours depending on where it 's done under general anesthesia and in the end you achieve something like this
where an electrode array is inserted inside the cochlea now actually this is quite crude in comparison to our regular inner ear but here is that same girl who is implanted now this is her ten years later and this is a video that was taken by my surgical mentor dr john niparko who implanted her if we could play this video please
do you remember writing that chapter
you turn on the radio and all of a sudden they can 't hear music almost at all in fact most implant users really struggle and dislike music because it sounds so bad
and so when it comes to this idea of restoring beauty to somebody 's life we have a long way to go when it comes to audition
now there are a lot of reasons for that i mentioned earlier the fact that music is a different capacity because it 's abstract language is very different language is very precise in fact the whole reason we use it is because it has semantic specificity
when you say a word what you care is that word was perceived correctly you don 't care that the word sounded pretty when it was spoken music is entirely different when you hear music if it doesn 't sound good what 's the point there 's really very little point in listening to music when it doesn 't sound good to you
the acoustics of music are much harder than those of language and you can see on this
figure that the frequency range and the decibel range the dynamic range of music is far more heterogeneous
so if we had to design a perfect cochlear implant what we would try to do is target it to be able to allow music transmission
because i always view music as the pinnacle of hearing if you can hear music you should be able to hear anything now the problems begin first with pitch perception i mean most of us know that pitch is a fundamental building block of music and without the ability to perceive pitch well
music and melody is a very difficult thing to do forget about a harmony and things like that now this is a midi arrangement of rachmaninoff 's prelude now if we could just play this
the sound quality or the sound of the sound is how i like to describe timbre tone color they cannot tell these things whatsoever this implant is not transmitting the quality of music that usually provides things like warmth
now if you look at the brain of an individual who has a cochlear implant and you have them listen to speech have them listen to rhythm and have them listen to melody what you find is that the auditory cortex is the most active during speech you would think that because these implants are optimized for speech they were designed for speech
but actually if you look at melody what you find is that there 's very little cortical activity in implant users compared with normal hearing controls
so for whatever reason this implant is not successfully stimulating auditory cortices during melody perception
i had patients tell me that those sound the same they cannot differentiate sound quality differences between those two clips again we are very very far away in just getting to where we want to get to now the question comes to mind is there any hope
and yes there is hope now i don 't know if anybody knows who this is this is does somebody know this is beethoven
and it turns out that his temporal bones were harvested when he died to try to look at the cause of his deafness which is why he has molding clay and his skull is bulging out on the side there but beethoven composed music long after he lost his hearing what that suggests is that even in the case of hearing loss
the capacity for music remains the brains remain hardwired for music i 've been very lucky to work with dr david ryugo where i 've been working on deaf cats that are white and trying to figure out what happens when we give them cochlear implants this is a cat that 's been trained to respond to a trumpet for food
if we were to direct efforts towards training cochlear implant users to hear music because right now there 's virtually no effort put towards that no rehabilitative strategies
very little in the way of technological advances to actually improve music we would come a long way
and he learned to play the piano after he received the cochlear implant and here 's a video of joseph and
and it 's one of the most awful things heartwarming but awful
when it comes to restoration of hearing we have certainly come a long way a remarkably long way
and we have a much longer way to go when it comes to the idea of restoring perfect hearing and let me tell you right now it 's fine that we would all be very happy with speech but i tell you if we lost our hearing if anyone here suddenly lost your hearing you would want perfect hearing back you wouldn 't want decent hearing you would want perfect hearing
restoration of basic sensory function is critical and i don 't mean to understate how important it is to restore basic function but it 's really restoration of the ability to perceive beauty
