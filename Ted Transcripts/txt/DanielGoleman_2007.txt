you know i'm struck by how one of the implicit themes of ted is compassion these very moving demonstrations we've just seen hiv in africa
president clinton last night and i'd like to do a little
if you will about compassion
and bring it from the
global level to the personal i'm a psychologist but rest assured i will not bring it to the scrotal
divinity students at the princeton theological seminary
told that they were going to give a practice sermon and they were each given a sermon topic half of those students were given as a topic the parable of the good samaritan the man who stopped the stranger in
to help the stranger in need by the side of the road half were given random bible topics then one by one they were told they had to go to another building
as they went from the first building to the second each of them passed a man who was bent over and moaning clearly in more interesting question is
did it matter they were contemplating the parable of the good samaritan
what turned out to determine whether someone would stop and help a stranger in need was how much of a hurry
they thought they were in were they feeling they were late or were they absorbed
in what they were going to talk about and this is i think the predicament of our lives
that we don't take every opportunity to help because our focus is in the wrong direction there's a new field in brain science social neuroscience
from social neuroscience is that our default wiring
is to help that is to say
if we attend to the other person we automatically empathize we automatically feel with
these newly identified neurons mirror neurons that act like a neuro wi fi activating in our brain exactly the areas activated in theirs we feel with automatically
and if that person is in need if that person is suffering we're automatically prepared to help at least that's the argument but then the question is
why don't we and i think this speaks to a spectrum that goes from complete self absorption
to noticing to empathy and to
the simple fact is if we are focused on ourselves if we're preoccupied as we so often are throughout the day
we don't really fully notice the other and this difference between the self and the other focus can be very subtle i was doing my
taxes the other day and i got to the point where i was listing all of the donations i gave and i had an epiphany it was
i came to my check to the seva foundation and i noticed that i thought boy my friend larry brilliant would really be happy that i gave money to seva then i realized that what i was getting from giving was a narcissistic hit
that i felt good about myself then i started to think about
the people in the himalayas whose cataracts would be helped and i realized that i went from this kind of narcissistic self focus to altruistic joy
to feeling good for the people that were being helped
i think that's a motivator but this
while back and i overheard two women talking about the brother of one woman who was in the singles scene
and this woman says my brother is having trouble getting dates so he 's trying speed dating i don't know if you know speed dating women sit at tables
and men go from table to table and there's a clock and a bell and at five minutes bingo
the conversation ends and the woman can decide whether to give her card
or her email address to the man for follow up and this woman says my brother 's never gotten a card and i know exactly why
the moment he sits down he starts talking non stop about himself he never asks about the woman and i was doing some research in the
the test was from the moment they got together how long it would take the guy to ask her a question with the word you in it and apparently epstein aced the test therefore the
this is a it's a little test i encourage you to try out at a party here at ted there are great opportunities
the harvard business review recently had an article called the human moment about how to make real contact with a person at work and they said well the fundamental thing you have to do is turn off your blackberry close your laptop
your daydream and pay full attention to the person
there is a newly coined word in the english language
for the moment when the person we're with whips out their blackberry or answers that cell phone and all of a sudden we don't exist
the word is pizzled it's a combination of puzzled and pissed off
my brother in law leonard decided to write a book about a serial killer this is a man who terrorized the very vicinity we're in many years ago he was known as the santa cruz strangler and before he was arrested he had murdered
his grandparents his mother and five co eds at uc santa cruz so my brother in law goes to interview this killer
and he realizes when he meets him that this guy is absolutely terrifying for one thing he 's almost seven feet tall
but that's not the most terrifying thing about him the scariest thing is that his iq is one hundred and sixty a certified genius
but there is zero correlation between iq and emotional empathy feeling with the other person they're controlled by different parts of the brain
one point my brother in law gets up the courage to ask the one question he really wants to know the answer to and that is
how could you have done it
pity for your victims these were very intimate murders he strangled his victims
if i'd felt the distress i could not have done it
to turn that part of me off
had to turn that part of me off and i think that that is very troubling
that is very troubling and in a sense
right now as bill mcdonough has pointed out
the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences we're all unwitting victims of a collective blind spot we don't notice and don't notice that we don't notice the toxic molecules
emitted by a carpet or by the fabric on the seats or we don't know if that fabric technological or
manufacturing nutrient it can be reused or does it just end up at landfill in other words we're oblivious to the
ecological and public health and social and economic justice consequences of the things we buy and use
room itself is the elephant in the room but we don't see it and we've
become victims of a system that points us elsewhere consider this there's a
wonderful book called stuff the hidden life of everyday objects
and it talks about the back story of something like a t shirt and it talks about where the cotton was grown and the fertilizers that were used and the consequences for soil of that fertilizer
and it mentions for instance that cotton is very resistant to textile dye about sixty percent washes off into wastewater and it's well known by epidemiologists that kids who live near textile works
tend to have high rates of leukemia
there's a company bennett and company that supplies polo com
they because of their ceo who 's aware of this in china formed a joint venture
with their dye works to make sure that they wastewater would be properly taken care of before it returned to the
right now we don't have the option to choose the virtuous t shirt over the non virtuous one
so what would it take to do that well i've been thinking
for one thing there's a new electronic tagging
can track it back to the factory once you can track it back to the factory you can look at the manufacturing processes that were used to make it and
if it's virtuous you can label it that way
or if it's not so virtuous you can go into today go into
any store put your scanner on a palm onto a barcode which will take you to a website they have it for people with in the world of
the question is will it make a difference
i did an article on what was then a new problem in new york it was homeless people on the streets
and i spent a couple of weeks going around with a social work agency that ministered to the homeless and i realized seeing the homeless through their eyes
that almost all of them were psychiatric patients that had nowhere to go they had a diagnosis it made me what it did was to shake me out of the urban trance where
when we see when we're passing someone who 's homeless in the periphery of our vision it stays on the periphery
we don't notice and therefore we
one day soon after that it was a friday
at the end of the day i went down i was going down to the subway it was rush hour and thousands of people were streaming down the stairs and all of a sudden as i was going down the stairs i noticed that there was a man
slumped to the side shirtless not moving
and people were just stepping over him hundreds and hundreds of people
and because my urban trance had been somehow weakened i
myself stopping to find out what was wrong the moment i stopped half a dozen other people immediately ringed the same guy and we found out that he was hispanic he didn't speak any english he had no money he'd been wandering the streets for days
and he 's fainted from hunger immediately someone went to get orange juice someone brought a hotdog someone brought a subway cop this guy
