back into my body now
usually when i play out the first thing that happens is people scream out
and then like and it 's i'm sure you're trying to figure out well how does this thing
well what i'm doing is oh controlling the pitch with my left hand
with this hand i'm controlling the volume so the further away my right hand gets the
sometimes i startle myself i'll forget that i have it on and i'll lean over to pick up something
go into the next tune because i
we're going to do a song by david mash called listen words are gone and maybe i'll have words come back to
think of some of the questions that are commonly asked there are so many and well i guess i could tell you a little of the history
it was invented around the nineteen twenties and
he also is a musician besides an inventor he came up with the idea for making the theremin
i think when he was working on some shortwave radios and there'd be that sound in the signal it's like
and he thought oh what if i could control that sound and turn it into an instrument because there are pitches in it and so somehow through developing that he eventually came to make the theremin the way it is now and
a lot of times even kids nowadays they'll make reference to
the funny googly sound they do and sometimes if i have too much coffee then my vibrato gets out of hand
your body and its functions when you're behind this thing you have to stay so still if you want to have the most control
it reminds me of the balancing act earlier on what michael was doing because you're fighting so hard to keep the balance with
what you're playing with and stay in tune and at the same time you don't want to focus so much on being in tune all the time
you want to be feeling the music and then also you're trying to stay very very very still because
little movements with other parts of your body will affect the pitch or sometimes if you're holding
it's definitely i think of it almost like like a yoga instrument because it makes you so aware of every little crazy thing your body is doing or
well i'm about to go on soon i don't want to be you know
it really does reflect the mood that you're in also if you 're you know if you're it's similar to being a vocalist except instead of it coming out of your throat you're controlling it just in the
and you don't really have a point of reference you're always relying on your ears and adjusting constantly you just have to always adjust to what's happening
have foreign notes come here and there and listen to it adjust it and just move on or else you'll get too tied up to
