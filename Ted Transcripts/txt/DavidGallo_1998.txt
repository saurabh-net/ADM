dave gallo and we're going to tell you some stories from the sea here in video we've got some of the most incredible video of the titanic that's ever been seen and we're not going to show you any of
the truth of the matter is that the titanic even though it's breaking all sorts of box office records it's not the most exciting story from the sea and the problem i think is that
we take the ocean for granted when you think about it the oceans are seventy five percent of the planet most of the planet 's ocean water the average depth is about two miles part of the problem i think is we stand at the beach or we see images like this of the ocean
and in the oceans there are the longest mountain ranges on the planet most of the animals are in the oceans most of the earthquakes and volcanoes are in the sea at the bottom of the sea the biodiversity and the biodensity in the ocean is higher in places than it is in the
it's mostly unexplored and yet there are beautiful sights like this that captivate us and make us become familiar with it but
when you're standing at the beach i want you to think that you're standing at the edge of a very unfamiliar world we have to have a very special technology to get into that unfamiliar world we use the submarine alvin and we use cameras
as in having new eyes people that have partnered with us have given us new eyes not only on what exists the new landscapes at the bottom of the sea
got these fishing lures on the bottom they're going up and down it's got tentacles dangling swirling around like that it's a colonial animal these are all individual animals banding together to make
this one creature and it's got these jet thrusters up in front
use in a moment and a little light if you take all the big fish and schooling fish and all that put them on one side of the scale put all the jelly type
of animals on the other side those guys win hands down most of the biomass in the ocean is made out of creatures like this here 's the x wing death jelly
the bioluminescence they use the lights for attracting mates and attracting prey and communicating we couldn't begin to show you our archival stuff from the jellies they come in all different sizes and shapes
we tend to forget about the fact that the ocean is miles deep on average and that we're real familiar with the animals that are in the first two hundred or three hundred feet
but we're not familiar with what exists from there all the way down to the bottom and these are the types of animals that live in that three dimensional space that micro gravity environment
of our favorites because it's a little octopod you can actually see through his head and here he is flapping with his ears and very gracefully going up
we see those at all depths and even at the greatest depths they go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet they come right up to the submarine they'll put their eyes right up to the window
this is really a world within a world and we're going to show you two in this case we're passing down through the mid ocean and we see creatures like this this is kind of like an undersea rooster this guy that looks incredibly formal in a way
this is basically scientific data that you're looking at it's footage that we've collected for scientific purposes and that's one of the things that bill 's been doing is providing scientists with this first
of animals like this in the world where they belong they don't catch them in a net they're actually looking at them down
over the atlantic that's the ridge right there but we're going to go across the caribbean central america and end up against the pacific
nine degrees north we make maps of these mountain ranges with sound with sonar and this is one of those mountain ranges we're coming around a cliff here on the right
the height of these mountains on either side of this valley is greater than the alps in most cases and there's tens of thousands of mountains out there that haven't been mapped yet
this is a volcanic ridge we're getting down further and further in scale and eventually we can come up with something like this this is an icon of our robot
jason it's called and you can sit in a room like this with a joystick and a headset and drive a robot like that around the bottom of the ocean in real time
one of the things we're trying to do at woods hole with our partners is to bring this virtual world this world this unexplored region back to the laboratory because we see it in bits and pieces right now
we see it either as sound or we see it as video or we see it as photographs or we see it as chemical sensors but we never have yet put it all together into one interesting picture here 's where bill 's cameras really do shine
this is what's called a hydrothermal vent and what you're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed hydrogen sulfide rich water coming out of a volcanic
on the sea floor gets up to six hundred seven hundred degrees fahrenheit somewhere in that range so that's all water under the sea a mile and a half two miles three miles down and we knew it was volcanic back in the sixties seventies
i think that's one of the greatest stories right now that we're seeing from the bottom of the sea is that the first thing we see coming out of the sea floor after a volcanic eruption is bacteria
the pressure here is four thousand pounds per square inch a mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles no sun has ever gotten down here all the energy to support these life forms is coming from inside the earth
so chemosynthesis and you can see how dense the population is these are called tube worms
these worms have no digestive system they have no mouth but they have two types of gill structures one for extracting oxygen out of the deep sea water another one which houses this chemosynthetic bacteria which takes the
like having your hand in boiling water and your foot in freezing water that's how they like to live dg this is
never any lights there except the lights that we bring here they go
these long filaments that you see on the back of the crab are actually created by the product of that bacteria so the bacteria grows hair on the crab on the back you see this again the red dot is the laser light of the submarine alvin to give us an idea about how far away we are from the
those are all shrimp you see the hot water over here here and here coming out
they're clinging to a rock face and actually scraping
off that rock face here 's a tiny little vent that's come out of the side of
you see this white v shaped mark on the back of this shrimp it's actually a light sensing organ it's how they find the hydrothermal vents
is happening along that forty thousand mile long mountain range that we're calling the ribbon of life because even today as we speak there's life being generated there from volcanic activity this is the first time we've ever tried this any place we're going to try to show you high definition from the pacific
we're moving up one of these pillars this one 's several stories tall
in it you'll see that it's a
for a lot of different animals there's a funny kind of hot plate here with vent water coming out of it
all of these are individual homes for worms now here 's a closer view of that community here 's crabs here worms here there are smaller animals crawling around here 's pagoda structures i
this is the neatest looking thing i just can't get over this that you've got these little chimneys sitting here smoking away this stuff is toxic as hell by the way you could never get a permit to dump this in the ocean and it's coming out all
this bacteria that we've been talking about turns out to be the most simplest form of life found
a number of groups that are proposing that life evolved at these vent sites although the vent sites are short lived an individual site
it works too well you see there 're some fish inside here as well there's a fish sitting here here 's a crab
right at the end of that tube worm waiting for that worm to stick his head out
from a human perspective is toxic as hell not only that but on top the lifeblood that plumbing system turns off
i'll end up with saying one thing there's a story in the sea in the waters of the sea in the sediments and the rocks of the sea floor it's an incredible story what we see when we look back in time in
those sediments and rocks is a record of earth history everything on this planet everything works by cycles and rhythms the continents move apart they come back together oceans come and go mountains come and go
and what we're learning now is that you can't listen to a five billion year long symphony get to today and say stop we want tomorrow 's note to be the same as it was today it's absurd it's just absurd
