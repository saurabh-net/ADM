i 'd like to tell you about a magical place called darpa where scientists and engineers defy the impossible and refuse to fear failure
now these two ideas are connected more than you may realize
because when you remove the fear of failure impossible things suddenly become
impossible things suddenly become ask yourself this question
what would you attempt to do
if you knew you could not fail
if you really ask yourself this question you can 't help but feel uncomfortable
i feel a little uncomfortable
because when you ask it you begin to understand how the fear of failure constrains you
how it keeps us from attempting great things
and life gets dull amazing things stop happening sure good things happen
but amazing things stop happening
i 'm not encouraging failure
i 'm discouraging fear of failure
because it 's not failure itself that constrains us the path to truly new never been done before things always has failure along the way clemenceau said
life gets interesting when we fail
in october of one thousand nine hundred and three the prevailing opinion of expert aerodynamicists
the flight lasted twelve seconds
and covered one hundred and twenty feet
that was one thousand nine hundred and three one year later the next declarations of impossibilities began ferdinand foch a french army general credited with having one of the most original and subtle minds in the french army
but of no military value
forty years later aero experts coined the term transonic they debated should it have one s or two
you see they were having trouble in this flight regime and it wasn 't at all clear that we could fly faster than the speed of sound
in one thousand nine hundred and forty seven there was no wind tunnel data beyond mach zero point eight five
and he flew towards an unknown
than in all u two missions combined
it took a lot of failures to get there
since we took to the sky we have wanted to fly
that 's still true today
today we don 't talk about flying transonically
or even supersonically we talk about flying hypersonically
not mach two or mach three mach twenty
at mach twenty we can fly from
new york to long beach in eleven minutes and twenty seconds
and we are flying it or trying to maneuvering aircraft ever built
it 's boosted to near space atop a minotaur iv rocket now the minotaur iv has too much impulse so we have to bleed it off by flying the rocket at an eighty nine degree angle of attack for portions of the trajectory
and it 's pointed at the hypersonic glider
this is the actual rocketcam footage from flight one
now to conceal the shape we changed the aspect ratio a little bit but this is what it looks like from the third stage of the rocket
looking at the unmanned glider
as it heads into the atmosphere back towards earth we 've flown twice
but we collected more hypersonic flight data than in thirty years of ground based testing combined
and in the second flight
three minutes of fully controlled aerodynamic flight
you can 't learn to fly at mach twenty unless you fly
and while there 's no substitute for speed maneuverability is a very close second
if a mach twenty glider takes eleven minutes and twenty seconds to get from new york to long beach a hummingbird but they are maneuverable
small enough and maneuverable enough to do so
this is a hummingbird drone
it can fly in all directions
is equipped with a video camera
it weighs less than one aa battery
it does not eat nectar
in two thousand and eight it flew for a whopping twenty seconds
a year later two minutes then six eventually eleven many prototypes crashed
many prototypes crashed it
and make amazing new things
with the occasional clumsiness of a human
or perhaps spider man will one day be gecko man
a gecko can support its entire body weight with one toe
one square millimeter of a gecko 's footpad has fourteen thousand hair like structures called setae they are used to help it grip to surfaces using intermolecular forces
today we can manufacture structures that mimic the hairs of a gecko 's foot the result
can support a static load of six hundred and sixty pounds that 's enough to stick six forty two inch plasma tv 's to your wall no nails
so much for velcro right
in the world of godzilla spider mites we can make millions of mirrors each one fifth the diameter of a human hair moving at hundreds of thousands of times per second to make large screen displays so that we can watch movies like godzilla in high def
and if we can build machines at that scale what about eiffel tower like trusses at the microscale
today we are making metals that are lighter than styrofoam so light they can sit atop a dandelion puff and be blown away with a wisp of air
from the smallest wisp of air to the powerful forces of nature 's storms there are
forty four lightning strikes per second around the globe each lightning bolt heats the air to forty four thousand degrees
experiments suggest that lightning could be the next gps
tim uses his thoughts to control an advanced prosthetic arm
this is the first time
a human has controlled a robot with thought alone
and it is the first time that tim has held katie 's hand in seven years
and this green goo may someday matter to you
this green goo is perhaps the vaccine that could save your life
it was made in tobacco plants
tobacco plants can make millions of doses of vaccine in weeks instead of months
and it might just be the first healthy use of tobacco
and if it seems far fetched that tobacco plants could make people healthy what about gamers that could solve problems that experts can 't solve last september
last september the gamers of foldit
solved the three dimensional structure of the retroviral protease that contributes to aids in rhesus monkeys now understanding this structure is very important for developing treatments
for fifteen years it was unsolved in the scientific community
the gamers of foldit solved it in fifteen days
now they were able to do so by working together they were able to work together because they 're connected by the internet and others also connected to the internet used it as an instrument of democracy and together they changed the fate of their nation
the internet is home to two billion people or thirty percent of the world 's population
it allows us to contribute
and to be heard as individuals
it allows us to amplify
that 's all that made it through an l and an o and then a buffer overflow crashed the system now a worldwide force
so who are these scientists and engineers
at a magical place called darpa they are nerds
and they are heroes among us
they challenge existing perspectives at the edges of science and under the most demanding of conditions they remind us
that we can change the world
if we defy the impossible
and we refuse to fear failure
they remind us that we all have nerd power
have nerd power sometimes we just forget
you see there was a time when you weren 't afraid of failure when you were a great artist or a great dancer and you could sing you were good at math
you could build things you were an astronaut an adventurer jacques cousteau you could jump higher run faster kick harder than anyone you believed in impossible things and you were scientists and engineers
if you knew you could not fail
now i want to say this is not easy
it 's hard to hold onto this feeling
really hard i guess in some way i sort of believe it 's supposed to be hard doubt and fear always creep in we think someone else someone smarter than us someone more capable someone with more resources will solve that problem but there isn 't anyone else
takes a hand and says
let me help you believe jason harley did that
i saw jason nearly every day sometimes twice a day and more so than most he saw the highs and the lows the celebrations and the disappointments jason sat down
and he wrote an email he was encouraging
he probably didn 't realize what a difference it would make it mattered to me
it mattered to me in that moment
in that moment and still today
and still today when i doubt
when i feel afraid when i need to reconnect with that feeling i remember his words
i remember his words they were so powerful
there is only time enough to iron your cape
and back to the skies for you
so that glider of yours the mach twenty glider the first one no control it ended up in the pacific i think somewhere rd yeah yeah it did ca what happened on that second flight yeah it also went into the pacific ca but this time under control
control of the vehicle before we lost it it 's amazing
it 's amazing the
we wondered if it was possible to do it and you have to revisit these questions over time
it would be inconceivable for us to do that work
if we didn 't make people excited and uncomfortable with the things that we do at the same time
it 's just the nature of what we do now our responsibility is to push that
asking questions about the possibly unintended consequences of your team 's brilliance
my job is one of the most exhilarating jobs you could have
i work with some of the most amazing people
and so you have on the one hand this tremendous lift of what 's possible and this tremendous seriousness of what it means
