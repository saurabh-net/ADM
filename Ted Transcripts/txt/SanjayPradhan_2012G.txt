grew up in bihar india 's poorest state and i remember when i was six years old i remember coming home one day to find a cart full of the most delicious sweets at our doorstep
my brothers and i dug in and that 's when my father came home he was livid and i still remember how we cried when that cart with our half eaten sweets was pulled away from us
later i understood why my father got so upset those sweets were a bribe from a contractor who was trying to get my father to award him a government contract my father
was responsible for building roads in bihar and he had developed a firm stance against corruption even though he was harassed and threatened
his was a lonely struggle because bihar was also india 's most corrupt state where public officials were enriching themselves rather than serving the poor who had
no means to express their anguish if their children had no food or no schooling and i experienced this most viscerally when i traveled to remote villages to study poverty
and as i went village to village
i remember one day when i was famished and exhausted and i was almost collapsing in a scorching heat under a tree and just at that time one of the poorest men in that village
invited me into his hut
and graciously fed me only i later realized that what he fed me was food for his entire family for two days
this profound gift of generosity challenged and changed the very purpose of my life i resolved to give back
later i joined the world bank which sought to fight such poverty by transferring aid from rich to poor countries
my initial work focused on uganda
newly built schools without textbooks or teachers new health clinics without drugs
all over again bihar represents the challenge of development abject poverty surrounded by corruption
globally one point three billion people live on less than dollar one point two five a day
five hundred founding fathers and one lonely founding mother gathered in new hampshire usa to establish the bretton woods institutions including the world bank
and that traditional approach to development had three key elements first transfer of resources from rich countries in the north to poorer countries in the south accompanied by reform prescriptions second the development institutions that channeled these transfers
and third the engagement in developing countries was with a narrow set of government elites with little interaction with the citizens who are the ultimate beneficiaries of development assistance
today each of these elements is opening up due to dramatic changes in the global environment open knowledge open aid open governance and together they represent three key shifts
the first key shift is open knowledge you know developing countries today will not simply accept solutions that
they want to know how china lifted five hundred million people out of poverty in thirty years how mexico 's oportunidades program improved schooling and nutrition for millions of children
this is the new ecosystem of open knowledge flows not just traveling north to south but south to south and even south to north with mexico 's oportunidades today inspiring new york city
and just as these north to south transfers are opening up so too are the development institutions that channeled these transfers this is the second shift open aid
recently the world bank opened its vault of data for public use releasing eight thousand economic and social indicators for two hundred countries over fifty years
and it launched a global competition to crowdsource innovative apps using this data
development institutions today are also opening for public scrutiny the projects they finance take geomapping in this map from kenya the red dots show where all the schools financed by donors are located
and the darker the shade of green the more the number of out of school children
so this simple mashup reveals that donors have not financed any schools in the areas with the most out of school children provoking new questions is development assistance targeting those who most need our help
in this manner the world bank has now geomapped thirty thousand project activities in one hundred and forty three countries and donors are using a common platform to map all their projects
this is a tremendous leap forward in transparency and accountability of aid
and this leads me to the third and in my view the most significant shift in development open governance governments today are opening up just as citizens are demanding voice and accountability from the
but also for development accountability are governments delivering services to the citizens so for instance several governments in africa and eastern europe are opening their budgets to the public
but you know there is a big difference between a budget that 's public and a budget that 's accessible this is a public budget
to tackle this problem governments are using new tools to visualize the budget so it 's more understandable to the public
tools like this help turn a shelf full of inscrutable documents into a publicly understandable visual and what 's exciting is that with this openness there are today new opportunities for citizens to give feedback
and engage with government so in the philippines today
and the government is responsive so for instance when it was reported on this website that eight hundred students were at risk because school repairs had stalled due to corruption the department of education in the philippines took swift action
and you know what 's exciting is that this innovation is now spreading south to south from the philippines to indonesia kenya moldova and beyond
and what is very exciting is that citizens were then able to give feedback as to which health or water points were not working aggregated in the red bubbles that you see which together
provides a graphic visual of the collective voices of the poor
today even bihar is turning around and opening up under a committed leadership that is making government transparent accessible and responsive to the poor
but you know in many parts of the world governments are not interested in opening up or in serving the poor
and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system these are the lonely warriors like my father
and many many others and a key frontier of development work is to help
it was very late at night and at age eighty he was typing a seventy page public interest litigation against corruption in a road project
though he was no lawyer he argued the case
court himself the next day he won the ruling but later that very evening he fell and he died
he fought till the end increasingly passionate that to combat corruption
and poverty not only did government officials need to be honest but citizens needed to join together to make their voices heard these became the two bookends of his life
and the journey he traveled in between mirrored the changing development landscape
today i 'm inspired by these changes and i
excited that at the world bank we are embracing these new directions a significant departure from my work in uganda twenty years ago
we need to radically open up development so knowledge flows in multiple directions inspiring practitioners so aid becomes transparent accountable and effective
so governments open up and citizens are engaged and empowered with reformers in government we need to accelerate these shifts
if we do we will find that the collective voices
we will find that these children too have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty thank you
