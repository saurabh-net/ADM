fuller presented a particularly audacious proposal for the geoscope
it was a two hundred foot diameter geodesic sphere
he felt could truly inform and deeply affect the decision making of this body through
and today forty five years later we clearly have no less need for this kind of clarity and perspective
but what we do have is improved technology today we don't need one million lightbulbs to create a spherical display we can use
are smaller they're cheaper they're longer lasting they're more efficient
most importantly for this they're faster and this
combined with today 's high performance micro controllers allowed us to actually simulate in this piece over seventeen thousand leds using just sixty four
the equator 's speed is actually about sixty miles per hour
on board micro controllers that each time this ring rotates
it as it passes the rear of the display it picks up a position signal and from that the on board micro controllers can extrapolate the position of the ring
at all points around the revolution and display arbitrary bitmap images and animations but this is really just the beginning
in addition to higher resolution versions of this display my father and i are working on a new patent pending design for a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon
it achieves this by rotating leds about two axes so as you can see here this is a eleven inch diameter circuit board these blocks represent leds and so you could see that as this disc rotates about this axis it will create
a disc of light that we can control that's nothing new that's a propeller clock that's
the rims that you can buy for your car but what is new is that when we rotate this disc about this axis
now this disc of light actually becomes a sphere of light
and so we can control that with micro controllers and create a fully volumetric three dimensional display with just two hundred and fifty six leds now this piece is currently in process
due out in may but what we've done is we've put together a small demo just to show the geometric translation of points into a sphere
and here you can see it's rotating about the vertical axis only creating circles
the shutter speed of the camera actually makes it slightly less effective in this case but this piece is due out in may
love to talk to you all and invite you to come down and take a closer look
