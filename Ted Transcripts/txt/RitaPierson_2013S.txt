both my parents were educators my maternal grandparents were educators
and for the past forty years i 've done the same thing and so needless to say over those years i 've had a chance to look at education reform from a lot of perspectives some of those reforms have been good some of them have been not so good
and we know why kids drop out we know why kids don 't learn it 's either poverty low attendance negative peer influences we know why but one of the things that we never discuss or we rarely discuss is the value and importance of human connection
says that no significant learning can occur without a significant relationship george washington carver says all learning is understanding relationships
everyone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult
well i said to her you know kids don 't learn from people they don 't like
and kids can be cruel and so she kept those things in her desk and years later after she retired
i watched some of those same kids come through and say to her you know ms walker you made a difference in my life
of relationships that could never disappear
can we stand to have more relationships absolutely will you like all your children
is this job tough you betcha
oh god you betcha but it is not impossible
we can do this we 're educators we 're born to make a difference thank you
