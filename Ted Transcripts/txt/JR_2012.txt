then i went to taking photos of people
from the suburbs of paris
to the wall of israel and palestine
the rooftops of kenya to the favelas of rio
paper and glue as easy as that
i asked a question last year
can art change the world
well let me tell you in terms of changing the world there has been a lot of competition this year
because the arab spring is still spreading the eurozone has collapsed what else the occupy movement found a voice
and i still have to speak english constantly so
you are going to take the photos
you 're going to send them to me
i 'm going to print them and send them back to you
then you 're going to paste them where it makes sense for you to place your own statement
those are the kind of posters let me show you
and we keep sending more every day this is the size just a regular piece of paper with a little bit of ink on it
this one was from haiti
hundreds of people stood up and said they wanted to help us
but i say it has to be
no credit no logos no sponsoring
a week later a handful of people were there ready to rock and empower the people on the ground who wanted to change the world
these are the people i want to talk about to you today
and they pasted over every single portrait of the dictator with their own photos boom
this is what happened slim and his friends went through the country and pasted hundreds of photos everywhere to show the diversity in the country
they really make inside out their own project
actually that photo was pasted in a police station and what you see on the ground are id cards of all the photos of people being tracked by the police
they used inside out as a platform for protest
there and made all the unseen faces of the city on the walls
in her town and i want to thank her today
standing rock nation in this turtle island unclear name from the dakota lakota tribe
wanted to show that the native americans are still here
do you know what it takes to do this people
while in iran at the same time abololo of course a nickname
to show his resistance against the government
i don 't have to explain to you what kind of risk he took for that action
twenty percent of the posters we are receiving comes from schools education is so essential
kids just make photos in a class
the teacher receives them they paste them on the school here they even got the help of the firemen
of course we wanted to go back to israel and palestine
so we went there with a truck this is a photobooth truck you go on the back of that truck it takes your photo thirty seconds later take it from the side
and each of them signs up for a two state peace solution
and then walk in the street this is march the four hundred and fifty thousand march beginning of september they were all holding their photo as a statement on the other side people were wrapping up streets buildings it 's everywhere come on don 't tell me that people aren 't ready for peace out there
these projects took thousands of actions in one year making hundreds of thousands of people participating creating millions of views this is the biggest
global art participatory project that 's going on
maybe not in one year that 's the beginning but maybe we should change the question
from what i 've seen this year
