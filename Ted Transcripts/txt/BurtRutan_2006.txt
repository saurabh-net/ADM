i want to start off by saying houston we have a problem
entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space in fact
we stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth to go out and continue this very important thing
that we as a species have always done and that is instinctively we've gone out and climbed over
and i feel very strongly that it's not good enough
for us to have generations of kids that think that it's ok to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it they need to look forward to
we need to inspire them because they need to lead us and help us survive in the future i'm particularly troubled that what nasa's doing right now with this new bush doctrine to
for this next decade and a half oh shoot i screwed up we have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics
what we're looking forward to
what we're looking forward to
is not only the inspiration of our children but the current plan right now is not really even
allowing the most creative people in this country the boeing 's and lockheed 's space engineers to go out and take risks and try new stuff
we're going to go back to the moon fifty years later and we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new
i'm really troubled by that but anyway that's the basis of the thing that i want to share with you today though is
that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later that's the theme of my next fifteen minutes here
and i think that the inspiration begins when you're very young three year olds up to twelve fourteen year olds what we what they look at is the most important thing
take a snapshot at aviation and there was a wonderful little short four year time period
airplanes were invented by natural selection now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes there
probably at least thirty thousand different things tried and when they crash and kill the pilot don't try that again
the ones that flew and landed ok because there was no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition so we by making a whole bunch of attempts
thousands of attempts in that four year time period we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today and that's why they're so safe as we gave it a lot of chance to
find what's good that has not happened at all in space flying there's only been two concepts tried two by the u s and one by the russians
well who was inspired during that time period aviation week asked me to make a list of who i thought were the movers and shakers of the first one hundred years of aviation and i wrote them down and i found out later that every one of them was a little kid
in that wonderful renaissance of aviation well what happened when i was a little kid was some pretty heavy stuff
the jet age started the missile age started von braun was on there showing how to go to mars and this was before sputnik and this was at a time when mars was a hell of a lot more interesting
than it is now we thought there'd be animals there we knew there were plants there the colors change right but you know nasa screwed that up because they've sent these robots and they've landed it only in the
if you look at what happened this little black line is as fast as
man ever flew and the red line is a top of the line military fighters and the blue line is commercial air transport you notice here 's a big jump when i was a little kid
and i think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try
well what did i do when i was a kid i didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing and well we didn't have drugs in those days but i did competition model airplanes
i spent about seven years during the vietnam war flight testing airplanes for the air force and then i went in and i had a lot of fun building airplanes that people
could build in their garages and some three thousand of these are flying of course one of them is around the world voyager
the most impressive airplane ever
i believe was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet
the most impressive spaceship ever i believe was a grumman lunar lander it was a you know it landed on the moon take off of the moon didn't need any maintenance guys
three years and we can't do that now crazy
talk very briefly about innovation cycles things that grow have a lot of activity they die out when they're replaced by something else these things tend to happen every twenty five years
forty years long with an overlap you can put that statement on all kinds of different technologies the interesting thing by the way the speed here excuse me higher speed travel is the
title of these innovation cycles there is none here
here 's the biggie and that is you don't have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it
you know a good example of course is the darpa net computers were used for artillery first then irs but when we got it now you have all the level of activity all the benefit from it private sector
to do it keep that in mind i put down innovation i've looked for innovation cycles in space and i found
the very first year starting when gagarin went in space and a few weeks later alan shepherd there were five manned space flights in the world the very first year
in two thousand and three everyone that the united states sent to space was killed
there were only three or four flights in two thousand and three in two thousand and four
there were only two flights two russian soyuz flights to the international manned station and i had to fly three in mojave with my little group of a couple dozen people
this is a picture here taken from spaceshipone this is a picture here taken from orbit our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that we know how to do it
for sub orbital flying now do it safe enough at least as safe as the early airlines so that can be done and i think i want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small
well first of all what's going to happen next the first industry will be a high volume a lot of players
another one announced just last week and it will be sub orbital and the reason it has to be sub orbital
is there is not solutions for adequate safety to fly the public to orbit
the governments have been doing this three governments have been doing this for forty five years and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died that's you don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety
be very high volume we think one hundred thousand people will fly by two thousand and twenty i can't tell you when this will start because i don't want my competition to know my schedule
but i think once it does we will find solutions and very quickly you'll see those resort hotels in orbit and that real easy thing to do which is a swing around the moon so you have this cool view and
that will be really cool because the moon doesn't have an atmosphere you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by ten feet if you want oh it's going to be so much fun
my critics say hey rutan 's just spending a lot of these billionaires money for joyrides for
what's this this is not a transportation system it's just for fun
because i could say i got a computer at my house and you don 't what do you use it for come over it does frogger
not the banks computer or
big development big improvement and capability and so on and they get out there in enough homes we were
for a new invention and the inventor is in this audience al gore invented the internet and because of that
something that we used for a whole year excuse me a whole decade for fun became everything our commerce our research our communication and if we let the google guys
think for another couple weekends we can add a dozen more things to the list and it won 't be very long before you won 't be able to convince kids that we didn't always have computers in our
a group of people that have come forward and you don't know all of them but the ones that have come forward were inspired
as young children this little three to fifteen year old age by us going to orbit and going to the moon here right in this time period paul allen
paul allen richard branson jeff
the ansari family which is now funding the russians sub orbital thing bob bigelow a private space station and
these people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area and i think it's a lot better than they put it
in an area of a better cell phone or something but they're putting it in very areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability
and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore and i think eventually it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct
they were inspired by big progress
but look at the progress that's going on after that
there were a couple of examples here the military fighters had a highest performance military airplane was the sr seventy one it went a whole life cycle
got too rusty to fly and was taken out of service the concorde doubled the speed for airline travel it went a whole life cycle without competition took out of service
and we're stuck back here with the same kind of capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late
but something is out there to inspire our kids now and i'm talking about if you've got a baby now or if you've got a ten year old now what's out
there is there's something really interesting going to happen here relatively soon you'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest performance military operational airplane it's never happened before
the fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been well you know you win the war in twelve minutes why do you need something better
but i think when you guys start buying tickets and flying sub orbital flights to space very soon
wait a minute what's happening here we'll have military fighters with sub orbital capability and i think very soon this but the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first ok i look forward to a new
we didn't lose them technically the fact that we had the hardware to put something in orbit when we let von braun fly
technology and that was a very strong thing and then we flew alan shepherd weeks after gagarin not months or decades or whatever so we had the capability but america lost
well again what's interesting here is we've lost to the russians on the first couple of milestones already you cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in america
you can buy it in russia
it's commercial it can be defined as space tourism they are also offering a trip to go on this whip around the moon like apollo eight was done one hundred million bucks
go to the moon but you know would you have thought back in the sixties when the space race was going on that the first commercial capitalist like thing to do
to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in russian hardware and would you have thought would the russians have thought that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware
the guys inside won 't be russians maybe it'll probably be a japanese or an american billionaire well that's weird you know it really is but anyway i think we need to beat them again
i think what we'll do is we'll see a successful very successful private space flight industry
whether we're first or not really doesn't matter the russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the concorde
and then they flew a few cargo flights and took it out of service i think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is offered
already there's about a billion and a half to a billion point seven investment in private space flight that is not government at all already worldwide
read if you google it you'll find about half of that money but there's twice of that being committed out there not spent yet but being committed and planned for the next few years
i'm predicting though as profitable as this industry is going to be and it certainly is profitable when you fly people
two hundred thousand dollars on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost or less this is going to be very profitable i predict also that
and every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by factor of ten to fifteen
and what that means is before we know
the progress in human space flight with no taxpayer dollars will be at a level that is because
us it's private industry you should never depend on the government to do
this sort of stuff and we've done it for a long time the naca before nasa never developed an airliner and never ran an airline
but nasa is developing the space liner always has and runs the only space line ok
and we've shied away from it because we're afraid of it but starting back in june of two thousand and four
when i showed that a little
