you can imagine how out of place
i feel like a fish out of
an owl out of the air
i was preaching in san jose some time ago and my friend mark kvamme who helped introduce me to this conference
brought several ceos and leaders of some of the companies here in the silicon valley to have breakfast with me or i with them
and i was so stimulated and had such it was an eye opening experience
eye opening experience to hear them talk
about the world that is yet to come through technology
through technology and science
i know that we're near the end of this conference
and some of you may be wondering
why they have a speaker from the field of religion richard can answer that
because he made that decision
and on that elevator a man said i hear billy graham is staying in this hotel
another man looked in my direction and said yes there he is he 's on this elevator with us and this man looked me up and down for about ten seconds and he said my what an
i hope that you won 't feel that these few moments with me is not a is an anticlimax after all this tremendous
on an airplane in the east some years ago
and the man sitting across the aisle from me was the mayor of charlotte north carolina his name was john belk some of you will probably know him
and there was a drunk man on
and he got up out of his seat two or three times and he was making everybody upset by
what he was trying to do and he was slapping the stewardess and pinching her as she went
and everybody was upset with him
and finally john belk said do you know who 's sitting here man
and he turned to me and he said
he said your sermons have certainly helped
and i suppose that that's true with thousands of people
i know that as you have been peering into the future
and as we've heard some of it here tonight
i would like to live in that age and see what is going to be but i
because i'm eighty years old this is my
and i know that my time is brief
i have phlebitis at the moment in both legs
and some other problems that i won 't talk about
this is not the first time that we've had a technological revolution in one generation
the nation of the people of israel
a tremendous and dramatic change that made them a great power
a man by the name of david came to the throne
and king david became one of the great leaders of his generation
of his generation brilliant poet
soldier with strategies in battle and conflict that people study even today
but they wouldn't allow the israelis to look into it or to have any
but david changed all of
and he introduced the iron age to israel
and the bible says that david laid up great stores of
which archaeologists have found that in present day palestine
there are evidences of that generation now instead of crude tools
made of sticks and stones israel now had iron
and in the course of one generation israel was completely changed the introduction of iron in some ways had an impact
there were many problems that technology could not solve
and they're still with us and you haven't solved them and i haven't heard anybody here speak to that
how do we solve these three problems that i'd like to mention
the first one that david saw was human evil
how do we solve it
and again in the psalms which gladstone said was the greatest book in the world
david describes the evils of the human and yet he says
and yet he says he restores my soul
have you ever thought about what a contradiction we
on one hand we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe and dramatically push back the frontiers of technology
as this conference vividly demonstrates we've seen under the
hundreds of billions of years out in the future our battleships
our battleships our soldiers
on a frontier now almost ready to go to war
why do we have these wars in every generation and in every part of the world and revolutions
we can't get along with other people
even in our own families
find ourselves in the paralyzing grip of self destructive habits we can't break
and injustice and violence sweep our world bringing a tragic harvest of heartache and
even the most sophisticated among us seem powerless to break this cycle
i would like to see oracle
work on this how do we change man
the bible says the problem is within us
within our hearts and our souls which we call god
and we need to have our souls restored
jesus said for out of the heart come evil thoughts
come evil thoughts false testimonies slander
the british philosopher bertrand russell was not a religious man
but he said it 's in our hearts that the evil lies
and it's from our hearts that it must be plucked out albert einstein
mister einstein he didn't have a doctor 's degree because he said nobody was qualified to give him easier to denature plutonium
to denature the evil spirit of man
and many of you i'm sure have thought about that
and puzzled over it you've seen people take beneficial technological advances
such as the internet we've heard about tonight and twist them into something
the oklahoma city bombing was simple technology
the problem is the person or persons using it king david said
that he knew the depths of his own soul that included murder
yet king david sought god 's forgiveness and said you can restore my soul the bible teaches
that we're more than a body and we are
that's the part of us that yearns
for god or something more we find in technology
your soul is that part of you that yearns for meaning in life
and which seeks for something beyond this life
it's the part of you that yearns really for god i find young people all over the world are searching for something
they don't know what it is i speak at many universities
oxford i've spoken at all of those universities i'm going to harvard in about three or four no it's about two months from now
to give a lecture and
the same questions that i was asked the last few times i've been on these few questions
i come from why am i here where am i going what's life all about why am i here
even if you have no religious belief there are times when you wonder that there's something else
thomas edison also said when you see everything that happens in the world of science and in the working of the universe you cannot deny that there's a captain on the bridge
i went to ambassador dobrynin whom i knew very well and i'd been to russia several times
under the communists and they'd given me marvelous freedom that i didn't expect
going to sit beside misters
and he surprised me with the answer he said talk to her about religion and philosophy that's what she's really interested in i was a little bit surprised but that evening
that's what we talked about and it was a stimulating conversation
and afterward she said you know i'm an atheist but i know that there's something up there higher than we are
the second problem that king david
writing the oldest book in the world was job and he said man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward
a few months i'll be eighty years of age
i admit that i'm very grateful for all the medical advances
that have kept me in relatively good health all these years
i haven't given a talk in
and when you speak as much as i do three or four times a day
every time you ever hear me on the television or somewhere
got some notes here so that which i do sometimes
i've got something i can turn to
but even here among us
in the most advanced society in the world we have poverty
friends that betray us unbearable psychological pressures bear down on us i've never met a person in the world that didn't have a problem
or a worry why do we suffer
it's an age old question that we haven't
yet david again and again said
that he would turn to god
he said the lord is my shepherd the
problem that david knew he could not solve was death
many commentators have said that death is the forbidden subject of our generation
most people live as if going to die
we see people on our screens marilyn monroe is just as beautiful on the screen as she was in person
and our many young people think she's
they don't know that she's dead
or clark gable or whoever it is
the old stars they come to life but death is inevitable
i spoke some time ago to
a joint session of congress last year
and we were meeting in that room
about three hundred of them
and i said there 's one thing that we have in common in this room all of us together whether republican or democrat
i said we 're all going to die and we have that in common with all these great men of the past that are staring down at us
and it's often difficult for young people to understand that
as the ancient writer of ecclesiastes wrote
he said there's every activity under heaven
there's a time to be born the deathbed
of several famous people whom you would know
seen them in those agonizing moments when they were scared to
and yet a few years earlier death never
i talked to a woman this past week was a famous doctor
never thought of god never talked about god didn't believe in god he was an atheist as he came to
and he said for the first time in his life he'd thought about and about god
what is the greatest surprise in your life
and i said the greatest surprise in my life is the brevity of life passes so
in the aftermath of world war ii concluded quote
science and religion are not antagonists on the contrary
he put it on a personal basis i knew doctor von braun very well
and he said speaking for myself i can only say that the grandeur of the cosmos serves only to confirm a belief in the certainty of a creator he also said
in our search to know god i've come to believe that the life of jesus christ
should be the focus of our efforts and inspiration the reality of this life and his resurrection is the hope of mankind
i've done a lot of speaking in germany and in france
and in different parts of the world one hundred and five countries it's been my privilege to speak in
and i was invited one day to visit
and he once and he said to me he said young man
he said do you believe in the resurrection of jesus christ
and i said sir i do
he said so do i he said when i leave office
i'm going to spend my time writing a book
on why jesus christ rose again and why it's so important to believe that
in one of his plays alexander solzhenitsyn
depicts a man dying who says to those gathered around his bed
the moment when it's terrible to feel regret is when one is dying
how should one live in order not to feel regret when one is dying
at the frontiers of mathematics even as a teenager
he is viewed by many as the the probability theory
and a creator of the first model of a computer
and of course you are all familiar with the computer language named for him he was astounded
at the phenomenon we've been considering that
yet they also are full of anger hypocrisy and have and self hatreds pascal saw us as a remarkable mixture of genius and self delusion four
four had a profound
he wrote in his journal these i submit myself
to jesus christ my redeemer a french historian said
a french historian said two centuries later
seldom has so mighty an intellect
that his own sins and failures could be forgiven
and that when he died he would go to a place called heaven
he experienced it in a way that went beyond scientific observation and reason it was he who penned the well known words
the heart has its reasons which reason knows not
equally well known is pascal 's wager
essentially he said this if you bet on
open yourself to his love you lose nothing even if you're wrong
but if instead you bet that there is no god
the knowledge of god was far beyond anything that ever crossed his mind
when he died at the age of thirty nine
to be seventy a long time in his era yet he too had to face death
and he wrote these words
i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no
for you are with me
this was david 's answer to three dilemmas of evil suffering and death
and allow him to fill your life
when i was seventeen years of age
i was born and reared on a farm in north carolina
i milked cows every morning and i had to milk the same cows every evening when i came home
and i worked on the farm
and tried to keep up with my studies
good grades in high school
i didn't make them in college until
one day i was faced face to face
the way the truth and the
can you imagine that i am the truth
i'm the embodiment of all truth he was a liar
he was a liar or he was insane
or he was what he claimed to be
i had to make that decision
but by faith i said i believe him
and he came into my heart
when i hear that call
to go into the presence of god
thank you and god bless all of you as a clergyman
