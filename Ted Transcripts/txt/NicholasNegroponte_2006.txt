at mit for forty four years i went to ted i there's only one other person here i think who did
all the other teds and i went to them all under ricky 's regime i talked about what the media lab was doing which today has almost five hundred people in it
and if you read the press it actually last week said i quit the media lab i didn't quit the media lab i stepped down as chairman which was a kind of ridiculous title but
so i'm going to tell you about this use my eighteen minutes to tell you why i'm doing it how we're doing it and then what we're doing and at some point i'll even pass around
what the one hundred dollar laptop might be like now
i was asked by chris to talk about some of the big issues and so i figured i'd start with the three that at least drove me to do this and the first is pretty obvious
it's amazing when you meet a head of state and you say what is your most precious natural resource they will not say children at first
and then when you say children they will pretty quickly agree with you and so that isn't very hard
everybody agrees that whatever the solutions are to the big problems they include education sometimes can be just education
and can never be without some element of education so that's certainly part of it and the third is a little bit less obvious
and that is that we all in this room learned how to walk how to talk not by being
taught how to talk or taught how to walk but by interacting with the world by having certain results as a consequence of being able to ask for something or being able to stand up and reach it
at about the age six we were told to stop learning that way and that all learning from then on would happen through teaching whether it's people standing up like i'm doing now or a book or something but it was really through teaching
and one of the things in general that computers have provided to learning is that it now includes a kind of learning which is a little bit more like walking and talking in the sense that a lot of it's driven by the
a year ago or two years ago or we were struck by lightning this actually has gone back a long time and in fact back to the
here we're in the eighties steve jobs had given us some laptops we were in senegal
it didn't scale but it at least was bringing computers to developing countries and learning pretty quickly that these kids
even though english wasn't their language the latin alphabet barely was their language but they could just swim like fish they could play these like pianos
a little bit more recently i got involved personally and these are two anecdotes one was in cambodia
in a village that has no electricity no water no television no telephone but has broadband internet now and these kids their first english word is google
and they only know skype they've never heard of telephony ok they just use skype and they go home at night they've got a broadband connection in a hut that doesn't have electricity the parents love it because when they open up the
the brightest light source in the house and talk about where metaphors and reality mix this is the actual school in parallel with this seymour papert got the governor of maine
to legislate one laptop per child in the year two thousand and two now at the time i think it's fair to say that eighty percent of the teachers were
let me say apprehensive really they were actually against it and they really preferred that the money would be used for higher salaries more schools whatever and now three and a half years later guess what they're reporting five things
of truancy to almost zero attending parent teacher meetings which nobody did and now almost everybody does drop in discipline problems
and then the fifth which interests me the most is that the servers have to be turned off at certain times at night because the teachers are just getting too much email from the kids asking them for help
so when you see that kind of thing this is not something that you have to test the days of pilot projects are over when people say well we'd like to do three or four thousand in our country to see how it works
screw you go to the back of the line and someone else will do it and then when you figure out that this works you can join
as well and this is what
so one laptop per child was formed about a year and a half ago it's a nonprofit association it raised about twenty million dollars to do the
because you can buy components at a lower price ok it's because you can go to a
can even have a pixel or two missing it doesn't have to be that bright and
you're not part of our strategic plan and i said well that's kind of too bad because we need one hundred million units a year and they said
well maybe we could become part of your strategic plan and that's why scale counts
and that's why we will not launch this without five to ten million units in the first run
and the idea is to launch with enough scale that the scale itself helps bring the price down and that's why i said seven to ten million there
and we're doing it without a sales and marketing team i mean you're looking at the sales and marketing team we will do it by
going to seven large countries and getting them to agree and launch it and then the others can follow we have partners it's not hard to guess google would be one the others are all
was held in tunisia now
people start looking at this they say ah this is a laptop project well no it's not a laptop project it's an education project and
the fun part and i'm quite focused on it i tell people i used to be a light bulb but now i'm a laser i'm just going to get that thing
built and it turns out it's not so hard because laptop economics are the following i say fifty percent here it's more like sixty
none of those figure into our cost because first of all we sell it at cost and the governments distribute it it gets distributed to the school system like a textbook so
that piece disappears and then you have display and everything else now the display on your laptop costs in rough numbers
ten dollars a diagonal inch now that can drop to eight it can drop to seven but it's not going to drop to two or to one and a half unless we do some pretty clever things
it's the rest that little brown box that is pretty fascinating because the rest of your laptop is devoted to itself
it's a little bit like an obese person having to use most of their energy to move their obesity ok and we have a situation today which is incredible ok
i've been using laptops since their inception and my laptop runs slower
less reliably and less pleasantly than it ever has before and this year is worse now
people clap sometimes you even get standing ovations and i say what the hell 's wrong with you why are we all sitting there and somebody
five hundred and twelve it worked really well and we've been going steadily downhill now this
all the time what it is that's what it is the two pieces that are probably notable
is it'll be a mesh network so when the kids open up their laptops they all become a network and then just need one or two points of backhaul you can serve a couple of thousand kids with two megabits
so you really can bring into a village and then the villages can connect themselves and you really can do it
quite well the dual mode display the idea is to have a display that both works outdoors
isn't it fun using your cell phone outdoors in the sunlight well you can't see it and one of the reasons you can't see it is because it's
most of the time most cell phones now what we're doing is we're doing one that will be both front lit and back lit and
is it all worked out no that's why a lot of our people are more or less living in taiwan right now and in about thirty days we'll know for sure whether this works probably
the most important piece there is that the kids really can do the maintenance and this is again something that people don't believe but i really think it's quite true
that's the machine we showed in tunis and this is more the direction that we're going to go and it's something that we didn't think was possible now i'm going to pass this around
this isn't a design ok so this is just a mechanical engineering sort of embodiment of it for you to play with
and it's clearly just a model the working one is at mit i'm going to pass it to this handsome gentleman at least then you can decide whether it goes left
oh simulcast sorry i forgot i forgot ok so wherever the camera is ok good point thank you chris the idea was that it
would be not only a laptop but that it could transform and be into an electronic book so it's sort of an electronic book this is where you can go outside it's in black and white
the games buttons are missing but it'll also be a games machine book machine set it up this way and it's a television set et cetera et cetera
ok sorry i'll let jim decide which way to send it afterwards ok seven countries
i say maybe for massachusetts because they actually have to do a bid by law you've got
so on and so forth so i can't quite name them in the other cases they don't have to do bids they can decide it's the federal government in each case
it's kind of agonizing because a lot of people say well let 's do it at the state level because of course states are more nimble than the feds just because of size
and yet we count we're really dealing with the federal government we're really dealing with ministries of education and if you look at
if you look at the countries they're pretty geoculturally distributed have they all agreed no not completely probably thailand brazil and nigeria are the three that are the most active and most agreed we're purposely not signing anything with anybody
i'm just going around the world every three weeks here 's sort of the schedule and i put at the bottom we might give some away free in two years
at this meeting everybody says it's a one hundred dollar laptop you can't do it well guess what we're not
we're coming in probably at one hundred and thirty five to start then drift down and that's very important because so many things hit
the market at a price and then drift up it's kind of the loss leader and then as soon as it looks interesting
it can't be afforded or it can't be scaled out so we're targeting fifty dollars in two thousand and ten the gray market 's a big issue and one of the ways just one but one of the ways to
help in the case of the gray market is to make something that is so utterly unique it's a little bit like the fact that
and why because there's no market for post office trucks it looks like a post office truck you can spray paint it you can do anything you want i just learned recently in south africa
no white volvos are stolen period none zero so we want to make it very much like a white volvo
each government has a task force this perhaps is less interesting but we're trying to get the governments to all work together and
it's not easy the economics of this is to start with the federal
and then later to go to other
same age an uncle gives a niece or a nephew that as a birthday present i mean there are all sorts of things that will happen and they'll be very very exciting and
says i say it's an education project are we providing the software the answer is the system certainly has software but no we're not providing the education content that is really
scratch if you've ever even heard of it are very very much part of it and that's the rollout are we dreaming is this real it actually is real
the only criticism and people really don't want to criticize this because it is a humanitarian effort it is a nonprofit effort
and to criticize it is a little bit stupid actually but the one
that people could criticize was great idea but these guys can't do it and that could either mean these guys professors and so on couldn't do it or that it's not possible
well on december twelve a company called quanta agreed to build it and since they make about one third of all the laptops on the planet today
that question disappeared so it's not a matter of whether it's going to happen it is going to happen and
if it comes out at one hundred and thirty eight dollars so what if it comes out six months late so what that's a pretty soft landing thank you
