time to be a molecular biologist
it 's a movement that it advocates making biotechnology accessible to everyone
not just scientists and people in government labs the idea is that if you open up the science and you allow diverse groups to participate it could really stimulate innovation putting technology in the hands of the end user is usually a good idea because they 've got the best idea of what their needs are
and here 's this really sophisticated technology coming down the road all these associated social moral so
so three years ago i got together with some friends of mine who had similar aspirations and we founded genspace it 's a nonprofit a community biotech lab
and putter around in the lab
in a very open friendly atmosphere
none of my previous experience prepared me for what came next can you guess the press started calling us and the more we talked about how great it was to increase science literacy the more they wanted to talk about us creating the next frankenstein and as a result
for the next six months when you googled my name instead of getting my scientific papers you got this
it was pretty depressing the only thing that got us through that period was that we knew that all over the world there were other people that were trying to do the same thing that we were
global community of hackerspaces and this is just the beginning these are some of the biggest ones and there are others opening every day there 's one probably going to open up in moscow one in south korea
and the cool thing is they each have their own individual flavor that grew out of the community they came out of
let me take you on a little tour biohackers work alone we work in groups in big cities laughter and in small villages we reverse engineer lab
to take things apart we make things grow
we make things glow and we make cells dance
is bio safety bio security
it really compels you you have to look at both the amateur groups but also the professional groups because they have better infrastructure they have better facilities and they have access to pathogens
so the united nations did just that and they recently issued a report on this whole area
and what they concluded was the power of this technology for positive was much greater than the risk for negative and they even looked specifically at the diybio community
and they noted not surprisingly that the press had a tendency to consistently overestimate our capabilities and underestimate our ethics
as a matter of fact diy people from all over the world america europe got together last year and we hammered out a common code of ethics that 's a lot more than conventional science has done now
we follow state and local regulations we dispose of our waste properly we follow safety procedures we don 't work with pathogens you know if you 're working with a pathogen you 're not part of the biohacker community
that 's literally about as probable as a snowstorm in the middle of the sahara desert now it could
but i 'm not going to plan my life around it i
actually chosen to take a different kind of risk
i signed up for something called the personal genome project it 's a study at harvard where at the end of the study they 're going to take my entire genomic sequence all of my medical information and my identity and they 're going to post it online for everyone to see
there were a lot of risks involved that they talked about during the informed consent portion the one i liked the best
is someone could download my sequence go back to the lab synthesize some fake ellen dna and plant it at a crime scene
now you might be asking yourself well you know what would i do in a biolab
well it wasn 't that long ago we were asking well what would anyone do with a personal computer so this stuff is just beginning
he threw tennis balls to all the neighborhood dogs
invasive species in my own
in a biohacker space you can analyze your genome for mutations you can analyze your breakfast cereal for gmo 's and you can explore your ancestry you can send weather balloons up into the stratosphere collect microbes see what 's up
you can do a lot of things you can also do an art science project some of these are really spectacular and they look at social ecological problems from a completely different perspective it 's really cool some people ask me well why
there 's something sacred about a space where you can work on a project and you don 't have to justify to anyone that it 's going to make a lot of money that it 's going to save mankind or even that it 's feasible it just has to follow safety guidelines
who knows what we could do this is such a new area and as we say back
