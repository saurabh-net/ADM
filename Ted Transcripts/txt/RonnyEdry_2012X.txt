and the client was saying no it 's ten thousand a day
it 's like every year it 's the last minute that we can do something about the war with iran it 's like if we don 't act now it 's too late forever for ten years now
so i went to sleep and that was it for me and later on in the night i woke up because i 'm always waking up in the night and i went by the computer and i see all these red dots you know on facebook which i 've never seen before which is what
because you have to understand in israel we don 't talk with people from iran we don 't know people from iran it 's like on facebook you have friends only from it 's like your neighbors are your friends on facebook
and now people from iran are talking to me so i start answering this girl and she 's telling me she saw the poster and
give me a picture i will make you a poster and that 's how it started and that 's how really it 's unleashed because suddenly people from facebook friends and others just understand that they can be part of it it 's not just one dude making one poster it 's
we can be part of it so they start sending me pictures and ask me make me a poster post it tell the iranians we from israel love you too
it became you know at some point it was really really intense i mean so many pictures so i asked friends
to come graphic designers most of them to make posters with me because i didn 't have the time it was a huge amount of pictures so for a few days that 's how my living room was
and we received israeli posters israeli images but also lots of comments lots of messages from iran
and we took these messages and we made posters out of it because i know people they don 't read they see images if it 's an image they may read it so here are a few of them
on an israeli flag to enter her school every morning and now that she sees the posters that we 're sending she starts she said that she changed her mind and now
she loves that blue she loves that star and she loves that flag talking about the israeli flag and she wished that we 'd meet and come to visit one another and just a few days after i posted the first poster
and now it 's communication it 's a two way story it 's israelis and iranians sending the same message one to each other
and then it became news because when you 're seeing the middle east you see only the bad news and suddenly there is something that was happening
so she said everybody in palestine in where israel who is everybody everybody they said syria syria lebanon lebanon at some point he just said forty million people are going to see you today
something crazy also happened every time a country started talking about it like germany america wherever a page on facebook popped up with
the same logo with the same stories so at the beginning we had iran loves israel which is an iranian sitting in tehran saying okay israel loves iran
i give you iran loves israel you have palestine loves israel you have lebanon that just a few days ago and this whole list of pages on facebook dedicated to the same message to people sending their love one to each other
the moment i really understood that something was happening a friend of mine told me google the word israel and those were the first images on those days that popped up from google
when you were typing israel or iran we really changed how people see the middle east because you 're not in the middle east you 're somewhere over there and then you want to see the middle east so you go on google and you say israel and they give you the bad stuff and for a few days you got those images
today the israel loves iran page is this number eighty thousand eight hundred and thirty one and two million people last week went on the page and shared liked i don 't know commented on one of the photos so for
five months now that 's what we are doing me michal a few of my friends and we 're understanding
and you show compassion and you become friends
and at some point you become friends on facebook and you become friends in life you can go and travel and meet people
and i was in munich a few weeks ago
i went there to open an exposition about iran and i met there with people
from the page that told me okay you 're going to be in europe i 'm coming i 'm coming from france from holland from germany of course and from israel people came and we just met there for the first time in real life i met with people that
are supposed to be my enemies for the first time and we just shake hands and have a coffee and a nice discussion and we talk about food and basketball and that was the end of it remember that image from the beginning at some point we met in real life and we became friends and
to come to israel and she gets on the plane and arrives at ben gurion and says okay not that big a deal so a few weeks ago the stress is getting higher
so we start this new campaign called
not ready to die in your war i mean it 's plus minus the same message but we wanted really to add some aggressivity to it
and again something amazing happened something that we didn 't have on the first wave of the campaign now people from iran the same ones who were shy at the first campaign and just sent you know their foot and half their faces now they 're sending their faces and they 're saying okay
no problem we 're into it we are with you
just read where those guys are from and for every guy from israel you 've got someone from iran
just people sending their pictures so
so you may ask yourself who is this dude
my name is ronny edry and i 'm forty one i 'm an israeli i 'm a father of two i 'm a husband and i 'm a graphic designer i 'm teaching graphic design
i was in the army i was in the paratroopers for three years and i know how it looks from the ground i know how it can look really bad so to me this is the courageous thing to do to try to reach the other side before it 's too late
sometimes but maybe with effort we can avoid it maybe as people because especially in israel we 're in a democracy we have the freedom of speech and maybe that little thing can change something
and really we can be our own ambassadors we can just
send a message and hope for the best
change something just raise that exactly and i 'm just going to take a picture of it and i 'm just going to post it on facebook with kind of israelis for peace or something
oh my god don 't cry thank you guys
