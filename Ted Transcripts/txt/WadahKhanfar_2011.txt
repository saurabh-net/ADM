exactly i was in afghanistan
these regimes created something within us
during this period i 'm forty three years old right now for the last forty years i have seen almost the same faces for kings and presidents ruling us aged authoritarian corrupt
yes they got rid of saddam hussein but when they saw their land occupied by foreign forces they felt very sad they felt that their dignity had suffered and this is why they revolted this is why they did not accept
would you like to see civil war sectarian killing would you like to see destruction would you like to see foreign troops on your land
that was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen for ten years
images of destruction images of killing of sectarian conflicts images of violence emerging from a magnificent piece of land a region that one day was the source of civilizations and art and culture for thousands of years
now i am here to tell you that the future that we were dreaming for has eventually arrived inspired by universal values
inspired by universal values and a global understanding
has created a new reality for us we have found
they found something called facebook they found something called twitter they were surprised by all of these kinds of issues and they said these kids but yes
who have been inspired by universal values
who are idealistic enough to imagine a magnificent future and at the same time realistic enough to balance this kind of imagination and the process leading to it not using violence not trying to create chaos
we put it in every sitting room in the arab world and internationally globally
and while this was the major difference between many initiatives before to create change
culture cultural diversity with our faith in our tradition and in our history but at the same time open to universal values connected with the world tolerant to the outside and this is
we are seeing them collapsing one after the other
a tool of revolution we do not create revolutions however when something of that magnitude happens we are at the center of the coverage but most of
to phone our correspondents there and to phone our newsroom and to tell them make your best not to switch off the cameras at night because the guys there really feel confident when someone is reporting their story and they feel protected as well
so we have a chance
to create a new future in that part of the world we have a chance to
cannot create but terrorism and violence and destruction
let us accept the choice of the people let us not pick and choose who we would like to rule their future the future should be ruled by people themselves even sometimes if they are voices that might now scare us but
in order to embrace change and in order to celebrate with the people of that region a great future and hope and tolerance
the future has arrived and the future is now i thank you very much
how would you characterize the historical significance of what 's happened is this a story of the year a story of the decade or something
more wadah khanfar actually this may be the biggest story that we have ever covered we have covered many wars we have covered a lot of tragedies a lot of problems a lot of conflict zones a lot of hot spots in the region because we were centered at the middle of it but this is a story it is a great story it is beautiful it is not something
that you only cover because you have to cover a great incident you are witnessing change in history you are witnessing the birth of a new era and this is what the story 's all about
skeptical or think this may just be an intermediate stage before much more alarming chaos
you really believe that if there are democratic elections in egypt now that a government could emerge that espouses some of the values you 've spoken about so inspiringly
do if they want to connect or make a difference and they believe in what 's happening here
of accessing our website from various parts of the world fifty percent of it is coming from america because we discovered that people care and people would like to know they are receiving the stream through our internet unfortunately in the united states we are not covering but washington d c at this moment in time for al jazeera english
but i can tell you this is the moment to celebrate through connecting ourselves with those people in the street and expressing our support to them and expressing this kind of feeling universal feeling of supporting the weak and the oppressed to create a much better future for all
