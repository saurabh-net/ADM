in my husband 's homeland in the highlands of sulawesi island in eastern indonesia there is a community of people that experience death not as a singular event but as a gradual social process
points of social and cultural interaction are not weddings or births or even family dinners
that are sacrificed and distributed in the name of the deceased
and it 's a transition that 's just as much about the identity of the living as it is about remembrance of the dead so every year
and for many people these grandiose ceremonies and the length of the ceremonies
are somehow incommensurable with the way that we face our own mortality in the west so even as we share death as a universal experience
it 's not experienced the same way the world over
and as an anthropologist i see these differences in experience being rooted in the cultural and social world through which we define the phenomena around us so where we see an unquestionable reality
death as an irrefutable biological condition
in fact a member of society is only truly dead when the extended family can agree upon and marshal the resources necessary to hold a funeral ceremony that is considered appropriate in terms of resources for the status of the deceased
and this ceremony has to take place in front of the eyes of the whole community with everyone 's participation
so after a person 's physical death
their body is placed in a special room in the traditional residence which is called the tongkonan and the tongkonan is symbolic not only of the family 's identity
from birth to death so essentially the shape of the building that you 're born into is the shape of the structure which carries you to your ancestral resting place until the funeral ceremony
which can be held years after a person 's physical death the deceased is referred to as to makala a sick person or to mama a person who is asleep
and they continue to be a member of the household they are symbolically fed and cared for and the family at this time will begin a number of ritual injunctions which communicates to the wider community around them that one of their members is undergoing the transition from this life
so i know what some of you must be thinking right now is she really saying that these people live with the bodies of their dead relatives and that 's exactly what i 'm saying
i like to think about what the torajan way of viewing death encompasses of the human experience
i think that torajans socially recognize
and that is that our relationships with other humans their impact on our social reality
so my husband has fond memories of talking to and playing with and generally being around his deceased grandfather and for him there is nothing unnatural about this this is a natural part of the process as the family comes to terms with the transition
in their relationship to the deceased and this is the transition from relating to the deceased as a person who 's living to relating to the deceased as a person who 's an ancestor and here you can see these wooden effigies of the ancestors so these are people who have already been buried already had a funeral ceremony
so the funeral ceremony itself embodies this relational perspective on death it ritualizes the impact of death on families and communities
and it 's also a moment of self awareness it 's a moment when people think about who they are
and will define who our loved ones are into the future so essentially we all become grandparents to the generations of human children that come after us
and this metaphor of membership in the greater human family is the way that children also describe the money that they invest in these sacrificial buffaloes that are thought to carry people 's soul from here to the afterlife
and children will explain that they will invest the money in this because they want to repay their parents the debt
for all of the years their parents spent investing and caring for them
but the sacrifice of buffalo and the ritual display of wealth also exhibits the status of the deceased and by extension the deceased 's family so at funerals relationships are reconfirmed but also transformed
in a ritual drama that highlights the most salient feature about death in this place its impact on life
and the relationships of the living so all of this focus on death doesn 't mean that torajans don 't aspire to the ideal
so by having death as a part of the cultural and social fabric of life people 's everyday decisions about their health and healthcare
and his death will be greatly mourned
but i know that my husband 's family looks forward to the moment when they can ritually display
his remarkable presence has meant to their lives when they can ritually recount his life 's narrative weaving his story into the history of their community
people ask me if i 'm frightened or repulsed by
participating in a culture where the physical manifestations of death greet us at every turn
but i see something profoundly transformative in experiencing death as a social process and not just a biological one
in reality the relationship between the living and the dead has its own drama in the u s healthcare system
where decisions about how long to stretch the thread of life are made based on our emotional and social ties with the people around us not just on medicine 's ability to prolong life
on the meanings and the definitions that we ascribe to death so i 'm not suggesting that anyone in this audience should run out and adopt the traditions of the torajans it might be a little bit difficult to put into play in the united states
but i want to ask what we can gain from seeing physical death not only as a biological process but as part of the greater human story
what would it be like to look on the expired human form with love
because it 's so intimately a part of who we all are
if we could expand our definition of death to encompass life
with something other than fear
it might help us recognize that the way we limit our conversation about death to something that 's medical or biological is reflective of a larger culture that we all share
if we could entertain and value
other kinds of knowledge about life
including other definitions of death it has the potential to change the discussions that we have about the end of life
it could change the way that we die but more importantly it could transform
the way that we live
