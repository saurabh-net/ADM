that i want to talk to you about today
rarely makes the front pages it however is enormous in both scale and
look you all are very well traveled this is tedglobal after all but i do hope to take you to some places you've never been to before
so let 's start off in china
this photo was taken two weeks ago
this is in the dabian mountains in the remote part of hubei province in central china dai manju is thirteen years old at the time the story starts she lives with her parents her two brothers and her great aunt
they have a hut that has no electricity no running water no wristwatch no bicycle and they share this great splendor with a very large pig
was in sixth grade when her parents said we 're going to pull you out of school because the thirteen dollar school fees are too much for us you're going to be spending the rest of your life in the rice paddies why would we waste this money on you
this is what happens to girls in remote areas turns out that dai manju was the best pupil in her
she still made the two hour trek to the schoolhouse and tried to catch every little bit of information that seeped out of the doors we wrote about her in the new york times
we got a flood of donations
thirteen dollar checks because new york times readers are very generous in tiny amounts
but then we got a money transfer for dollar ten thousand really nice guy
we turned the money over to that man there the principal of the school he was delighted he thought oh i can renovate the school i can give scholarships to all the girls you know if they work hard and stay in school
so dai manju basically finished out middle school she went to high school she went to vocational school for accounting
she scouted for jobs down in guangdong province in the south she found a job she scouted for jobs for her classmates and her friends
she sent money back to her family they built a new house this time with running water electricity a bicycle no
what we saw was a natural
it is rare to get an exogenous investment in girls education and over the years as we followed dai manju we were able to see that she was able to move out of a vicious cycle
and into a virtuous cycle she not only changed her own dynamic she changed her household she changed her family her village the village became
a real stand out of course most of china was flourishing at the time but they were able to get a road built to link them up to the rest of china
and that brings me to my first major of two tenets of
in the nineteenth century it was slavery
in the twentieth century it was totalitarianism
the cause of our time is the brutality that so many people face around the world because of their gender
she's exaggerating well let me ask you this question
most of you well you know this latter group you're wrong
there are true enough in europe and the west when women and men have
in most of the rest of the world that's not the case in fact demographers have shown that there are anywhere between sixty million and one hundred million missing females in the current population
and you know it happens for several reasons for instance in the last half century more girls were discriminated to death
all the people killed on all the battlefields in the twentieth century sometimes it's also because of the sonogram girls get aborted before they're even born
when there are scarce resources this girl here for instance is in a feeding center in ethiopia the entire center was filled with girls like her
boy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate because they depend upon the breast from one to five
girls die at a fifty percent higher mortality rate than boys in all of india
the morality of all the right and wrong of it all and just on a purely practical level
three reasons why this is the case
one of the persistent causes of poverty and you know when you educate a boy his family tends to have fewer kids but only slightly
when you educate a girl she tends to
it has to do with spending it's kind of like the dirty little secret of poverty which is that not only do poor people take in very little income
also the income that they take in they don't spend it very wisely and unfortunately most of that spending is done by men so research has shown if you look at people who live under two dollars a day one metric of poverty
two percent of that take home pay goes to this basket here in education
just take four percentage points and put it into this basket you would have a transformative effect
the last reason has to do with women being part of the solution not the problem
you need to use scarce resources it's a waste of resources if you don't use someone like dai manju bill gates put it very well when he was traveling through saudi arabia
he was speaking to an audience much like yourselves however two thirds of the way there was a barrier on this side was
and then the barrier and this side was women and someone from this side of the room got up and said mister
we have here as our goal in saudi arabia to be one of the top ten countries when it comes to technology do you think we'll make it
so bill gates as he was staring out at the audience he said
if you're not fully utilizing half the resources in your country there is no way you will get anywhere near the top ten
so here is bill of arabia
so what would some of the specific challenges look like
i would say on the top of the agenda is sex trafficking and i'll just say two things about this
the slavery at the peak of the slave trade in the seventeen
there were about eighty thousand slaves transported from africa to the new world
now modern slavery according to state department rough statistics there are about eight hundred thousand ten times the number
that are trafficked across international borders and that does not even include those that are trafficked within country borders which is a substantial portion
you can buy a girl trafficked for few hundred dollars
which means she's actually more disposable
but you know there is progress being made in places like cambodia and thailand we don't have to expect a world where girls are bought and sold or killed
the second item on the agenda is maternal mortality
in this part of the world is a wonderful event
you know it's not as though we don't have the technological solution
but these women have three strikes against them
they are poor they are rural and they are female
end up with an injury and the most devastating injury is obstetric fistula
tearing during obstructed labor that leaves a woman
let me tell you about mahabuba
she lives in ethiopia she was married against her will at age thirteen she got pregnant ran to the bush to have the baby but you know her body was very immature and she ended up having obstructed labor
that meant she was incontinent
she couldn't control her wastes
she fought off the hyenas with that
and the next morning she new if she could get to a nearby village where there was a foreign missionary she would be saved
all the way thirty miles to that
her to a nearby fistula hospital
she was repaired with a three hundred and fifty dollar operation
the problem she's moved out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle
talk about some of the solutions and there are predictable solutions
she tends to have kids later on in life she tends to have fewer kids and those kids that she does have she educates them in a more enlightened fashion with economic opportunity it can be
at the time she was miserable she was beaten every single day by her husband who was unemployed he was kind of a gambler type and unemployable therefore and took his frustrations out on her well when she had her second daughter her
i think you'd better get a second wife saima 's not going to produce you
at the time there was a microlending group in the village sixty five dollar loan
and she started an embroidery business
the merchants liked her embroidery it sold very well and they kept asking for more and when she couldn't produce enough she hired other women in the village pretty soon she had thirty women in the village working for her embroidery business
and then when she had to
transport all of the embroidery goods from the village to the marketplace she needed someone to help her do the transport so she hired her husband
so now they're in it together he does the transportation and distribution and she does the production and sourcing and now they have a third daughter and
the daughters all of them are being tutored in education because saima knows what's really important which brings me to the final element which is education
larry summers when he was chief economist at the world bank once said that it may well be that the highest return on investment in the developing world is in girls education
she didn't go to school actually she had never been to school not to a lick one day
so at nine years of age beatrice started in first grade after all she'd never been to a lick of school with a six year
no matter she was just delighted to be in school she rocketed to the top of her class she stayed at the top of
and then in high school she scored brilliantly on the national examinations so that she became the first person in her village ever to come to the united states on scholarship
two years ago she graduated from connecticut college
on the day of her graduation she said i am the luckiest girl alive because of a goat
so you see how transformative little bits of help can be
i want to give you a reality check look
u s aid helping people is not easy and there have been books that have criticized u s
bill easterly 's book there's a book called dead aid you know the criticism is fair it isn't easy you know people say how
of all water well projects a year later failed when i was in zimbabwe we were touring a place with the village chief he wanted to raise money for a secondary school and there was some construction a few yards away and i said what
turns out that it's a failed irrigation project
few yards away was a failed chicken coop one year all the chickens died and no one wanted to put the chickens in there
it's true but we think that you don't through the baby out with the bathwater you actually
we also think that individuals can make a difference
and they should because individuals together
what's in it for you research shows
you have all of your material needs taken care of which most of us all of us here in this room do
research shows that there are very few things in life that can actually elevate your level of happiness
one of those things is
it's an anecdote that i'll leave you with and that is the story of an aid worker in darfur
here was was a woman who had worked in darfur seeing things that no human being should see throughout her time there
and she saw something that made her break down in tears the great fortune
to be born in a country
we not only can feed clothe and
that with that great fortune you me
all won the lottery of life
feel happier and help save the world thank you very much
