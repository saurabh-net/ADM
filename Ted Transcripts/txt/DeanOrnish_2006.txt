with all the legitimate concerns about aids and avian flu and we'll hear about that from the brilliant doctor brilliant later today i want to talk about the other pandemic which is
and in one generation for example asia 's gone from having one of the lowest rates of heart disease and obesity and diabetes to one of the highest and in africa
blood vessel diseases still kill more people not only in this country but also worldwide than everything else combined and yet it's completely preventable for almost everybody
it's not only preventable it's actually reversible and for the last almost twenty nine years we've been able to show that by simply changing diet and lifestyle using these very
high tech expensive state of the art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low tech and low cost interventions can be like quantitative arteriography before and after a year and cardiac pet scans
we showed a few months ago we published the first study showing you can actually stop or reverse the progression of prostate cancer by making changes in diet and lifestyle and seventy percent
now there is an epidemic of obesity two thirds of adults and fifteen percent of kids what's really concerning to me is that diabetes has increased seventy percent in the past ten years
and this may be the first generation in which our kids live a shorter life span than we do that's pitiful and it's preventable now these are not election returns these are the people
the number of the people who are obese by state beginning in eighty five eighty six eighty seven these are from the cdc website eighty eight eighty nine
can we do about this well you know the diet that we've found that can reverse heart disease and cancer is an asian diet but the people in asia are starting to eat like we are which is why they're starting to get sick like we are
and they're finding that it's good business the salads that you see at mcdonald 's came from the work they're going to have an asian salad at pepsi two thirds of their revenue growth came from their better foods
