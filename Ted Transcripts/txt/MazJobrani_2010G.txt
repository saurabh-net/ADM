these are dilemmas i have every day
but i was born in iran i'm now an american citizen which means i have the american passport which means i can travel
because if you only have the iranian passport you're kind of limited to the countries you can go to with open arms you know syria venezuela north korea
i'm like oh come on man trying to go places
and so i was in kuwait recently doing a comedy show with some other american comedians they all went through and then the border patrol saw my american passport ah ha american great then he opened it up born in iran wait
asking me questions he said what is your father 's name i said well he 's passed away but his name was khosro he goes what is your grandfather 's name
been looking for you for two hundred years
your grandfather has a parking violation it's way overdue
you owe us two billion dollars
but as you can see when i talk
i speak with an american accent which you would think as an iranian american actor i should be able to play any part good bad what have you but a lot of times in hollywood when casting directors find out you're of middle eastern descent they go oh you're iranian great can you say i will kill you in the name of
i could say that but what if i were to say hello i'm your doctor
go great and then you hijack the hospital
i think you're missing the point here
i don't mind playing bad guys i want to play a bad guy i want to rob a bank i want to rob a bank in a film i want to rob a bank in a film but do it with a gun with a gun not with a bomb strapped around
i imagine the director maz i think your character would rob the bank with a bomb around
gimme all your money or i'll blow myself
well then blow yourself up
just do it outside please
but the fact is there's good people everywhere that's what i try and show in my stand up there's good people everywhere all it takes in one person to mess it up like a couple months ago in times square in new york
and a few months before that there was a white american guy in austin texas who flew his airplane into the irs building and i happened to be in austin that day
doing a stand up comedy show now i'll tell you as a middle eastern male when you show up around a lot of these activities
you start feeling guilty at one point
i was watching the news i'm like am i involved
i didn't get the memo what's going on
but what was interesting was the pakistani muslim guy see he gives a bad name to muslims and middle easterners and pakistanis from all over the world and one thing that happened there was also the pakistani taliban took credit for that failed car bombing
my question is why would you take credit for a failed car bombing
we just wanted to say we tried and furthermore
it is the thought that
what happened was when the white guy flew his plane into the building i know all my middle eastern and muslim friends in the states were watching tv going please don't be middle eastern don't
and the name came out jack i'm like
but i kept watching the news in case they came back they were like before he did it he why
but the fact is i've been lucky to get a chance to perform all over the world and i did a lot of shows in the middle east i just did a seven country solo tour i was in
oman and i was in saudi arabia i was in dubai and it's great there's good people everywhere and you learn great things about these places i encourage people always to go visit these places for example dubai
cool place they're obsessed with having the biggest tallest longest as we all know they have a mall there the dubai mall it is so big they have taxis in the mall
i was walking i heard beep beep i'm like what are you doing here
out of my way out of my way
you want some frozen yogurt
i have one gram five gram ten gram how many gram do you want
i bought five grams ten dollars ten dollars i said what 's in this he 's like good stuff man columbian top of the line top of
the other thing you learn sometimes when you travel to these countries in the middle east sometimes in latin american countries south american countries a lot of times when they build stuff there's no rules and regulations
for example i took my two year old son to the playground at the dubai mall and i've taken my two year old son to playgrounds all over the united states and when you put your two year old
on a slide in the united states they put something on the slide to slow the kid down as he comes down the slide not in the middle east
i put my two year old on the slide
off i went down i go where 's my son on the third floor sir on the third
you take a taxi you go to zara make a left try the yogurt it's very good little expensive
thin mustache staring at me
so i went over excuse me sir are you my driver i
you staring at me he goes i thought you were my
with this i try with my stand up to break stereotypes present middle easterners in a positive light muslims in a positive light and i hope that in the coming years
more film and television programs come out of hollywood presenting us in a positive light who knows maybe one day we'll even have our own james bond
right my name is bond jamal bond
til then i'll keep telling jokes i hope you keep laughing have a good day thank
