in missouri we lived on less than a dollar a day for about fifteen years i got a scholarship went to university
studied international agriculture studied anthropology and decided i was going to give back i was going to work with small farmers i was going to help alleviate poverty i was going to work on international development
and then i took a turn
and ended up here now if you get a ph d and you decide not to teach you don't always end up in a place like this it's a choice you might end up driving a taxicab you could be in new york
what i found was i started working with refugees and famine victims small farmers all or nearly all who had been dispossessed and
what i'd been trained to do was methodological research on such people
so i did it i found out how many women had been raped en route to these camps i found out how many people had been put in jail
how many family members had been killed i assessed how long they were going to stay and how much it would take to feed them
and i got really good at predicting how many body bags you would need for the people who were going to die in these camps
now this is god 's work
he said what can i do to save the rainforests i said well ben what do you do i make ice cream so i said well you've got to make
it was a great success
we did our first million dollars worth of trade by buying on thirty days and selling on twenty one that gets your adrenaline going
then we had a four and a half million dollar line of credit because we were credit worthy at that point
fifty companies signed up two hundred products came out generated one hundred million in sales it failed
because the people who were gathering brazil nuts weren't the same people who were cutting the forests and the people who made money from brazil nuts were not the people who made money from cutting the forests
we were attacking the wrong driver we needed to be working on beef we needed to be working on lumber we needed to be working on soy things that we were not focused on
so let 's go back to sudan
this farmer said to me one day something that was very profound he said you can't wake a person who 's pretending to sleep
fast forward we live on a planet there's just one of them
got to wake up to the fact that we don't have any more
and that this is a finite planet
we know the limits of the resources we have
we may be able to use them differently we may have some innovative new ideas but in general this is what we've got there's no more of
there's a basic equation that we can't get away from
line of being in a sustainable relationship to the planet now we're at one point three if we were farmers we'd be eating our seed
for bankers we'd be living off the principal not the interest this is where we stand today
lot of people like to point to some place else as the cause of the problem it's always population growth
we've got to think that consumption is an issue it's not just about population and it's not just about them it's about us
there's very good evidence again we don't necessarily have a peer reviewed methodology that's bulletproof yet but there's very good evidence that the average cat in europe
has a larger environmental footprint in its lifetime than the average african
you think that's not an issue going forward you think that's not a question as to how we should be using the earth 's resources let 's go back and visit our equation
in two thousand we had six billion people on the planet they were consuming what they were consuming let 's say one unit of consumption each we have six billion units of consumption
five times what it is today on global average about so we're going to have eighteen billion units of consumption
who have you heard talking lately that's said we have to triple production of goods and services but that's what the math says we're not going to be able to do that
we can get productivity up
and then we need to use less again and then we need to consume less all of those things are part of that equation but it basically raises a fundamental question
should consumers have a choice about sustainability about sustainable products should you be able to buy a product that's sustainable sitting next to one that isn 't or should all the products on the shelf be sustainable
the average consumer takes one point eight seconds in the u s okay so let 's be generous let 's say it's three point five seconds in europe
how do you evaluate all the scientific data around a product the data that's changing on a weekly if not a daily basis
here 's a little question
from a greenhouse gas perspective is lamb produced in the u k better than lamb produced in new zealand frozen and shipped to the u k
is a bad feeder lot operation for beef better or worse than a bad grazing operation for beef
do organic potatoes actually have fewer toxic chemicals used to produce them than conventional potatoes
in every single case the answer is it depends it depends on who produced it and how
in every single instance and there are many others how is a consumer going to walk through this mine field
they're not they may have a lot of opinions about it but they're not going to be terribly informed
it's got to be something we all care about and we need collusion
we need groups to work together that never have we need cargill to work with bunge we need coke to work with pepsi
we need oxford to work with cambridge we need greenpeace to work with wwf everybody 's got to work together china and the u s
we need to begin to manage this planet as if our life depended on it because it does it fundamentally does
so the where we've identified thirty five places globally that we need to work these are the places that are the richest in biodiversity and the most important from an ecosystem function point of view
we looked at the threats to these places these are the fifteen commodities that fundamentally pose the biggest threats to these places
because of deforestation soil loss water use pesticide use over fishing etc
so we've got thirty five places we've got fifteen priority commodities who do we work with to change the way those commodities are produced are we going to work with six point nine billion consumers
let 's see that's about seven thousand languages three hundred and fifty major languages a lot of work there i don't see anybody actually being able to do that very effectively
are we going to work with one point five billion producers
again a daunting task there must be a better way
of the trade of each of the fifteen commodities that we've identified as the most significant if we work with those if we change those companies and the way they do business then the rest will happen automatically
so we went through our fifteen commodities this is nine of them we lined them up side by side and we put the names of the companies that work on each of those and if you go
through the first twenty five or thirty names of each of the commodities what you begin to see is gosh there's cargill here there's cargill there there's cargill everywhere
in fact these names start coming up over and over again so we did the analysis again a slightly different way
we said if we take the top hundred companies what percentage of all fifteen commodities do they touch buy or sell
and what we found is it's twenty five percent so one hundred companies
why is twenty five percent important
because if these companies demand sustainable products they'll pull forty to fifty percent of production
companies can push producers faster than consumers can
by companies asking for this we can leverage production so much faster than by waiting for consumers to do it
after forty years the global organic movement has achieved zero point seven of one percent of global food
we can't wait that long
we don't have that kind of time we need change that's going to accelerate
even working with individual companies is not probably going to get us there we need to begin to work with
industries so we've started roundtables where we bring together the entire value chain from producers all the way to the retailers and brands
we bring in civil society we bring in ngos we bring in researchers and scientists to have an informed discussion sometimes a battle royale
and design standards around that it's not all fun and games
in salmon aquaculture we kicked off a roundtable almost six years ago
eight entities came to the table
we eventually got i think sixty percent of global production at the table and twenty five percent of demand at the table three of the original eight entities were suing each other
and yet next week we launch globally verified vetted and certified standards for salmon it can happen
it can happen so what brings
the different entities to the table
for the big companies it's reputational risk but more importantly they don't care what the price of commodities is if they don't have commodities they don't have a business they care about availability so the big risk for them is not having product at all
for the producers if a buyer wants to buy something produced a certain way that's what brings them to the table so it's the demand that brings them to the table
the good news is we identified a hundred companies two years ago in the last eighteen months we've signed agreements with forty of those hundred companies to begin to work with them on their supply chain and in the next eighteen months
signed up to work with another forty and we think we'll get those signed as well now what we're doing is bringing the ceos of these eighty companies together
to help twist the arms of the final twenty to bring them to the table because they don't like ngos they've never worked with ngos they're concerned about this they're concerned about that
but we all need to be in this together so we're pulling out all the stops we're using whatever leverage we have to bring them to the table one company we're working with that's begun in baby steps perhaps but has begun this journey on sustainability is cargill funded research that shows
that we can double global palm oil production without cutting a single tree in the next twenty years and do it all in borneo alone by planting on land that's already degraded
the study shows that the highest net present value for palm oil is on land that's been degraded they're also undertaking a study to look at all of their
why is cargill important because cargill has twenty to twenty five percent of global palm oil if cargill makes a decision
the entire palm oil industry moves or at least forty or fifty percent of it that's not insignificant more importantly
but they're doing some really interesting things around
and it all comes from the fact that mars wants to be in business in the future
and what they see is that they need to improve chocolate production on any given plantation
so mars is looking at the genome they're sequencing the genome of the cocoa plant
what they've realized is that if they can identify the traits on productivity and drought tolerance they can produce three hundred and twenty percent as much cocoa on forty percent of the
the rest of the land can be used for something else it's more with less and less again that's what the future has got to be
now many people complain about
consumers are not paying for the true cost of food if you take a look just at water what we see is that
with four very common products you look at how much a farmer produced to make those products and then you look at how much water input was put into them
and then you look at what the farmer was paid if you divide the amount of water into what the farmer was paid
a lot on water but right now they're entering into seventeen year contracts with growers in turkey to sell juice into europe and they're doing that because they want to have a product that's closer to the european market
there's carbon that's being bought with sugar with coffee with beef this is called bundling it's bringing those externalities back into the price of the commodity
we need to take what we've learned in private voluntary standards
of what the best producers in the world are doing and use that to inform government regulation so we can shift the entire performance curve we can't just focus on identifying the best we've got to move the rest
the issue isn't what to think it's how to think these companies have begun to think differently they're on a journey there's no turning back we're all on that same journey with them
we have to really begin to change the way we think about everything whatever was sustainable on a planet of six billion is not going to be sustainable on a planet with nine thank you
