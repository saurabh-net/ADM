five years old and i am very proud my father has just built the best outhouse in our little village in ukraine
inside it 's a smelly gaping hole in the ground but outside
it 's pearly white formica and it literally gleams in the sun
this makes me feel so proud so important that i appoint myself the leader of my little group of friends and i devise missions for us so we prowl from house to house looking for flies captured in spider webs and we set them free
four years earlier when i was one after the chernobyl accident the rain came down black and my sister 's hair fell out in clumps and i spent nine months in the hospital
there were no visitors allowed so my mother bribed a hospital worker she acquired a nurse 's uniform and she snuck in every night to sit by my side
five years later an unexpected silver lining thanks to chernobyl we get asylum in the u s
so the first day we get to new york my grandmother and i find a penny in the floor of the homeless shelter that my family 's staying in only we don 't know that it 's a homeless shelter we think that it 's a hotel a hotel with lots of rats so
we find this penny kind of fossilized in the floor and we think that a very wealthy man must have left it there because regular people don 't just lose money
and in that moment i feel like a millionaire about a year later i get to feel that way again when we find a bag full of stuffed animals in the trash and suddenly i have more toys than i 've ever had in my whole life
and again i get that feeling when we get a knock on the door of our apartment in brooklyn and my sister and i find a deliveryman with a box of pizza that we didn 't order so we take the pizza
our very first pizza and we devour slice after slice as the deliveryman stands there and stares at us from the doorway and he tells us to pay but we don 't speak english
my mother comes out and he asks her for money but she doesn 't have enough she walks fifty blocks to and from work every day just to avoid spending money on bus fare
then our neighbor pops her head in and she turns red with rage when she realizes that those immigrants from downstairs have somehow gotten their hands on her pizza
everyone 's upset but the pizza is delicious
it doesn 't hit me until my husband brian
was also homeless as a kid his family lost everything and at age eleven he had to live in motels with his dad
motels that would round up all of their food and keep it hostage until they were able to pay the bill
and one time when he finally got his box of frosted flakes back it was crawling with roaches
but he did have one thing he had this shoebox that he carried with him everywhere containing nine comic books two g i joes painted to look like spider man
and five gobots and this was his treasure this was his own assembly of heroes that kept him from drugs and gangs and from giving up on his dreams and
now these days she eats organic food and she sleeps on an orthopedic bed with her name on it
gratitude we forget about all of our new middle class frustrations and disappointments and we feel like millionaires
