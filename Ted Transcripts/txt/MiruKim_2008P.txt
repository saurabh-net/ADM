and i thought i would become a surgeon because i was interested in anatomy and dissecting animals really piqued my curiosity
at the same time i fell in love with new york city
i started to realize that i could look at the whole city as a living organism i wanted to dissect it and look into its unseen layers
and the way to to it for me was through artistic means so eventually i decided to pursue an mfa instead of an m d
and in grad school i became interested in creatures that dwell in the hidden corners of the city
in new york city rats are part of commuters daily lives most people ignore them or are frightened of them
but i took a liking to them because they dwell on the fringes of society and even though they're used in labs to promote human lives
also considered as pests i also started looking around in the city and trying to photograph them
one day in the subway i was snapping pictures of the tracks hoping to catch a rat or two and a man came up to me and said you can't take photographs here
the mta will confiscate your camera i was quite shocked by that and thought to myself well ok then i'll follow the rats
then i started going into the tunnels which made me realize that there's a whole new dimension to the city that i never saw before and most people don't get to see
around the same time i met like minded individuals who call themselves urban explorers adventurers spelunkers
guerrilla historians et cetera i was welcomed into this loose internet based network of people who regularly explore
urban ruins such as abandoned subway stations tunnels sewers aqueducts factories hospitals shipyards and so on
when i took photographs in these locations i felt there was something missing in the pictures simply documenting these soon to be demolished structures wasn't enough for me
so i wanted to create a fictional character or an animal that dwells in these underground spaces and the simplest way to do it at the time was to model myself
i decided against clothing because i wanted the figure to be without any cultural implications or time specific elements
i wanted a simple way to represent a living body inhabiting these decaying derelict spaces
this was taken in the riviera sugar factory in red hook brooklyn it's now an empty six acre lot waiting for a shopping mall right across from the new ikea
first went in i was scared because i heard dogs barking and i thought they were guard dogs but they happened to be wild dogs living there and it was right by the water so there were swans and ducks swimming around and
when i got comfortable in the space it also felt like a big playground i would climb up the tanks and hop across exposed beams as if i went back in time and became a child again
when you go into spaces like this you're directly accessing the past because they sit untouched for
i love feeling the aura of a space that has so much history instead of looking at reproductions of it at home you're actually feeling the hand laid bricks
and shimmying up and down narrow cracks and getting wet and muddy and walking in a dark tunnel with a flashlight
this is a tunnel underneath the riverside park it was built in the nineteen thirties by robert moses
walking in this tunnel is very peaceful there's nobody around you and you hear the kids playing
in the park above you completely unaware of what's underneath when i was going out a lot to these places i was feeling a lot of
naked city is a nickname for new york and spleen embodies the melancholia and intertia that come from feeling alienated in an urban environment
this is the same tunnel you see the sunbeams coming from the ventilation ducts and the train approaching
this is a tunnel that's abandoned in hell 's kitchen i was there alone setting up and a homeless man approached i was basically intruding his living space
and when i was done he actually offered me his shirt to wipe off my feet and kindly walked me out it must have been a very unusual
one thing that struck me after this incident was that a space like that holds so many deleted memories of the city
that homeless man to me really represented an element of the unconscious of the city he told me that he was abused
above ground and was once in riker 's island and at last he found peace and quiet in that space
the tunnel was once built for the prosperity of the city but is now a sanctuary for outcasts who are completely forgotten in the average urban dweller 's everyday life
this is underneath my alma mater columbia university the tunnels are famous for having been used during the development of the manhattan project
this is the new york city farm colony which was a poorhouse in staten island from the eighteen nineties to the nineteen thirties
it's located in newark when i was there three years ago the windows were broken and the walls were peeling but everything was left there as it was
you see the autopsy table morgue trays x ray machines and even used utensils which you see on
after exploring recently abandoned buildings i felt that everything could fall into ruins very fast your home your office a shopping mall
a church any man made structures around you i was reminded of how fragile our sense of security is and how vulnerable people truly are
i love to travel and berlin has become one of my favorite cities it's full of history and also full of underground bunkers and
i saw the structure while i was on the train and i got off at the next station and met people there that gave me access to their
this is the actual catacombs in paris i explored there extensively in the off limits areas and fell in love right away
there are more than one hundred and eighty five miles of tunnels and only about a mile is open to the public as a museum
the first tunnels date back to sixty b c they were consistently dug as limestone
and by the eighteenth century the caving in of some of these quarries posed safety threats so the government
ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries and dug new observation tunnels in order to monitor and map the whole place
as you can see the system is very complex and vast it's very dangerous to get lost in there
and at the same time there was a problem in the city with overflowing cemeteries so the bones were moved from the cemeteries into the quarries making them into the catacombs
also phone cables that were used in the fifties and many bunkers from the world war ii era this is a german bunker
nearby there's a french bunker and the whole tunnel system is so complex that the two parties never met
the tunnels are famous for having been used by the resistance which victor hugo wrote about in les miserables and i saw a lot of graffiti from the eighteen hundreds like this one
after exploring the underground of paris i decided to climb up and i climbed a gothic monument that's right in the middle of paris
this is the tower of saint jacques it was built in the early fifteen
i don't recommend sitting on a gargoyle in the middle of january
it was not very comfortable and all this time i never saw a single rat in any of these places until recently when i was in the london sewers
this was probably the toughest place to explore i had to wear a gas mask because of the toxic fumes
this is a still from a film i worked on recently called blind door i've become more interested in capturing movement and
texture and the sixteen mm black and white film gave a different feel to it
and this is the first theater project i worked on i adapted and produced a doctoream play by august strindberg and it was performed
leaning towards more collaborative projects like these lately but whenever i get a chance i still work on my series
the last place i visited was the mayan ruins of copan honduras this was taken inside an archaeological tunnel
in the main temple i like doing more than just exploring these spaces i feel an obligation to
and humanize these spaces continually in order to preserve their memories in a creative way before they're lost forever
