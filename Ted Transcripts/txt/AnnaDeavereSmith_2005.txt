when i was a little girl if you say a word often enough it becomes you and having grown up in a segregated city baltimore maryland
i sort of use that idea to go around america with a tape recorder thank god for technology to interview people thinking that if i walked in their words which is also why i don't wear shoes when i perform sank
and bam it went down it went down
came up wow some century
so this is his answer about a defining moment in american history american history i
think there's one you can't say
funny little play bit the atlanta airport is a modern
and on to a destination and these trains are smooth and
quiet and they're efficient and there's a voice on the train you know the voice was a human voice you see in the old days we imitating robots
imitating robots this
and they're just about to close the pneumatic doors and that voice without losing a beat says because of late entry we're delayed thirty seconds just
at this couple with hateful eyes and the couple 's going like this you know shrinking well
i do that to steel my nerves and so i imitate a train call
time has come you see well some of
at the foot of calvary up you know just
i see a baby a
i know it's hispanic because she's speaking spanish i
what is your considered opinion
and the baby looks you know the way
what huck did you see here 's huck he 's an illiterate kid he 's had no schooling but there's something in him and the official truth
the truth was the law was that
you see and huck gets on the raft
and more and more less and less awareness of the pain or the other and
and kids i
kids i that's
talk about risk taking i'm going to do somebody that nobody likes you know most actors want to do characters that are
well not always but the notion especially at a conference like this i like to inspire people but since this was called risk taking i'm doing somebody who i never do
because she's so unlikeable that one person actually came backstage and told me to take her out of the show she
like this as a good thing but there are certain other connotations to the word risk and the same thing about the word nature what is nature maxine greene who 's a wonderful philosopher who 's
and was the head of a philosophy great big philosophy kind of an organization i went to her and asked her what are the two things that she doesn't
know that she still wants to know and she said well personally i still feel like i have to curtsey when i see the president of my university
and i still feel as though i've got to get coffee for my male colleagues even though i've outlived most of them and she said and then intellectually i don't know enough about the negative imagination and september eleventh certainly taught us that that's a whole area we don't investigate so
this piece is about a negative imagination it raises questions about what nature is what mother nature is and about what a risk can be and i got this in the maryland correctional institute for women everything i do is word for word
off of a tape and i title things because i think people speak in organic poems and this is called a mirror to her mouth and this is an inmate named paulette jenkins
i began to learn how to cover
because i didn't want nobody to know that this was happening in my home
i want everybody to think we were a normal family i mean we had all the materialistic
ran out of excuses about how we got black eyes and busted lips and bruises
i didn't had no more excuses and he beat me
but that didn't change the fact that it was a nightmare for my family it was a nightmare
and i failed them dramatically because i allowed it to go on and on and on
but the night that myesha got killed and the intensity just grew and grew and grew until one night we came home from getting drugs
and he got angry with myesha and he started beating her and he put her in a
oh he would use a belt he had a belt because he had this warped perverted thing that myesha was having sex with her little brother and they was fondling each other that would be his reason i'm just talking about the particular night
and so he put her in the bathtub and i was in the bedroom with the baby and four months before this happened four months before myesha died i thought i could really fix this man
so i had a baby by him insane thinking that if i gave him his own kid he would leave mine alone and it didn't work
up with three children houston myesha and dominic who was four months old when i came to
and i was in the bedroom like i said he had her in the bathroom and he he every time he hit her she would fall
but i dared not to move i didn't move i didn't even go and see what was
i just sat there and
and so she set there for about four or five hours
all around her head was just swollen her head was about two sizes of
the next morning she was
on her for school and he got very excited
she was dead i didn't even want to accept the fact that she was dead so i
there was no thing nothing
coming out of her mouth he said he said he said we can 't we can't let nobody find out about this he say you've got to help me i agree
i mean i've been keeping a secret for years and years and years so it just seemed like second hand to me just to keep on keeping it a secret
so we went to the mall
and we told a police that we had like lost her
we told a security guard that she was missing
that she was missing she
she to
so that's an investigation of the negative imagination
search for an american character with my tape recorder i thought that i was going to go around america and find it in all its aspects bull riders
pig farmers drum majorettes but i sort of got tripped on race relations because my first big show was a show
it's a kind of an aria i would say and in many tapes that i have everybody knows that the los angeles riots happened because four cops beat up a black man named rodney king it was captured on video tape technology
was played all over the world everybody thought the four cops would go to jail they did not so there were riots and what a lot of people forget is there was a second trial ordered by george bush sr and that
came back with two cops going to jail and two cops declared innocent i was at that trial
whose stores had been burned to the ground and so this woman misters young soon han i suppose will have taught me the most that i have learned about race and she
in society and this is called swallowing the bitterness i used to believe
i used to believe many
many but at the end
when we were in such turmoil and having all the financial problems and all the mental
i began to really realize that
out of this society and we are nothing why why do we have to be
amount of money to survive we didn't get any because we have a
and a house and we are i
many african americans probably think that they won by the trial i was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict and all the
they were having a party they celebrated all of south central all the churches and they say well finally well what about
well what about as i do
he is the only model for black community i don't care jesse jackson
model of non violence non violence and
they would all like to be
and i wonder if that is really justice for them to get their rights in that way
sitting here alone and watching they became
korean victims and other victims who
in the mainstream that's why i understand that's why i have a mixed feeling about the verdict
i wish that i wish that
i wish that i could be part of the enjoyment i wish that i could live together with black people the riot
the riot much difference
much difference how do you
how do you igniting fire
igniting fire still there
still there out any time
the other reason that i don't wear
and get into the feet of somebody walking really in somebody else's shoes and i told you that in
you know i didn't give you the year but in seventy nine i thought that i was going to go around and find bull riders and pig farmers and people like that and i got sidetracked on race relations finally i did find a bull rider two years ago and i've been going to the rodeos with him and we've bonded
and he 's the lead in an op ed i did about the republican convention he 's a republican i won 't say anything about my party affiliation
anyway so this is my dear dear brent williams and this is on toughness in case anybody needs to know about being tough for the work that you do i think there's a real lesson in this and this is called
well i'm an optimist i mean basically i'm an optimist i mean you know i mean it's like my wife jolene her family 's always saying you know you ever think he 's just a born loser it seems like he has so much bad luck you know but then
and i mean funny things like this happen i was in a doctor 's office last cat scan and there was a reader 's digest october two thousand and two it was like seven ways to get lucky
and she was saying you're going to make me look like an idiot because i've never been to college and i wouldn't be talking professional or anything i said well look the woman talked to me for four hours you know if i wasn't talking you know like you know she wanted me to talk i don't think she would even come out here
movie eight seconds i mean like pat o 'mealey always said when i was a boy he say you know you got more try than any kid i ever seen and beauty is
and so they sewed my face up and then they had to straighten out my nose and they took these rods and shoved them up
thing was once they shoved those rods up there and straightened my nose out i could breathe and i hadn't been able to thank you
