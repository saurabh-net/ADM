at ted we talk a lot about leadership and how to make a movement so let 's watch a movement happen start to finish in under three minutes and dissect some lessons from it
first of course you know a leader needs the guts to stand out and be ridiculed
but what he 's doing is so easy to follow so here 's his first follower with a crucial role he 's going to show everyone else how to follow
you notice that the first follower is actually an underestimated form of leadership in itself it takes guts just to stand out like that the first follower is what transforms a lone nut into a leader
and here comes a second follower now it's not a lone nut it's not two nuts three is a crowd and a crowd is news so a movement must be public
it's important not just to show the leader but the followers because you find that new followers emulate the followers not the leader now here comes two more people and immediately after three more people now we've got momentum this is the tipping point now we've got a so
notice that as more people join in it's less risky so those that were sitting on the fence before now have no reason not to they won 't stand out
they won 't be ridiculed but they will be part of the in crowd if they hurry
over the next minute you'll see all of those that prefer to stick with the crowd because eventually they would be ridiculed for not joining in and that's how you make a movement but let 's recap some lessons from this
so first if you are the type like the shirtless dancing guy that is standing alone remember the importance of nurturing your first few followers as equals so it's clearly about the movement not you okay but
we might have missed the real lesson here the biggest lesson if you noticed did you catch it is that leadership is over glorified that yes it was the shirtless guy was first and he'll get all the credit
but it was really the first follower that transformed the lone nut into a leader so as we're told that we should all be leaders that would be really ineffective
if you really care about starting a movement have the courage to follow and show others how to follow and when you find a lone nut doing something great
have the guts to be the first one to stand up and join in and what a perfect place to do that ted thanks
