but we don 't normally think of cancer as being a contagious disease the tasmanian devil has shown us that not only can cancer be a contagious disease but it can also threaten an entire species with extinction
so first of all what is a tasmanian devil
many of you might be familiar with taz the cartoon character the one that spins around and around and around but not many people know that there actually is a real animal called the tasmanian devil and it 's the world 's largest carnivorous marsupial a marsupial is a mammal with a pouch like a kangaroo
the tasmanian devil got its name from the terrifying nocturnal that it makes
the tasmanian devil is predominantly a scavenger and it uses its powerful jaws and its sharp teeth to chomp on the bones of rotting dead animals
and despite their ferocious appearance tasmanian devils are actually quite adorable little animals in fact growing up in tasmania it always was incredibly exciting when we got a chance to see a tasmanian devil in the wild
but the tasmanian devil population has been undergoing a really extremely fast decline and in fact there 's concern that the species could go extinct in the wild within
twenty to thirty years and the reason for that is the emergence of a new disease a contagious cancer
at the time this was thought to be a one off
animals just like humans sometimes get strange tumors however we now believe that this is the first sighting of a new disease which is now an epidemic spreading through tasmania the
the northeast of tasmania in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six and has spread across tasmania like a huge wave now there 's only a small part of the population which remains unaffected
this disease appears first as tumors usually on the face or inside the mouth of affected tasmanian devils these tumors inevitably grow into larger tumors such as these ones here and the next image i 'm going to show is quite gruesome but inevitably these tumors progress towards being enormous
ulcerating tumors like this one here
she hadn 't eaten for days her guts were swimming with parasitic worms her body was riddled with secondary tumors and yet she was feeding three little baby tasmanian devils in her pouch
in fact in the area where she comes from more than ninety percent of the tasmanian devil population has already died of this disease
scientists around the world were intrigued by this cancer this infectious cancer that was spreading through the tasmanian devil population and our minds immediately turned to cervical cancer in women which is spread by a virus and to the aids epidemic which is associated with a number of different types of cancer
all the evidence suggested that this devil cancer was spread by a virus
however we now know and i 'll tell you right now that we know that this cancer is not spread by a virus in fact the infectious agent of disease in this cancer is something altogether more sinister and something that we hadn 't really thought of before
but in order for me to explain what that is i need to spend just a couple of minutes talking more about cancer itself
cancer is a disease that affects millions of people around the world every year fourteen
cancer occurs when a single cell in your body acquires a set of random mutations in important genes that cause that cell to start to produce more and more and more copies of itself
paradoxically once established natural selection actually favors the continued growth of cancer
natural selection is survival of the fittest and when you have a population of fast dividing cancer cells if one of them acquires new mutations which allow them to grow more quickly acquire nutrients more successfully invade the body
an amazing fact is that given the right environment and the right nutrients a cancer cell has the potential to go on growing forever
however cancer is constrained by living inside our bodies and its continued growth its spreading through our bodies and eating away at our tissues leads to the death of the cancer patient and also to the death of the cancer itself
so cancer could be thought of as a strange short lived self destructive life form an evolutionary dead end
but that is where the tasmanian devil cancer has acquired an absolutely amazing evolutionary adaptation
and the answer came from studying the tasmanian devil cancer 's dna this was work from many people but i 'm going to explain it through a confirmatory experiment that i did
the sequence of jonas tumor to that of the rest of his body i discovered that they had a completely different genetic profile
in fact jonas and his tumor
so how come a tumor that arose from the cells of another individual is growing on jonas face well the next breakthrough came from studying hundreds of tasmanian devil cancers from all around tasmania we found that all of these cancers shared the same dna
think about that for a minute that means that all of these cancers actually are the same cancer that arose once from one individual devil that have broken free of that first devil 's body and spread through the entire tasmanian devil population but how can a cancer spread
we think that cancer cells actually come off the tumor get into the saliva when the devil bites another devil it actually physically implants living cancer cells into the next devil so the tumor continues to grow
so this tasmanian devil cancer is perhaps the ultimate cancer it 's not constrained by living within the body that gave rise to it it spreads through the population has mutations that allow it to evade
this is kimbo he 's a dog that belongs to a family in mombasa in kenya last year his owner noticed some blood trickling from his genital region she took him to the vet
and the vet discovered something quite disgusting and if you 're squeamish please look away now he discovered this a huge bleeding tumor at the base of kimbo 's penis
the vet diagnosed this as transmissible venereal tumor a sexually transmitted cancer that affects dogs and just as the tasmanian devil cancer is contagious through the spread of living cancer cells so is this dog cancer
but this dog cancer is quite remarkable because it spread all around the world and in fact these same cells that are affecting kimbo here are also found affecting dogs in new york city
in mountain villages in the himalayas and in outback australia
we also believe this cancer might be very old in fact genetic profiling tells that it may be tens of thousands of years old which means that this cancer may have first arisen from the cells of a wolf that lived alongside the neanderthals
this cancer is remarkable it 's the oldest mammalian derived life form that we know of
it 's a living relic
of the distant past so we 've seen that this can happen in animals could cancers be contagious between people
well this is a question which fascinated chester southam a cancer doctor in the one thousand nine hundred and fifty s ad he decided to put this to the test
and this is a photograph of dr southam in one thousand nine hundred and fifty seven injecting cancer into a volunteer who in this case was an inmate in ohio state penitentiary what this tells us
ethical issues aside is that
it 's probably extremely rare for cancers to be transferred
between people however under some circumstances it can happen
and i think that this is something that oncologists and epidemiologists should be aware of in the future
so just finally cancer is an inevitable outcome of the ability of our cells to divide and to adapt to their environments but that does not mean that we should give up hope in the fight against cancer
in fact i believe given more knowledge of the complex evolutionary processes that drive cancer 's growth we can defeat cancer my personal aim is to defeat the tasmanian devil cancer 's familiar with cancer
