so unlike traditional magic it uses the power of words linguistic deception non verbal communication and various other techniques to create the illusion of a sixth sense
ok clap them together once ok reverse your hands follow my actions exactly
about half the audience has their left hand up why is that
ok swap them around put your right hand up
ok now cross your hands over so your right hand goes over interlace your fingers like this then make sure your right thumb is outside your left thumb that's very important yours is the other way around so swap it around
all right tap them together once
now if you did not allow me to deceive your minds you would all be able to do this
easy it is for me to manipulate the human mind once you know how
now i remember when i was about fifteen i read a copy of life magazine which detailed a story about a seventy five year old blind russian woman
who could sense printed letters there's still people trying to do it here
who could sense printed letters
you know if you actually think about it if somebody is totally blind a guy yesterday did a demonstration in one of the rooms where people had to close their eyes and they could just hear things
really weird thing to try and figure out how could somebody read using their fingertips now earlier on as part of a tv show that i have coming up on mtv i attempted to give a similar demonstration of what is now known as second sight
two days ago we were going to film this down there at the race course and we got a guy into a car and we got a camera man in the back but halfway through the drive he told me he had a i think it was a nine millimeter or something stuck to his leg so i stopped pretty quick and that was it
so do you believe it's possible to see through somebody else's eyes that's the question now most people here would automatically say no ok but i want you to realize some facts i couldn't see through the blindfold
all right but because your brains are not trained in the art of deception
the solutions you come up with will ninety nine percent of the time be way off the mark
this is because magic is all about directing attention
if for instance i didn't want you to look at my right hand well then i don't look at it but if i wanted you to look at my right hand then i look at it too the
closer a little bit closer ok a little bit closer come over they look really nervous in witchcraft
in witchcraft go bump in the
next no ok i want you to just stand exactly like this for me pull up your sleeves if you don't mind
and don't open your eyes until i ask you from this point onwards close your eyes do not say anything do not open them be aware of the sensations
ok keep it there be aware of the sensations don't say anything don't open your eyes ok there
ok excellent open your eyes i never touched you i just touched his back
yeah i walk around nightclubs all night like this
over here for a second i'm going to use you again in a moment and can you take a seat right over here for me if you don't mind sit right here
i want you to do is look directly at me ok just take a deep breath in through your nose letting
and relax allow your eyes to close on five four three two one close your eyes right now ok now i'm not hypnotizing you i'm merely placing you in a heightened state of
our minds are along the same lines
and as you sink and drift and float into this relaxed state of mind
take your left hand and just place it up here and i want you to hold it there just for a moment and i only want you to allow your hand to sink and drift and float back to the
at the same rate and speed as you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness and allow it to go all the way down to the
that's it all the way down all the way down all the way down
and further and further and further and further and further and further
ok now allow it to stay there
was wonderfully done let 's try it again
only when you want the pressure to be released make an upward gesture like this but only when you want the pressure to be released you can wait as long as you want
but only when you want the pressure
ok let 's try it again ok now imagine the connection
that time excellent and hold it there hold it there both of you hold it there only when you want the pressure to go back make a downward gesture you can wait as long as
on five four three two one open your eyes wide awake give them a round of applause
i once saw a film called the gods are crazy has anybody here seen that film yeah yeah yeah do you remember when they threw the coke bottle out of the airplane and it landed on the ground and it didn't break
see that's because coke bottles
it's nearly impossible to break not taking any chances
you see psychokinesis is the paranormal influence of the mind on physical events and processes
for some magicians or mentalists sometimes the spoon will bend or melt sometimes it will not sometimes the object will slide across the table sometimes it will not
excellent now have a look at the coke bottle make sure it is solid there's only one hole
all the negative energy from that broken relationship from that guy being imparted into the broken piece of glass which will represent him ok
i want you to take this very seriously stare at the glass ignore everybody right here in a moment you'll feel a certain sensation ok
and when you feel that sensation i want you to drop the piece of glass into the bottle think of that guy that ba that
trying to be good here ok and when you feel the sensation it might take a while drop it into the glass
was a lot of negative energy
it should be a male victim that's the only thing
i was going to use you for this but i decided i might want to come back another year ca well
ok steve i want you to take a seat right behind here
go ahead i've no fancy assistants underneath there
they just they insist that because i was a magician put a nice black tablecloth on
i've got four wooden plinths here steve one two three and four now they're all the exact same except this one obviously has a stainless steel spike sticking out of it i want you to examine it and make sure ok
now steve i'm going to stand in front of the table ok when i stand in front of the table i want you to put the cups on the plinths like this in any order you want and then mix them all up so nobody has any idea where the spike well hidden now
well hidden now we've
so all right we'll leave them like that
you know where the spike is but nobody else does correct but i don't want you to know either
my hand is at life here so at risk there
i go this way is there another cup over here
ok give me both hands
you think the spike is under your left hand or under your right hand but if you
your right hand now remember you made all the decisions all along psychologists figure this out
