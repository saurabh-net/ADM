i am a papercutter is very straightforward
i take a piece of paper i visualize my story sometimes i sketch sometimes i don 't
i see it more as a spiral
i was not born with a blade in my hand and i don 't remember papercutting as a child
as a teenager i was sketching drawing and i wanted to be an artist but i was also a rebel and i left everything and went for a long series of odd jobs so among them one year in egypt
i moved for two years in taiwan and then i settled in new york where i became a tour guide
and i still worked as a tour leader traveled back and forth in china tibet and central asia so of course it took time and i was nearly forty and i decided it 's time to start as an artist applause i
because graphically it 's very efficient and it 's also
and people told me like these thirty six views of the empire state building they told me you 're making artist books
so artist books have a lot of definitions they come in a lot of different shapes but to me they are fascinating objects to visually narrate a story
they can be with words or without words
and my daily language is english so i did a series of work
so this spider goes through the whole alphabet with identical adjectives and substantives so if you don 't know one of these languages it 's instant learning
and one ancient form of the book is scrolls so scrolls are very convenient
because you can create a large image on a very small table
so the unexpected consequences of that is that you only see one part of your image so it makes a very freestyle architecture
and i 'm making all those kinds of windows so it 's to look beyond the surface it 's to have a look at different worlds and very often i 've been an outsider so i want to see how things work and what 's happening so each window
it 's all if so what if we were
living in balloon houses it would make a very uplifting world
and we would leave a very low footprint on the planet
it would be so light so
it 's a global view to see our common roots
and how we can use them to catch dreams and we can use them also as a safety net and my inspirations
my inspirations are very eclectic
here it 's candycity it 's a non sugar coated history of sugar
with some sweet moments in between
and sometimes i have an emotional response to news such as the two thousand and ten haitian earthquake
and i create a mindscape
i channel their history so that they have a place to go back to look at their life
mad growth on columbus circle a web of time
a web of time daily battles
and at one point i had to do the whole nine yards so it 's actually a papercut that 's nine yards long
i was also interested in the physicality of this format because you have to walk to see it
it 's just the training to become a long distance papercutter
here is a three week papercutting marathon at the museum of arts and design in new york city the result is hells and heavens it 's two panels thirteen ft high they were installed in the museum on
and against all odds they make it to heavens other people make the opposite trip that 's the border you have sweatshops in hells you have people renting their wings in the heavens
and then you have all those individual stories where sometimes we even have the same action and the result puts you in hells or in heavens so the whole hells and heavens is about free
here it 's an artist book installation called identity project
it 's not autobiographical identities they are more our social identities and then you can just walk behind them and try them on so it 's like the different layers of what we are made of
and what we present to the world as an identity that 's another artist book project in fact in the picture you have two of them it 's one i 'm wearing and one that 's on exhibition at the center for books arts in new york city
why do i call it a book
and also because the definition of artist book is very generous so artist books you take them off the wall you take them for a walk you can also install them as public art
here it 's in scottsdale arizona and it 's called floating memories so it 's regional memories
and they are just randomly moved by the wind i love public art
i made an artist book
that 's in stainless steel instead of paper i called it working in the same direction but i added weathervanes on both sides to show that they cover all directions
so for the subway in new york i saw a correspondence between riding the subway and reading it is travel in time travel on time and bronx literature it 's all about bronx writers and their stories
for the ohlone indian civilization then
and on the branches you have
library material growing you can also have
function and form with public art
so in aurora colorado it 's a bench but you have a bonus with this bench because if you sit a long time in summer in shorts you will walk away
it 's a story about transformation and connections so it acts as a screen to protect the rail and the commuter and not to have objects falling on the rails to be able to change fences and window guards
into flowers it 's fantastic
and here i 've been working for the last three years with a south bronx developer
to bring art to life to low income buildings and affordable housing so each building has its own personality
i created all around town it is a papercutting and then after i added color on the computer so i can call it techno crafted and along the way
i don 't know the stories i take images from our global imagination from cliche from things we are thinking about from history
and everybody 's a narrator because everybody has a story to tell but more important is everybody has to make a story to make sense of the world
and in all these universes it 's like imagination is the vehicle to be transported with but the destination is our minds
and how we can reconnect with the essential and with the magic i am a papercutter
