let 's not forget it 's a functional entity we have strong skull bones that protect the most important organ in our body the brain it 's where our senses are located our special senses our vision our speech our hearing our smell our taste and
this bone is peppered as you can see with the light shining through the skull with cavities the sinuses which warm and moisten the air we breathe but also imagine if they were filled with solid bone our head would be dead weight we wouldn 't be able to hold it erect we wouldn 't be able to look at the world around us
this woman is slowly dying because the benign tumors in her facial bones have completely obliterated her mouth and her nose so she can 't breathe and eat attached
to the facial bones that define our face 's structure
which is a hugely complex three dimensional structure taking right angled bends here and there having thin areas like the eyelids thick areas like the cheek different colors and then we have the sensual factor of the face where do we like to kiss people on the lips
but let 's not forget the hair you 're looking at the image on your left hand side that 's my son with his eyebrows present look how odd he looks with the eyebrows missing there 's a definite difference and imagine if he had hair sprouting from the middle of his nose he 'd look even odder still
dysmorphophobia is an extreme version of the fact that we don 't see ourselves as others see us it 's a shocking truth
dysmorphophobia is a perversion of this where people who may be very good looking regard themselves as hideously ugly and are constantly seeking surgery to correct their facial appearance
they don 't need this they need psychiatric help max has kindly donated his photograph to me he doesn 't have dysmorphophobia but i 'm using his photograph to illustrate the fact that he looks exactly like a dysmorphophobic in other words he looks entirely normal
age is another thing when our attitude toward our appearance changes so children
judge themselves learn to judge themselves by the behavior of adults around them
here 's a classic example rebecca has a benign blood vessel tumor that 's growing out through her skull has obliterated her nose and she 's having difficulty seeing as you can see it 's blocking her vision she 's also in danger when she damages this of bleeding profusely our research has shown that the parents
and close loved ones of these children adore them they 've grown used to their face they think they 're special
actually sometimes the parents argue about whether these children should have the lesion removed and occasionally they suffer intense grief reactions because the child they 've grown to love has changed so dramatically and they don 't recognize them but other adults
after surgery everything normalizes the adults behave more naturally and the children play more readily with other children as teenagers
just think back to your teenage years we 're going through a dramatic and often disproportionate change in our facial appearance
we 're trying to struggle to find our identity we crave the approval of our peers so our facial appearance is vital to us as we 're trying to project ourselves to the world just remember that single acne spot that crippled you for several days
how long did you spend looking in the mirror every day practicing your sardonic look practicing your serious look trying to look like sean connery as i did trying to raise one eyebrow
