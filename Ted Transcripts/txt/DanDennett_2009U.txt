going around the world giving talks about darwin and usually what i a m talking about is darwin a s strange inversion of reasoning
now that title that phrase comes from a critic an early critic and this is a passage that i just love and would like to read for you
in the theory with which we have to deal absolute ignorance is the artificer so that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system that in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine it is not requisite to know how to make it
this proposition will be found on careful examination to express in condensed form the essential purport of the theory
to express in a few words all mister darwin a s meaning who by a strange inversion of reasoning
seems to think absolute ignorance fully qualified to take the place of absolute wisdom in the achievements of creative skill exactly
exactly and it is a strange inversion a creationist
test two do you know of any building that didn a t have a builder yes no do you know of any painting that didn a t have a painter
yes no do you know of any car that didn a t have a maker yes no if you answered yes for any of the above give details
i mean it really is a strange inversion of reasoning
you would have thought it stands to reason that design requires an intelligent designer
but darwin shows that it a s just false today though i a m going to talk about darwin a s other strange inversion which is equally puzzling at first
it stands to reason that we love chocolate cake because it is sweet
guys go for girls like this because they are sexy
we adore babies because they a re so cute
and of course we are amused by jokes because they are this is all backwards
darwin shows us why let a s start with sweet our sweet tooth
is basically an evolved sugar detector because sugar is high energy and it a s just been wired up to the preferer to put it very crudely
and that a s why we like sugar honey is sweet because we like it not we like it because
we like it because about honey if you
glucose molecules till you were blind you wouldn a t see why they tasted sweet
you have to look in our brains to understand why
the other way round sweetness was born with the wiring
which evolved and there a s nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies and it a s a good thing
that there isn a t because of there were then mother nature would have a problem
how on earth do you get chimps to
that would be one way of doing it but there a s a quicker way
the chimps up to love that look and apparently they do
over six million years we and the chimps evolved our different ways we became bald bodied
oddly enough for one reason or another they didn a t if we hadn a t then probably this would be the height of sexiness our sweet tooth
is an evolved and instinctual preference for high energy food it wasn a t designed for chocolate cake chocolate cake is a supernormal stimulus
the term is owed to niko tinbergen who did his famous experiments with gulls where he found that that orange spot on the gull a s beak if he made a bigger oranger spot the gull chicks would peck at it even harder
wiring and there are lots of supernormal stimuli chocolate cake is one there's lots of supernormal stimuli for sexiness and there's even supernormal
for cuteness here a s a pretty good example it a s important that we love babies and that we not be put off by say messy diapers
so babies have to attract our affection and our nurturing and they do and by the way a recent study shows that mothers prefer the smell of the dirty diapers of their own baby
so nature works on many levels here but now if babies didn a t look the way they do if babies looked like this
what we would find adorable that a s what we would find we would think oh my goodness do i ever want to hug that
this is the strange inversion
well now finally what about
my answer is it a s the same story the same story this is the hard one the one that isn a t obvious that a s why i leave it to the end and i won a t be able to say too much about it
but you have to think evolutionarily you have to think what hard job that has to be done it a s dirty work somebody a s got to do it is so important
to give us such a powerful inbuilt reward for it when we succeed
now i think we've found the answer i and a few of my colleagues it a s a neural system that a s wired up
to reward the brain for doing a grubby clerical job our bumper sticker for this
as a sort of neuroscientific probe by switching humor on and off by turning the knob on a joke now it a s not funny oh now it a s funnier
the functional architecture of the brain matthew hurley is the first author of this we call it the hurley model he a s a computer scientist reginald adams a psychologist and there i am and we a re putting this together into a book thank you very much
