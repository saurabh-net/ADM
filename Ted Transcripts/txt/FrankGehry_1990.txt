go right into the slides and all i'm going to try and prove to you with these slides is that
my ideas are in my head anyway they're very logical and relate to what's going on and problem solving for clients
either convince clients at the end that i solve their problems or i really do solve their problems because usually they seem to like it let me go right into
the slides can you turn off
i like to be in the dark i don't want you to see what i'm doing
anyway i did this house in santa monica and it got a lot of notoriety in fact
it appeared in a porno
which is the slide on the right
is in venice i just show it because i want you to know i'm concerned about context on the left hand side
i had the context of those little houses and i tried to build a building that fit into that context when people take pictures of these buildings out of that context they look really weird
then once i deal with the context i then try to make a place that's comfortable and private and fairly serene as i hope you'll find that slide on the right
and then i did a law school for
loyola in downtown l a
i was concerned about making a place for the study of law
and we continue to work with this client the building
right at the top is now under construction the garage on the right the gray structure will be torn down finally and several small classrooms will be placed along this
avenue that we've created this campus
and it all related to the clients and the students from the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place they wanted a sense of place
so the whole idea here was to create kind of space
was difficult to fit into and it was my theory or my point of view that one didn't
upstage the neighborhood one made accommodations i tried to be inclusive to include the buildings in the neighborhood whether they were buildings i liked or not
made flooring walls and everything out of cardboard
and the success of it threw me for a loop
i couldn't deal with the success of furniture i wasn't secure enough as an architect and so i closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like
after we failed i just kept failing
piece on the left and that ultimately led to the piece on the right happened
when the kid that was working on this took one of those long strings of stuff and folded it up to put it in the wastebasket
and i put a piece of tape around it as you see there and realized you could sit on it and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on so
it was an accidental discovery i got into fish
i mean the story i tell is that i got mad at postmodernism at pomo and
said that fish were five hundred million years earlier than man
and if you're going to go back we might as well go back to the beginning and so making these funny
and they started to have a life of their own
and got bigger as the one glass at the walker and then
i sliced off the head and the tail and everything and tried to translate what i was learning about the form
fish and the movement and a lot of my architectural ideas that came from it accidental again
an intuitive kind of thing and i just kept going with it and made this proposal for a building which was only a proposal
i did this building in japan i was taken
out to dinner after the contract for this little restaurant was signed and i love sake and kobe and all that stuff
and after i got i was really
i was asked to do some sketches on
and i made some sketches on napkins little boxes and morandi like things that i used to do and the client said why no fish and so i made a drawing with a fish
japan three weeks later i received a complete set of drawings saying we'd won the competition to
oldenburg who i work with a little once in a while told me i couldn't do it and so that
but he was right i couldn't do the tail i started to get the head ok but the tail i
the thing on the right is a snake form a ziggurat and i put them together and you walk between them it was a dialog with the context again now if you saw a picture of this as it was
record they didn't show the context so you would think god what a pushy guy this is but a friend of mine spent four hours wandering around here looking for this restaurant couldn't find it so
as for craft and technology and all those things that you've all been talking about i was thrown for a complete loop this was built in six months the way we sent drawings to
we used the magic computer in michigan that does carved models and we used to make foam models which that thing scanned we made the drawings of fish and scales
building in l a for reasons want
want delayed toxic
so we built a temporary building i'm getting good
there is a story it's a real story about my grandmother buying a carp on thursday bringing it home 's
and i made a pedestal for a sculpture and he didn't buy a sculpture so i made one i went around
people like oldenburg we've been friends for a long
things a few years ago we did a performance piece in venice italy
and they were claes 's assistants in the play he was the swiss army knife
i get credit for participating in and i can tell you it's totally an oldenburg i had nothing to do with it the only thing i did was i made it possible for them to turn those blades
with things like chain link fencing i do it because it's a curious thing in the culture when things are made in such great quantities absorbed in such great quantities and
people hate it and i'm fascinated with that which like the paper furniture it's one of those materials and and
and the loyola law school
trying to collide our ideas to put objects next to each other like a morandi like the little bottles composing them like a still life and it seemed to work as a way to
sent me the first model of the real proposal it made my building
and it was this interaction between that kind of up the ante stuff that became pretty interesting it led to the building on the left
and i still think the time magazine picture will be of the binoculars the
want i'll use the craft i can get
and there were plenty of models for that in rauschenberg and jasper johns and many artists who were making beautiful
with junk materials i went into the metal because it was a way of building a building
was a sculpture and it was all of one material and the metal could go on
and canada in washington and i did it on the condition that they become my partners in the future and help me with all future metal buildings et cetera et cetera and it's working very well to have these
miller has this philosophy of having a place a people
thing to say but it is real that they wanted to have a central place where the cafeteria would be where the people would come and where the people working would interact
so it's out in the middle of nowhere and you approach it it's copper and galvanize and i used the galvanize and copper in a very
gauge so it would buckle
undoing richard meier 's aesthetic
they would let stanley do a cameo piece with me because these were ideas that we were talking about building
things next to each other making it's all about metaphor for a city
and so stanley did the little dome thing and we did it over the phone and
show me something he'd made a building he
building but he put some funny details on it and he moved it closer to my building and so i decided to put him in a
back and forth over a couple of weeks period and he put these two bridges with pink guard rails on it and so then i put this big billboard behind
we had that old building on the left it was a very prominent building off the freeway and we added a floor
it up and fixed it up and used the kind of i thought the language of the neighborhood which
these cornices projecting cornices mine got a little exuberant
lead copper which is a beautiful material
turns green in one hundred years instead of like copper in ten or fifteen
we redid the side of the building and reproportioned the windows so it sort of fit into the space and it surprised both boston and myself that we got it approved because they have very strict kind of design guideline
and they wouldn't normally think
the detailing was very careful with the lead copper and
and then more metal and some chain link in santa monica a little shopping center
and this is a laser laboratory at the university
in which the fish comes back
the support labs which by
and so it was an opportunity that i seized because i didn't have to have any protruding ducts or vents or things in this form it small house
house along the stream dammed it up to make a lake these are the models
the workmanship is pretty bad
and it reminded me why i play defensively in things like my house when you have to do something really cheaply
it's hard to get perfect corners
and in it is you go downstairs into the living room and
i thought it was fitting for me to be doing
this is a house next to a philip johnson house in minnesota
didn't recommend me by the way we
ended up having to make it a sculpture because the dilemma was how do you build a building that doesn't look like the language is it going to look like this beautiful
the idea and so we finally ended up making it these people are art collectors and we finally made it so it appears very sculptural from
all the windows are on the
and the building is very sculptural as you walk around
it's made of metal and the brown stuff is fin ply it's that formed lumber from finland we used it at loyola on the chapel and it didn't work
in cleveland there's burnham mall
on the left it's never been finished going out to the lake you can see all
and we had the opportunity to build a building on this site there's a railroad track this is the city hall
city hall and the courthouse
center line of the mall goes out burnham had designed a railroad station that was never built and so we followed sohio
axis here and we followed the axis and they're two kind of goalposts and this is our building which is a
we collaborated with oldenburg and put the newspaper on top folded
the garage with a c clamp for
it would start to work with the scale of the new buildings by pelli and kohn pederson fox et cetera that are underway
it's hard to do high rise i feel much more comfortable down here this is a piece of property in brentwood
a long time ago about eighty two or something after my house
house for myself that would be a village of several pavilions around a courtyard and the
owner of this lot worked for me and built that actual model on the left and she came back i guess wealthier or something something
following that basic idea of the village
changed it as we got into it i locked the house into the site by cutting the back end here you see on the photographs of
slicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms like a retaining wall creating a lower level
for the master bedroom which i designed like a kind of a barge looking like a boat and
the dome was a request from the client she wanted a dome somewhere in the house she didn't care where
when you sleep in this bedroom i hope i mean i haven't slept in offered to
when you're in that room you feel like you're on a kind of barge on some kind of lake and it's very private the landscape is being built
private garden and then up above there's a garden on this side of the living room and one on the other side
these aren't focused very well
do it from here focus the one on the right
anyway you enter into a garden with a beautiful grove of trees that's the living room
servants quarters a guest bedroom which has this dome with marble on it and then you enter into the living room and then
in this space with windows looking out onto the
things were designed to give foreground and to create a greater depth in this shallow lot
the material is lead copper like in the building
and so it was an intent to make this small piece of land it's one hundred by two hundred and fifty into a kind of
by separating these areas and making the living room and dining room into this pavilion with a high space
in it and this happened by accident that i got this right on
like i got a baldessari
free but the idea is the windows are all placed so you see pieces of the house this is for
michael eisner disney we're doing some work for him and this is in anaheim california
and it's a freeway building you go under this bridge at about sixty five miles an hour and there's another bridge here and you're through this room
second and the building will sort of reflect that on the back side it's much more humane entrance dining hall et cetera and then this
thing here i'm hoping as you drive by
picket fence effect of the sound
i'm doing a building in switzerland basel which is an office building for a furniture company
we struggled with the image these are the early studies but they have to sell furniture to normal people so if i did the building and it was too fancy then people might say well the furniture looks ok in his thing
normal building so we've made a kind of pragmatic slab in the second phase here and we've taken the conference facilities
so that the communal space is very sculptural and separate and you're looking at it from the offices and this is in paris
the gare de lyon over here the minister of finance the guy that moved from the louvre goes in here there's a new library across the
river and back in here in this already treed park we're doing a very dense
it's a very dense program bookstores
in a very tight small this is the ground level and the french
a beautiful site and cutting the corner off they call it the
get around the corner these are the models for it i showed you the other model the one
this is the way i organized myself so i could make the drawing
so i understood the problem i was trying to get around this plan coupe how do you do it apartments et cetera and these are the kind
but out of it came finally this resolution where the elevator piece
worked frontally to this parallel to this street and also parallel to here and then this kind of twist with this balcony and
her skirt to let me into the foyer the restaurants here the apartments and the theater et cetera so it would all be built in stone
it faces into a park and the idea was
on the side facing the street it's much more normal
so that coming on the point these housing units made a gesture
any of you guys have any ideas for it please contact me i don't know what to
and he hired me to do a house for him in the hamptons and it's got a fish and i
is going to be the last fish it's like a drug addict i say i'm not going to do it
i'm not going to do it and then i do it
but it's the living room and this piece here
is i don't know what it is i just added it so that we'd have enough money in the budget so we could take
this is eurodisney and i've worked with all of the guys that presented to you earlier we've had a lot of fun working together i think
from mars for them and they are for me but somehow we all manage to work together and i think productively so far
this is a shopping thing you come into the magic kingdom
and the hotel that tony baxter
and then this is a kind of a shopping mall
another restaurant what i did because of the paris skies being quite dull i made a light grid
that's perpendicular to the train station to the route of the train it looks like it's kind of been there and then
all these simpler forms into it the light grid will have a light be lit up at night and give a kind of light ceiling
in switzerland germany actually on the rhine across from basel
a furniture factory and a furniture museum and i tried to there's a nick grimshaw building over here there's an oldenburg sculpture over here i tried to make
a relationship urbanistically and i don't gave good slides to show it's just been completed but this piece here is this building and these pieces here and here and as
by it's always part you see it as all of these pieces accrue and become part of an overall
you wonder if this is a museum what it's going to be like inside
on the outside it does scream out at you
actually basically three square rooms with a couple of skylights and stuff and from the building in the back you see it as an iceberg floating by
see that skylight goes down and becomes that one so
this is the disney hall the concert hall it's a complicated project it has
chamber hall it's related to an existing chandler pavilion that was built with a lot of love and
caring and it's not a great building but i approached it optimistically that we would make a
the plan of this it's a concert hall this is the foyer which is kind of a garden structure there's commercial at the ground floor these are offices which really in the competition we didn't have to design but finally
chandler composing these elevations together and relating them to the buildings that
the acoustician in the competition gave us criteria which led to
scheme which we found out after the competition would not work at all
these forms and liked the space and so that's one of the problems of a competition you have to then try and
get that back in some way we studied
many models this was our original model these were the three
buildings that were the ideal the concertgebouw boston and berlin everybody liked the surround actually this is the smallest hall in size and it has more seats than
because it has double balconies our client doesn't want balconies so and when we met our new
we finally settled on a shape that was the proportion of the concertgebouw with the sloping outside walls which
our idea is to make the seating carriage very sculptural and out of wood and like a big boat sitting in this plaster room that's the idea
the corners would have skylights
these columns would be structural and the nice thing about introducing columns is they give you
from wherever you sit and create intimacy now this is not a
on the way to being and so i wouldn't take it literally except the feeling of
we studied the acoustics with laser
stuff and they bounce them off this and see where it all works but you get the sense of the hall in section
most halls come straight down into a proscenium in this case we're opening it back up
and getting skylights in the four corners and so it will be quite a different shape
the original building because it was frog
like fit nicely on the site and cranked itself well when you get into a box it's harder to do it and here we are struggling with how to put the hotel in and this is a
but this is how i do work i do take pieces and bits and look at it and struggle with it and cut it away and of course it's not going to look like that but it is the crazy way i tend to
and then finally in l a
larry 's putting some water in there and it works much better than a fish in barcelona i was asked to do a fish and we're working on
at the foot of ritz carlton tower being done by skidmore owings and merrill and the ritz carlton tower is being designed with exposed steel non fire
much like those old gas tanks and so we took the language of this exposed steel and used it perverted it into the form of the
created a kind of a nineteenth century contraption that looks like that will sit this is the beach and the harbor out in front and this is really a shopping center with department stores and we split these bridges
originally this was all solid with a hole in
several bridges and created a kind of foreground
to the hotel people the other day
terrified and said that nobody because of this fish
finally i just threw these in lou danziger i
sadly for sale time goes on
and this is my son working with me
fast food thing he designed the robot as the cashier and the head moves and i did the rest of it and the food wasn't as good as the
should have been the other way around the food should have been good first it didn't work thank you very much
