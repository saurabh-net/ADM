so basically it all began with this whole idea of a computer who has a computer
yeah ok so everyone has a computer even a mobile phone it's a computer and anyone remember this workbook
this was how computing began don't forget a computer came out it had no software
buy that thing you'd bring it home you'd plug it in and it would do absolutely nothing at all so you had to program it and there were great programming like tutorials like this i mean
this was great it 's like you know herbie the apple ii it's such a great way to i mean they should make java books like this and we've have no
and you see this era coincided with my own childhood i grew up in a tofu factory in seattle
who of you grew up in a family business suffered the torture yes yes the torture was good wasn't it good torture it was just life changing you know and so in my life you know i was in the tofu it was a
he would invent like ways to make things heavy like back here there's like concrete block technology here and he would need the concrete blocks to press the

time when a guy who kind of could cross the two sides it was a good time
so i remember that my first major piece of software was on a direct copy of then aldus pagemaker i made a desktop
and the problem when you're younger for all you students out there is your head gets kind of big really easy and when i was making icons i was like
