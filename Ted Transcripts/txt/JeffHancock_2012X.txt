it has been a fantastic month for deception
and i 'm not even talking about the american presidential race laughter we have a high profile journalist caught for plagiarism a young superstar writer whose book involves so many made up quotes that they 've pulled it from the shelves a new york times expose on fake book reviews it 's been fantastic
now of course not all deception hits the news
much of the deception is everyday in fact a lot of research shows that we all lie once or twice a day as dave suggested
so it 's about six thirty now suggests that most of us should have lied let 's take a look at winnipeg how many of you in the last twenty four hours think back have told a little fib or a big one how many have told a little lie out there all right good these are all the liars make sure you pay attention to them
it 's this pervasiveness combined with the centrality to what it means to be a human the fact that we can tell the truth or make something up that has fascinated people throughout history here we have diogenes with his lantern does anybody know what he was looking for
a single honest man and he died without finding one back in greece and we have confucius in the east who was really concerned with sincerity not only that you
walked the walk or talked the talk but that you believed in what you were doing you believed in your principles
now my first professional encounter with deception is a little bit later than these guys a couple thousand years i was a customs officer for canada back in the mid ninety s yeah i was defending canada 's borders you may think that 's a weapon right there in fact that 's
but even since just one thousand nine hundred and ninety five ninety six the way we communicate has been completely transformed we email we text we skype we facebook it 's insane almost every aspect of human communication 's been changed and of course that 's had an impact on deception let me tell you a little bit about a couple of new deceptions we 've been tracking
each of these is about a relationship and this is a twenty four seven connected world once you get my cell phone number you can literally be in touch with me twenty four hours a day
and so these lies are being used by people to create a buffer like the butler used to do between us and the connections to everybody else but they 're very special they use ambiguity that comes from using technology you don 't know where i am or what i 'm doing or who i 'm with and they 're aimed at protecting the relationships these aren 't just people being jerks
these are people that are saying look i don 't want to talk to you now or i didn 't want to talk to you then but i still care about you our relationship is still important
now the sock puppet on the other hand is a totally different animal the sock puppet isn 't about ambiguity per se it 's about identity let me give you a very recent example as in like last week
here 's r j ellory best seller author in britain here 's one of his bestselling books here 's a reviewer online on amazon my favorite by nicodemus jones is whatever else it might do it will touch your soul and of course you might suspect
that nicodemus jones is r j ellory he wrote very very positive reviews about himself surprise surprise
now this sock puppet stuff isn 't actually that new
that are paid small amounts of money to produce content it could be reviews it could be propaganda the government hires these people companies hire them all over the place in north america we call this astroturfing
and astroturfing is very common now there 's a lot of concerns about it we see this especially with product reviews book reviews everything from hotels to whether that toaster is a good toaster or not
now looking at these three reviews or these three types of deception you might think
now let 's put aside the online anonymous sex chatrooms which i 'm sure none of you have been in i can assure you there 's deception there and let 's put aside the nigerian prince who 's emailed you about getting the forty three million out of the country laughter let 's forget about that guy too let 's focus on the conversations between our friends and our family and our
coworkers and our loved ones those are the conversations that really matter what does technology do to deception with those folks
here 's a couple of studies one of the studies we do are called diary studies in which we ask people to record all of their conversations and all of their lies for seven days
and what we can do then is calculate how many lies took place per conversation within a medium and the finding that we get that surprises people the most is that email is the most honest of those three media and it really throws people for a loop because we think well there 's no nonverbal cues so why don 't you lie more the phone
what about resumes we did a study in which we had people apply for a job and they could apply for a job either with a traditional paper resume or on linkedin which is a social networking site like facebook but for professionals involves the same information as a resume how about facebook itself
you know we always think that hey there are these idealized versions people are just showing the best things that happened in their lives i 've thought that many times my friends no way they can be that cool and have good of a life well one study tested this by examining people 's personalities they had four good friends of a person
judge their personality then they had strangers many strangers judge the person 's personality just from facebook and what they found was those judgments of the personality were pretty much identical highly correlated meaning that facebook profiles really do reflect our actual personality all right well what
online dating i mean that 's a pretty deceptive space i 'm sure you all have friends that have used online dating
and what we found was very very interesting
here 's an example of the men and the height
along the bottom is how tall they said they were in their profile along the y axis the vertical axis is how tall they actually were that diagonal line is the truth line if their dot 's on it they were telling exactly the truth now as you see most of the little dots are below the line
what it means is all the guys were lying about their height in fact they lied about their height about nine tenths of an inch what we say in the lab as strong rounding up
but what 's really important here is look at all those dots they are clustering pretty close to the truth what we found was eighty percent of our participants did indeed lie on one of those dimensions but they always lied by a little bit
one of the reasons is pretty simple if you go to a date a coffee date and you 're completely different than what you said game over right so people lied frequently but they lied subtly not too much they were constrained
well what explains all these studies what explains the fact
that despite our intuitions mine included
a lot of online communication technologically mediated communication is more honest than face to face that really is strange how do we explain this well to do that one thing is we can look at the deception detection literature
and there 's some really compelling findings the first is we 're really bad at detecting deception really bad fifty four percent accuracy on average when you have to tell if somebody that just said a statement is lying or not
that 's really bad why is it so bad well it has to do with pinocchio 's nose
if i were to ask you guys what do you rely on when you 're looking at somebody and you want to find out if they 're lying what cue do you pay attention to
most of you would say that one of the cues you look at is the eyes the eyes are the window to the soul and you 're not alone around the world almost every culture one of the top cues is eyes but the research over the last fifty years says there 's actually no reliable cue to deception
which blew me away and it 's one of the hard lessons that i learned when i was customs officer the eyes do not tell us whether somebody 's lying or not some situations yes high stakes maybe their pupils dilate their pitch goes up their body movements change a little bit but not all the time not for everybody it 's not reliable strange the other
thing is that just because you can 't see me doesn 't mean i 'm going to lie it 's common sense but one important finding is that we lie for a reason we lie to protect ourselves or for our own gain or for somebody else 's gain
so there are some pathological liars but they make up a tiny portion of the population we lie for a reason just because people can 't see us doesn 't mean we 're going to necessarily lie
but i think there 's actually something much more interesting and fundamental going on here the next big thing for me the next big idea
saber toothed tigers i don 't know what they talked about but they were doing a lot of talking and like i said there 's a lot of humans evolving speaking about one hundred billion people in fact
what 's important though is that writing only emerged about five thousand years ago so what that means is that all the people before
there was any writing every word that they ever said every utterance disappeared no trace evanescent gone so we 've been evolving to talk in a way in which there is no record
in fact even the next big change to writing was only five hundred years ago now with the printing press which is very recent in our past and literacy rates remained incredibly low right up until world war ii so even the people of the last two millennia most of the words
they ever said poof disappeared let 's turn to now the networked age how many of you have recorded something today anybody do any writing today did anybody write a word
it looks like almost every single person here recorded something in this room right now we 've probably recorded more than almost all of human pre ancient history
that is crazy we 're entering this amazing period of flux in human evolution where we 've evolved to speak in a way in which our words disappear but we 're in an environment where we 're recording everything in fact i think in the very near future
what does that mean what 's the next big idea from that well as a social scientist this is the most amazing thing i have ever even dreamed of now i can look at all those words that used to for millennia disappear i can look at lies that before were said and then gone
well when they write a fake review they have to post it somewhere and it 's left behind for us so one thing that we did and i 'll give you an example of looking at the language is we paid people to write some fake reviews one of these reviews is fake the person never was at the james hotel the other review is real the person stayed there
now your task now is to decide
which review is fake i 'll give you a moment to read through them
all right how many of you believe that a is the fake
here 's the answer b is a fake
well done second group you dominated the first
those cold hard winters i love it all right so why do i care about this well what i can do now with my colleagues in computer science
is we can create computer algorithms that can analyze the linguistic traces of deception let me highlight a couple of things here in the fake review the first is that liars tend to think about narrative they make up a story who and what happened and that 's what happened here our fake reviewers talked about who they were with and what they were doing
they also used the first person singular i way more than the people that actually stayed there they were inserting themselves into the
now you guys did pretty well most people perform at chance at this task
our computer algorithm is very accurate much more accurate than humans can be and it 's not going to be accurate all the time this isn 't a deception detection machine to tell if your girlfriend 's lying to you on text messaging
we believe that every lie now every type of lie fake hotel reviews fake shoe reviews your girlfriend cheating on you with text messaging those are all different lies they 're going to have different patterns of language
but because everything 's recorded now we can look at all of those kinds of lies
now as i said as a social scientist this is
wonderful it 's transformational we 're going to be able to learn so much more about human thought and expression about everything from love to attitudes because everything is being recorded now but what does it mean for the average citizen what does it mean for us in our lives
i write all the time but i never look at my record at my trace and i think we 're going to see a lot more of that where we can reflect on who we are by looking at what we wrote what we said what we did
now if we bring it back to deception there 's a couple of take away things here first
lying online can be very dangerous right not only are you leaving a record for yourself on your machine but you 're leaving a record on the person that you were lying to and you 're also leaving them around for me to analyze with some computer algorithms so by all means go ahead and do that that 's good
but when it comes to lying and what we want to do with our lives i think we can go back to
and i think this is really important now when you are about to say or do something we can think do i want this to be part of my legacy part of my personal record
because in the digital age we live in now in the networked age
