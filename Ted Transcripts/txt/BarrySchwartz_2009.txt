his inaugural address barack obama appealed
each of us to give our best
as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis but what did he appeal to he did not happily follow in the footsteps of his predecessor and tell us to just go shopping
nor did he tell us trust us trust your country invest invest invest instead what he told us was to put aside childish things
and he appealed to virtue virtue is an old fashioned word it seems a little out of place
in a cutting edge environment like this one and besides some of you might be wondering what the hell does it mean let me begin with an example
this is the job description of a hospital janitor that is scrolling up on the screen and all of the
items on it are unremarkable they're the things you would expect mop the floors sweep them empty the trash restock the cabinets it may be a little surprising
how many things there are but it's not surprising what they are but the one thing i want you to notice about them is
even though this is a very long list there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings not one
the janitor 's job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital and yet
when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like they encountered mike
who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor because mister jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise trying to build up his strength walking slowly up and down the hall
and charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisor 's admonition and didn't vacuum the visitor 's lounge because there were some family members who were there all day every day who at this moment happened to be taking a nap
and then there was luke who washed the floor in a comatose young man 's room twice
and behavior like this from janitors from technicians from nurses and if we're lucky now and then from doctors
doesn't just make people feel a little better it actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well
now not all janitors are like this of course but the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions involving kindness care and empathy are an essential part of the job
and yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings these janitors have the moral will to do right by other people
and beyond this they have the moral skill to figure out what doing right means practical wisdom aristotle told us is the combination of moral will and moral skill
a wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties
in the service of other objectives a wise person knows how to improvise as luke did when he re washed the floor
real world problems are often ambiguous and ill defined and the context is always changing a wise person is like a jazz musician
using the notes on the page but dancing around them inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand
a wise person knows how to use these moral skills in the service of the right aims to serve other people not to manipulate other people
and finally perhaps most important a wise person is made not born wisdom depends on experience
and not just any experience you need the time to get to know the people that you're serving
you need permission to be allowed to improvise try new things occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures and you need to be mentored by wise teachers
when you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones i described how hard it is to learn to do their job they tell you that it takes lots of experience
and they don't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans it takes lots of experience to learn how to care
for people at ted brilliance is rampant it's scary the good news
is you don't need to be brilliant to be wise the bad news is that without wisdom
now i hope that we all know this there's a sense in which it's obvious and yet let me tell you a little story it's a story about lemonade
a dad and his seven year old son were watching a detroit tigers game at the ballpark his son asked him for some lemonade and dad went to the concession stand to buy it
all they had was mike 's hard lemonade which was five percent alcohol dad being an academic had no idea that mike 's hard lemonade
and they were ready to let the kid go but not so fast the wayne county child welfare protection agency said no and the child was sent to a foster home for three days
at that point can the child go home well a judge said yes but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel
after two weeks i'm happy to report the family was reunited but the welfare workers and
the ambulance people and the judge all said the same thing we hate to do it but we have to follow procedure
how do things like this
scott simon who told this story on npr said rules and procedures may be dumb but they spare you from thinking
and to be fair rules are often imposed because previous officials have been lax and they let a child go back to an abusive household fair enough
when things go wrong as of course they do we reach for two tools to try to fix them one tool we reach for is rules better ones more of them
the second tool we reach for is incentives better ones more of them what else after all is there
we can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis regulate regulate regulate fix the incentives fix the incentives fix the incentives the truth is
that neither rules nor incentives are enough to do the job how could you even write a rule that go the janitors to do what they did and would you pay them a bonus for being
it's preposterous on its face
and what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules rules and incentives may make things better in the short run but they create a downward spiral
moral skill is chipped away by an over reliance on rules that deprives us of the opportunity to improvise and learn from our improvisations
and moral will is undermined by an incessant appeal to incentives that destroy our desire to do the right thing
second no doubt more familiar to you is the nature of modern american education scripted lock step curricula
here 's an example from chicago kindergarten reading and enjoying literature and words that begin with b the bath assemble students on a rug and give students a warning about the dangers of hot water say
seventy five items in this script to teach a twenty five page picture book
all over chicago in every kindergarten class in the city every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day
we know why these scripts are there we don't trust the judgment of teachers enough to let them loose on their own
don't get me wrong we need rules jazz musicians need some notes most of them need some notes on the page we need more rules for the bankers god knows
but too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians from improvising and as a result they lose their gifts or worse they stop playing altogether
now how about incentives they seem cleverer if you have one reason for doing something and i give you a second reason
for doing the same thing it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one and you're more likely to do it right
well not always sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another instead of complimenting and they make people less likely to do it i'll just give you one example because time is racing
in switzerland back about fifteen years ago they were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste dumps there was going to be a national referendum
they knew it was dangerous they thought it would reduce their property values but
it had to go somewhere and they had responsibilities as citizens the psychologists asked other people a slightly different question they said if we paid you six weeks salary
every year would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community two reasons it's my responsibility and i'm getting paid instead of fifty percent saying yes twenty five percent said yes
what happens is that the second this introduction of incentive gets us so that instead of asking what is my responsibility all we ask is what serves my interests
when incentives don't work when ceos ignore the long term health of their companies in pursuit of short term gains
that will lead to massive bonuses the response is always the same get smarter incentives
the truth is that there are no incentives that you can devise that are ever going to be smart enough any incentive system can be subverted by bad will
we need incentives people have to make a living but excessive reliance on incentives demoralizes professional activity
in two senses of that word it causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale
and it causes the activity itself to lose morality barack obama said before he was inaugurated we must ask not just is it profitable but is it right
and we certainly see it in the world of business
it is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work so what can we do a few sources of hope we ought to try to re moralize work one way not to do it teach more ethics courses
there is no better way to show people that you're not serious than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course
what to do instead one celebrate moral exemplars acknowledge when you go to law school that a little
don't know how many of you remember this another moral hero fifteen years ago aaron feuerstein who was the head of malden mills in massachussetts they made polartec the factory burned down three thousand employees he kept
go maybe on paper our company is worth less to wall street but i can tell you it's worth more we're doing fine
just at this ted we heard talks from several moral heroes two were particularly inspiring to me one was ray anderson who turned
turned you know a part of the evil empire into a zero footprint or almost zero footprint business why
because it was the right thing to do and a bonus he 's discovering is he 's actually going to make even more money
his employees are inspired by the effort why because there happy to be doing something that's the right thing to do yesterday we heard willie smits talk about
but most important to make it work and he emphasized this is that it took knowing the people in the communities unless the people you're working with
are behind you this will fail and there isn't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you because different people in different communities organize their lives in different ways so there's a lot
here at ted and at other places to celebrate and you don't have to be a mega hero there are ordinary heroes ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too
as practitioners each and everyone of us should strive to be ordinary if not extraordinary heroes as heads of organizations we should strive to create environments that encourage and nurture
both moral skill and moral will even the wisest and most well meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current
in the organizations in which they work if you run an organization you should be sure that none of the jobs none of the jobs have job descriptions like the job descriptions of the janitors
because the truth is that any work that you do that involves interaction with other people is moral work and any moral work depends upon practical wisdom
and perhaps most important as teachers we should strive to be the ordinary heroes the moral exemplars to the people we mentor
and there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers one is that we are always teaching someone is always watching the camera is always on
bill gates talked about the importance of education and in particular the model that kipp was providing
knowledge is power and he talked about a lot of the wonderful things that kipp is doing to take inner city kids and turn them in the direction of college
i want to focus on one particular thing kipp is doing that bill didn't mention that is that they have come to the realization that the single most important thing kids need to learn is character
they need to learn to respect themselves they need to learn to respect their schoolmates they need to learn to respect their teachers and most important they need to learn to respect learning
that's the principle objective if you do that the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill and the teachers the way you teach these things to the kids is by having the teachers and all the other staff
other virtues honesty kindness courage and so on to be displayed at the right time and in the right way he also appealed to hope right again
think there is reason for hope i think people want to be allowed to be virtuous in many ways
it's what ted is all about wanting to do the right thing in the right way for the right reasons
this kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us if only we start paying attention paying attention to what we do
to how we do it and perhaps most importantly to the structure of the organizations in which we work
so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom rather than having it suppressed thank you very much thank you
thank you you
