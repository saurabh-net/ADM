the youngest son he left a ninth of the camels well three sons got into a negotiation seventeen doesn't divide by two
it doesn't divide by three it doesn't divide by nine brotherly tempers started to get strained finally in desperation they went and they
a wise old woman the wise old woman thought about their problem for a long time and finally she came back and said well i don't know if i can help you but at least if you want you can have my camel so then they had eighteen camels
the first son took his half half of eighteen is nine the second son took his third a third of eighteen is six the youngest son took his ninth a ninth of eighteen is two you get seventeen they had one camel left over
they gave it back to the wise old woman
now if you think about that story for a moment i think it resembles
a lot of the difficult negotiations we get involved in they start off like seventeen camels no way to resolve it somehow what we need to do is step back from those situations like that wise old woman look at the situation through fresh eyes and come up with an
now finding that eighteenth camel in the world 's conflicts has been my life passion i basically see humanity a bit like those three brothers we're all one family
we know that scientifically thanks to the communications revolution all the tribes on the planet all fifteen thousand tribes are in touch with each other
and it's a big family reunion and yet like many family reunions it's not all peace and light
and the question is how do we deal with our differences how do we deal with our deepest differences given the human propensity for conflict and the human genius at devising weapons of enormous destruction that's the question
as i've spent the last better part of three decades almost four traveling the world trying to work getting involved in conflicts
ranging from yugoslavia to the middle east to chechnya to venezuela some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet
i've been asking myself that question and i think i've found in some ways what is the secret to peace it's actually surprisingly simple
it's not easy but it's simple it's not even new it may be one of our most ancient human heritages the secret to peace is us
it's us who act as the surrounding community around any conflict who can play a constructive role let me give give you
because after all within living memory they were hunters and gatherers living pretty much like our ancestors lived for maybe ninety nine percent of the human story
and all the men have these poison arrows that they use for hunting absolutely fatal so how do they deal with their differences well what i learned is whenever tempers rise in those communities
someone goes and hides the poison arrows out in the bush and then everyone sits around in a circle like this and they sit and
and they talk it may take two days three days four days but they don't rest until they find a resolution or better yet a reconciliation
and if tempers are still too high then they send someone off to visit some relatives as a cooling off period well that system is i think probably the system that kept us alive to this point given our human tendencies
that system i call the third side because if you think about it normally when we think of conflict when we describe it
there's always two sides it's arabs versus israelis labor versus management husband versus wife republicans versus democrats
but what we don't often see is that there's always a third side and the third side of the conflict is us it's the surrounding community it's the friends the allies the family members the neighbors and we can play an incredibly constructive role
perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to remind the parties of what's really at stake
for the sake of the kids for the sake of the family for the sake of the community for the sake of the future let 's stop fighting for a moment and start talking
because the thing is when we're involved in conflict it's very easy to lose perspective it's very easy to react human beings we're reaction machines
and as the saying goes when angry you will make the best speech you will ever regret
and so the third side reminds us of that the third side helps us go to the balcony which is a metaphor for a place of perspective where we can keep our eyes on the prize
me tell you a little story from my own negotiating experience some years ago i was involved as a facilitator in some very tough talks between the leaders of russia and the leaders of chechnya
there was a war going on as you know and we met in the hague in the peace palace in the same room where the yugoslav war crimes tribunal was taking place
the talks got off to a rather rocky start when the vice president of chechnya began by pointing at the russians and said you should stay right here in your seats because you're going to be on trial for war crimes
and then he went on and then he turned to me and said you 're an american look at what you americans are doing in puerto rico and my mind started racing puerto rico what do i know about puerto rico i started reacting
i tried to remember to go to the balcony and then when he paused and everyone looked at me for a response from a balcony perspective i was able to thank him for his remarks and say
i appreciate your criticism of my country and i take it as a sign that we're among friends and can speak candidly to one another
and what we're here to do is not to talk about puerto rico or the past what we're here to do is to see if we can figure out a way to stop the suffering and the bloodshed in chechnya
the conversation got back on track that's the role of the third side is to help the parties to go to the balcony
now let me take you for a moment to what's widely regarded as the world 's most difficult conflict or the most impossible conflict is the middle east
question is where's the third side there how can we possibly go to the balcony now i
to have an answer to the middle east conflict but i think i've got a first step literally a first step something that any one of us could do as third siders let me just ask you one question first how many of you in the last
years have ever found yourself worrying about the middle east and wondering what anyone could do just out of curiosity how many of you okay so the great majority of us
and here it's so far away why do we pay so much attention to this conflict is it the number of deaths there are a hundred times more people who die in a conflict
in the middle east no it's because of the story because we feel personally involved in that story whether we're christians muslims or jews
yes let 's try and resolve the politics there in the middle east but let 's also take a look at the story let 's try to get at the root of what it's all about
let 's see if we can apply the third side to it what would that mean what is the story there now as anthropologists we know that every culture has an origin story
and the world has never been the same since that man of course was abraham
and what he stood for was unity the unity of the family he 's the father of us all but it's not just what he stood for it's what his message was his basic message was unity too the interconnectedness of it all and the unity of it all
and his basic value was respect was kindness toward strangers that's what he 's known for his hospitality
so in that sense he 's a symbolic third side of the middle east he 's the one who reminds us that we're all part of a greater whole now how would you now think about that for a moment
today we face the scourge of terrorism what is terrorism terrorism is basically taking an innocent stranger and treating them as an enemy whom you kill
in order to create fear what's the opposite of terrorism it's taking an innocent stranger and treating them as a friend
whom you welcome into your home in order to sow and and create understanding or respect or love
so what if then you took the story of abraham which is a third side story what if that could be because abraham stands for hospitality
what if that could be an antidote to terrorism what if that could be a vaccine against religious intolerance how would you bring that story to life now it's not enough just to tell a story
you go for a walk you go for a walk in the footsteps of abraham you retrace the footsteps of abraham
because walking has a real power you know as an anthropologist walking is what made us human it's funny when you walk you walk side by side
in the same common direction now if i were to come to you face to face and come this close to you you would feel threatened
but if i walk shoulder to shoulder even touching shoulders it's no problem who fights while they walk that's why in negotiations often when things get tough
people go for walks in the woods so the idea came to me of what about inspiring
route think the silk route think the appalachian trail that followed in the footsteps of abraham
and we then took a bus and took some walks and went to harran where in the bible he sets off on his journey
then we crossed the border into syria went to aleppo which turns out is named after abraham we went to damascus which has a long history associated with abraham
we then came to northern jordan to jerusalem which is all about abraham to bethlehem
and finally to the place where he 's buried in hebron so effectively we went from womb to tomb we showed it could be done it was an amazing journey
let me ask you a question how many of you have had the experience of being in a strange neighborhood or strange land
and a total stranger perfect stranger comes up to you and shows you some kindness maybe invites you into their home gives you a drink gives you a coffee gives you a meal how many of you have ever had that experience
that's the essence of the abraham path but that's what you discover is you go into these villages in the middle east where you expect hostility and you get the most amazing hospitality all associated with abraham in the name of father abraham let me
offer you some food so what we discovered is that abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people he 's alive he 's a living
an amazing experience men women young people old people more women than men actually interestingly for those who can't walk
who are unable to get there right now people started to organize walks in cities in their own communities in cincinnati for instance that organized a walk from a church to a mosque to a synagogue and all had an abrahamic meal together it was abraham path day
in sao paulo brazil it's become an annual event for thousands of people to run in a virtual abraham path run uniting the different communities the media love it they really adore it they
and just a couple weeks ago there was an npr story on it last month there was a piece
in the guardian in the manchester guardian
about it two whole pages and they quoted a villager who said this walk connects us to the world he said it was like a light that went on in our lives it brought us hope
and so that's what it's about but it's not just about psychology it's about economics because as people walk they spend money
and this woman right here um ahmad is a woman who lives on a path in northern jordan she's desperately poor she's partially blind her husband can't work she's got seven kids
she can do is cook and so she's begun to cook for some groups of walkers who come through the village and have a meal in her home they sit on the floor she doesn't even have a
she makes the most delicious food that's fresh from the herbs in the surrounding countryside and so more and more walkers have come and lately she's begun to earn an income to support her family
and so she told our team there she said you have made me visible in a village where people were once ashamed to look at
that's the potential of the abraham path there are literally hundreds of those kinds of communities across the middle east across the path
the potential is basically to change the game and to change the game you have to change the frame the way we see things to change the frame from
is a game changer let me just show you one thing i have a little acorn here that i picked up while i was walking on the path
earlier this year now the acorn is associated with the oak tree of course grows into an oak tree which is associated with abraham the path right now is like an acorn it's still in its
what would the oak tree look like well i think back to my childhood a good part of which i spent after being born here in chicago i spent in europe
said sixty years from now this is going to be the most peaceful prosperous part of the planet people would have thought you were certifiably insane
but they did it thanks to a common identity europe and a common economy so my question is
if it can be done in europe why not in the middle east why not thanks to a common identity which is the story of abraham and thanks to common economy that would be based in good part on tourism
so let me conclude then by saying that in the last thirty five years as i've worked in some of the most dangerous difficult and intractable conflicts around the planet
i have yet to see one conflict that i felt could not be transformed
it's not easy of course but it's possible it was done in south africa it was done in northern ireland it could be done anywhere it simply depends on us
it depends on us taking the third side so let me invite you to consider taking the third side even as a very small step we're about to take a break in a moment
just go up to someone who 's from a different culture a different country a different ethnicity some difference and engage them in a conversation listen to them
that's a third side act that's walking abraham 's path after a tedtalk why not a tedwalk
so let me just leave you with three things one is the secret to peace is the third side
the third side is us each of us with a single step can take the world can bring the world a step closer to peace
there's an old african proverb that goes when spiderwebs unite they can halt even the lion
if we're able to unite our third side webs of peace we can even halt the lion of war thank you very much
