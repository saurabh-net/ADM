i guess it is a result of globalization that you can find coca cola tins on top of everest and buddhist monk in monterey
and so i just came two days ago from the
and to show the place where
me who began with being a molecular biologist in pasteur institute and found their way to the
so these are a few images i was lucky to take and be there
take and be there in eastern tibet wonderful
this is from marlboro country
this is the hottest day of the year somewhere in eastern tibet on august one st and the night before
we camped and my tibetan friends said we are going to sleep outside
why we have enough space in the
so now we are going to speak of happiness as a frenchman i must say that
a lot of french intellectuals that think happiness is not at all interesting
on happiness and there was a controversy and someone wrote an article saying don't impose on us the dirty work
we don't care about being happy we need to live with passion we like the ups and downs of life we like our suffering because it's so good when it ceases for
this is what i see from the balcony of my
it's about two meters by three and you are all welcome any time
now let 's come to
it seems that no one wakes up in the morning thinking may i which means that somehow
directly or indirectly in the short or the long term
somehow is related to a deep profound desire for
as pascal said even the one who hangs himself somehow
is looking for cessation of
but then if you look in the literature east and west
you can find incredible diversity
only believed in remembering the past imagining the future never the present
some people say happiness is right now it's the quality of the freshness of the present moment and that led to
that would be fine if it was just a secondary preoccupation in life
but now if it is something that is going to
we better know what it is have some
that we don't know that is why so often although we seek happiness it seems we turn our back to it although we want to avoid suffering
one of the most common ones is
happiness and pleasure but if you look at the characteristics of those two chocolate cake
first serving is delicious second one not so much then we
of things we get tired
i used to be a fan of bach i used to play it on the
i can hear it two three five times if i had to hear it twenty four hours non stop very tiring
if you are feeling very cold you come near a fire it's so wonderful
then after some moments you just go a little back and then uses itself
and also again it can also it's something that
it is not something that is radiating outside
like you can feel intense pleasure and some others around you can be suffering
what then will be happiness and happiness of course is such
so let 's say well being
and so i think the best definition according to the not
and all the joys and sorrows that can come one 's way you that might be
in a way why not
you hit the solid rock when you are surfing on the top you are all elated so you go from elation to depression there's no
now if you look at the high sea of the ocean is
to have everything to be happy that very sentence already reveals the doom of destruction of happiness to have everything if we miss something it collapses
and also when things go wrong we try to fix the outside so much look at inner conditions
we know by experience that we can be what we call in little paradise and yet be completely unhappy within
was once in portugal and there was a lot of construction going on everywhere so one evening he said look you are doing all these things but
nice also to build something within and he said unless that
even you get high tech flat on the one hundredth floor of a super modern
if you are deeply unhappy within all you are going to look for is a window from which to so now at the
it's wonderful to live longer
to have access to information education to be able to travel to have freedom
so then when we ask oneself how to nurture the condition for happiness those which will undermine
so then this needs to have some experience
we have to know from ourself there are certain state of mind that are conducive to this flourishing
this well being what the
there are some which are adverse well being
and so if we look from our own experience anger hatred
anger hatred strong grasping
they don't leave us in such a good state after we have experienced it and also they are detrimental to others happiness so we may consider
that the more those are invading our mind and
at the opposite everyone knows deep within
that an act of selfless generosity if from the distance without anyone knowing anything about it
we could save a child 's life such a sense of
to change our way of being to transform one 's mind those
is change possible in our emotions in our traits in our moods
for that we have to ask what is nature
and if we look from the experiential point of
there is a primary quality of consciousness that's just the mere fact to be
is like a mirror that allows all images to rise
you can have ugly faces beautiful faces in the mirror the mirror allows that
the mirror is not tainted is not modified is not altered by those images
the bare consciousness pure awareness tainted intrinsically
hatred or jealousy because then if it was always there like a dye that would permeate the
then it would be found all the time somewhere we know we're not always angry always jealous always
so because the basic fabric of consciousness is this pure cognitive quality that differentiates it from a
there is a possibility for change because all emotions are fleeting that is the ground for mind training
mind training is based on the
want to harm and want to do good you cannot in the same gesture shake
so there are natural antidotes
so that's the way to proceed
a kind of sense of inner freedom
opposite to intense grasping and obsession kindness against hatred
but of course each emotion then would need a particular antidote
another way is to try to find a general antidote to all emotions
and that's by looking at the very nature
usually when we feel annoyed hatred
with someone or obsessed with something
the mind goes again and again to that object each time it goes to the object it reinforces that obsession or that
so what we need to look now is instead of looking outward we
itself it looks very menacing like a billowing monsoon cloud
we think we could sit on the cloud but if you go there
likewise if you look at the thought of
if you do this again and again
so this is the principal of mind training because we
time for all those faults in our mind the tendencies to
so it will take time to unfold them as well way to go
mind transformation that is the meaning
it means familiarization with a new way of being new way of perceiving things which is more an adequation with reality with interdependence with the stream and continuous transformation which our being and our consciousness the last twenty years
thought to be more or less fixed when we reached adult age now recently it has been found that it can change a lot
we heard who has done ten thousand hours of violin practice some area that controls the movements of fingers in the brain
change a lot increasing reinforcement of the synaptic connections so
can we do that with human qualities with loving kindness with patience with openness
so that's what those great meditators have been doing
they do like three years retreat where they do meditate twelve hours a day and then the rest of their life they will do that three or four hours a day they are real olympic champions of mind training
this is the place where the and fifty six electrodes
so what did they find the scientific embargo
has been to submitted to nature hopefully it will be accepted the state of
in a state where there's nothing but loving kindness to
the training we do that with objects we think of people suffering we think of people we love but at some point it can be a state which
already been shown the bell curve shows hundred and fifty controls
and what is being looked at is the difference between the right and the left frontal lobe in very short people who have more activity in the right side of the prefrontal
they don't describe a lot of positive the opposite on
the opposite on more tendency to
to express and curiosity and so forth so there's a basic line for people and also it can be
you see a comic movie you go off to the left side if you are happy about something you'll go more to the left side if you have a bout of depression you'll go to the right side
the zero point five is the full standard
who meditated on compassion it's something that is totally out of
so i've no time to go into all the different scientific results hopefully they
come but they found that this is after three and a half hours in a fmri it's like
also it has been shown in other labs for instance paul ekman 's labs in berkeley that some meditators are able also to control their emotional response more than it could be
guy on a chair with all this kind of apparatus measuring your physiology and there's kind of a bomb that goes off it's so instinctive response that in twenty years they never saw anyone who
some meditators without trying to stop it
open thinking that that bang is just going to be just a small
so the whole point of that
not sort of to make thing of showing exceptional
beings who can jump or whatever it's more to say that mind training matters
that this is not just a luxury this is not a supplementary vitamin for the soul
vitamin for the soul something that's going to
we are ready to spend fifteen years achieving education
we love to do jogging fitness we do all kinds of things to remain beautiful yet we spend surprisingly little of what matters most
we try to do in different places
just this one example is worth a lot of work this lady with bone tb left alone in a tent
going to die with her only daughter
one year later how she is
and just i leave you with the beauty of those
and jumping monks of tibet
