i took this picture about ten blocks from here this is the grand cafe here in oxford
claim to fame and i wanted to show it to you not because i want to give you the kind of starbucks tour of historic england
but rather because the english coffeehouse was crucial to the development and spread of one of the great intellectual flowerings of the last five hundred years what we now call the enlightenment
and the coffeehouse played such a big role in the birth of the enlightenment in part because of what people were drinking there because before the
day in and day out from dawn until dusk was alcohol alcohol was the daytime beverage of choice you would drink a little beer with breakfast and have a little wine at lunch a little gin
so effectively until the rise of the coffeehouse you had an entire population that was effectively drunk all day and you can imagine what that would be like right in your own life and i know this is true of some of you if you were drinking all day and
then you switched from a depressant to a stimulant in your life you would have better ideas you would be sharper and more alert and so
it's not an accident that a great flowering of innovation happened as england switched to tea and coffee but the other thing that makes
is the architecture of the space it was a space where people would get together from different backgrounds different fields of expertise
and share it was a space as matt ridley talked about where ideas could have sex this was their conjugal bed in a sense ideas would get together there and an astonishing number of innovations from this period have a coffeehouse somewhere in their story
i've been spending a lot of time thinking about coffeehouses for the last five years because i've been kind of on this quest to investigate this question of where good ideas come from what are the
what i've done is i've looked at both environments like the coffeehouse i've looked at media environments like the world wide web that have been extraordinarily innovative
gone back to the history of the first cities i've even gone to biological environments like coral reefs and rainforests that involve unusual levels of biological innovation
recurring patterns that we can learn from that we can take and kind of apply to our own lives or our own organizations or our own environments to make them more creative and innovative and i think i've found a few but what you have to do
to make sense of this and to really understand these principles is you have to do away with a lot of the way in which our conventional metaphors and language steers us towards certain concepts of idea creation we have this very
rich vocabulary to describe moments of inspiration we have the kind of the flash of insight the stroke of insight we have
we have eureka moments we have the lightbulb moments right all of these concepts as kind of rhetorically florid as they are
share this basic assumption which is that an idea is a single thing it's something that happens often in a wonderful
i mean this is what is happening inside your brain an idea a new idea is a new network of neurons firing in sync with each other inside your brain it's a new configuration that has never formed before
and the question is how do you get your brain into environments where these new networks are going to be more likely to form and it turns out that in fact the kind of network patterns of the outside world mimic a lot of the network patterns of the internal world of the human brain
so the metaphor i'd like the use i can take from a story of a great idea that's quite recent a lot more recent than the sixteen fifties
a wonderful guy named timothy prestero who has a company called an organization called design that matters
they decided to tackle this really pressing problem of you know the terrible problems we have with infant mortality rates in the developing world one of the things that's very frustrating about this is that we know by getting modern neonatal incubators
into any context if we can keep premature babies warm basically it's very simple we can halve infant mortality rates in those
and you send it off to a mid sized village in africa it will work great for a year or two years and then something will go wrong and it will break and it will remain broken forever
they don't have a lot of dvrs they don't have a lot of microwaves but they seem to do a pretty good job of keeping their cars on the road there's a toyota forerunner on the street in all these places they seem to have the expertise
to keep cars working so they started to think could we build a neonatal incubator that's built entirely out of automobile parts
in fact the spaces that have historically led to innovation tend to look like this right this is hogarth 's famous painting of a kind of political dinner at a tavern but this is what the coffee shops looked like back then
look a little bit more like this this is what your office should look like is part of my message here and one of the problems with this is that people are actually when you research this field
and basically do the big brother approach to figuring out where good ideas come from he went to a bunch of science labs around the world and videotaped everyone
we think about the classic image of the scientist in the lab we have this image you know they're pouring over the microscope and they see something in the tissue sample and oh eureka they've got the idea
what happened actually when dunbar kind of looked at the tape
at the weekly lab meeting when everybody got together and shared their kind of latest data and findings oftentimes when people shared the mistakes they were having the error the noise in the signal they were discovering
and something about that environment and i've started calling it the liquid network where you have lots of different ideas that are together
the other problem that people have is they like to condense their stories of innovation down to kind of shorter time frames so they want to tell the story of the eureka moment they want to say there i was i was standing there and i had it all suddenly clear in my head
but in fact if you go back and look at the historical record it turns out that a lot of important ideas have very long incubation periods i call this the slow hunch
heard a lot recently about hunch and instinct and blink like sudden moments of clarity
but in fact a lot of great ideas linger on sometimes for decades in the back of people 's minds they have a feeling that there's an interesting problem but they don't quite have the tools yet to discover them
they spend all this time working on certain problems but there's another thing lingering there that they're interested in but they can't quite solve darwin is a great example of this
at last i had a theory with which to work that's in his autobiography about a decade or two ago a wonderful scholar named howard gruber went back and looked at
darwin 's notebooks from this period and darwin kept these copious notebooks where he wrote down every little idea he had every little hunch
what gruber found was that darwin had the full theory of natural selection for months and months and months before he had his
from the period before he has this epiphany and so what you realize is that darwin in a sense had the idea he had the concept but was unable of fully thinking it yet
and that is actually how great ideas often happen they fade into view over long periods of time now the challenge for all of us is
could you just give me some time to do that now a couple of companies like google they have innovation time off twenty percent time where in a sense those are hunch cultivating
they turn into something larger than the sum of their parts so in a sense we often talk about the value of protecting intellectual property you know building barricades having secretive r d labs
patenting everything that we have so that those ideas will remain valuable and people will be incentivized to come up with more ideas and the culture will be more innovative
but i think there's a case to be made that we should spend at least as much time if not more valuing the premise of connecting ideas and not just protecting them
and i'll leave you with this story which i think captures a lot of these values and it's just wonderful
in laurel maryland at the applied physics lab associated with johns hopkins university
and it's monday morning and the news has just broken about this satellite that's
now orbiting the planet and of course this is nerd heaven right there are all these physics geeks who are there thinking oh my gosh this is incredible i can't believe this has happened
and two of them two twenty something researchers at the apl are there at the cafeteria table having an informal conversation with a bunch of their colleagues and these two guys are named guier and weiffenbach
and they start talking and one of them says hey has anybody tried to listen for this thing there's this you know man made satellite up there in outer space that's obviously broadcasting some kind of signal we
if we tune in and so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues and everybody 's like no i hadn't thought of doing that that's an interesting idea and it turns out weiffenbach is kind of an expert in microwave
and he 's got a little antennae set up with an amplifier in his office and so guier and weiffenbach go back to weiffenbach 's office and they start kind of noodling around hacking as we might call it now and after a couple of hours they actually start picking up the signal because the soviets made
sputnik very easy to track it was right at twenty mhz so you could pick it up really easily because they were afraid that people would think it was a hoax basically so they made it really easy to find
so these two guys are sitting there listening to this signal and people start kind of coming into the office and saying wow that's pretty cool
and they they start thinking well gosh you know we're noticing small little frequency variations here we could probably
and then they played around with it a little bit more and they talked to a couple of their colleagues who had other kind of specialties
to figure out the points at which the satellite is closest to our antennae and the points at which it's farthest away that's pretty cool and eventually they get permission this is all a little side project that hadn't been officially part of their job description
they get permission to use the new you know univac computer that takes up an entire room that they'd just gotten at the apl they run some more of the numbers and at the end of about three or four weeks turns out they have mapped the exact trajectory of this satellite
figured out an unknown location of a satellite orbiting the planet from a known location on the ground
could you go the other way could you figure out an unknown location on the ground if you knew the location of the satellite
and he said oh that's great because see i have these new nuclear submarines that i'm building
it's really hard to figure out how to get your missile so that it will land right on top of moscow if you don't know where the submarine is in the middle of the pacific ocean so we're thinking we could throw up a bunch of satellites
use it to track our submarines and figure out their location in the middle of the ocean could you work on that problem
and that's how gps was born
thirty years later ronald reagan actually opened it up and made it an open platform that anybody could kind of build upon and anybody could come along and build new technology
that would create and innovate on top of this open platform left it open for anyone to do pretty much anything they wanted with
now i guarantee you certainly half of this room if not more has a device sitting in their pocket right now that is talking to one of these satellites in outer space and i bet you
one of you if not more has used said device and said satellite system to locate a nearby coffeehouse somewhere in the last in the last day or last week right
think is a great case study a great lesson in the power the marvelous kind of unplanned emergent unpredictable power
of open innovative systems when you build them right they will be led to completely new directions that the creators never even dreamed of i mean here you have these guys
who basically thought they were just following this hunch this little passion that had developed then they thought they were fighting the cold war and then it turns out
they're just helping somebody find a soy latte that is how innovation happens chance favors the connected mind thank you very much
