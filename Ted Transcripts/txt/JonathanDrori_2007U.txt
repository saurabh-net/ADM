science educators so that 's science teachers and also of seven year olds and i find that the seven year olds do marginally better than the other audiences which is somewhat surprising
so the first question and you might want to write this down either on a bit of paper physically or a virtual piece of paper in your head and for viewers at home you can try this as well a little seed weighs next to nothing and a tree weighs a lot right i think we agree on that where does the tree get the stuff that makes up
this chair right where does all this stuff come from knocks and your next question
is can you light a little torch bulb with a battery a bulb
and one piece of wire
the third question is why is it hotter in summer than in winter
i think we can probably agree
that it is hotter in summer than in winter
scribble a plan diagram of the solar system showing the shape of the planets orbits
would you be able to do that and if you can just scribble a pattern
children get their ideas not from teachers as teachers often think but actually from common sense from experience of the world around them
from all the things that go on between them and their peers and their carers and their parents and all of that experience and one of the great experts in this field of course was bless him cardinal wolsey
be very careful what you get into people 's heads because it 's virtually impossible to shift it afterwards right
now i guarantee that about eighty five percent of you or maybe it 's fewer at ted will have said it comes out of the ground
and some people probably two of you will come up and argue with me afterwards and say that actually it comes out of the ground now if that was true we 'd have trucks going round the country filling people 's gardens in with soil it 'd be a fantastic business but actually we don 't do that the mass of this comes out of the air
now i passed all my biology exams in britain i passed them really well but i still came out of school thinking that that stuff came out of the ground
second one can you light a little torch bulb with a battery bulb and one piece of wire yes you can and i 'll show you in a second how to do that now i have some rather bad news which is that i had a piece of video that i was about to show you which unfortunately the sound doesn 't work in this room so i 'm going to describe to you in true monty python fashion what happens in the video
and when we gave graduate engineers
that question they said it couldn 't be done
and when we gave them a battery and a piece of wire and a bulb and said can you do it they couldn 't do it right and that 's no different from imperial college in london by the way it 's not some sort of as if
so why is it hotter in summer than in winter we learn as children that you get closer to something that 's hot and it burns you
by extension we think to ourselves why it 's hotter in summer than in winter must be because we 're closer to the sun i promise you that most of you will have got that oh you 're all shaking your heads but only a few of you are shaking your heads very firmly other ones are kind of going like this all right it 's hotter in summer than in winter because the rays from the sun are spread out more
right because of the tilt of the earth
and if you think the tilt is tilting us closer no it isn 't the sun is ninety three million miles away and we 're tilting like this right it makes no odds in fact in the northern hemisphere we 're further from the sun in summer as it happens but it makes no odds the difference
ok now the scribble of the diagram of the solar system if you believe as most of you probably do that it 's hotter in summer than in winter because we 're closer to the sun you must have drawn an ellipse
so here 's copernicus view of what the solar system looked like as a plan that 's pretty much what you should have on your piece of paper right and this is nasa 's view they 're stunningly similar i hope you notice the coincidence here
what would you do if you knew that people had this misconception right in their heads of elliptical orbits caused by our experiences as children what sort of diagram would you show them of the solar system to show that it 's not really like that you 'd show them something like this wouldn 't you it 's a plan looking down from above but no look what i found in the textbooks
we look for evidence that reinforces our models and some folks are just all too able and willing to provide the evidence that reinforces the models
so being i 'm in the united states i 'll have a dig at the europeans these are examples of what i would say is bad practice in science teaching centers these pictures are from la villette in france and the welcome wing of the science museum in london
and if you look at the kind of the way these things are constructed there 's a lot of mediation by glass and it 's very blue and
so children are not empty vessels ok so as monty python would have it this is a bit lord privy seal to say so but this is children are not empty vessels they come with their own ideas and their own theories and unless you work with those
then you won 't be able to shift them right and i probably haven 't shifted your ideas of how the world and universe operates either
so we 're not empty vessels the mental models that we have as children persist into adulthood poor teaching actually does more harm than good in this country and in britain magnetism is understood better by children before they 've been to school than afterwards
is you know how does an aircraft 's wing create lift an obvious question and you 'll have an answer now in your heads and the second question to that then is ensure you 've explained how it is that planes can fly upside down
always wanted to say that in this country
