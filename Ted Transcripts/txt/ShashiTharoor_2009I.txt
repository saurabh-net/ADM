and now as a politician and a government minister i've become rather concerned about the hype we're hearing about our own country all this talk about india becoming a world leader even the next superpower
indeed what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership seems to me terribly archaic it's redolent of james bond movies and kipling ballads
what constitutes a world leader if it's population we're on course to top the charts we will overtake china by two thousand and thirty four
the economy well we have now the fifth largest economy in the world in purchasing power parity terms and we continue to grow when the rest of the world took a beating last
we grew at six point seven percent but somehow none of that adds up to me to what i think india really can aim contribute in the world
in this part of the twenty one st century and so i wondered could what the future beckons for india to be all about be a combination of these things allied to something else
the power of example the attraction of india 's culture what in other words people like to call soft power soft power is
probably hollywood and mtv and mcdonalds have done more for american soft power around the world than any specifically government activity
so soft power is something that really emerges partly because of governments but partly despite governments and
in the information era we all live in today what we might call the ted age i'd say that countries are increasingly being judged by a global public that's been fed on
an incessant diet of internet news of televised images of cellphone videos of email gossip in other words all sorts of communication devices
telling us the stories of countries whether or not the countries concerned want people to hear those stories now in this age again countries with access to multiple channels of communication and information
have a particular advantage and of course they have more influence sometimes about how they're seen india has more all news tv channels
any country in the world in fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together but the fact still is that it's not just that
soft power you have to be connected one might argue that india has become an astonishingly connected country i think you've already heard the figures we've been selling fifteen million cellphones a month
in fact those fifteen million cellphones are the most connections that any country including the u s and china has ever established in the history of telecommunications
but what perhaps some of you don't realize is how far we've come to get there you know when i grew up in india telephones were a rarity
in fact they were so rare that elected members of parliament had the right to allocate fifteen telephone lines as a favor to those they deemed worthy
there was a dial tone and you dialed a number the odds were two in three you wouldn't get the number you were intending to reach in fact the words wrong number were more popular than the word hello
if you then wanted to connect to another city let 's say from calcutta you wanted to call delhi you'd have to book something called a trunk call and then sit by the phone all day waiting for it to come
or you could pay eight times the going rate for something called a lightning call but lightening struck rather slowly in our country in those days so it was like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come
that the government had no obligation to provide better service and if the honorable member wasn't satisfied with his telephone could he please return it since there was an eight year long waiting list for telephones in india
now fast forward to today and this is what you see the fifteen million cellphones a month but what is most striking is who is carrying those cellphones you know if you visit friends in the suburbs of delhi on the side streets
you will find a fellow with a cart that looks like it was designed in the sixteenth century wielding a coal fired steam iron that might have been invented in the eighteenth century
the other day i was in kerala my home state at the country farm of a friend about twenty kilometers away from any place you'd consider
and it was a hot day and he said hey would you like some fresh coconut water and it's the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drink on a hot day in the tropics so i said sure and he whipped out his cellphone dialed the number and a voice said i 'm up here and right on top of the nearest coconut tree
with a hatchet in one hand and a cellphone in the other was a local toddy tapper
who proceeded to bring down the coconuts for us to drink
farmers now who used to have to spend half a day of backbreaking labor to find out if the market town was open if the market was on whether the product they'd harvested could be sold what price they'd fetch
an eight year old boy all the way on this trudge to the market town to get that information and come back then they'd load the cart today they're saving half a day 's labor with a two minute phone call
so this empowerment of the underclass is the real result of india being connected and that transformation is part of where india is heading today but of course that's not the only thing about india
got bollywood my attitude to bollywood is best summarized in the tale of the two goats at a bollywood garbage dump mister shekhar kapur forgive me
and they're chewing away on cans of celluloid discarded by a bollywood studio and the first goat chewing away says you know this film is not bad and the second goat says no the book was
i usually tend to think that the book is usually better but having said that the fact is that bollywood is now taking a certain aspect of indian ness and indian culture around the globe not just in the indian diaspora in the u s and the
she's illiterate so she can't read the french subtitles but these movies are made to be understood despite such handicaps and she has a great time in the song and the dance and the action she goes away with stars in her eyes about india as a result
and this is happening more and more afghanistan we know what a serious security problem afghanistan is for so many of us in the world india doesn't have a military mission
you what was india 's biggest asset in afghanistan in the last seven years one simple fact you couldn't try to call an afghan at eight thirty in the evening
why because that was the moment when the indian television soap opera dubbed into dhurrie was telecast on todo t v and it was the most popular television show in afghan history
every afghan family wanted to watch it they had to suspend functions at eight thirty weddings were reported to be interrupted
so guests could cluster around the t v set and then turn their attention back to the bride and groom crime went up at eight thirty i have read
so this is not indian propaganda a british news agency about how robbers in the town of musarri sharif stripped a vehicle of its windshield wipers its hubcaps its sideview mirrors any moving part they could find
at eight thirty because the watchmen were busy watching the t v rather than minding the store and they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show 's heroine tulsi zindabad long live tulsi
soft power and that is what india is developing through the e part of ted its own entertainment industry
the same is true of course we don't have time for too many more examples but it's true of our music of our dance of our art yoga
even indian cuisine i mean the proliferation of indian restaurants since i first went abroad as a student in the mid seventies
and what i see today you can't go to a mid size town in europe or north america and not find an indian restaurant it may not be a very good one but today in britain for example
indian restaurants in britain employ more people than the coal mining ship building and iron and steel industries combined so the empire can strike back
but with this increasing awareness of india with you and with i and so on with tales like afghanistan comes something vital in the information era
the sense that in today 's world it's not the side of the bigger army that wins it's the country that tells a better story
i mean again having gone to the u s as a student in the mid seventies i knew what the image of india was then if their was an image at all today people in silicon valley and elsewhere speak of the iits the indian institutes of technology
the same reverence they used to accord to mit this can sometimes have unintended consequences ok i had a friend a history major like me
who was accosted at schiphol airport in amsterdam by an anxiously perspiring european saying you 're indian you're indian can you help me fix my laptop
we've gone from the image of india as land of fakirs lying on
beds of nails and snake charmers with the indian rope trick to the image of india as a land of mathematical geniuses computer wizards software gurus but that too is transforming the indian story around the world
india gave refuge to the jews fleeing the destruction first temple by the babylonians and said thereafter by the romans
in fact legend has is that when doubting thomas the apostle saint thomas landed on the shores of kerala my home state somewhere around fifty two a d he was welcomed on shore by a flute playing jewish girl
and to this day remains the only jewish diaspora in the history of the jewish people which has never encountered a single incident of anti semitism
that's the indian story islam came peacefully to the south slightly more differently complicated history in the north but all of these religions have found a place and a welcome home in india you know we just celebrated
but the fact is that the last elections five years ago gave the world extraordinary phenomenon of an election being won by a woman political leader
is india and of course it's all the more striking because it was four years later that we all applauded the u s the oldest democracy in the modern world more than two hundred and twenty years of free and fair elections which took till last year
to elect a president or a vice president who wasn't white male or christian so maybe oh sorry he is christian i beg your pardon and he is male but he
all the others have been all those three
all his predecessors have been all those three and that's the point i was trying to make
and that it seems to me is what ultimately will make a difference in today 's information era in today 's ted age so india
now is no longer the nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion because we have every ethnicity known to mankind practically we've every religion know to mankind with the possible exception of shintoism
that has some hindu elements somewhere we have twenty three official languages
got all of that we don't even have geography uniting us because the natural geography of the subcontinent
and it's the nationalism of an idea that essentially says you can endure differences of caste creed color culture
the great success story of india a country that so many learned scholars and jounalists assumed would disintegrate in the fifties and sixties is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus
india that is emerging into the twenty one st century and i do want to make the point that if there is anything worth
all the infrastructural things we need to do and the software of development the human capital the need for the ordinary person in india
to be able to have a couple of square meals a day to be able to send his or her children to a decent school and to aspire to work a job that will give them
which none of us can pretend don't exist but it's all taking place in an open society in a rich and diverse and plural civilization in one that is determined
to liberate and fulfill the creative energies of its people that's why india belongs at ted and that's why ted belongs in india thank you very
