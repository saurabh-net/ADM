and i didn 't have a phone or tv but i had u s mail
and life was good back then if you could remember it
two days later it would end up on my front door which was way better than having to fight the traffic of hollywood music i didn 't have much money
but i had time and a sense of wonder music so i started shooting time lapse
to shoot a four minute roll of film
because that 's all i could afford i 've been shooting time lapse flowers continuously non stop twenty four hours a day seven days a week for over thirty years
and to see them move is a dance i 'll never get tired of their beauty immerses us with color taste touch it also provides a third of the food we
to every one of us because it 's clear that it 's all connected in one
journey we all want to be on
to feel like we 're connected to a universe that celebrates life did you know that eighty percent of the information we receive comes through our eyes and if you compare light energy to musical scales it would only be one octave that the naked eye could see which is right in the middle appreciation and gratitude
if you do nothing else but to cultivate that response
that response open your heart to
the incredible gifts that civilization gives to us
