thirteen trillion dollars in wealth has evaporated over the course of the last two years we've questioned the future of capitalism we've questioned the financial industry we've looked at our government oversight we've questioned where we're going
and yet at the same time this very well may be a seminal moment in american history an opportunity for the consumer to actually take control and guide us to a new trajectory in america i'm calling this the great unwind
and the idea is a simple simple idea which is the fact that the consumer has moved from a state of anxiety to action consumers who represent seventy two percent of the gdp of america
have actually started just like banks and just like businesses to de leverage to unwind their leverage in daily life to remove themselves from the liability and risk that presents itself as we move forward
so to understand this and i'm going to stress this it's not about the consumer being in retreat the consumer is empowered in order to understand this we're going to step back and look a little bit at what's happened
over the course of the last year and a half so if you've been gone this is the easy cliffsnotes on what's happened in the economy okay unemployment up
will the bailout work we have national debt detroit currency valuations healthcare all these issues facing us you put them all together you mix them up in a bouillabaisse and you have consumer confidence that's basically a ticking time bomb
in fact let 's go back and look at what caused this crisis because the consumer all of us in our daily lives actually contributed a large part to the problem
this is something i call the fifty twenty paradox it took us fifty years to reach annual savings ratings of almost ten percent fifty years do you know what this was right here this was world war ii do you know why savings was so high
because we binged we bought extra large cars supersized everything we bought remedies for restless leg syndrome
all these things together basically created a factor where the consumer sort of drove us headlong into the crisis that we face today
the personal debt to income ratio basically went from sixty five percent to one hundred and thirty five percent in the span of about fifteen years
so consumers got overleveraged and of course our banks did as well as did our federal government this is an absolutely staggering chart it shows leverage
can see is if you stack up dollar bills first of all three hundred and sixty thousand dollars is about the size of a five foot
here and trillion there we are stacking ourselves up for long term leverage however consumers have moved they are taking responsibility
what we're seeing is an uptake in the savings rate in fact eleven straight months of savings have happened since the beginning of the crisis we are working our way back up to that ten percent
also remarkably in the fourth quarter spending dropped to its lowest level in sixty two years almost a three point seven percent decline
if you take into account eighty percent of all americans were born after world war ii this is essentially our depression
and so as a result some crazy things have happened i'll give you some examples lets talk about dentists vasectomies guns and shark attacks
dentists report molars you know people grinding their teeth coming in and reporting the fact that they've had stress and so there is an increase
in people having to have their fillings replaced guns gun sales according to the fbi who does background checks are up almost twenty five percent since january
are up forty eight percent according to the cornell institute and lastly but a very good point hopefully not related to the former point i just made which is that shark attacks are at their lowest level from two thousand and three does anybody know why
no one is at the beach so there is a bright side to everything but seriously what we see happening and the reason i want to stress that the consumer is not in retreat is that this is a tremendous opportunity for the consumer who drove us
this recession to lead us right back out and what i mean by that is that we can move from mindless consumption to mindful consumption right if you think about the last three decades the consumer has moved from
by restricting their demand consumers can actually align their values with their spending and drive capitalism and business to not just be about more but be about better we're going to explain that right now
a couple of really interesting things we're going to go through four value shifts that we see driving new consumer behaviors that offer new management principles
the first cultural value shift that we see is this tendency toward something we call liquid life this is the movement from americans defining their success on having things to having liquidity because the less excess that you have around you the more nimble and fleet of foot you are
but seriously we also have this phenomenon on madison avenue and in other places where people are actually
walking out of luxury boutiques with ordinary sort of generic paper bags to hide the brand purchases we see high end haggling in fashion today high end haggling for luxury and real estate
we also see just a relaxing of ego and sort of a dismantling of artifice this is a story on the yacht club that's all basically blue collar blue collar yacht club where you can join the yacht club but you've got to work in the boat yard as sort of condition of membership
we also see the trend toward tourism that's a little bit more low key right agritourism going to vineyards and going to farms and then we also see
this movement forward from dollars and cents what businesses can do to connect with these new mindsets is really interesting a couple things that are kind of cool one is that frito lay
really interestingly too was the san francisco giants they've just instituted dynamic pricing so it takes into account everything from the pitcher match ups to the weather to the team records in setting prices for the consumer
another quick example of these types of movements is the rise of zynga zynga has risen on the consumer 's desire to not want to be locked in to fixed cost again this theme is about variable cost variable living so micropayments have become huge
and lastly some people are using hulu actually as a device to get rid of their cable bill so really clever ideas there that are kind of being taken ahold and marketers are starting to understand
the second of the four values is this movement toward ethics and fair play we see that play itself out with empathy and respect the consumer is demanding it
also a wonderful byproduct of sort of a really lousy thing which has been unemployment is a rise in volunteerism that's been noted in our country
we also see the phenomenon some of you may have boomerang kids these are boomerang alumni where universities are actually reconnecting with alumni in helping them with jobs sharing skills and retraining
we also talked about character and professionalism we had this miracle on the hudson in new york city you know in january and suddenly sully has become a key name on
so from a value and values standpoint what companies can do is connect in lots of different ways microsoft is doing something wonderful they are actually vowing to retrain two million americans with i t training using their existing infrastructure to do something good
the third of the four laws of post crisis consumerism is about durable living we're seeing on our data that consumers are realizing this is a marathon not a
digging in and they're looking for ways to extract value out of every purchase that they make witness the fact that americans are holding on to their cars longer than ever before nine point four years on average in march a record
we also see the fact that libraries have become a huge resource for america did you know that sixty eight percent of americans now carry a library card the highest percentage ever in our nation 's history
so what you see in this trend is also the accumulation of knowledge continuing education is up everything is focused on betterment and training and development and moving forward we also see a big diy movement
i was fascinated to learn that thirty percent of all homes in america are actually built by owners that includes cottages and the like but thirty percent so people are getting their hands dirty they are rolling up their sleeves they want these skills
we see that with the phenomenon of raising backyard hens and chickens and ducks and when you work out the math they say it doesn't work but the principle is there that it's about being sustainable and taking care of yourself
so what brands can do and companies is pay dividends to consumers be a brand that lasts offer transparency promise you're going to be there beyond today 's
or the interesting company sunrun i love this company they've created a consumer collective where they put solar panels on households
and create a consumer based utility where the electricity that they generate is basically pumped back out into the marketplace so it's a consumer driven co op
so the fourth sort of post crisis consumerism that we see is this movement about return to the fold it's incredibly important right now trust is not parceled out
as we all know it's now about connecting to your communities connecting to your social networks in my book i talked about the fact that seventy two percent of people trust what other people say about a brand or a company versus fifteen percent on
so in that respect cooperative consumerism has really taken off this is about consumers working together to get what they want out of the marketplace let 's look a couple of quick examples
movement is huge everything about locally derived products and services supporting your local neighborhoods whether it's cheeses wines and other products
also this rise of local currencies realizing that it's difficult to get loans in this environment you're doing business with people you trust in your local markets so this rise of this sort of local currency is another really interesting phenomenon
then we also look at the idea of cow pooling which is the whole phenomenon of consumers organizing together to buy meat from organic farms that they know is safe and controlled in the way that they want it to be controlled
other really interesting movement that's happened in california which is about carrot mobs the traditional thing would be to boycott right have a stick well why not have a carrot
so these are consumers organizing pooling their resources to incentify companies to do good
we look at what companies can do this is all the opportunity about being a community organizer you have to realize that you
first is just the rise of the fact that zagat 's has actually moved out of and diversified from rating restaurants into actually rating healthcare
so what credentials does zagat 's have well they have a lot because it's their network of people right so that becomes a very powerful force for them to make their brand more elastic then you look at the phenomenon of
this kogi doesn't exist it's a moving truck right it's a moving truck through l a and the only way you can find it is through twitter or you look at
allowing them to basically create a forum where they can communicate and they can connect and it's also become a very very valuable sort of advertising revenue for j j as well
this plus the fact that you've got phenomenal work from ceos from ford to zappos connecting on twitter creating an open environment allowing their employees to be part of the process rather than hidden behind walls
you see this rising force in sort of total transparency and openness that companies are starting to adopt all because the consumer is demanding it
so when we look at this and we step back what i believe is that the crisis that exists today is definitely real it's been tremendously powerful for consumers
what we're seeing with consumers right now is the ability for them to actually lead us forward out of this recession so we believe that values driven spending will force capitalism to be better
it will drive innovation it will make longer lasting products it will create better more intuitive customer service it will give us the opportunity to connect with companies that share the values that we share
so when we look back and step out at this and see the beginning of these trends that we're seeing in our data we see a very hopeful picture for the future of america thank you very much
