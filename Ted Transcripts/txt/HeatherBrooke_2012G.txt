upon a time the world was a big dysfunctional family it was run by the great and powerful parents and the people were helpless and hopeless naughty children if any of the more rowdier children questioned the authority of the parents they were scolded
if they went exploring into the parents rooms or even into the secret filing cabinets they were punished and told that for their own good they must never go in there again
then one day a man came to town with boxes and boxes of secret documents stolen from the parents rooms look what they 've been hiding from you he said
they made mistakes too just like the children the only difference was their mistakes were in the secret filing cabinets
so i fought for about five years doing this and it was one of many hundreds of requests that i made
not i didn 't hey look i didn 't set out honestly to revolutionize the british parliament that was not my intention i was just making these requests as part of research
for my first book but it ended up in this very long protracted legal battle and there i was after five years fighting against parliament in front of three of britain 's most eminent high court judges waiting for their ruling about whether or not parliament had to release this data
the transparency law they 'd passed earlier that applied to everybody else they tried to keep it so it didn 't apply to them
put it on a disk and then just saunter outside of parliament which they did and then they shopped that disk to the highest bidder which was the daily telegraph and then you all remember
there was weeks and weeks of revelations everything from porn movies and bath plugs and new kitchens and mortgages that had never been paid off
the end result was six ministers resigned the first speaker of the house in three hundred years was forced to resign
a new government was elected on a mandate of transparency one hundred and twenty mps stepped down at that election and so far four mps and two lords have done jail time for fraud
and not only not content with it now more often armed with official data itself so
we are moving to this democratization of information and i 've been in this field for quite a while slightly embarrassing admission even when i was a kid i used to have these little spy books and i would like see what everybody was doing in my neighborhood and log it down i think that was a pretty good indication about my future career as an investigative journalist
and what i 've seen from being in this access to information field for so long is that it used to be quite a niche interest and it 's gone mainstream everybody increasingly around the world wants to know about what people in power are doing they want a say in decisions that are made in their name
and with their money it 's this democratization of information that i think is an information enlightenment and it has many of the same principles of the first enlightenment
it 's about searching for the truth not because somebody says it 's true because i say so no it 's about trying to find the truth based on what you can see and what can be tested
but what they hadn 't counted on was technology and then they had the printing press which suddenly enabled these ideas to spread cheaply far and fast and people would come together in coffee houses discuss the ideas plot revolution
in our day we have digitization that strips all the physical mass out of information so now it 's almost zero cost to copy and share information our printing press is the internet our coffee houses are social networks we 're moving to what i would think of as a fully connected system
and we have global decisions to make in this system decisions about climate about finance systems about resources and think about it if we want to make an important decision about buying a house we don 't just go off
i mean i don 't know about you but i want to see a lot of houses before i put that much money into it and if we 're thinking about a finance system we need a lot of information to take in it 's just not possible
that 's why we 're starting to see more disclosure laws come out so for example on the environment there 's the aarhus convention which is a european directive that gives people
a very strong right to know so if your water company is dumping water into your river sewage water into your river you have a right to know about it in the finance industry
you now have more of a right to know about what 's going on so we have different anti bribery laws money regulations increased corporate disclosure so you can now track assets across borders and it 's getting harder to hide
assets tax avoidance pay inequality so that 's great we 're starting to find out more and more about these systems
and they 're all moving to this central system this fully connected system
all of them except one can you guess which one
it 's the system which underpins all these other systems it 's the system by which we organize and exercise power and there i 'm talking about politics because in politics we 're back to this system this top down hierarchy
and how is it possible that the volume of information can be processed that needs to in this system well it just can 't
that 's it and i think this is largely what 's behind the crisis of legitimacy in our
and what it is it 's a freedom of information platform it 's open source with documentation and it allows you to make a freedom of information request
to ask your public body a question so it takes all the hassle out of it and i can tell you that there is a lot of hassle making these requests so it takes all of that hassle out and you just type in your question for example how many police officers have a criminal record
it zooms it off to the appropriate person it tells you when the time limit is coming to an end it keeps track of all the correspondence it posts it up there and it becomes an archive of public knowledge
so that 's open source and it can be used in any country where there is some kind of freedom of information law so there 's a list there of the different countries that have it and then there 's a few more coming on board so if any of you out there like the sound of that
and have a law like that in your country i know that seb would love to hear from you about collaborating and getting that into your country
this is birgitta jonsdottir she 's an icelandic mp and quite an unusual mp in iceland she was one of the protesters who was outside of parliament
when the country 's economy collapsed
and then she was elected on a reform mandate and she 's now spearheading this project it 's the icelandic modern media initiative and they 've just got funding to make it an international modern media project
and this is taking all of the best laws around the world about freedom of expression protection of whistleblowers protection from libel source protection and trying to make iceland a publishing haven
it 's a place where your data can be free so when we think about increasingly how governments want to access user data what they 're trying to do in iceland is make this safe haven where it can happen
in my own field of investigative journalism we 're also having to start thinking globally so this is a site called investigative dashboard and if you 're trying to track a dictator 's assets for example hosni mubarak
you know he 's just funneling out cash from his country when he knows he 's in trouble and what you want to do to investigate that is you need to have access to all of the world 's as many as you can companies house registrations databases so this is a website that tries to
agglomerate all of those databases into one place so you can start searching for you know his relatives his friends the head of his security services you can try and find out how he 's moving out assets from that country
so when the guardian did this investigation about the afghan war you know they can 't walk into the department of defense and ask for all the information you know they 're just not going to get it
so this came from leaks of tens of thousands of dispatches that were written by american soldiers about the afghan war and leaked and then they 're able to do this investigation
another rather large investigation is around world diplomacy again this is all based around leaks two hundred and fifty one thousand u s diplomatic cables
and i was involved in this investigation because i got this leak through a leak from a disgruntled wikileaker and ended up going to work at the guardian so
very pompous politicians they were just like us they all bitched about each other i mean quite gossipy those cables okay but i thought it was a very important point for all of us to grasp these are human beings just like us they don 't have special powers they 're not magic they are not our parents
beyond that what i found most
fascinating was the level of endemic corruption that i saw across all different countries and particularly centered around the heart of power around public officials who were embezzling the public 's money for their own personal enrichment and allowed to do that because of official secrecy
because surely what could be more open than publishing all the material because that is what julian assange did he wasn 't content with the way the newspapers published it to be safe and legal he threw it all out there
that did end up with vulnerable people in afghanistan being exposed it also meant that the belarussian dictator was given a handy list of all the pro democracy campaigners in that country who had spoken to the u s government
is that radical openness i say it 's not because for me what it means it doesn 't mean abdicating power
power is incredibly seductive and you must have two real qualities
i think when you come to the table when you 're dealing with power talking about power
because of its seductive capacity you 've got to have skepticism and humility skepticism because you must always be challenging i want to see why do you you just say so that 's not good enough i want to see the evidence behind why that 's so and humility because we are all human we all make mistakes
and if you don 't have skepticism and humility then it 's a really short journey to go from reformer to autocrat and i think you only have to read animal farm
to get that message about how power corrupts people
so what is the solution
it is i believe to embody within the rule of law rights to information
at the moment our rights are incredibly weak in a lot of countries we have official secrets acts including in britain here we have an official secrets act with no public interest test so that means it 's a crime people are punished quite severely in a lot of cases for
i would like us to work towards that so
it 's not all bad news i mean there definitely is progress on the line but i think what we find is that the closer that we get right into the heart of power
the more opaque closed it becomes so it was only just the other week that i heard london 's metropolitan police commissioner
talking about why the police need access to all of our communications spying on us without any judicial oversight and he said it was a matter of life and death he actually said that it was a matter of life and death
and we need to fight against that
so he was talking about the law in britain which is the communications data bill an absolutely outrageous piece of legislation in america you have the cyber intelligence
sharing and protection act you 've got drones now being considered for domestic surveillance you have the national security agency building the world 's giantest spy center it 's just this colossal it 's five times bigger than the u s capitol in which they 're going to intercept and analyze communications traffic and personal data
to try and figure out who 's the troublemaker in society
they 've kidded out the house with cctv cameras they 're watching all of us they 've dug a basement and they 've built a spy center to try and run algorithms and figure out which ones of us are troublesome
and if any of us complain about that
but the world isn 't a fairy tale and it could be more brutal than we want to acknowledge
equally it could be better than we 've been led to believe but either way we have to start seeing it exactly as it is with all of its problems because it 's only by seeing it with all of its problems that we 'll be able to fix them
and live in a world in which we can all be happily ever after laughs thank you
