her text said you will rock
and so there you have it i embody the central
who 's going to tell you that too many of them
rebecca was five years old and she was sitting right there in the front row i had just written a book that celebrated our life on the internet and i was about to be on the cover of wired magazine
in those heady days we were experimenting with chat rooms and online virtual communities we were exploring different aspects of ourselves and then we unplugged
i was excited and as a psychologist what excited me most was the idea that we would use what we learned in the virtual world about ourselves about our identity to live better lives in the real world she sleeps with her
but this time it 's not one
that will get me on the cover of wired magazine
but i believe and i 'm here to make the case that we 're letting it take us places that we don 't want to go
over the past fifteen years i 've studied technologies of mobile communication and i 've interviewed hundreds and hundreds of people young and old about their plugged in lives
they change who we are
some of the things we do now with our devices are things that only a few years ago
we would have found odd or disturbing
but they 've quickly come to seem familiar
just how we do things so just to take some quick examples people text or do email during corporate board meetings they text and shop and go on facebook during classes during presentations actually
during all meetings people talk to me about the important new skill of making eye contact
about not having their parents full attention but then these same children deny each other their full attention this is a recent shot of my daughter
and we even text at funerals i study this
we remove ourselves from our grief or from our revery and we go into our phones
trouble certainly in how we relate to each other
but also trouble in how we relate to ourselves
we 're getting used to a new way of being alone together
people want to be with each other but also elsewhere
connected to all the different places they want to be people want to customize their lives they want to go in and out of all the places they are because the thing that matters most to them
but you only want to pay attention to the bits that interest you
and some people think that 's a good thing
but you can end up hiding from each other
even as we 're all constantly connected to each other
but then he stops himself and he says you know i 'm not telling you the truth i 'm the one who doesn 't want to be interrupted
i think i should want to
but actually i 'd rather just do things on my blackberry
across the generations i see that people can 't get enough of each other if and only if
they can have each other at a distance in amounts they can control
i call it the goldilocks effect
someday but certainly not now
i 'd like to learn how to have a conversation
when i ask people what 's wrong with having a conversation people say i 'll tell you what 's wrong with having a conversation it takes place in real time
the face the voice the flesh the body
and when we do one of the things that can happen is that we sacrifice conversation and over time
we seem to forget this me a profound
me a profound question a profound question
don 't all those little sips of online communication of real conversation
of real conversation my answer was no
or even for saying i love you
i mean look at how i felt when i got that text from my daughter
but they don 't really work for learning about each other for really coming to know and understand each other
to learn how to have conversations with ourselves
so a flight from conversation can really matter
because it can compromise our capacity for self reflection for kids growing up that skill is the bedrock of development
over and over i hear i would rather text than talk and what i 'm seeing is that people get so used to being short changed out of real conversation
will be more like a best friend someone who will listen when others won 't
i believe this wish reflects
and the feeling that no one is listening to me make us want to spend time with machines that seem to care about us
we 're developing robots they call them sociable robots that are specifically designed to be companions to the elderly
will be there for each other
during my research i worked in nursing homes and i brought in these sociable robots
that were designed to give the elderly the feeling that they were understood
and one day i came in and a woman who had lost a child
it seemed to be looking in her eyes it seemed to be following the conversation it comforted her
and many people found this amazing
but that woman was trying to make sense
that robot put on a great show
and we 're vulnerable people experience pretend empathy as though it were the real thing
it doesn 't know life
and as that woman took comfort in her robot companion
i didn 't find it amazing
i found it one of the most wrenching complicated moments in my fifteen years of work
we expect more from technology and less from each other and i ask myself
why have things come to this
and i believe it 's because technology appeals to us most
where we are most vulnerable and we are vulnerable
and so from social networks to sociable robots we 're designing technologies that will give us the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship we turn to technology to help us feel connected in ways we can comfortably control but we 're not so comfortable
that we will always be heard and three that we will never have to be alone and that third idea that we will never have to be alone is central to changing our psyches
because the moment that people are alone even for a few seconds they become anxious they panic they fidget they reach for a device just think of people at a checkout line or at a red light being alone feels like a problem
that needs to be solved and so people try to solve it by connecting
but here connection is more like a symptom than a cure it expresses but it doesn 't solve an underlying problem
but more than a symptom constant connection is changing the way people think of themselves it 's shaping a new way of being the best way to describe it is i share therefore i am
the problem with this new regime of i share therefore i am is that if we don 't have connection we don 't feel like ourselves we almost don 't feel ourselves so what do we do we connect
how do you get from connection to isolation you end up isolated if you don 't cultivate the capacity for solitude the ability to be separate to gather yourself
solitude is where you find yourself
when we don 't have the capacity for solitude
to support our fragile sense of self we slip into thinking that always being connected is going to make us feel
if we 're not able to be alone
when i spoke at ted in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six reporting on my studies of the early virtual communities i said those who make the most of their lives on the screen
come to it in a spirit of self reflection
and that 's what i 'm calling for here now
reflection and more than that a conversation about where our current use of technology may be taking us what it might be costing us we 're smitten
with technology and we 're afraid like young lovers that too much talking might spoil the romance but it 's time to talk
we grew up with digital technology and so we see it as all grown up
but it 's not it 's early days there 's plenty of time for us to reconsider how we use it how we build it i 'm not suggesting that we turn away from our devices
just that we develop a more self aware relationship with them with each other and with ourselves
i see some first steps
start thinking of solitude as a good thing make room for it
find ways to demonstrate this as a value to your children
create sacred spaces at home the kitchen the dining room and reclaim them for conversation do the same thing at work at work we 're so busy communicating that we often don 't have time to think
we don 't have time to talk about the things that really matter
including to the boring bits
because it 's when we stumble or hesitate or lose our words that we reveal ourselves
that we reveal ourselves i 'm optimistic
we have everything we need to start
so in my work i hear that life is hard
relationships are filled with risk
and then there 's technology online and with avatars
we 're drawn to virtual romance to computer games that seem like worlds to the idea that robots robots
will someday be our true companions
we spend an evening on the social network instead of
going to the pub with friends
but our fantasies of substitution have cost us
our own bodies our own communities our own politics our own planet
the technology of our dreams to make this life her text said
