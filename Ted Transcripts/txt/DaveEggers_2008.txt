so much everyone from ted and chris and amy in particular i cannot believe
here i have not slept in weeks neil and i were sitting there comparing how little we've slept in anticipation for this i've never been so nervous and i do this when i'm nervous i just realized
i was trying to finish my first book i was wandering around dazed every day because i wrote from twelve a m to five a m so i would walk around in a daze during the day i had no mental acuity to speak of during the day i had
in the brooklyn neighborhood that i lived in park slope there are a lot of writers it's like a very high per capita ratio of writers to normal people meanwhile i had
grown up around a lot of teachers my mom was a teacher my sister became a teacher
and after college so many of my friends went into teaching and so i was always hearing them talk about their lives and how inspiring they were and they were really sort of the
hard working and constantly inspiring people i knew but i knew so many of the things they were up against so many of the struggles they were dealing with and one of them was that
so many of these students had come from households where english isn't spoken in the home where many of them have different
they would talk to me about this and say you know what we really need is just more people more bodies more one on one attention more hours more
expertise from people that have skills in english and can work with these students one on one now i would say well why don't you just work with them one on one and they would say well
we have five classes of thirty to forty students each this can lead up to one hundred and fifty one hundred and eighty two hundred students a day how can we possibly give each student even one hour
of one on one attention you'd have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers and so
we started talking about this and at the same time i thought about this massive group of people i knew writers editors journalists
graduate students assistant professors you name it all these people that had sort of flexible daily hours and
an interest in the english word
i hope to have an interest in the english language but i'm not speaking it
well right now i'm trying that clock has got me
written word in terms of nurturing a democracy nurturing an enlightened life and so they had you know their
time and their interest but at the same time there wasn't a conduit that i knew of in my community to bring these two communities together so when i moved back to
we rented this building and the idea was to put mcsweeney 's mcsweeney 's quarterly that we published twice or three times a year
and a few other magazines we were going to
move it into an office for the first time it used to be in my kitchen in brooklyn we were going to move it into an office and we were going to actually share space with a tutoring center so we thought
have all these writers and editors and everybody sort of a writing community coming into the office every day anyway why don't we just open up the front of the building
to come in there after school get extra help on their written homework so you have basically no border between these two communities so
the idea was that we would be working on whatever we're working on at two thirty the students flow in and you put down what you're doing or you trade or you work a little bit later or whatever it is you give those hours in the afternoon to the students in the neighborhood so
so we rented this space and everything was
really and we couldn't think of anything necessarily to sell but we did all the necessary research it used to be a weight room so there were rubber floors below acoustic tile ceilings fluorescent lights we took all that down and we found
beautiful wooden floors whitewashed beams and it had the look while we were renovating this place somebody said you know it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship
and we looked around and somebody else said well you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer and so
that let 's sell pirate supplies
this is the pirate supply store you see this is sort of a sketch i did on a napkin a great carpenter built all this stuff and you see we made it look sort of
pirate supply like here you see planks sold by the foot and we have supplies to combat scurvy we have the peg legs
there that are all handmade and fitted to you up at the top you see the eyepatch display which is the black column there for everyday use your regular eyepatch and then you have the pastel and other colors for stepping out
this is a vat that we fill with treasures that students dig in this is replacement eyes in case you lose one
these are some signs that we have all over the place with pirates
reading the sign we pull a rope behind the counter and
mop heads drop on your head that was just my one thing i said we had to have something that drops on people
it became mop heads and
this is the fish theater which is just a saltwater tank with three seats
and then right behind it
the mcsweeney 's offices where all of us would be working on the magazine and book editing and like that the kids would come in
or we thought they would come in i should back up we set the place up we opened up we spent months and months renovating this place
we had tables chairs computers everything i went to a dot com auction at a holiday inn in palo alto and i bought eleven g four s with a stroke of
we bought em we set everything up and then we waited
and writing related needs just come in it's all free and we thought oh they're going to storm the gates they're gonna love it and they didn 't and so
we waited we sat at the tables we waited and waited and everybody was becoming very discouraged because it was weeks and weeks that we waited really where nobody
came in and then somebody alerted us to the fact that maybe there was a trust gap because
we never put it together you know and so then around that time
i persuaded a woman named nineveh caligari a longtime san francisco educator she was teaching in mexico city
the experience necessary knew everything about education was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood i convinced her to move up from mexico city where she was teaching she took over as executive director immediately
she made the inroads with the teachers and the parents and the students and everything and so suddenly it was actually full every day and what we were trying to offer every day
one on one attention the goal was to have a one to one ratio with every one of these students you know it's been proven that thirty five to forty hours a year with one on one attention a student can get one grade level higher and so
right there the parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tutored so that was the basis of it was one on one attention and we found ourselves full every day with kids if you're on valencia street within those few blocks
around two zero two thirty you will get run over often by the kids and their big backpacks or whatever actually running to this space which is very strange because it's school in a way but
our interns were actually working at the same tables very often and shoulder to shoulder computer next to computer with the students and so it became a tutoring center publishing center is what we called it and a writing center they go
and they might be working with a high school student actually working on a novel because we had very gifted kids too so there's no stigma they're all working next to each other
feeds on each other there's a lot of cross pollination the only problem especially for the adults working at mcsweeney 's who hadn't necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up was that there was just the one like
this is a problem but you know there's something about the kids finishing their homework in a given day working one on one getting all this attention they go home
they don't stall they don't do their homework in front of the tv they're allowed to go home at five thirty enjoy their family enjoy other hobbies get outside
play and that makes a happy family a bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community a bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world so the key to it all is homework
one on one attention so we started off with about twelve volunteers and then we had about fifty and then a couple hundred and we now have one thousand four hundred volunteers on our roster and we make it incredibly easy to volunteer the key thing is
has to be used before two thirty so we started bringing in classes during the day so every day there's a field trip where they together create a book you can see it being typed up above
this is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing you just point a camera at a class and it always looks like this so
this is one of the books that they do notice the title of the book the book that was never checked out titanic and
the first line of that book is
once there was a book named cindy
that was about the titanic so
it completely seriously which blows their mind so then we still had more tutors to use this is a shot of just some of the tutors during one
the teachers that we work with and everything is different to teachers they tell us what to do we went in there thinking we 're ultimately completely malleable you're going to tell us
what about the students that wouldn't come to you necessarily who don't have really active parents that are bringing them or aren't close enough
thousands and thousands more students then another school said well what if we just give you a classroom and you can staff it all day so this is the everett middle school
this is their newspaper the straight up news that has an ongoing column from mayor gavin newsom in both languages english and spanish
so then one day isabel allende wrote to us and said hey why don't you assign a book with high school students i want them to write about how
to achieve peace in a violent world and so we went into thurgood marshall high school which is a school that we had worked with on some other things and
we gave that assignment to the students and we said isabel allende is going to read all your essays at the end she's going to publish them in a book she's going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form it's going to be available
was that outside audience there was isabel allende on the other end i think we had about one hundred and seventy tutors that worked on this book with them
and so this worked out incredibly well we had a big party at the end this is a book that you can find anywhere so that led to a series of these you can see amy tan sponsored the next one i might get somewhere and this became an ongoing thing more and more books now
we're sort of addicted to the book thing the kids will work harder than they've ever worked in their life if they know it's going to be permanent know it's going to be on a shelf know that nobody can diminish what they've thought and said that
words honored their thoughts with hundreds of hours of five drafts six drafts all this attention that we give to their thoughts and
once they achieve that level once they've written at that level they can never go back it's absolutely transformative and so then they're all sold in the store
this is near the planks we sell all the
where else would you put them right so
we sell em and then something weird had been happening with the stores the store actually even though we started out as just a gag the store actually made money
it was paying the rent and
this is just a san francisco thing i don't know i don't want to judge but people would come in and this was before the pirate movies and everything it was making a lot of money not a lot of money but it was paying the rent paying a full time staff member there there's the ocean maps you can see on the left
and it became a gateway to the community people would come in and say what the what is this i don't want to swear on the web
a rule i don't know they would say what is this and people would come in
and learn more about it and then right beyond there's usually a little chain there right beyond they would see the kids
being tutored this is a field trip going on and so they would be shopping and they might be more likely to buy some lard or millet for their parrot or you know a hook or hook protector for nighttime all of these things we sell
so the store actually did really well but it brought in so many people teachers donors volunteers everybody because it was street level it was open to the public it wasn't a non profit buried
you know on the thirtieth floor of some building downtown it was right in the neighborhood that it was serving and it was open all the time to the public so it became this sort of
happy accident so all the people i used to know in brooklyn they said well why don't we have a place like that here and a lot of them had been former educators or would be educators
so they combined with a lot of local designers local writers and they just took the idea independently and they did their own thing
they didn't want to sell pirate supplies they didn't think that that was going to work there so knowing the crime fighting community in new york they opened the brooklyn
company this is sam potts great design that did this and this was to make it look sort of like one of those keysmith 's shops that has to have every service they've ever offered you know all
basic form these are all handmade these are all sort of repurposed other products or whatever all the packaging is done by sam potts so then you have the villain containment unit where kids put their parents
have the office this is a little vault you have put your product in there it goes up an electric lift
do it hand on heart and everything these are some
this is a secret identity kit if you want to take on the identity of sharon boone one american female marketing executive from hoboken new jersey it's a full dossier on everything you would need to know
so this is the capery where
get fitted for your cape and then you walk up these three steel graded steps and then we turn on three hydraulic fans from every side and then you can see the cape in action
there's nothing worse than you know getting up there and the cape is bunching up or something like that
in but it slowly opens you can see it there in the middle next to all the grappling hooks it opens and then this is the tutoring center in the back
this is i just want to emphasize locally funded locally built all the designers all of the builders everybody was local all the time was pro bono i just came and visited and said yes you guys are doing great or whatever that was it you can see the time in all five boroughs of new york in the back
so this is the space during tutoring hours it's very busy same principles one on one attention complete devotion to the students work and a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility of creativity and ideas and
you can read this quote addicted to video games and tv couldn't concentrate at home came in got this concentrated attention and he couldn't escape it so soon enough
he was writing he would finish his homework early got really addicted to finishing his homework early it's an addictive thing to sort of be done with it and to have it checked and to know he 's going to achieve the next thing and be prepared for school the next day
so he got hooked on that and then he started doing other things he 's now been published in five books he co wrote a mockumentary about failed superheroes called super has beens
he wrote a series on penguin
which is a fighting a boxing penguin and then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to five hundred people at symphony space
i'll go through really quickly this is l a the echo park time travel mart whenever you are we're already then
this is sort of a seven eleven for time travelers so you see everything it's exactly as a seven eleven would be leeches mammoth chunks
they even have their own slurpee machine out of order come back yesterday
i'm going to jump ahead these are spaces that are only affiliated with us doing this same thing word st in pittsfield massachusetts ink spot in cincinnati youth speaks san francisco california which inspired
now i'm going to the ted wish
so the ted wish i wish that you you personally and every creative individual and organization you know will find a way to directly engage with a public school in your area and that you'll then tell the story of how you got involved so that within a year we have a thousand examples a thousand
and not i hope we hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in a new era of participation in our public schools we hope that you will take the lead in partnering
a million ways you can walk up to your local school and consult with the teachers they'll always tell you how to help so this is with hot studio in san francisco they did this phenomenal job this website is
and around the world so you go to the website you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by and then you add your own projects once you get started hot studio did a great job in a very tight deadline so visit the site
if you have any questions you can ask this guy who 's our director of national programs he'll be on the phone you email him he'll answer any question you possibly want
and he'll get you inspired and get you going and guide you through the process so that you can affect change and it can be fun that's the point of this talk it needn't be
sterile it needn't be bureaucratically untenable
you can do and use the skills that you
have the schools need you the teachers need you students and parents need you they need your actual person your physical personhood and your open minds and open ears and boundless compassion
sitting next to them listening and nodding and asking questions for hours at a time some of these kids just don't plain know how good they are
how smart and how much they have to say you can tell them you can shine that light on them one human interaction at a time so we hope you'll join us thank you so much
