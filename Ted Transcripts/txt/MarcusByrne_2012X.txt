so the question is where do we start this story and it seems appropriate to start at the end because
this is a waste product that comes out of other animals but it still contains nutrients and there are sufficient nutrients in there for dung beetles basically to make a living and so dung beetles eat
so according to dung beetles dung is pretty good unless you 're prepared to get dung under your fingernails and root through the dung itself you 'll never see ninety percent of the dung beetle species because they go directly into the dung
straight down below it and then they shuttle back and forth between the dung at the soil surface and a nest they make underground so the question is how do they deal with this material and most dung beetles actually wrap it into a package of some sort
ten percent of the species actually make a ball
so this is a very proud owner of a beautiful dung ball you can see it 's a male because he 's got a little hair on the back of his legs there and he 's clearly very pleased about what he 's sitting on there and then he 's about to become a victim of a vicious smash and grab and so valuable resources
have to be looked after and guarded in a particular way and we think the reason they roll the balls away is because of this because of the competition that is involved in getting hold of that dung
so this dung pat was actually well it was a dung pat fifteen minutes before this photograph was taken and we think it 's the intense competition that makes the beetles
so well adapted to rolling balls of dung
its head is down it 's walking backwards it 's the most bizarre way to actually transport your food in any particular direction and at the same time it 's got to deal with the heat this is africa it 's hot so what i want to share with you now are some of the experiments that myself and my colleagues have used
to investigate how dung beetles deal with these problems
deal with these problems so watch this
the first is how it deals with this obstacle that we 've put in its way see look it does a little dance
and then it carries on in exactly the same direction that it took in the first place
so clearly this animal knows where it 's going and it knows where it wants to go and that 's a very very important thing because if you think about it you 're at the dung pile you 've got this great big pie that you want to get away from everybody else and the quickest way to do it is in a straight line
so we gave them some more tasks
so this animal has actually had the whole world turned under its feet it 's turned by ninety degrees but it doesn 't flinch it knows exactly where it wants to go and it heads off in that particular direction
so our next question then was how are they doing this what are they doing and there was a cue that was available to us it was that every now and then they 'd climb on top of the ball and they 'd take a look at the world around
does it does a little double dance
and then it heads back in exactly the same direction it went in the first
but the sun is at the horizon over here and we know that when the sun is at the horizon say it 's over on this side there is a north south a huge pathway across the sky of polarized light that we can 't see that the beetles can see
okay so what we 've got so far is
and it was this particular little behavior the dance
so what are they doing when they do this dance how far can we push them before they will reorientate themselves and in this experiment here what we did was we forced them into a channel
and you can see he wasn 't particularly forced into this particular channel and we gradually displaced the beetle by one hundred and eighty degrees
bush watching dung beetles on nice hot days we noticed that there was another behavior associated with the dance behavior every now and then when they climb on top of the ball they wipe their face
and you see him do it again
now we thought now what could be going on here
clearly the ground is very hot and when the ground is hot they dance more often and when they do this particular dance they wipe the bottom of their face and we thought that it could be a thermoregulatory behavior we thought that maybe what they 're doing is trying to get off the hot soil and also spitting onto their face to cool their head down
so what we did was design a couple of arenas one was hot one was cold we shaded this one we left that one hot and then what we did was we filmed them with a thermal camera so what you 're looking at here
against the background so the background here is around about fifty degrees centigrade
and mine and what 's of interest here is that little brain is quite cool but if we contrast now what happens in a hot environment look at the temperature of the soil it 's up around fifty five to sixty degrees centigrade watch how often the beetle dances
and look at its front legs they 're roaringly hot
so the ball leaves a little thermal shadow and the beetle climbs on top of the ball and wipes its face
and all the time it 's trying to cool itself down we think and avoid the hot sand that it 's walking across and what we did then was put little boots
and if you look over here with boots
this is a dung beetle
can you spot the difference they don 't normally go this slowly it 's in slow motion but it 's walking forwards and it 's actually taking a pellet of dry dung with it
this is a different species in the same genus but exactly the same foraging behavior
now there 's two ways it could be doing that and we can test that by displacing the beetle to a new position when it 's at the foraging site
and what it 's doing here if it 's using path integration is it 's counting its steps or measuring the distance out in this direction it knows the bearing home and it knows it should be in that direction if you displace it it ends up in the wrong place so let 's see what happens
when we put this beetle to the test with a similar experiment so here 's our cunning experimenter
he displaces the beetle and now we have to see
what is going to take place
the forage has been displaced to a new position if he 's using landmark orientation he should be able to find the burrow because he 'll be able to recognize the landmarks around it if he 's using path integration then it should end up in the wrong spot over here so let 's watch what happens
it hasn 't a clue
it starts to search for its house in the right distance away from the food
to find its way around and the callous experimenter leads it
that use a compass and they use the sun as a compass to find their way around and
they have some sort of system for measuring that distance and we know that these species here actually count the steps that 's what they use as an odometer a step counting system to find their way back home we don 't know yet what dung beetles use
so what have we learned from these animals with a brain that 's the size of a grain of rice
well we know that they can roll balls in a straight line using celestial cues
we know that the dance behavior is an orientation behavior and it 's also a thermoregulation behavior and we also know that they use a path integration system for finding their way home so for a small animal dealing with a fairly revolting substance we can actually learn an awful lot
from these things doing behaviors that you and i couldn 't possibly do
