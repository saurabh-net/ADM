i grew up in the middle of nowhere on a dirt road in rural arkansas an hour from the nearest movie theater and i think it was a great place to grow up as an artist because i grew up around quirky colorful characters who were great at making with their hands
on the other side of that though we were big readers in our house and if the tv was on we were watching a documentary and my dad is the most voracious reader i know he can read a novel or two a day but
when i was little i remember he would kill flies in our house with my bb gun and what was so amazing to me about that well he would be in his recliner would holler for me
damage what it landed on so
i should talk about art
i was struck by going to so many one after the other
and the second thing that i was longing for was some more exquisite craftsmanship and technique so
i started thinking and listing what all it was that i thought would make a perfect biennial so i decided i 'm going to start my own biennial i 'm going to organize it and direct it and get it going in the world
so i thought okay i have to have some criteria of how to choose work
worked on until it can speak fluently and then my other second set of rules i hate to say rules because it 's art my criteria would be the three h 's which is head heart and hands and great art would have head it would have
interesting intellectual ideas and concepts it would have heart in that it would have passion and heart and soul and it would have hand in that it would be greatly crafted
so i started thinking about how am i going to do this biennial how am i going to travel the world and find these artists and then i realized one day there 's an easier solution to this
i 'm just going to make the whole thing myself
artists i 'm going to do an international biennial i need artists from all around the world so what i did was i invented a hundred artists from around the world i figured out their bios their passions in life and their art styles and i started making their work
i should start to talk about these guys well the range is quite a bit and i 'm such a technician so i loved this project getting to play with all the techniques
so for example in realist paintings it ranges from this which is kind of old masters style to really realistic still life
to this type of painting where i 'm painting with a single hair and then at the other end there 's performance and short films and indoor installations like this indoor installation and this one
and outdoor installations like this one and
this one i know i should mention i 'm making all these things this isn 't photoshopped i 'm under the river with those fish so now let me introduce some of my fictional artists to you this is nell remmel nell is interested in agricultural processes and her work is based in these practices this piece which is called flipped earth
she was interested in taking the sky and using it to cleanse barren ground and by taking giant mirrors
and this is twenty two feet long and what i loved about her work is when i would walk around it and look down into the sky looking down to watch the sky and it unfolded in a new way and probably the best part of this piece is at dusk and dawn when the twilight wedge has fallen and the ground 's dark
but there 's still the light above bright above and so you 're standing there and everything else is dark but there 's this portal that
you want to jump in this piece was great this is in my parents backyard in arkansas and i love to dig a hole so this piece was great fun because it was two days of digging in soft dirt
the next artist is kay overstry and she 's interested in ephemerality and transience and in her most recent project it 's called weather i made and she 's making weather on her body 's scale and this piece is frost and what she did was she went out on a cold
dry night and breathed back and forth on the lawn to leave
in tokyo and they were interested in developing a new alternative art space and they needed funding for it so they decided to come up with some interesting fundraising projects one of these is scratch off masterpieces laughter and so what
in some way talk about luck or fate or chance those first two are portraits of mega jackpot winners years before and after their win and in this one it 's called drawing the short stick
this artist is gus weinmueller and he 's doing a project a large project called art for the peoples and within this project he 's doing a smaller project called artists in residence and what he does is laughter he
's present he goes in and makes a little abode studio to work out of and he spends that week talking to the family about what do they think great art is he has all these discussions with their family and he digs through everything they have and he finds
materials to make work and he makes a work that answers what they think great art is for this family he made this still life painting and whatever he makes somehow references nesting and space and personal property
this next project this is by jaochim parisvega and he 's interested in
he believes art is everywhere waiting that it just needs a little bit of a push to happen and he provides this push by harnessing natural forces like in his series where he used rain to make paintings
this project is called love nests what he did was to get wild birds to make his art for him so he put the material in places where the birds were going to collect them and they crafted his nests for him and this one 's called lovelock
she was thinking about her friends and family who work in chaos ridden places and developing countries and she was thinking what can i make that would be of value to them in case something bad happens and they have to buy their way across the border or pay off a gunman
and she makes them so they could either be broken up into payments or they could be like these which are leaves that can be payments and so they 're valuable this is precious metals and gemstones and this one had to get broken up he had to break off a piece to get out of egypt recently
this is by a duo michael abernathy and bud holland and they 're interested in creating culture just tradition so what they do is they move into an area and try to establish a new tradition in a small geographic area so
we got a lot of attention when we did it i talked my family
this is by jason birdsong he is interested in how we see as an animal how we are interested in mimicry and camouflage you know we look down a dark alley or a jungle path
trying to make out a face or a creature we just have that natural way of seeing and he plays with this idea and this piece those aren 't actually leaves they 're butterfly specimens who have a natural camouflage
and he pairs these up with paintings like this is a painting of a snake in a box so you open the box and you think whoa there 's a snake in there but it 's actually a painting so he makes these interesting conversations about realism and mimicry and our drive to be fooled by great camouflage
hazel clausen hazel clausen is an anthropologist who took a sabbatical and decided
you know i would learn a lot about culture if i created a culture that doesn 't exist from scratch so that 's what she did she created the swiss people named the uvulites and they have this distinctive yodeling song that they use the uvula for and also they reference how the uvula everything they say is
this is a typical angora embroidery for them this is one of their founders gert schaeffer
this is my aunt irene it was so funny having a fake person who was making fake things and i crack
he even once traded a work of art for a block of government cheese because the person wanted it so badly next is an australian artist janeen jackson and this is from a project of hers called what an artwork does when we 're not watching
next is ginger cheshire this is from a short film of hers called the last person and that 's my cousin and my sister 's dog gabby the next this is by sam sandy
next is by hilda singh and she 's doing a whole project called social outfits next is by vera sokolova and i have to say vera kind of scares me you can 't look her directly in the eyes because she 's kind of scary and
it 's good that she 's not real she 'd be mad that i said that
