some seventeen years ago i became allergic to delhi 's air my doctors told me that my lung capacity had gone down to seventy percent and it was killing me
with the help of iit teri and learnings from nasa we discovered that there are three basic green plants common green plants with which we can grow
all the fresh air we need indoors to keep us healthy we've also found that you can reduce the fresh air requirements into the building while maintaining industry indoor air quality standards
money plant the botanical names are in front
is a plant which removes co two and converts it into oxygen we need four shoulder high plants
and in terms of plant care we need to wipe the leaves every day in delhi and perhaps once a week in cleaner air cities
which is again a common plant and we call it a bedroom plant because it converts co two into oyxgen at night and we need six to eight waist high plants per person
the third plant is money plant and this is again a very common plant preferably grows in hyrdoponics and this particular plant
at all and you would not need any
we have tried these plants at our own building in delhi which is a fifty thousand square feet twenty year old building
the government of india has discovered or published a study to show that this is the healthiest building in new delhi and the study showed that there is
to other buildings there is a reduced incidence of eye irritation by fifty two percent respiratory systems by thirty four percent
and also a reduction in energy requirements in buildings by an outstanding fifteen percent because you need less fresh air
now replicating this in a one seventy five million square feet building which will have sixty thousand indoor plants
why is this important it is also important for the environment because the world 's energy requirements are expected to grow by thirty percent in the next decade forty percent of the world 's energy is taken up by buildings currently and sixty percent of the world 's population will be living in buildings
in cities with a population of over one million in the next fifteen years and there is a growing preference for living and working in air conditioned places
be the change you want to see in the world said mahatma gandhi and thank you for listening
