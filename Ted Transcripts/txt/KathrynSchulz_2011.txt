and a friend and i go on a road trip from providence rhode island to portland oregon
so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests basically the longest route we can possibly take
and somewhere in the middle of south dakota
i turn to my friend
and i ask her a question that 's been bothering me for two thousand miles
what 's up with the chinese character i keep seeing by the side of the road
my friend looks at me totally blankly
and then she cracks up
because she figures out what i 'm talking about
and what i 'm talking about is this
thinking about situations exactly like this
why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us
and how we behave when that happens and what all of this can tell us about human nature in other words as you heard chris say
this might strike you as a strange career move
but it actually has one great advantage no job competition
or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong
we all know everybody in this room makes mistakes the human species in general is fallible okay fine
but when it comes down to me right now
to all the beliefs i hold here in the present tense
and the thing is the present tense is where we live we go to meetings in the present tense we go on family vacations in the present tense we go to the polls and vote in the present tense so effectively we all kind of wind up traveling through life trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything
i think this is a problem
i think it 's a problem for each of us as individuals in our personal and professional lives
and i think it 's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture
so what i want to do today is first of all talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right
and second why it 's such a problem
and finally i want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling
and that if you can do so it is the single greatest moral intellectual and creative leap you can make so
one reason actually has to do with a feeling of being wrong
thank you these are great answers
but they 're answers to a different question
you guys are answering the question how does it feel to realize you 're wrong
in pretty much every episode of this cartoon there 's a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner and the roadrunner runs off a cliff
which is fine he 's a bird he can fly
but the thing is the coyote runs off the cliff right after him and what 's funny at least if you 're six years old is that the coyote 's totally fine too he just keeps running right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he 's in mid air
that 's when he falls
we 're like that coyote
after he 's gone off the cliff and before he looks down
you know we 're already wrong
so i should actually correct something i said a moment ago
it does feel like something to be wrong
think back for a moment to elementary school
so by the time you are nine years old
you 've already learned first of all that people who get stuff wrong are lazy irresponsible dimwits
is to never make any mistakes
we learn these really bad lessons really well
and a lot of us and i suspect especially a lot of us in this room
deal with them by just becoming perfect little a students
at the possibility that we 've gotten something wrong
because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe
so this woman comes in
why is the wrong side of my body in bandages
well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one
when the vice president for health care quality at beth israel spoke about this incident
he said something very interesting
the point of this story
is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side
and when we act like it is and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong
or torpedoing the global economy
so this is a huge practical problem
but it 's also a huge social problem
think for a moment about what it means to feel right
it means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality
it turns out most of us explain those people the same way
when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us
and when that doesn 't work when it turns out that people who disagree with us
have all the same facts we do
and are actually pretty smart
so this is a catastrophe this attachment to our own rightness
keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly
but to me what 's most baffling and most tragic about this
is that it misses the whole point of being human it 's like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds
and we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing
that is not true and if it were life would be incredibly boring
the miracle of your mind
isn 't that you can see the world as it is
it 's that you can see the world as it isn 't
we can remember the past
and we can imagine what it 's like to be some other person in some other place
and we all do this a little differently
and also this and also this and yeah it is also why we get things wrong
i err therefore i am
augustine understood that our capacity to screw up it 's not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system
something we can eradicate or overcome
it 's totally fundamental to who we are
and unlike all of the other animals
we are obsessed with trying to figure it out to me this obsession
is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity
all the stories are about being wrong
and my first thought was
and the crypto theme is i thought this one thing was going to
and something else happened instead
and the thing is says ira glass
we need this we need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work
and for the rest of us audience members as listeners as readers
we eat this stuff up
we love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings
when it comes to our stories
we think this one thing is going to happen
and something else happens instead
george bush thought he was going to invade iraq find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction liberate the people and bring democracy to the middle east
and something else happened instead
and hosni mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of egypt for the rest of his life until he got too old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son
and something else happened instead
grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together
and something else happened instead
and i have to tell you that
i thought i was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize
and something else happened instead
we generate these incredible stories about the world around us
and then the world turns around and astonishes us
no offense but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong
we just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements but you know why we need
boggling and world altering ted one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight
we tell another story we hold another conference
the theme of this one as you guys have now heard seven million times is the rediscovery of wonder
you need to step outside of that tiny terrified space of rightness
and look around at each other
