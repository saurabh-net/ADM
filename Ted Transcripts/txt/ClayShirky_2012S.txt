this is a hand lettered sign that appeared in a mom and pop bakery in my old neighborhood in brooklyn a few years ago
the store owned one of those machines that can print on plates of sugar and kids could bring in drawings and have the store print a sugar plate for the top of their birthday
and it 's a copyright violation and policing copyright violations for children 's birthday cakes was such a hassle
you have to use one of our prefab images
one is called sopa the other is called
of copyright compliance to the point where people simply get out of the business of offering it as a capability
now the domain name system is the thing that turns human readable names like
and you 'd think that would be a pretty big problem for a law but congress seems not to have let that bother them
so the policing layer around the problem becomes the real threat
if you were making a tv show it didn 't have to be better than all other tv shows ever made
it only had to be better than the two other shows that were on at the same
this is like having a license to print money and a barrel of free
we do like to consume but every time one of these new tools came
it turned out we also like to produce and we like to share
and this freaked the media businesses out it freaked them out every time jack valenti who was the head lobbyist for the motion picture association of america
once likened the ferocious video cassette recorder to jack the ripper and poor helpless hollywood to a woman at home alone that was the level of rhetoric
and so the media industries begged insisted demanded that congress do something
but this taping business fine
on the idea of legal versus illegal distinctions for copying because it was clear that if congress was acting in their framework they might actually increase the rights of citizens to participate in our own media
was that it was legal to sell you uncopyable digital material
except that there 's no such things as uncopyable digital material it would be as ed felton once famously said like handing out water that wasn 't wet bits are copyable that 's what computers do that is a side effect of their ordinary operation
so in order to fake the ability to sell uncopyable bits the dmca also made it legal to force you to use systems that broke the copying function of your devices every dvd player and game player and television and computer you brought home no matter what you thought you were getting when you bought
on the legal system of distinguishing between legal and illegal copying and simply tried to prevent copying through technical
the mixtape the fanzine that was nothing compared to what we 're seeing now with the internet we are in a world where most
but where the dmca was surgical we want to go down into your computer we want to go down into your television set down into your game machine and prevent it from doing what they said it would do at the store pipa and sopa are nuclear
and because the biggest producers of content on the internet are not because in the end
so what pipa and sopa risk doing is taking a centuries old legal concept
innocent until proven guilty and reversing you can 't share
you can 't share until you show us
that you 're not sharing something we don
to police a user that will crush a service with a hundred million
imagine this sign everywhere except imagine it doesn 't say college bakery
and the people who provide those capabilities to us the youtubes the facebooks the twitters
call your representative call your senator
what you see is that they have cumulatively received millions and millions of dollars from the traditional media
and you can ask not to be treated like a thief
and if you 're not an american citizen you can contact american citizens that you know and encourage them to do the same because this seems like a national issue but it is not
because the whole business of actually suggesting that someone is breaking the law and then gathering evidence and proving
that that turns out to be really inconvenient we convince
congress that the way to deal with copyright violation is the way copyright
that 's the way to handle this in the meantime the hard thing to do is to be ready because that 's the real message
