want to talk to you today about a difficult topic that is close to me and closer than you might realize to you
i came to the u k twenty one years ago as an asylum seeker i was twenty one i was forced to leave the democratic republic of the congo
my home where i was a student activist
i would love my children to be able to meet my family in the congo
how naturally your finger slides towards the buttons
but what you hold in your hand leaves a bloody trail
it would be great if the story ended there unfortunately what you hold in your hand has not only
rape is used as a weapon of war instilling fear and depopulating whole areas the quest for extracting this mineral has not only aided but it has fueled
the ongoing war in the congo
but don 't throw away your phones yet thirty thousand children are enlisted and are made to fight
the congo consistently scores dreadfully in global health and poverty rankings
but remarkably the u n environmental programme has estimated the wealth of the country to be over twenty four trillion dollars
the state regulated mining industry has collapsed and control over mines has splintered coltan is easily controlled by armed groups
that has brought this situation to our attention we only know so much about the situation in the congo and in the mines because of the kind of communication the mobile phone allows
as with the arab spring during the recent elections in the congo voters were able to send text messages of local polling stations to the headquarters in the capital kinshasa
and in the wake of the result the diaspora has joined with the carter center the catholic church
the mobile phone has given people around the world
so we are faced with a paradox the mobile phone is an instrument of freedom and an instrument of oppression
who makes it and for what
here i am speaking directly to you the ted community and
all those who might be watching on a screen on your phone across the world in the congo all the technology is in place for us to communicate and all the technology is in place to communicate this at the moment
there is no clear fair trade solution
but there has been a huge amount of progress the u s has recently passed legislation to target bribery and misconduct in the congo recent u k legislation could be used in the same way
there are campaigns spreading across university campuses to make their colleges conflict free but we 're not there yet we need to continue mounting pressure
on phone companies to change their sourcing processes
when i first came to the u k twenty one years ago i was homesick i missed my family and the friends i left behind communication was extremely difficult sending and receiving letters took months if you were lucky
why should we allow such a wonderful brilliant and necessary product to be the cause of unnecessary suffering for human beings
