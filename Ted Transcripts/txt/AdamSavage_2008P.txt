the new yorker published an article about a cache of dodo bones that was found in a pit on the island of mauritius now the island of
is a small island off the east coast of madagascar in the indian ocean and it is the place where the dodo bird was discovered
and extinguished all within about one hundred and fifty years everyone was very excited about this archeological find because it meant that they might finally be able to assemble a single dodo skeleton see
while museums all over the world have dodo skeletons in their collection nobody not even the actual natural history museum on the island of mauritius has a skeleton that's made from the bones of a single dodo
isn't exactly true the fact is is that the british museum had a complete specimen of a dodo in their collection up until the eighteenth century it was actually mummified skin and all
but in a fit of space saving zeal they actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet and they burned the rest in a bonfire if you go look at their website today they'll actually list these specimens saying the rest was lost in a fire
not quite the whole truth anyway the frontispiece of this article was this photo and i'm one of the people that thinks that tina brown was great for bringing photos to the new yorker because this photo
completely rocked my world i became obsessed with the object not just the beautiful photograph itself and the color the shallow depth of field the detail that's visible the wire you can see on the beak there that the conservator used to put this skeleton together there's an entire story here
and i thought to myself wouldn't it be great
if i had my own dodo skeleton
and so i want to point out here at this point that
my life obsessed by objects and the stories that they tell and this was the very latest one so i began looking around for to see if anyone sold a
some kind of model that i could get and i found lots of reference material lots of lovely pictures no dice no dodo skeleton for me but
the damage had been done i had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons into my creative projects folder it's a repository for my brain everything that i could possibly be interested in
any time i have an internet connection there's a sluice of stuff moving into there everything from beautiful rings to cockpit photos the key that the marquis du lafayette sent to george washington to celebrate the storming of the
russian nuclear launch key the one on the top is the picture of the one i found on ebay the one on the bottom is the one i made for myself because i couldn't afford the one on
maybe yeah maybe i could make my own dodo skull
i should point out at this time i'm not a sculptor i'm a hard edged model maker you give me a drawing you give me a prop to replicate you give me a
something like this my friend mike murnane sculpted this it's a maquette for star wars episode two this is not my thing i this is something other people do dragons soft things however
i felt like i had looked at enough photos of dodo skulls to actually be able to understand the topology and perhaps replicate it i mean it couldn't be that difficult so
i started looking at the best photos i could find i grabbed all the reference and i found this lovely piece of reference this is someone selling this on ebay it was a woman 's clearly a woman a s hand hopefully a woman 's hand
as size reference for figuring out exactly how big the beak should be exactly how long et cetera et cetera and over a few hours i eventually achieved what was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull and i didn't mean to continue
i it's kind of like you know you can only clean a super messy room by picking up one thing at a time you can't think about the totality i wasn't thinking about a dodo skeleton i just noticed that as i finished this skull the armature wire that i had been used to holding it up
was sticking out of the back just where a spine would be and one of the other things i'd been interested in and obsessed with over the years is spines and skeletons having collected a couple of hundred
i actually understood the mechanics of vertebrae enough to kind of start to imitate them and so button by button vertebrae by vertebrae i built my way down
and actually by the end of the day i had a reasonable skull a moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis
and again i kept on going looking for more reference every bit of reference i could find drawings beautiful photos this guy i love this guy he put a dodo leg bones in a scanner with a ruler
you can see that i even made a museum label for it that includes a brief history of the dodo and tap plastics made me although i didn't photograph it a museum vitrine i don't have the room for this in my house
but i had to finish what i had started and this actually represented kind of a sea change to me again like i said my life has been about being fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell and also making them for myself obtaining them appreciating them
and diving into them and in this folder creative projects there are tons of projects that i'm currently working on projects that i've already worked on things that i might want to work on some day and things that i may just want to find and buy and have and and look at and touch
but now there was potentially this new category of things that i could sculpt that was different that i you know i have my own r two d two but that's honestly relative to sculpting to me that's easy and so i went back and looked through my creative projects folder and i happened across the maltese falcon now
this is funny for me to fall in love with an object from a hammett novel because if it's true that the world is divided into two types of people chandler people and hammett people i am absolutely a chandler person but in this case
it's not about it's not about the author it's not about the book or the movie or the story it's about the object in and of itself and in this case this object is
plays on a host of
and it is very likely the object from which hammett drew his inspiration for the maltese falcon then there is the fictional bird the one that hammett created for the book built out of words it is the engine that drives the plot of his book and also the movie
in which another object is created a prop that has to represent the thing that hammett created out of words inspired by the kniphauser hawk and this represents the falcon in the movie and then there is this fourth level which is
a whole new object in the world the prop made for the movie the representative of the thing becomes in its own right a whole other thing a whole new object of desire
and so i contacted an antiquarian bookseller who had the original christie 's catalogue and in it i found this magnificent picture which included a size reference i was able to scan the picture blow it up to exactly full size
it was made out of resin which wasn't a common material for movie props about the time the movie was made it's funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it because i can see it compared to
this thing and i can tell you it's real it's the real thing it's made from the exact same mold that this one is in this one because the auction was actually so controversial profiles in history the auction house that sold this
and other side elevation so now i had all the topology i needed to replicate the maltese falcon what do they do how do you start something like that i really don't know so what i did was again like i did with the dodo skull i blew all my reference up to full size
feather by feather detail by detail i worked out and achieved working in front of the television and super sculpey here 's me sitting next to my wife it's the only picture i took of the entire process as i moved through i achieved
so i went down to my shop and i molded it and i cast it in resin
i ended up with this my maltese falcon and it's beautiful and i can state with authority at this point in time when i'd finished it of all of the replicas out there and there is a few
this is by far the most accurate representation of the original maltese falcon than anyone has sculpted now the original one i should tell you is sculpted by a guy named fred sexton this is where it gets weird
the los angeles county museum of art had a plaster original of the maltese falcon one of the original six plasters i think made for the movie stolen out of the museum a lot of people thought it was a publicity stunt for the movie
john 's grill which actually is seen briefly in the maltese falcon is still a viable san francisco eatery counted amongst its regular customers elisha cook who played wilmer cook in the movie and he gave them one of his original plasters
of the maltese falcon and they had it in their cabinet for about fifteen years until it got stolen in january of two thousand and seven
it would seem that the object of desire only comes into its own by disappearing repeatedly so here i had this falcon and it was lovely
it looked really great it the light worked on it really well it was better than anything that i could achieve or obtain out in the world but there was a problem and the problem was was that
the entirety of the object i wanted the weight behind the object this thing was made of resin and it was too light
there's this group online that i frequent it's a group of prop crazies just like me called the replica props forum and it's people who trade make and travel in information about movie props and it turned out that one of the guys there
a friend of mine that i never actually met but befriended through some prop deals was the manager of a local foundry he took my master falcon pattern he actually did lost wax casting
in bronze for me and this is the bronze i got back and this is after some acid etching the one that i ended up with and this thing it's deeply deeply satisfying to me here i'm going to i going to put it out there
later on tonight and you can a i want you to pick it yeah i
there you can see it's weighing in at twenty seven and a half pounds that's half the weight of my dog huxley
but there's a problem now
here 's the most recent progression of falcons on the far left is a piece of crap a replica i bought on ebay there's my somewhat ruined sculpey falcon because i had to get it back out of the mold there's my first casting there's my master and there's my bronze
that happens when you mold and cast things which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin you lose a little bit of volume you lose a little bit of size and when i held my bronze one up against my sculpey one it was shorter by three quarters of an inch
why didn't i remember this why didn't i start and make it bigger so what do i do i figure i have two options one
and blown this up big enough to make a three d lithography master of this which i will polish then i will send to the mold maker and then i will have it done in bronze
there are several people who own originals and i have been attempting to contact them and reach them hoping that they will let me spend
few minutes in the presence of one of the real birds maybe to take a picture or even to pull out the hand held laser scanner that i happen to own that fits inside a cereal box
and could maybe without even touching their bird i swear get a perfect three d scan and i'm even willing to sign pages saying that i'll never let anyone else have it except for me in my office i promise i'll give them one if they want it and
then maybe then i'll achieve the end of this exercise but really if we're all going to be honest with ourselves i have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise was never the point of the exercise to begin with was it about four years
