what would happen with society if there was no religion or if there was less religion and so he painted this famous painting the garden of earthly delights which some have interpreted
much later as a student i went to a very different garden a zoological garden in arnhem where we keep chimpanzees this is me at an early age with a baby chimpanzee
i discovered there that the chimpanzees are very power hungry and wrote a book about it and
this is the launch of my book i 'm not sure how well the chimpanzees read it but they surely seemed interested in the book
and so what you see here is two males who have had a fight they ended up in a tree and one of them holds out a hand to the other and about a second after i took the picture they came together in the fork of the tree and they kissed and embraced each other now this is very interesting because
a valuable relationship that is damaged by conflict so you need to do something about it so my whole picture of the animal kingdom and including humans also started to change at that time
so we have this image in political science economics the humanities philosophy for that matter that man is a wolf to man and so deep down our nature 's actually nasty i think it 's a very unfair image for the wolf
the wolf is after all a very cooperative animal and that 's why many of you have a dog at home which has all these characteristics also and it 's really unfair to humanity because humanity is actually much more cooperative and empathic than given credit for so i started getting interested in those issues and studying that in other animals
so these are the pillars of morality if you ask anyone what is morality based on these are the two factors that always come out one is reciprocity and associated with it is a sense of justice and a sense of fairness and the other one is empathy and compassion and
human morality is more than this but if you would remove these two pillars there would be not much remaining i think and so they 're absolutely essential so let me give you a few examples here this is a very old video from the yerkes primate center where they train chimpanzees to cooperate
so this is already about a hundred years ago that we were doing experiments on cooperation what you have here is two young chimpanzees who have a box and the box is too heavy for one chimp to pull in and of course there 's food on the box otherwise they wouldn 't be pulling so hard and so they 're bringing in the box
and you can see that they 're synchronized you can see that they work together they pull at the same moment it 's already a big advance over many other animals who wouldn 't be able to do that and now you 're going to get a more interesting picture because now one of the two chimps has been fed so one of the two is not really interested in the task anymore
now look at what happens at the very end of this everything
the second one is that the partner is willing to work even though he 's not interested in the food why would that be well that probably has to do with reciprocity there 's actually a lot of evidence in primates and other animals that they return favors so he will get a return favor at some point in the future and so that 's how this all operates
we do the same task with elephants now with elephants it 's very dangerous to work with elephants another problem with elephants is that you cannot make an apparatus that is too heavy for a single elephant
now you can probably make it but it 's going to be a pretty flimsy apparatus i think and so what we did in that case we do these studies in thailand for josh plotnik
tape you 're going to see is two elephants who are released together arrive at the apparatus the apparatus is on the left with food on it
and so they come together they arrive together they pick it up together and they pull together so it 's actually fairly simple for them
that 's how they bring it in but now we 're going to make it more difficult because the whole purpose of this experiment is to see how well they understand cooperation do they understand that as well as the chimps for example
and so what we do in the next step is we release one elephant before the other and that elephant needs to be smart enough to stay there and wait and not pull at the rope because if he pulls at the rope it disappears and the whole test is over now this elephant does something illegal that we did not teach it
but it shows the understanding that he has because he puts his big foot on the rope stands on the rope and waits there for the other and then the other is going to do all the work
for him so it 's what we call freeloading
and is going to pull it in the
this was the cooperation reciprocity part now something on empathy
empathy is my main topic at the moment of research and empathy has sort of two qualities one is the understanding part of it this is just a regular definition the ability to understand and share the feelings of another and the emotional part and so empathy has basically two channels
and that 's more limited there 's few animals i think elephants and apes can do that kind of thing but there are very few animals who can do that
people who have problems with empathy such as autistic children they don 't have yawn contagion so it is connected and we study that in our chimpanzees by presenting them with an animated head so that 's what you see on the upper left
an animated head that yawns and there 's a chimpanzee watching an actual real chimpanzee watching a computer screen on which we play these animations
so yawn contagion that you 're probably all familiar with and maybe you 're going to start yawning soon now
and that 's related to that whole body channel of synchronization that underlies empathy and that is universal in the mammals basically
now we also study more complex expressions this is consolation this is a male chimpanzee who has lost a fight and he 's screaming and a juvenile comes over and puts an arm around him and calms him down that 's consolation it 's very similar to human consolation
we also recently published an experiment you may have heard about it 's on altruism and chimpanzees where the question is do chimpanzees care about the welfare of somebody else
can do that that only humans worry about the welfare of somebody else now we did a very simple experiment
we do that on chimpanzees that live in lawrenceville in the field station of yerkes and so that 's how they live and we call them into a room and do experiments with them in this case we put two chimpanzees side by side and one has a bucket full of tokens
and the tokens have different meanings one kind of token feeds only the partner who chooses the other one feeds both of them so this is a study we did with vicky horner
and here you have the two color tokens so they have a whole bucket full of them
and they have to pick one of the two colors
you will see how that goes
so if this chimp makes the selfish choice which is the red token in this case
so it doesn 't matter whatsoever and she should actually be choosing blindly
it 's as if they 're saying if you 're not behaving i 'm not going to be pro social today and this is what happens without a partner when there 's no partner sitting there and so we found that the chimpanzees do care about the well being of somebody else especially these are other members of their own group
so the final experiment that i want to mention to you is our fairness study
so what we did is we put two capuchin monkeys side by side again these animals they live in a group they know each other we take them out of the group put them in a test chamber and there 's a very simple task that they need to do and if you give both of them cucumber
so that 's the experiment we did recently we videotaped it with new monkeys who 'd never done the task thinking that maybe they would have a stronger reaction and that turned out to be right the one on the left
so she gives a rock to us that 's the task
and we give her a piece of cucumber and she eats it the other one needs to give a rock to us
and that 's what she does and she gets a grape
and she eats it the other one sees that she gives a rock to us now gets again cucumber
she tests a rock now against the wall she needs to give it to us
so this is basically the wall street protest that
let me tell you i still have two minutes left let me tell you a funny story about this
this study became very famous and we got a lot of comments especially anthropologists economists
philosophers they didn 't like this at all because they had decided in their minds i believe that fairness is a very complex issue and that animals cannot have it and so one philosopher even wrote us that it was impossible that monkeys had a sense of fairness because fairness was invented during the french revolution
a couple of combinations of chimpanzees where indeed the one who would get the grape would refuse the grape until the other guy also got a grape so we 're getting very close to the human sense of fairness and i think philosophers need to rethink their philosophy for awhile
so let me summarize i believe there 's an evolved morality i think morality is much more than what i 've been talking about but
it would be impossible without these ingredients that we find in other primates which are empathy and consolation pro social tendencies and reciprocity and a sense of fairness and so we work on these particular issues to see if we can create a morality from the bottom up so to speak without necessarily god and religion involved
and to see how we can get to an evolved morality and i thank you for your attention
