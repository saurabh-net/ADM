it 's increasingly irrelevant to the kinds of decisions we face that have to do with global pandemics
a cross border problem with hiv a transnational problem with markets and immigration something that goes beyond national borders with terrorism with war all now cross border problems in fact we live in a twenty first century world of
interdependence and brutal interdependent problems and when we look for solutions in politics and in democracy
we are faced with political institutions designed four hundred years ago
autonomous sovereign nation states with jurisdictions and territories separate from one another each claiming to be able to solve the problem of its own people
twenty first century transnational world of problems and challenges seventeenth century world of political institutions in that dilemma lies the central problem of democracy
and my suggestion is that we change the subject
that we stop talking about nations about bordered states and we start talking about cities because i think you will find when we talk about cities we are talking about
the political institutions in which civilization and culture were born we are talking about the cradle of democracy we are talking about the venues in which those public spaces where we come together to create democracy and at the same time
protest those who would take our freedom take place think
are the public spaces where we announce ourselves as citizens as participants as people with the right to write our own narratives
cities are not only the oldest of institutions they 're the most enduring if you think about it
constantinople istanbul much older than turkey alexandria much older
are the places where we are born grow up are educated work marry pray play get old and in time die they are home
very different than nation states which are abstractions we pay taxes we vote occasionally
we watch the men and women we choose rule rule more or less without us not so in those homes known as our towns and cities where we live moreover today more than half of the world 's population
live in cities in the developed world it 's about seventy eight percent more than three out of four people live in urban institutions urban places in cities today
so cities are where the action is cities are us aristotle said in the ancient world man is a political animal i say we are an urban animal we are an urban species at home in our cities
so to come back to the dilemma if the dilemma is we have old fashioned political nation states unable to govern the world respond to the global challenges that we face like climate
change then maybe it 's time for mayors to rule the world for mayors and the citizens and the peoples they represent to engage
in global governance when i say if mayors ruled the world when i first came up with that phrase it occurred to me that actually they already do
there are scores of international inter city cross border institutions networks of cities in which cities are already quite quietly
below the horizon working together to deal with climate change to deal with security to deal with immigration to deal with all of those tough interdependent problems that we face
they have strange names uclg united cities and local governments iclei the
international council for local environmental issues
and the list goes on citynet in asia city protocol a new organization out of barcelona that is using the web to share best practices among countries and then all the things we know a little better the u s conference of mayors the mexican conference of mayors the european conference
of mayors mayors are where this is happening and so the question is
how can we create a world in which mayors and the citizens they represent play a more prominent role well
to understand that we need to understand
why cities are special why mayors are so different than prime ministers and presidents because
my premise is that a mayor and a prime minister are at the opposite ends of a political spectrum
to be a prime minister or a president you have to have an ideology you have to have a meta narrative you have to have a theory of how things work you have to belong to a party independents on the whole don 't get elected to office
but mayors are just the opposite mayors are pragmatists they 're problem solvers their job is to get things done and if they don 't they 're out of a job
mayor nutter of philadelphia said we could never get away here in philadelphia with the stuff that goes on in washington the paralysis the non action the inaction why because potholes have to get filled
because the trains have to run because kids have to be able to get to school and that 's what we have to do and to do that is about pragmatism in that deep american sense reaching outcomes washington
spare me your sermons and i will fix your sewers
strange term but in some ways he is he 's a libertarian
twenty years mayor in moscow though he helped found a party united party with putin in fact refused to be defined by the party and finally in fact lost his job not under brezhnev not under gorbachev but under putin who wanted a more faithful party follower
so mayors are pragmatists and problem solvers they get things done but the second thing about mayors is they are also what i like to call homeboys
or to include the women mayors homies they 're from the neighborhood they 're part of the neighborhood they 're known ed koch used to wander around new york city saying how am i doing
imagine david cameron wandering around the united kingdom asking how am i doing he wouldn 't like the answer or putin or any national leader he could ask that because he knew new yorkers and they knew him
mayors are usually from the places they govern it 's pretty hard to be a carpetbagger and be a mayor you can run for the senate out of a different state but it 's hard to do that as a mayor
and as a result mayors and city councillors and local authorities have a much higher trust level and this is the third feature about mayors than national governing officials in the united states we know the pathetic figures eighteen percent of americans approve
of congress and what they do and even with a relatively popular president like obama
to seventy seventy five even eighty percent because they 're from the neighborhood because the people they work with are their neighbors because like mayor booker in newark a mayor is likely to get out of his car on the way to work and go in and pull people out of a burning building profoundly multicultural open
participatory democratic able to work with one another when states face each other china and the u s they face each other like this
when cities interact they interact like this
china and the u s despite the recent meta meeting in california are locked in all kinds of anger resentment and rivalry for number one we heard more about who will be number one
cities don 't worry about number one they have to work together and they do work together they work together in climate change for example
organizations like the c forty like iclei which i mentioned have been working together
many many years before copenhagen in copenhagen four or five years ago one hundred and eighty four nations came together to explain to one another why their sovereignty didn 't permit them to deal with the grave grave crisis of climate change
but the mayor of copenhagen had invited
two hundred mayors to attend they came they stayed and they found ways and are still finding ways to work together city to city and through inter city organizations eighty percent of carbon emissions come from cities
which means cities are in a position to solve the carbon problem or most of it whether or not the states of which they are a part make agreements with one another and they are doing it los angeles cleaned up its port which was forty percent of carbon emissions
and as a result got rid of about twenty percent of carbon new york has a program to upgrade its old buildings make them better insulated in the winter
allowed surface buses to run in effect like subways express buses with corridors it helped unemployment because people could get across town and it had a profound impact on climate as well as many other things there singapore
as it developed its high rises and its remarkable public housing also developed an island of parks and if you go there you 'll see how much of it is green land and park land cities are doing this but not just one by one they are doing it together they are
sharing what they do and they are making a difference by shared best practices
bike shares many of you have heard of it started twenty or thirty years ago in latin america now it 's in hundreds of cities around the world pedestrian zones congestion fees emission limits in cities like california cities have there 's lots and lots that cities can do even when opaque
stubborn nations refuse to act so what 's the bottom line here
the bottom line is we still live politically in a world of borders a world of boundaries a world of walls a world where states refuse
to act together yet we know that the reality we
medecins sans frontieres of economics and technology without borders of education without borders of terrorism and war without borders that
the failure to address all of these transnational problems but we will risk losing democracy itself locked up in the old nation state box unable to address global problems democratically
so where does that leave us i 'll tell you the road to global democracy doesn 't run through states it runs through cities democracy was born in the ancient polis
i believe it can be reborn in the global cosmopolis in that journey from polis to cosmopolis
we can rediscover the power of democracy on a global level we can create not a league of nations which failed but a league of cities not a united or a dis united nations
but united cities of the world we can create a global parliament of mayors
that 's an idea it 's in my conception of the coming world but it 's also on the table in city halls in seoul korea in amsterdam in hamburg
and in new york mayors are considering that idea of how you can actually constitute a global parliament of mayors and i love that idea because a parliament of mayors is a parliament of citizens and a parliament of citizens
citizens without borders i think it 's the citizens of ted
who show the promise to be those citizens without borders i am ready
to reach out and embrace a new global democracy to take back our democracy and the only question is are you thank you so much my fellow
