was one of many fellow inmates who had big plans for the future
he had a vision when he got out he was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight and he was actually working on merging his two passions into one vision
he 'd spent ten thousand dollars to buy a website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars
and i was learning quickly that it wasn 't what you see on tv in fact it was teeming with smart ambitious men whose business instincts were in many cases as sharp as those of the ceos who had wined and dined me six months earlier when i was a rising star in the missouri senate
now ninety five percent of the guys that i was locked up with had been drug dealers on the outside but when they talked about what they did
they talked about it in a different jargon but the business concepts that they talked about weren 't unlike those that you 'd learn in a first year mba class at wharton promotional incentives you never charge a first time user focus grouping new product launches
territorial expansion but they didn 't spend a lot of time reliving the glory days for the most part everyone was just trying to survive
it 's a lot harder than you might think contrary to what most people think
people don 't pay taxpayers don 't pay for your life when you 're in prison you 've got to pay for your own life you 've got to pay for your soap your deodorant toothbrush toothpaste all of it
for dollar five point two five not an hour but per month
so how do you survive well you learn to hustle
there 's sort of illegal hustles like you run a barbershop out of your cell
there 's pretty illegal hustles you run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell and there 's very illegal hustles which you smuggle in you get smuggled in drugs pornography cell phones and just as in the outer world
there 's a risk reward tradeoff so the riskier the enterprise the more profitable it can potentially be you want a cigarette in prison three to five dollars
you want an old fashioned cell phone that you flip open and is about as big as your head three hundred bucks you want a dirty magazine well it can be as much as one thousand dollars
so as you can probably tell one of the defining aspects of prison life is ingenuity
whether it was concocting delicious meals from stolen scraps from the warehouse
sculpting people 's hair with toenail clippers or constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags tied on to tree limbs prisoners learn how to make do with less and many of them want to take this ingenuity that they 've learned to the outside
and start restaurants barber shops personal training businesses but there 's no training nothing to prepare them for that no rehabilitation at all in prison no one to help them write a business plan
figure out a way to translate the business concepts they intuitively grasp into legal enterprises no access to the internet even and then when they come out most states don 't even have a law prohibiting employers from discriminating against people with a background
so none of us should be surprised that two out of three ex offenders re offend within five years
look i lied to the feds i lost a year of my life from it but when i came out i vowed
so i hope that you 'll think about helping in some way the best thing we can do is figure out ways to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit and the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons because if we don 't they 're not going to learn any new skills that 's going to help them and they 'll be right back
