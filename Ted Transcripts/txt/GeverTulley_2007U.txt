welcome to five dangerous things you should let your children do i don't have children i borrow my friends children so
this advice with a grain of salt
i'm a contract computer scientist by trade but i'm the founder of something called the tinkering school
it's a summer program which aims to help kids to learn how to build the things that they think of so we build a lot of things and
i do put power tools into the hands of second graders so if you're thinking about sending your kid to tinkering school they do come back bruised scraped and bloody so
you know we live in a world that's subjected to ever more stringent child safety regulations there doesn't seem to be any limit on
how crazy child safety regulations can get we put suffocation warnings on all the on every piece of plastic film manufactured in the united states or for sale with an item in the united states
we put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot and we seem to think that any item
sharper than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of ten so where does this trend stop
when we round every corner and eliminate every sharp object every pokey bit in the world then
the first time that kids come in contact with anything sharp or not made out of round plastic they'll hurt themselves with it so
as the boundaries of what we determine as the safety zone grow ever smaller we cut off our children from valuable opportunities to learn how to interact with the world around them
and despite all of our best efforts and intentions kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous thing they can in whatever environment they can
so despite the provocative title this presentation is really about safety and about some simple things that we can do to raise our kids to be
book is called fifty dangerous things this is five dangerous things
number one play with fire learning to control
one of the most elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment in any child 's personal history whether we remember it or not
it's a it's the first time we really get control of one of these mysterious things these mysteries are only revealed to those who get the opportunity to play with it
so playing with fire this is like one of the great things we ever discovered fire
from playing with it they learn some basic principles about fire about intake about combustion about exhaust these are the three working elements of fire that you have to have to have a good controlled fire and
you can think of the open pit fire as a laboratory you don't know what they're going to learn from playing with it you know let them fool around with it on their own terms and
trust me they're going to learn things that you can't get out of playing with dora the explorer toys
number two own a pocket knife pocket knives are kind of drifting out of our cultural consciousness which i think is a terrible thing
your first your first pocket knife is like the first universal tool that you're given you know it's a spatula it's a pry bar it's a screwdriver and it's a blade and
it's a powerful and empowering tool and in a lot of cultures they give knives like as soon as they're toddlers they have knives these are inuit children cutting whale blubber
i first saw this in a canadian film board film when i was ten and it left a lasting impression to see babies playing with knives and it shows that kids can develop an extended sense of self through a tool at a very young age
you lay down a couple of very simple rules always cut away from your body keep the blade sharp never force it and these are things kids can understand and practice with and yeah they're going to cut themselves i have some terrible scars on my legs from where i stabbed myself
but you know they're young they heal fast
but when you exercise them any given muscles adds strength to the whole system and that applies to your brain too so
three d understanding and structural problem solving so it gives a sense it helps develop their visualization skills and their predictive ability
and throwing is a combination of analytical and physical skill so it's very good for that kind of whole body training
these kinds of target based practice also helps kids develop attention and concentration skills so those are great number
to my school and we'll take it apart with them even if you don't know what the parts are puzzling out what they might be for is a really good
practice for the kids to get sort of the sense that they can take things apart and no matter how complex they are
they can understand parts of them and that means that eventually they can understand all of them it's a sense of knowability that something is knowable so
these black boxes that we live with and take for granted are actually complex things made by other people and you can understand them number five
parter break the digital millennium copyright act
there are laws beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit how we can interact with the things that we own in this case digital media
get broken by accident and that laws have to be interpreted and it's something we often talk about with the kids when
we're fooling around with things and breaking them open and taking them apart and using them for other things and also when we go out and
drive a car doctoriving a car is a is a really empowering act for a young child so this is the
for those of you who aren't comfortable actually breaking the law you can drive a car with your child
this is this is a great stage for a kid this happens about the same time that they get latched onto things like dinosaurs these big
things in the outside world that they're trying to get a grip on a car is a similar object and they can get in a car and drive it and that's a really
like it gives them a handle on a world in a way that they wouldn't that they don't often have access to so
it's perfectly legal find a big empty lot make sure there's nothing in it and it's on private property and let them drive your car it's very safe actually and it's fun for the whole
so let 's see i think that's it that's number five and a half ok
