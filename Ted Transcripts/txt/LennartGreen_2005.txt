the master of shortcuts it's of course nature but i will demonstrate ways to get
to get rid of difficulties and go to the point to find an answer probably much quicker than arthur did so violate the common sense
up if you do this
the common the logic says you must turn the i will first
how you can do it without moving the wrist right molded
right molded and i
over the heart don't move the wrist
forward don't move the wrist
don't move the wrist over the heart
to this position from this without moving the wrist now the shortcut
but it was six six moves now with one
i start here palm down you can follow that was the warming
that was the warming no
and you can sit over there one item here was water right
i will give my tribute to water
i think it's enough with water for me the other guys can talk about
control cards and so on and
to do it quick i work with so
i have studied the poker i like i don't gamble but
i don't gamble but so if we are
if we have a five person and i will do a five handed poker game
now i will interact so a different
the time so not the same person can answer so we have an agreement
which one shall have a good
which number one two three four or five
to make it a little the critical moment is
if a card shark gather the card together immediately when he
he deals the card now
so i think number three i have arranged them in a full house with queens i will explain
i will explain five i start with
so here you see the contrast when i
also the other hand is good if all the other guys has good hands too so these guys has actually a a kind
no reaction that with even ok and this these look in order i'm probably hopefully
three four five six seven
i will have the winning hand ten jack queen king ace yeah
mix them now if you are interested i will demonstrate some
i work with kind of estimation shuffle tracking
the first term is estimation
here i can estimate exactly how many cards are put between the my royal flush
of course i can count the card but this is much quicker right you agree
so here i have actually
i know exactly where the cards are so here i can make a bet and this is actually one of the points where i get my money so here ten jack queen king next is a
i do it quick i call this
so here i think i i know about where the cards are i
the cards and you'll say stop when i point to
here you see some are missing and that's the
now another term called shuffle tracking shuffle tracking means i keep track of the
even if another person person shuffle this is a little risky so because if you look now i can still see it you agree
have to calculate but actually i don't like to calculate i work direct with the right brain if you pass the left brain you have to take care of logic and common sense direct in the right brain that's much better of the same
and if you work with in the right atmosphere with humor you have that's the password to the cosmic bank of knowledge
where you can find any solution of any problem
ok now i drop the cards the
when i'm sober i do this much quicker but
not in order it that was
no now and then i put in a mistake just to emphasize how difficult it is right
last night i forgot that that was a mistake but now i'm glad i remember it so
bought here sorry i have a little pad to make it a
this deck is bought here in america it's called bicycle
is very flexible but not so many people know
if you check if you press at the right the right
you see how thin and flexible this deck is right now you can carry
so you don't see it make no reaction so but here
is the camera getting too much no
then when we will have it back but not too much
have to push it down again here please if you push heaps everyone see
them together so they are
and then i will demonstrate a thing from russian satellite
shortcuts i talk about shortcuts now i go very quick through the deck and try to find some pattern the new chaos theory is already old right
you know i think you are familiar with familiar with
spirals and all these things and it's much
to memorize cards in a pattern way and not
then it's the left brain but if you just look and talk in another language so now
so now jack of spades
i think jack of spades is number twelve from the top
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven so
you said spades yes ah my fault don't applaud this was clubs so jack of spades
two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty one twenty two twenty
now i do it quicker better
the time when i lift the heap i peek
three four five six then i calculate yeah good another person another
so i will do it quick very quick but in slow motion so you can follow i
i good
the thing i did i peeked i know where the card were
i chose it so another person another
do it the the regular speed right maybe you
so thank you another person another card
five of clubs say stop when the cards are in the
i think we we save five of clubs and now a card with a contrast of five of clubs
i will do the most difficult thing
for example you are sitting in las vegas and you're betting and you let the other guys
by mistake feel it's just the regular one
and now when i lift
be your card what was your so that's a
so that's a so here i grab
you know this five of clubs
and queen of hearts yes
here i must take advantage of i switch it with the five of clubs so
which card shall i use queen or five
five six seven eight you say the same card all the time eight nine
this is a kind of optical deal right
when i put one card at a table look it's not one card it's look it's a bunch of cards that gives now some hard stuffs
i think we keep the queen here now to the
now to the don't look at the
don't look at the is high frequency
and it's enough with a fraction of a second to destroy the retina completely right sorry my i should have mentioned that yeah but you can relax because it takes half an hour before it works so you have plenty of time to see put the laser here
now when i deal the cards in the
yes did the camera got it no another group
but you see the hand
that was the reason right you see the cards yes
one guy laughed so now to find the queen
do it this way take
now a little more difficult anyone name
here i have to peek lots of cards i think there are lots of
i don't know how many but ten fifteen spades in a deck at least right i start with the
yeah ace ah yeah spades
same mistake as before right so
i arrange the spades the clubs
and now and then i get some extra sympathy points right
right nine
nine ace of diamonds
and now look ace of diamonds will guide
now a little more difficult thing maybe you think i have the cards in order already that should be
you i drop the cards so in this case
you help me if i drop the card face up
you reverse it lg ok no diamonds good
no diamonds good see the pattern
see the pattern maybe it's important
figure out so many outs when i miss some cards but i love it
i will do it i will try to find find the the diamonds but i will do it the hard way
it's too easy to do it right away right
i think i will do it look shake the the
it was a women 's
yeah good yeah you can take the nostril too because some guys
guys think i can peek through the
right good satisfied looks good like and elegance right
i like her yeah i said be a little be a little tough and it was ok one more the last
now you must agree that
i must rely on other senses right i work with vibration
i work with vibration so what was the
maybe i'll stand up half diamonds i'll start with ace of diamonds
just kidding warming up king
and i give you a diamonds so they so you put them here in a nice row right ace of diamonds yes
i never ever miss two this is interesting
but the wrong color spades sorry
the the deck is a gift to you after so let the skepticals here in this examine them right remind me it's a gift right
right i
you see that in the screen and this is face up and it's not at the bottom here so next card will be was it five zoe five yeah i i will reverse it face up here the
the seven
i do this i know where it and then
and then again i love
again i love jack you with
five seconds yeah five five seconds
you my favorite topic is
