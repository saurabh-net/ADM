have been tracking the travels of bp 's oil in the gulf of mexico
this is the boat we were on by the way
the scientists i was with were not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff the birds the turtles
the dolphins the glamorous stuff they're looking at the really little stuff that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff
that eventually gets eaten by the big stuff
what they're finding is that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants can be highly toxic to phytoplankton which is very bad news because so much life depends on
so contrary to what we heard a few months back
how seventy five percent of that oil sort of magically disappeared and we didn't have to worry about it this disaster is still unfolding it's still working its way up the food chain
she pointed out that the control men as she called them who carpet bombed towns and fields with toxic insecticides like ddt were only trying to kill the little stuff the insects
not the birds but they forgot this the fact that birds dine on grubs that robins eat lots of worms now saturated with ddt the title silent spring
the meaning of this disaster with what it meant to witness a hole ripped in our world
with what it meant to watch the contents of the earth gush forth on live tv twenty four hours a day for months
with our lack of control
as the oil burst out of every attempt to contain it top hats top kills and most memorably
the junk shot the bright idea of firing old tires and golf balls down that hole in the world but even more striking than the ferocious power emanating from that well
recklessness with which that power was unleashed the carelessness the lack of planning that characterized the operation from drilling to
we have become far too willing to gamble with things that are precious and irreplaceable
and to do so without a back up plan without an exit strategy
and bp was hardly our first experience of this in recent years our leaders barrel into wars telling themselves happy stories about cakewalks and welcome parades
years of deadly damage control frankensteins of sieges and surges and counter insurgencies and once again no exit strategy
our financial wizards routinely fall victim to similar overconfidence
the best and the brightest reach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot in this case throwing massive amounts of much needed public money down a very different kind of
as with bp the hole does get plugged at least temporarily but not before exacting a tremendous price
why we keep letting this happen because we are in the midst of what may be our highest stakes gamble of all deciding what to do or not to do about climate change
a great deal of time is spent in this country and around the world inside the climate debate on the question
what if the ipc scientists are all wrong
a far more relevant question as mit physicist evelyn fox keller puts it is what if those scientists are right
based on the precautionary principle
the theory that holds that when human health and the environment are significantly at risk and when the potential damage
is irreversible we cannot afford to wait for perfect scientific certainty better to err on the side of caution
the burden of proving that a practice is safe should not be placed on the public
that would be harmed but rather on the industry that stands to profit
but climate policy in the wealthy world to the extent that such a thing exists is not based on precaution but rather on cost benefit analysis
so rather than asking as precaution would demand what can we do as quickly as possible to avoid potential catastrophe
we ask bizarre questions like this
or we ask how much hotter can we let the planet get and still survive
the way the assumption that we can safely control the earth 's awesomely complex climate system as if it had a thermostat making the planet not too hot not too cold but just right sort of goldilocks style
this is pure fantasy and it's not coming from the climate scientists it's coming from the economists imposing their mechanistic thinking on the science
the fact is that we simply don't know when the warming that we create will be utterly overwhelmed by feedback loops
so once again why do we take these crazy risks with the precious
a range of explanations may be popping into your mind by now like greed this is a popular explanation and there's lots of truth to it because taking big risks as we all know pays a lot of money
and greed and hubris are intimately intertwined when it comes to recklessness for instance if you happen to be a thirty five year old banker taking home one hundred times more than a brain surgeon
then you need a narrative you need a story that makes that disparity okay
and you actually don't have a lot of options you're either an incredibly good scammer
and you're getting away with it you gamed the system or you're some kind of boy genius the likes of which the world has never seen
way tony hayward the former ceo of bp had a plaque on his desk inscribed with this inspirational slogan
what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail
now this is actually a popular plaque and this is a crowd of overachievers so i'm betting that some of you have this plaque
don't feel ashamed putting fear of failure out of your mind can be a very good thing if you're training for a triathlon or preparing to give a tedtalk
but personally i think people with the power to detonate our economy and ravage our ecology would do better
having a picture of icarus hanging
from the wall because maybe not that one in particular but i want them thinking about the possibility of failure all of the time so we have we've got overconfidence hubris
i'm not going to belabor this point but studies do show that as investors women are much less prone to taking reckless risks
precisely because as we've already heard women tend not to suffer from overconfidence in the same way that
so it turns out that being paid less and praised less has its upsides for society at least
the flip side of this is that
being told that you are gifted chosen and born to rule has distinct societal downsides
because none of us at least in the global north neither men nor women are fully exempt from this message
the narrative of the newly discovered frontier and the conquering pioneer the narrative of manifest destiny the narrative of apocalypse and
gotten over them they pop up in the strangest places for instance i stumbled across this advertisement outside the women 's washroom in the kansas city airport
it's for motorola 's new rugged cellphone and yes it really does say slap mother nature in the face
this is a crass version of our founding story we slapped mother nature around and won and we always win because dominating nature is our destiny from tony hayward again
the gulf of mexico is a very big
the amount of oil and dispersant that we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume in other words the ocean is she can take
it is this underlying assumption of limitlessness that makes it possible to take the reckless risks that we do
because this is our real master narrative however much we mess up there will always be more
more water more land more untapped resources a new bubble will replace the old one a new technology will come along to fix the messes we made with the last one
in a way that is the story of the settling of the americas the supposedly inexhaustible frontier to which europeans escaped
now the problem is that the story was always a lie the earth always did have limits they were just beyond our sights and now we are hitting those limits on multiple fronts
i believe that we know this yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop
not only do we continue to tell and retell the same tired stories but we are now doing so with a frenzy and a fury that frankly verges on camp
how else to explain the cultural space occupied by sarah palin now on the one hand exhorting us to drill baby drill because god put those resources into the ground
in order for us to exploit them and on the other glorying in the wilderness of alaska 's untouched beauty on her hit reality tv show
the twin message is as comforting as it is mad
ignore those creeping fears that we have finally hit the wall there are still no limits there will always be another frontier so stop worrying and keep shopping
now would that this were just about sarah palin and her reality tv show in environmental circles we often here that rather than shifting to renewables we are continuing with business as usual
this assessment unfortunately is far too optimistic
the truth is that we have already exhausted so much of the easily accessible fossil fuels that we have already entered a far riskier business
era of extreme energy so that means
drilling for oil in the deepest water including the icy arctic seas where a clean up may simply be impossible it means large scale hydraulic fracking for gas
and massive strip mining operations for coal the likes of which we haven't yet seen and most controversially it means the tar sands
i'm always surprised by how little people outside of canada know about the alberta tar sands which this year are projected to become the number one source of imported oil
to the united states it's worth taking a moment to understand this practice because i believe it speaks to recklessness and the path we're on like little else
this is where the tar sands live under one of the last magnificent boreal forests the oil is not liquid you can't just drill a hole and pump it out
so to get at it you first have to get rid of the trees
then you rip off the topsoil and get at that oily sand
the process requires a huge amount of water
now looking at these images
it's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation which can already be seen from space and could grow to an area the size of england
i find it helps actually to look at the dump trucks that move the earth the largest ever built that's a person down there by the wheel
this is not oil drilling it's not even mining it is terrestrial skinning
vast vivid landscapes are being gutted left monochromatic gray
that as i'm concerned this would be an abomination if it emitted not one particle of carbon
but the truth is that on average turning that gunk into crude oil
how else to describe this but as a form of mass insanity
this is where our story of endless growth has taken us to this blackhole at the center of my country a place of such planetary pain that like the bp gusher one can only stand to look at it for so long
as jared diamond and others have shown us this is how civilizations commit suicide by slamming their foot on the accelerator at the exact moment when they should be putting on the brakes
the problem is that our master narrative has an answer for that
at the very last minute we are going to get saved just like in every hollywood movie just like in the rapture
but of course our secular religion is technology
now you may have noticed more and more headlines like these
the idea behind this form of geoengineering as it's called is that as the planet heats up we may be able to shoot sulfates and aluminum particles
into the stratosphere to reflect some of the sun 's rays back to space thereby cooling the planet
the wackiest plan and i'm not making this up would put what is essentially a garden hose eighteen and a half miles high into the sky suspended by balloons to spew sulfur dioxide
so solving the problem of pollution with more pollution
of it as the ultimate junk shot
the serious scientists involved in this research all stress that these techniques are
the mere mention of geoengineering is being greeted in some circles particularly media circles with a relief tinged with euphoria
an escape hatch has been reached a new frontier has been found most importantly we don't have to change our lifestyles after all
you see for some people their savior is a guy in a flowing robe for other people it's a guy with a garden hose
we badly need some new stories
we need stories that have different kinds of heroes willing to take different kinds of risks risks that confront recklessness head on that put the precautionary principle into practice
even if that means through direct action like hundreds of young people will to get arrested blocking dirty power plants or fighting mountaintop removal coal
we need stories that replace that linear narrative of endless growth with circular narratives
that remind us that what goes around comes around that this is our only home there is no escape hatch call it karma
call it physics action and reaction call it precaution the principle that reminds us that life is too precious to be risked for any profit thank you
