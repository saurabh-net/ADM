he was in a movie called torch song trilogy
cook fix plumbing build furniture i can even pat myself on the back when necessary all so i don 't have to ask anyone for anything there 's nothing i need from anyone except fighting for love
fighting for love when i
i realized there were a lot of people who weren 't as gay as i was gay being happy not gay being attracted to the same sex in fact i heard that there was a lot of hate and a lot of anger and a lot of frustration and a lot of fear about
who i was and the gay lifestyle
i 'm sitting here trying to figure out
that 's when i got scared
because i 'm thinking if i 'm gay and i 'm doing something that 's going to destroy civilization i need to figure out what this stuff is and i need to stop doing it
i took a look at my life who drink coffee
i get stuck in traffic evil evil traffic sometimes i get stuck in lines at airports
this is not an actual photograph of my son 's room his is messier
and because i have a fifteen year old all i do is cook and cook and cook any parents out there of teenagers
all we do is cook for these people they eat two three four dinners a night it 's ridiculous
this is the gay lifestyle
and after i 'm done cooking and cleaning and standing in line and getting stuck in traffic
my partner and i we get together and we decide that we 're gonna go and have some wild and crazy
when my partner steve and i
first started dating he told me this story about penguins and i didn 't know where he was going with it at first he was kind of a little bit nervous when he was sharing it with me but he told me that when a penguin finds a mate that they want to you might be gay
you might be gay you may want to
but there 's something that 's been disturbing me since he made that remark
just a short time ago and that is apparently this is just another move by the gay activists that 's on the gay agenda
and i 'm disturbed by this because
i was out shopping as i tend to do and i came across
a bootleg copy of the official gay agenda
and i said to myself lz for so long you have been denied this what do they want
so without further ado i will present to you ladies and gentlemen now be careful
the official copy of the gay agenda
but there it is the gay agenda run for your heterosexual lives
did you know that in all the states where there is no shading that people who are gay lesbian bisexual or transgendered can be kicked out of their apartments
for being gay lesbian bisexual or transgendered
just if you 're gay lesbian bisexual
i 'm looking at you north carolina but you 're not looking at the u s constitution
this is the gay agenda equality not special rights but the rights that were already written by these people these elitists if you will educated well dressed nonetheless
is the reason why i felt it was imperative that i presented you with this copy of the gay agenda
because i figured if i made it funny you wouldn 't be as threatened i figured if i was a bit irreverent you wouldn 't find it serious but when you see the map and you see our state of michigan
and we 're just trying to walk in those rights that have already been stated that we 've already agreed upon
there are people living in fear of losing their jobs so they don 't show anyone who they really are
right here at home this isn 't just about north carolina all those states that were clear it 's legal
if i could brag for a second i have a fifteen year old son from my marriage he has a four point zero he is starting a new club at school policy debate
he 's a budding track star he has almost every single record in middle school
for every event that he competed in he volunteers he prays before he eats
i would like to think as his father and he lives with me primarily
but if i were to go to the state of michigan today and try to adopt a young person who is in an orphanage i would be disqualified for only one reason because i 'm gay
don 't understand why what they are is so much more significant than who they are this story just keeps playing over and over and over again
couldn 't have the same rights people who happened to be women didn 't have the same rights couldn 't vote there was a point in our history in which if you were considered disabled that an employer could just fire you before the americans with disabilities act
we keep doing this over and over again and so here we are
two thousand and twelve gay agenda gay lifestyle and i 'm not a good dad and people don 't deserve to be able to protect their families because of what they are not who they are
so when you hear the words gay lifestyle and gay agenda in the future i encourage you to do
two things one remember the u s constitution and then two if you wouldn 't mind looking to your left please
