what i want to do today is to spend some time talking about some stuff that's sort of given me a little bit of existential angst for lack of a better word
the past couple of years and basically these three quotes tell what's going on when god made the color purple god was just showing off alice walker wrote in the color purple
and zora neale hurston in dust tracks on a road research is a formalized curiosity it's poking and prying with a purpose
and then finally when i think about the near future you know we have this attitude well whatever happens happens
so that goes along with the cheshire cat saying if you don't care much where you want to get to it doesn't much matter which way you go but i think it does matter which way we go and what road we take
the world our society is going to be building on the basic knowledge and abstract ideas the discoveries that we came up with today
just as all these wonderful things we're hearing about here at the ted conference that we take for granted in the world right now were really knowledge and ideas that came up in the fifties the sixties and the seventies
that's the substrate that we're exploring today whether it's the internet genetic engineering laser scanners guided missiles fiber optics high definition television
alvin ailey 's suite otis or sarah jones your revolution will not be between these thighs which by the way is banned by the fcc or ska all of these things without question
i'm really worried to be quite frank i'm concerned i'm skeptical that we're doing very much of anything we're in a sense failing
to act in the future we are purposefully consciously being laggards we're lagging behind
who was a psychiatrist from martinque said each generation must out of relative obscurity discover its mission and fulfill or betray it
what is our mission what do we have to do i think our mission is to reconcile to reintegrate science and the arts because right now there's a schism that exists in popular culture
you know people have this idea that science and the arts are really separate we think of them as separate and different things and this idea was probably introduced centuries ago but it's really becoming critical now
because we're making decisions about our society every day that if we keep thinking that the arts are separate from the sciences
and we keep thinking it's cute to say i don't understand anything about this one i don't understand anything about the other one then we are going to have problems now i know no one here at ted thinks this all of us we already know that they're very connected but i'm going to let you know that some folks in the outside world
believe it or not they think it's neat when they say you know scientists and science is not creative maybe scientists are ingenious but they're not
and then we have this tendency that career counselors and various people say things like artists are not analytical they're ingenious perhaps
but not analytical and when these concepts underlie our teaching and what we think about the world then we have a problem because we stymie support for everything by accepting this dichotomy whether it's
when we attempt to accommodate it in our world and we try to build our foundation for the world we're messing up the future because who wants to be
who wants to be illogical talent would run from either of these fields if you said you have to choose either then they're going to go to something where they think well i can be creative and logical at the same time now i grew up in the sixties and i'll admit it
old enough to be a hippie i know there are people here you know the younger generation of wanna be hippies
was that there was hope for the future we thought everyone could participate there
wonderful incredible ideas that were always percolating and so much of what's cool or hot today is really based on some of those concepts whether it's people trying to use a prime directive from star trek being
that three dimensional weaving and fax machines that i read about in my weekly readers as the technology and engineering was just getting started but the sixties left me with a problem you see i
always assumed i would go into space because i followed all of this but i also loved the arts and sciences you see when i was growing up as a little girl and a teenager
i loved designing and making doll clothes and wanted to be a fashion designer i took art and ceramics i loved dance lola falana alvin ailey jerome robins
and i also avidly followed the gemini and the apollo programs i had science projects and
of astronomy books i took calculus and philosophy i wondered about the infinity and the big bang theory and when i was at stanford i found myself my senior year
and i found myself the last quarter juggling chemical engineering separation processes logic classes nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
and also producing and choreographing a dance production and i had to do the lighting and the design work
i was trying to figure out do i go to new york city to try to become a professional dancer or do i go to medical school now my mother helped me figure that one out
their science and math folks ask me why did you take up what you took up i had to say because it represents human creativity
the creativity that allowed us that we were required to have to conceive and build and launch the space shuttle springs from the same source of imagination and analysis that it took to carve a bundu statue
or the ingenuity it took to design choreograph and stage cry each one of them are different manifestations incarnations of creativity
avatars of human creativity and that's what we have to reconcile in our minds how these things fit together the difference between arts and sciences is not
einstein said in fact the most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious it is the source of all true art and science
dance requires us to express and want to express the jubilation in life but then you have to figure out exactly what movement do i do to make sure that it comes across correctly
the difference between arts and sciences is also not constructive versus deconstructive right a lot people think of the sciences as deconstructive you have to pull things apart
is deconstructive because you see a piece and you remove what doesn't need to be there biotechnology is constructive orchestral arranging is constructive so in fact we use constructive and deconstructive techniques in everything
the difference between science and the arts is not that they are different sides of the same coin even or even different parts of the same continuum but rather they are manifestations of the same thing
our experience to influence the universe external to ourselves it doesn't rely on us it
it right
