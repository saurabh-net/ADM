somebody gives you a bet you will look at a crystal ball and you will see the future the future will be accurate but you need to share it with the world okay curiosity killed the cat
you take the bet you look at the crystal ball one hour later you are sitting in a building on the national tv in a talkshow and you tell the story before the end of two thousand and eleven
next thing you know two guys in white appear they give you the strange t shirt
take you to the nearest mental institution so i would like to speak a little bit about the phenomenon which is behind what already seems to be the very bad year for bad guys and this phenomenon is called people power
well people power has been there for a while it helped gandhi kick the brits from india it helped martin luther king win a historic racial struggle
it helped local lech walesa to kick out one million soviet troops from poland and beginning the end of the soviet union as we know it so what 's new in it
well first one analytic skills
i 'll try where it all started in the middle east and for so many years we were living with completely the wrong perception of the middle east it was looking like the frozen region
literally a refrigerator and there are only two types of meals there steak which stands for a mubarak ben ali type of military police dictatorship
and everybody was amazed when the refrigerator opened and millions of young mainly secular people step out to do the change guess what they didn 't watch the demographics
what is the average age of egyptians twenty four how long was mubarak in power thirty one so this system just obsolete they expired
the rest is the year in front of us and guess what the same generation epsilon with their rules with their tools with their games and with their language which sounds a little bit strange to me i am thirty eight now and can you look at the age of the people on the streets of europe
it seems that generation epsilon is
they will say people power will work if the annual income of the country is between x and z they will say people power will work only if there is a foreign pressure they will say people power will work only if there is no oil and i mean there is a set of conditions well
the news here is that your skills that you bring in the conflict seem to be more important than the conditions
namely skills of unity planning and maintaining nonviolent discipline let me give you the example i am coming from a country called serbia
it took us ten years to unite eighteen opposition party leaders with their big egos behind one single candidate against balkan dictator slobodan milosevic guess what that was the day of his defeat
your movement now let me move to another place it 's selection of strategies and tactics there are certain rules in nonviolent struggle you may follow first you start small second you pick the battles you can win
it 's only two hundred of us in this room we won 't call for the march of millions but what if we organize spraying graffiti throughout the night all over krakow city the city will know so we pick the tactics which accommodates to the event especially this thing we call the small
christians protecting muslims who are there praying coptic wedding cheered by thousands of muslims the world has just changed the picture but somebody was thinking about this previously so there are so many things you can do instead of getting into one place shouting and showing off in front of the security forces
from the police in egypt you can tell that something is happening there and then it 's about humor
humor is such a powerful game changer and of course it was very big in poland and you know we were just a small group of crazy students in serbia when we made this big skit we put the big petrol barrel with a portrait picture of mr president on it in the middle of the main street there was a hole on the top
so you could literally come put a coin in get a baseball bat and pow hit his face sounds loud
what will they do arrest us we are nowhere to be seen we are three blocks away observing it from our espresso bar
arrest the shoppers with kids doesn 't make sense of course you could bet they have done the most stupid thing they arrested the barrel and now the picture of the smashed face on the barrel with the policeman dragging them to the police car that was the best day for the photographers from newspapers that they ever will have
so i mean these are the things you can do and you can always use the humor there is also one big thing about the humor it really hurts because these guys really are taking themselves too seriously when you start to mock them it hurts
now everybody is talking about his majesty the internet
and it is also a very useful skill but don 't rush to label things like facebook revolution twitter revolution don 't mix tools with the substance
it is true that the internet and new media are very useful in making things faster and cheaper they make it also a bit safer for the participants because they give the part of anonymity we are watching the great example of something else the internet can do
it can put the price tag of state sponsored violence over nonviolent protesters this is a famous group we are all khaled said made by wael ghonim in egypt and his friend this is the mutilated face of the guy who was beaten by the police this is how he became the public and this is what probably became the straw which broke the camel 's back
there are risks to be taken and there are living people who are winning the struggle
well million dollar question what will happen in the arab world and though young people from the arab world were pretty successful in bringing down three dictators shaking the region
kind of persuading clever kings from jordan and morocco doing substantial reforms it is yet to be seen what will be the outcome whether the egyptians and tunisians will make it through the transition or this will end in bloody ethnic and religious conflict
whether the syrians will maintain nonviolent discipline
faced with the brutal daily violence which kills thousands already or they will slip into violent struggle and make ugly civil war
will these revolutions be whole like through the transitions to democracy or be overtaken by military or extremists of all kinds we cannot tell
same works for the western sector where you can see all of these excited young people protesting around the world occupying this occupying that
this is the difference between two towns now what do the statistics have my friend 's book maria stephan 's book
talks a lot about violent and nonviolent struggle and there are some shocking data if you look at the last thirty five years and different social transitions from dictatorship to democracy you will see that out of sixty seven different cases in fifty of these cases it was nonviolent struggle
which was the key power
this is one more reason to look at this phenomenon this is one more reason to look at the generation epsilon enough for me to give them credit and hope
