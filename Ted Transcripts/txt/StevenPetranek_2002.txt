in the last ten years are really extraordinary to the point where we know more about our universe and
after a hard day of work and start talking about some of these incredible perceptions about how the universe works and they would inevitably end up in what i thought was a very bizarre place which is ways the world could end very suddenly and that 's what i want to talk about not after this
which leads me to a videotape of a president bush
number ten we lose the will
we live in an incredible age of modern medicine we are all much healthier than we were twenty years ago people around the world are getting better medicine but mentally we 're falling apart the world health organization now estimates
and the world health organization also says that depression is the biggest epidemic that humankind has ever faced soon genetic breakthroughs and even better medicine are going to
allow us to think of one hundred as a normal lifespan a female child born tomorrow on average median
will live to age eighty three our life
longevity is going up almost a year for every year that passes now the problem with all of this getting older
people over sixty five are the most likely people to commit suicide
so what are the solutions
we don 't really have mental health insurance
we need a pump push from the federal government through nih and national science nsf
and places like that to start helping the drug companies develop some advanced psychoactive drugs moving on number nine
there must be millions of planets in the milky way and as carl sagan insisted for many years and was laughed at for it there must be billions and billions in the universe
it 's becoming obvious that the chance that
life does not exist elsewhere
in the universe and probably fairly close to us is a fairly remote idea and the chance that some of it isn 't more intelligent than ours is also
and swat us away like flies the way we swat away flies
even in those cases where every attempt was made
to protect and guard the
prepared for them how much energy and money does it take to actually have a plan
to negotiate with an advanced
secondly and you 're going to hear more from me about this we have to become an outward looking space faring nation we have got to develop the idea that the earth doesn 't last forever
our sun doesn 't last forever if we want humanity to last forever we have to colonize the milky way
and that is not something that is beyond comprehension at this point
many other ecosystems on earth are in real real danger we 're living in a time of mass extinctions that exceeds the fossil record by a factor of ten thousand
we have lost twenty five percent of the unique species in hawaii in the last twenty years california is expected to lose twenty five percent of its species in the next forty years somewhere in the amazon forest is the marginal tree
and when that ecosystem collapses like
so what do we do about this what are the solutions
be able to pump possible solutions into models and with the kind of computing power we have now there is as i say some of this going on but it needs money national science foundation needs to say
you know almost all the money that 's spent on science in this country comes from the federal government one way or another
and they get to prioritize you know there are people at the national science foundation who get to say this is the most important thing this is one of the things they ought to be thinking more about secondly we need to create huge biodiversity reserves on the planet and start moving them around there 's been an experiment for the last four or five years on the georges bank or the grand banks off of newfoundland
it 's a no take fishing zone they can 't fish there for a radius of two hundred miles and an amazing thing has happened almost all the fish have come back and they 're reproducing like crazy we 're going to have to start doing
you all remember ted kaczynski the unabomber one of the things he raved about was that a particle accelerator experiment could go haywire and set off a chain reaction that would destroy the world
a lot of very sober minded physicists believe it or not have had exactly the same thought this spring there 's a collider at
and obliterate it most physicists say that the accelerators we have now are not really powerful enough to create black holes and strangelets that we need to worry about and they 're probably right but all around the world
we need the advice of particle physicists to talk about particle physics
looking at that natural laboratory and figuring out first what 's safe to do on earth
they found bt corn genes in wild corn plants now corn originated we think in mexico this is the genetic biodiversity storehouse of corn
we treat biotechnology with the same scrutiny we apply to nuclear power plants it 's that simple this is an amazingly unregulated field when the starlink disaster happened there was a battle between the epa and the fda over who really had authority and over what parts of this
one of my favorites reversal of the earth 's magnetic field
believe it or not this happens every few hundred thousand years and has happened many times field protects us from
field protects us from are well basically
are well basically so
things like the ozone layer so
you know we can make ozone from car tailpipes it 's not hard it 's just three oxygen atoms if you brought the entire ozone layer down to the surface of the earth it would be the thickness of two pennies at fourteen pounds per square inch
you don 't need that much up there we need to learn how to repair and replenish the earth 's ozone layer
our magnetic field has done pretty well protecting us from this occasionally we get a flare from the sun that causes havoc with communications and so forth and electricity
but the alarming thing is that astronomers recently have been studying stars that are similar to our sun and they 've found that a number of them when they 're about the age of our sun brighten by a factor of as much as twenty doesn 't last
powerful than any flares we 've had from our sun so far
they go through periods of diminishment when their
on mars and to make a livable planet on mars is probably there and you just literally have to
aids is coming back ebola seems to be rearing its head with much too much frequency
and old diseases like cholera are becoming resistant to antibiotics
we 've all learned what the kind of panic that can occur when an old disease rears its head like anthrax
the worst possibility is that
a very simple germ like staph
for which we have one antibiotic that still works
the danger is that some germ like staph will be will mutate into something that 's really virulent very contagious and will sweep
through populations before we can do anything about it that 's happened before about twelve thousand years ago there was a massive wave of mammal extinctions in the americas and that is thought to have been a virulent disease so what can we do about
something like twelve fifteen miles wide and they are black holes and they are gobbling up everything
around them including light which is why we can 't see them
most of them should be in orbit around something but galaxies are very violent places and things
about a billion miles away here 's what happens to earth 's orbit it becomes elliptical instead of circular and for three months out of the year the surface temperatures go up to one hundred and fifty to one hundred and eighty for three months out of the year they go to fifty below zero that won 't work too well what can we do about this and this is my scariest and finally number one
exploded over siberia and flattened forests for maybe one hundred miles it had the effect of about one thousand hiroshima bombs astronomers estimate that little asteroids
miles wide causes major extinctions we think the one that got the dinosaurs was about five miles wide where are they there 's something called the kuiper belt which some people think pluto 's not a planet that 's where pluto is it 's in the kuiper belt there 's also something a little farther out called the oort cloud
there are about one hundred thousand balls of ice and rock comets really out there that are fifty miles in diameter or more and they regularly take a little spin in towards
the asteroids that exist between mars and jupiter the folks at the sloan digital sky survey told us last fall they 're making the first map of the universe three dimensional map of the universe that there are probably seven hundred thousand asteroids between mars and jupiter
you 'll notice that the chance of an asteroid slash comet impact killing you is about one in twenty thousand according to the work they 've done now look at the one right below that passenger aircraft crash one in twenty thousand we spend an awful lot of money trying to be sure that we
nasa 's spending three million dollars a year three million bucks that is like pocket change
to search for asteroids because we can actually figure out every asteroid that 's out there and if it might hit earth
and when it might hit earth and they 're trying to do that but it 's going to take them ten years at spending three million dollars a year and even then they claim they 'll only have about eighty percent of
we really need a dedicated observatory you 'll notice that a lot of comets are named after people you
we need a dedicated observatory that looks for comets part two of the solutions we need to figure out how to blow up an asteroid or alter its trajectory now
a year ago we did an amazing thing we sent a probe out to this asteroid belt called near near earth asteroid rendezvous and these guys orbited a thirty or no about a twenty two mile long asteroid
but we can learn to land on these asteroids that have our name on them and
put something like a small ion propulsion motor on it which would gently slowly
