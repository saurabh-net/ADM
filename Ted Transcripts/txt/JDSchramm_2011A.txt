the school where he graduated from with his master 's had just offered him a teaching appointment which meant not only a salary but benefits for the first time in ages
and yet despite everything going really well for john he was struggling fighting addiction and a gripping depression
on the night of june eleventh two thousand and three he climbed up to the edge of the fence on the manhattan bridge
and he leaped to the treacherous waters below remarkably no miraculously he lived
the fall shattered his right arm broke every rib that he had punctured his lung and he drifted in and out of consciousness as he drifted down the east river
under the brooklyn bridge and out into the pathway of the staten island ferry where passengers on the ferry heard his cries of pain contacted the boat 's captain who contacted the coast guard who fished him out of the east river and took him to bellevue hospital
and that 's actually where our story begins because once john committed himself to putting his life back together first physically then emotionally and then spiritually
he found that there were very few resources available to someone who has attempted to end their life in the way that he did
research shows that nineteen out of twenty people who attempt suicide will fail
but the people who fail are thirty seven times more likely to succeed the second time
this truly is an at risk population with very few resources to support them
i know john 's story very well because i 'm john
and this is today the first time in any sort of public setting i 've ever acknowledged the journey that i have been on
but after having lost a beloved teacher in two thousand and six and a good friend last year to suicide
and sitting last year at tedactive i knew that i needed to step out of my silence and past my taboos to talk about an idea worth spreading and that is that people who have made the difficult choice to come back to life
need more resources and need our help
as the trevor project says it gets better it gets way better and i 'm choosing to come out of a totally different kind of closet today to encourage you to urge you
