we actually just got middle class in colorado springs colorado but you get the picture i was raised with a very heavy sense of unfinished legacy
at this ripe old age of thirty i 've been thinking a lot about what it means to grow up in this horrible beautiful time and i 've decided for me it 's been a real journey and paradox
my dad actually resigned from the male only business club in my hometown because he said he would never be part of an organization that would one day welcome his son but not his daughter
he 's actually here today the trick here
the trick here fishnet stockings
fishnet stockings jennifer baumgardner was wearing
i tell you this i tell you this at the risk of embarrassing myself because i think part of the work of feminism is to admit that aesthetics that beauty that
i say intersectionality so race class gender ability all of these things go into our experiences of what it means to be a woman pay equity yes absolutely a feminist issue but for me so is immigration
but we also have a straightforward political impact feministing has been able to get merchandise pulled off the shelves of walmart we got a misogynist administrator sending us hate mail fired from a big ten school
community organizing changing institutions from the inside out all continuing the incredible work that our mothers and grandmothers started
brings me to the second paradox sobering up about our smallness and maintaining faith in our greatness all at once many in my generation because of well intentioned parenting and self esteem education were socialized to believe that we were special little snowflakes
and there 's a lot to be overwhelmed about to be fair an environmental crisis wealth disparity in this country unlike we 've seen since one thousand nine hundred and twenty eight and globally a totally immoral and ongoing wealth disparity xenophobia 's on the rise the trafficking of women and girls it 's enough to make you feel very overwhelmed
i experienced this firsthand myself when i graduated from barnard college in two thousand and two
my mom took a drink of her signature sea breeze
and she looked right at me and she said
i will not stand for your desperation
she said you are smarter
more creative and more resilient than that which brings me to my third paradox
growing up is about aiming to succeed wildly and being fulfilled by failing really well
to environmental justice i wrote about emily apt who initially became a caseworker in the welfare system because she decided that was the most noble thing she could do but quickly learned not only did she not like it but she wasn 't really good at it instead what she really wanted to do was make films so she made a film about the welfare system and had a huge impact
i wrote about maricela guzman the daughter of mexican immigrants who joined the military so she could afford college she was actually sexually assaulted in boot camp and went on to co organize a group called the service women 's action network
what i learned from these people and others was that i couldn 't judge them based on their failure to meet their very lofty goals many of them are working in deeply intractable systems the military congress the education system etc but what they managed to do within those systems was be a humanizing force
so when i was a little girl i had a couple of very strange habits one of them was i used to lie on the kitchen floor of my childhood home and i would suck the thumb of my left hand and hold my mom 's cold toes with my right hand
she was talking about board meetings she was founding peace organizations she was coordinating carpools she was consoling friends all these daily acts of care and creativity and surely at three and four years old i was listening to the soothing sound of her voice but i think i was also getting my first lesson in activist work
and sometimes they 're in our own kitchens talking on the phone making us dinner doing all that keeps the world going around and around
my mom and so many women like her have taught me that life is not about glory or certainty or security even it 's about embracing the paradox it 's about acting in the face of overwhelm
