i mean look this animal is trying to fight back this spear from this soldier and my mom took these pictures actually last week of our carpets and i remember this to this day
there was another object this sort of towering piece of furniture with creatures and gargoyles and nudity pretty scary stuff when you're a little kid what i remember today from this is that
objects tell stories so storytelling has been a really strong influence in my work
and then there was another influence i was a teenager and at fifteen or sixteen i guess like all teenagers we want to just do what we love and what we believe
and so i fused together the two things i loved the most which was skiing and windsurfing those are pretty good escapes from the drab weather
in switzerland so i created this compilation of the two i took my skis and i took a board and i put a mast foot in there and
some foot straps and some metal fins and here i was going really fast on frozen lakes
it was really a death trap i mean it was incredible it worked incredibly well but it was really dangerous and i realized then i had to go to design school
look look at those graphics there
so i went to design school and
it was the early nineties when i finished and i saw something extraordinary happening in silicon valley so i wanted to be there and i saw that the computer was coming into our homes
that it had to change in order to be with us in our homes and so i got myself a job and i was working for a consultancy and we would get in to these meetings and these managers would come
and they would say well what we're going to do here is really important you know and they would give the projects code names you know mostly from star wars actually
things like c three po yoda luke so in anticipation i would be this young designer in the back of the room and i would raise my hand and i would ask questions i mean in retrospect probably stupid questions but
things like what 's this cap lock key for or what 's this num lock key for you know that thing
do people really use it do they need it do they want it in their homes
what i realized then is they didn't really want to change the legacy stuff they didn't want to change the insides they
were really looking for us the designers to create the
to put some pretty stuff outside of the box and i didn't want to be a colorist it wasn't what i wanted to do i didn't want to be a stylist in this way and then i saw this
so i had to start on my own so i moved to san francisco and i started a little company
and what i wanted to work on is important stuff and i wanted to really not just work on the skins but i wanted to work on the entire human experience
and so the first projects were humble but they took technology and maybe made it into things that people would
use in a new way and maybe finding some new functionality this is a watch we made for mini cooper
the car company right when it launched and it's the first watch that has a display that switches from horizontal to vertical and that allows me to check
my timer discretely here without bending my elbow and other projects which were really about transformation about
matching the human need this is a little piece of furniture for an italian manufacturer and it ships completely flat and then it folds into a coffee table and a stool and whatnot and something a little bit more experimental
this is a light fixture for swarovski and what it does is it changes shape so it goes from a circle to a round to a square to a figure eight
and just by drawing on a little computer tablet the entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want
so we had to design both the light and the light bulb and that's a unique opportunity i would say in design and the new experience i was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from
a warm sort of glowing kind of mood light all the way to a bright work light so
the light bulb actually does that it allows the person to switch and to mix these two colorations and it's done in a very
simple way one just touches the base of the light and on one side you can mix the brightness and on the other the coloration of the light
so all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them and i think as designers we need to really think about how
we can create a different relationship between our work and the world whether it's for business or as i'm going to show on some
civic type projects because i think everybody agrees that as designers we bring value to business
value to the users also but i think it's the values that we put into these projects that ultimately create the greater value and the values we bring can be
about environmental issues about sustainability about lower power consumption
you know they can be about function and beauty they can be about business strategy but designers are really the glue that brings these things together
so jawbone is a project that you're familiar with and it has a humanistic technology it feels your skin
it rests on your skin and it knows when it is you're talking and by knowing when it is you're talking it gets rid of the other noises that it knows about which is the
and try to make it as beautiful as we can i mean think about it the care we take in selecting sunglasses or jewelry
or accessories is really important so if it isn't beautiful it really doesn't belong on your face and
this is what we're pursuing here but how we work on jawbone is really unique i want to point at something here on the left
this is the board this is one of the things that goes inside that makes this technology work but this is the design process there's somebody changing the board putting tracers on the board changing the location of the
as the designers on the other side are doing the work so it's not about slapping skins any more on a technology
really about designing from the inside out and then on the other side of the room the designers are making small adjustments sketching drawing by hand
putting it in the computer and it's what i call being design driven you know there is some push and pull but design is really
helping define the whole experience from the inside out and then of course design is never done and this is the other
new way that is unique in how we work is because it's never done you have to do all this other stuff the packaging and the website and you need to continue to really touch the user in many ways
how do you retain somebody when it's never done and hosain rahman the ceo of aliph jawbone you know really understands that
you need a different structure so in a way the different structure is that we're partners it's a partnership we can
continue to work and dedicate ourselves to this project and then we all share in the rewards and here 's another project another partnership type
approach this is called y water and it's this guy from los angeles thomas arndt austrian originally who came to us and all he wanted to do was to create
a healthy drink or an organic drink for his kids to replace the high sugar content sodas that he 's trying to get them away from
so we worked on this bottle and it's completely symmetrical in every dimension and this allows the bottle to
turn into a game the bottles connect together and you can create different shapes different forms thank you and then
while we were doing this the shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a y and then we thought well these words why
and why not are probably the most important words that kids ask so we called it y water and so this is another place where it all comes together in the same room the three dimensional design
the ideas the branding it all becomes deeply connected and then the other thing about this project is
we bring intellectual property we bring a marketing approach we bring all this stuff but i think
at the end of the day what we bring is these values and these values create a soul for the companies we work with and it's especially rewarding when your design work becomes a creative endeavor when others can be creative and do more with it
here 's another project which i think really emulates that this is the one laptop per child the one hundred dollar laptop
this picture is incredible in nigeria people carry their most precious belongings on their heads this girl is going to school with a laptop on her head i mean to me it just means so much
but when nicholas negroponte and he has spoken about this project a lot he 's the founder of olpc came to us
the third pillar that he talked about was design and at the time i wasn't really working on computers i didn't really want to from the previous adventure
but what he said was really significant is that design was going to be why the kids were going to love this product how were going to make it low cost robust
and plus he said he was going to get rid of the cap lock key and the num lock key
so i was convinced we designed it to be iconic to look different to look like it's for a kid but not like a toy
and then the integration of all these great technologies which you've heard about the wifi antennas that allow the kids to connect
the screen which you can read in sunlight the keyboard which is made out of rubber and it's protected from the environment you know all these great technologies
really happened because of the the passion and the olpc people and the engineers they fought the suppliers they fought the the
manufacturers i mean they fought like animals for this to remain they way it is and in a way it is that will
makes projects like this one allows the process from not destroying the original idea and i think this is something really important
so now you get these pictures you get up in the morning and you see the kids in nigeria and you see them in uruguay with their computers and in mongolia
and we went away from obviously the beige i mean it's colorful it's fun in fact you can see each logo is a little bit different it's because we were able to
run during the manufacturing process twenty colors for the x and the o which is the name of the computer and by mixing them on the manufacturing floor you get twenty times twenty
four hundred different options there so the lessons from seeing the kids using them in the developing world are incredible but this is my nephew anthony in switzerland
and he had the laptop for an afternoon and i had to take it back it was hard
was a prototype and a month and a half later i come back to switzerland and there he 's playing with his own version paper paper and cardboard
i'm going to finish with one last project and this is a little bit more of adult play
some of you might have heard about the new york city condom it's actually
just launched actually launched on valentines day february fourteenth about ten days ago so the department of health in
york came to us and they needed a way to distribute thirty six million condoms for free to the citizens of new york so a pretty big endeavor
and we worked on the dispensers these are the dispensers there's this friendly shape it's
a little bit like designing a fire hydrant and it has to be easily serviceable you have to know where it is
and what it does and we also designed the condoms themselves and i was just in new york
the launch and i went to see all these places where they're installed this is at a puerto rican little mom and pop store at a bar in christopher street at a
i mean they're being installed in homeless clinics everywhere of course clubs and discos too and here 's the public service announcement for
so this is really where design is able to create a conversation i was in these venues and people were you know really into
getting them they were excited it was breaking the ice it was getting over a stigma and i think that's also what design can do
so i was going to throw some condoms in the room and whatnot but i'm not sure it's the only a few
more you can always ask me for some more later
and if anybody asks why you're carrying a condom you can just say you like the design
so i'll finish with just one thought if we all work together on creating value but if we really keep in mind the values of the work that we do i think we can
change the work that we do we can change these values can change the companies we work with and eventually together maybe we can change the world so thank you child and
