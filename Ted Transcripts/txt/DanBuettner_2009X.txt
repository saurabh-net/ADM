called the danish twin study established that only about ten percent of how long the average person lives within certain biological limits is dictated by our genes the other ninety percent is dictated
by our lifestyle so the premise of blue zones if we can find the optimal lifestyle of longevity we can come up with a
de facto formula for longevity but if you ask the average american what the optimal formula of longevity is they probably couldn't tell you
tells us the fact of the matter is there is a lot of confusion around what really helps us live longer better
should you be running marathons or doing yoga should you eat organic meats or should you be eating tofu when it comes to supplements should you be taking them
how about these hormones or resveratrol and does purpose play into it spirituality and how about how we socialize
well our approach to finding longevity was to team up with national geographic and the national institute on aging to find the four demographically
when it comes to longevity and the first myth is if you try really hard you can live to be one hundred false
the problem is only about one out of five thousand people in america live to be one hundred your chances are
very low even though it's the fastest growing demographic in america it's hard to reach one hundred the problem is that we're not programmed for longevity
for something called procreative success i love that word it reminds me of my college days
if you're a rat or an elephant or a human in between it's the same story so to make it to age one hundred you not only have to have had a very good lifestyle you also have to have
the genetic lottery the second myth is there are treatments that can help slow reverse or even stop aging
false when you think of it there is ninety nine things that can age us deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes those brain cells die they never come back
play tennis too hard on your knees ruin your cartilage the cartilage never comes back our arteries can clog our brains can gunk up with plaque and we can get alzheimer 's
is just too many things to go wrong our bodies have thirty five trillion cells trillion with a t we're talking national debt numbers here
those cells turn themselves over once every eight years and every time they turn themselves over there is some damage and that damage builds up and it builds up exponentially it's a little bit like the days when we all had
well the same things happen to our cells that's why a sixty five year old person is aging at a rate of about one hundred and twenty five times faster than a twelve year old person
so if there is nothing you can do to slow your aging or stop your aging what am i doing here well the fact of the matter
is the best science tells us that the capacity of the human body my body your body is about ninety years a little bit more for women
but life expectancy in this country is only seventy eight so somewhere along the line we're leaving about twelve good years on the table
these are years that we could get and research shows that would be
years largely free of chronic disease heart disease cancer and diabetes we think the best way to get these missing years is to look
the cultures around the world that are actually experiencing them areas where people are living to age one hundred at rates up to ten times greater than we are
areas where the life expectancy is an extra dozen years the rate of middle age mortality is a fraction of what it is in this country
and here we have this area where men live the longest about ten times more centenarians than we have here in america and this is a place where people not only reach age one hundred they do so with extraordinary vigor
their history actually goes back to about the time of christ it's actually a bronze age culture that's been isolated because the land is so infertile they largely are shepherds which occasions regular low intensity physical activity
their diet is mostly plant based accentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields they came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread called notamusica made out of durum wheat a type of cheese made from grass fed
animals so the cheese is high in omega three fatty acids instead of omega six fatty acids from corn fed animals
and a type of wine that has three times the level of polyphenols than any known wine in the world it's called
but the real secret i think lies more in the way that they organize their society and one of the most salient elements of the sardinian society is how they treat people
you go into the bars in sardinia instead of seeing the sports illustrated swimsuit calendar you see the centenarian of the month calendar
this as it turns out is not only good for your aging parents to keep them close to the family
disease that's called the grandmother effect we found our
second blue zone on the other side of the planet about eight hundred miles south
of tokyo on the archipelago of okinawa okinawa is actually one hundred and sixty one small islands and in the northern part of the main island
this is ground zero for world longevity this is a place where the oldest living female population is found
it's a place where people have the longest disability free life expectancy in the world they have what we want they live a long time and tend to die in their sleep very quickly and often i can tell you sex
they live about seven good years longer than the average american five times as many centenarians as
we have in america one fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer big killers here in america and one sixth the rate of cardiovascular
the fact that this culture has yielded these numbers suggests strongly they have something to teach us what do they do
once again a plant based diet full of vegetables with lots of color in them and they eat about eight times as much tofu as americans do
more significant than what they eat is how they eat it they have all kinds of little strategies to keep from overeating
as you know is a big problem here in america a few of the strategies we observed they eat off of smaller plates so they tend to eat fewer calories at every
they also have a three thousand year old adage which i think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented it was invented by confucius and that diet is known as the hara hatchi bu diet
a little saying these people say before their meal to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is eighty percent full it takes about a half hour for that full feeling to
we know that isolation kills fifteen years ago the average american had three good friends we're down to one and half right now if you were lucky enough to be born in okinawa
you were born into a system where you automatically have a half a dozen friends with whom you travel through life they call it a moai
and if you're in a moai you're expected to share the bounty if you encounter luck and if things go bad child gets sick parent dies you always have somebody who has your back
this particular moai these five ladies have been together for ninety seven years their average age is one hundred and two typically in america we've divided our adult life up into two
sections there is our work life where we're productive and then one day boom we retire and typically that has meant
for this one hundred and two year old karate master his ikigai was carrying forth this martial art for this hundred year old fisherman
it was continuing to catch fish for his family three times a week and this is a question the national institute on aging actually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians and one of the questions they were
for this one hundred and two year old woman her ikigai was simply her great great great granddaughter
that was a wonderful thought my editor at geographic wanted me to find america 's blue zone and for a while we looked on the prairies of minnesota
where actually there is a very high proportion of centenarians but that's because all the young people left
so we turned to the data again and we found america 's longest lived population among the seventh day adventists concentrated in and around loma linda
and they follow five little habits that conveys to them extraordinary longevity comparatively speaking
in america here life expectancy for the average woman is eighty but for an adventist woman their life expectancy
eighty nine and the difference is even more pronounced among men who are expected to live about eleven years longer than their american counterparts now this is a study that followed
about seventy thousand people for thirty years sterling study and i think it supremely illustrates the premise of this blue zone project
this is a heterogeneous community it's white black hispanic asian the only thing that they have in common are a set of very small lifestyle habits that they follow ritualistically for most of their lives
they take their diet directly from the bible genesis chapter one verse where god talks about legumes and seeds
and on one more stanza about green plants ostensibly missing is meat they take this sanctuary in time very serious
for twenty four hours every week no matter how busy they are how stressed out they are at work where the kids need to be driven
they stop everything and they focus on their god their social network and then hardwired right in the religion are nature walks
and the power of this is not that it's done occasionally the power is it's done every week for a lifetime none of it's hard none of it costs money
this is a culture that has yielded ellsworth wheram ellsworth wheram is ninety seven years old he 's a multimillionaire yet when a contractor wanted six thousand dollars
to build a privacy fence he said for that kind of money i'll do it myself so for the next three days he was out shoveling cement and hauling poles around and predictably perhaps on the fourth day he ended up
in the operating room but not as the guy on the table the guy doing open heart surgery
ninety seven he still does twenty open heart surgeries every month
ed rawlings one hundred and three years old now an active cowboy starts his morning with a swim and on weekends he likes to put on the
rooster tails and then marge deton marge is one hundred and four her grandson actually lives in the twin cities
and tears down the san bernardino freeway where she still volunteers for seven different organizations
none of them exercise at least the way we think of exercise instead they set up their lives so that they are constantly nudged into physical activity
these one hundred year old okinawan women are getting up and down off the ground they sit on the floor thirty or forty times a day
they want to mix up a cake they're doing it by hand that's physical activity that burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does when they do do intentional physical activity
it's the things they enjoy they tend to walk the only proven way to stave off cognitive decline and they all tend to have a garden
they know how to set up their life in the right way so they have the right outlook each of these cultures take time to downshift the sardinians pray the seventh day adventists pray the okinawans have this ancestor veneration
but when you're in a hurry or stressed out that triggers something called the inflammatory response which is associated with everything from alzheimer 's disease to
they have vocabulary for sense of purpose ikigai like the okinawans you know the two most dangerous years in your life are the year you're born because of infant mortality and the year
they tend to eat a plant based diet doesn't mean they don't eat meat but lots of beans and nuts and they have strategies to keep from overeating little things that
they all tend to belong to a faith based community which is worth between four and fourteen extra years of life expectancy if you do it four times a month and the biggest thing here is they also belong to the right tribe
they were either born into or they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people
we know from the framingham studies that if your three best friends are obese there is a fifty percent better chance that you'll be overweight
so if you hang out with unhealthy people that's going to have a measurable impact over time instead if your friend 's idea of
that is going to have the biggest impact over time diets don't work no diet in the history of the world has ever worked for more than two percent of the population
