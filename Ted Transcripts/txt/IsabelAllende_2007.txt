made me a celebrity now people recognize me in macy 's and my grandchildren think that i'm cool allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame
one of the organizers of the olympic ceremony of the opening ceremony called me and said that i had been selected to be one of the flag bearers

what matters most more than training or luck is the heart
only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal
it is all about passion
the streets of turin were covered with red posters announcing the slogan of the olympics
heart is what drives us and determines our fate that is what i need for my characters in my books a passionate heart i need mavericks dissidents

she's pregnant and a widow soldiers have forced her to watch as her husband was tortured and killed
she manages to keep her seven children alive and a few months later she gives birth to premature twins

i was born in ancient times at the end of the world
catholic and conservative family no wonder that by age five i was a raging feminist although the term had not reached chile yet so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me
there was a high price to pay for my freedom
and for questioning the patriarchy but i was happy to pay it because for every blow that i received i was able to deliver two
once when my daughter paula was in her twenties she said to me that feminism was dated that i should move on
we had a memorable fight
for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who
forced into premature marriage prostitution forced labor they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed
they have no control over their bodies or their lives they have no education and no freedom they are raped beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity
for most western young women of today being called a feminist is an insult
by no means it has evolved if you don't like the term or whatever you want
the place is a small women 's clinic in a village in bangladesh the year is two thousand and
jenny is a young american dental hygienist who has gone to the clinic as a volunteer during her three week vacation
she's prepared to clean teeth but when she gets there she finds out that there are no doctors no dentists and the clinic is just a hut full of flies
patient is in excruciating pain because she has several rotten molars jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth
not licensed for that she has never done it she risks a lot and jenny has a brave
that day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth

they are the poorest of the poor
although women do two thirds of the world 's labor they own less than one percent of the world 's assets they are paid less than men for the same work if they're paid at all
and they remain vulnerable because they have no economic independence and they are constantly threatened by exploitation violence and abuse

because they have cut and sold the trees she gets the women to plant new trees and water them drop by drop in a matter of five or six years they have a forest the soil is enriched and the village is
the poorest and most backward societies are always those that put women down
yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments and also by philanthropy for every dollar given to a women 's program twenty dollars are given to men 's programs
women are fifty one percent of humankind empowering them will change everything more than technology and design and entertainment i can promise you that
women working together linked informed and educated can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet

that reality and follow the rules the rules change all the time but they always benefit them
which does not work in economics works perfectly abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom

i think that the time is ripe to make fundamental changes
but for real change we need feminine energy in the management of the world we need a critical number of women in positions of power and we need to nurture the feminine energy in
