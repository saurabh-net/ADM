i spent a few days photographing children in different countries and like a lot of photographers and a lot of journalists i always hope that when my pictures were published
they might actually have an effect on a situation instead of just documenting it so i
i decided i would find six children in different countries and actually go spend some time with the kids and try to tell their story a little bit better than i thought i had done for time magazine in the course of doing the story i was looking for
in korea that there was a young girl who was eleven years old being raised by her grandmother and the grandmother had never let any westerners ever see her every time any westerners came to the village she hid the
with me and went to this village found the grandmother sat down with her and to my astonishment she agreed to let me photograph her granddaughter and i was paying for this myself so i asked the translator
it would be ok if i stayed for the week i had a sleeping bag the family had a small shed on the side of the house so i said could i sleep in my sleeping bag in the evenings and
i just told the little girl whose name was hyun sook lee that if i ever did anything to embarrass her she didn't speak a word of english although she looked very american
she could just put up her hand and say stop and i would stop taking pictures and then my translator left so there i was i couldn't speak a word of korean and this is the first night
her mother was still alive her mother was not raising her her grandmother was raising her and what struck me immediately
was how in love the two of these people were the grandmother was incredibly fond deeply in love with this
they slept on the floor at night the way they heat their homes in korea is to put bricks under the floors so the heat actually radiates from underneath the floor hyun sook was eleven years old i had photographed as i said a lot of these kids
was in fact the fifth child that i found to photograph and almost universally amongst all the kids they were really psychologically
by having been made fun of ridiculed picked on and been rejected and korea was probably the place i found to be the worst for these kids and what struck me immediately in
you can see how much she looks like her grandmother although she looks so western i decided to follow her to school this is the first morning i stayed with her this is on the way to school
this is the morning assembly outside her school
and i noticed that she was clowning around when the teachers would ask questions she'd be the first person to raise her hand
again not at all shy or withdrawn or anything like the other children that i'd photographed again the first one to go to the blackboard to answer questions
getting in trouble for whispering into her best friends ears in the middle of class and one of the other things that i said to her through the translator again this thing about saying stop
was to not pay attention to me and so she really just completely ignored me most of the time i noticed that at recess she was the girl who picked the other girls to be on her team
was very obvious from the very beginning that she was a leader this is on the way home and that's north korea up along the hill this is up along the dmz they would actually cover the windows every night
so that light couldn't be seen because the south korean government has said for years that the north koreans may invade at any time so there's always this the closer you
the week came and my translator came back because i'd asked her to come back so i could formally thank the grandmother and hyun sook and in the course of the grandmother talking to the translator the grandmother started crying
and i said to my translator what 's going on why is she crying and she spoke to the grandmother for a moment and then she started getting tears in her eyes and i said ok what did i do what's going on why is everyone crying and the translator said the grandmother says that she thinks she's dying
and she wants to know if you would take hyun sook to america with you and i said i 'm twenty eight years old and i live in hotels and
i'm not married i mean i had fallen in love with this girl but i you know it was like emotionally i was about twelve years old if you know of photographers
the joke is it's the finest form of delayed adolescence ever invented sorry i have to go on an assignment i'll be back and then you never come back so i
asked the translator why she thought she was dying can i get her to a hospital could i pay to get her a doctor and she refused any help at all
my best friend had mistakenly one day said something about wishing he had another child so here my friends gene and gail had not heard from me in about a year
and suddenly i was calling saying i 'm in korea and i've met this extraordinary girl and i said the grandmother thinks she's sick but i think maybe we
have to bring the grandmother over also and i said i 'll pay for the i mean i had this whole sort of picture so anyway i left and
my friends actually said they were very interested in adopting her and i said look i think i'll scare the grandmother to death if i actually
back and talk to her but i was off on assignment i figured i'd come back in a couple of weeks and talk to the grandmother and on christmas day i was in bangkok with a group of photographers and got a telegram back in those days you got telegrams
from time magazine saying someone in korea had died and left their child in a will to me did i know anything about this because i hadn't told them what i was doing because i was so upset with the story
so i went back to korea and i went back to hyun sook 's village and she was gone and the house that i had spent time in was empty it was incredibly cold
her best friend that she used to play with after school every day and myung sung under some pressure from me and the translator gave us an address on the outside of
and i went to that address and knocked on the door and a man answered the door it was not a very nice area of so i was
the door was being slammed in my face it's incredibly cold and i'm trying to think what would the hero do in a movie if i was writing this as a movie script so i said listen it's really cold i've come a very long way do you mind if i just come in for a minute i'm freezing
so the guy kind of reluctantly let us in and we sat down on the floor and as we started talking i saw him yell something and hyun sook came and brought us some food
and i had this whole mental picture of sort of like cinderella i sort of had this picture of this incredibly wonderful bright happy little child who now appeared to be very withdrawn
being enslaved by this family and i was really appalled and i couldn't figure out what to do and the more i tried talking to him the less friendly he was getting so i finally decided i said look this is all through the translator because this is all you know i don't speak a word of korean
and i said look i'm really glad that hyun sook has a family to live with i was very worried about her i made a promise to her grandmother your mother
mother had been a prostitute and she was a prostitute and a boy who 'd been in and out of jail and i said to them look there's a little girl who has a tiny chance of getting
out of here and going to america i said i don't know if it's the right decision or not but i would like you to come to lunch tomorrow and tell the uncle what it's like to walk down the street what people say to you what you do for a living
and just i want him to understand what happens if she stays here and i could be wrong i don't know but i wish you would come tomorrow so these two came to lunch and
we got thrown out of the restaurant they were yelling at him they were it got to be really ugly and we went outside and he was just furious and i knew i had totally blown this whole thing here i was again trying to figure out what to do
with your cameras around your neck accusing me of enslaving my niece this is my niece i love her she's
daughter who the hell are you to accuse me of something like this and i said you know look i said
i will fly my friends over here from the united states if you want to meet them to see if you approve of them i just think that what little i know about the situation she has very little chance here of having the kind of life that you probably would like her to have
so everyone told me afterwards that inviting the prospective parents over was again the stupidest thing i could have possibly done because who 's ever good enough for your
but he invited me to come to a ceremony they were having that day for her grandmother and they actually take items of clothing and photographs and they burn them as part of the ritual
and you can see how different she looks just in three months this was now i think february early february and the pictures before were taken in september
an american marine priest that i had met in the course of doing the story who had seventy five children living in his house he had three women helping him take care of these kids
father keene he 's just a wonderful guy kids
this is a social worker interviewing hyun sook now i had always thought she was completely untouched by all of this because the grandmother to me appeared to be sort of the village wise woman and the
and he said the second day she was here she made up a list of all of the names of the older kids and the younger kids and she assigned one of the older kids to each of the younger kids
and then she set up a work detail list of who cleaned the orphanage on what day and he said she 's telling me that i'm messy and i have to clean up my room and he said i don't know who raised her but he said she 's running the orphanage and she's been here three
this is a woman who is now working at the orphanage whose son had been adopted
gene and gail started studying korean the moment they had gotten my first letter they really wanted to be able to welcome hyun sook into their family
and one of the things father keene told me when i came back from one of these trips hyun sook had chosen the name natasha
which i understood was from her watching a rocky and bullwinkle cartoon on the american air force station this may be one of those myth buster things that we'll have to clear up here in a minute so my friend gene flew over with his son tim
gail couldn't come and they spent a lot of time huddled over a dictionary and this was gene showing the uncle where atlanta was on the map where he lived
this is the uncle signing the adoption papers
now we went out to dinner that night to celebrate the uncle went back to his family and natasha and tim and gene and i went out to dinner
and gene was showing natasha how to use a knife and fork and then natasha was returning the utensil lessons
we went back to our hotel room and gene was showing natasha also where atlanta was this is the third night we were in korea the first night
a room for the kids right next to us now i'd been staying in this room for about three months it was a little fifteen story korean hotel
so the second night we didn't keep the kids room because we went down and slept on the floor with all the kids at the orphanage and the third night we came back we'd just gone out to dinner where you saw the pictures
and we got to the front desk and the guy at the front desk said there 's no other free rooms on your floor tonight so if you want to put the kids five floors below you there's a room there
and gene and i looked at each other and said no we don't want two eleven year olds five floors away so his son said dad i have a sleeping bag i'll sleep on the floor and i said yeah i have one too so tim and i slept on the floor natasha got one bed gene got the other
kids pass out it's been very exciting for three days we're laying in bed and gene and i are talking about how cool we are we said that was so great we saved this little girl 's life we were just like you know
full of ourselves and we fall asleep and i've been in this room you know for a couple of months now and they always overheat the hotels in korea terribly so during the day i always left the window open
freezing i go to close the window and i hear people shouting outside and i thought oh the bars must have just gotten out and i don't speak korean but i'm hearing these voices and i'm not hearing
so i open the window and i look out and there's flames coming up the side of our hotel and the hotel 's on fire
so i run over to gene and i wake him up and i say gene don't freak out i think the hotel 's on fire and now there's smoke and flames coming by our windows we're on the eleventh floor
so the two of us were just like oh my god oh my god so we're trying to get natasha
and the whole room filled with smoke in about two seconds and gene turns round and says we 're not going to make it and he closes the door and the whole room is now filled with smoke we're all choking and there's smoke pouring through the vents under the doors there's people screaming
i had two overwhelming feelings one was absolute terror it's like oh please god i just want to wake up this has got to be a nightmare this can't be happening please i just want to wake up it's got to be a nightmare and the other is unbelievable guilt here i've been playing god
with my friend 's lives my friend 's son with natasha 's life and this what you get when you try playing god is you hurt people i remember just being so frightened and terrified and gene who 's laying on the floor
says man we've got to soak towels i said what he says we 've got to soak towels we're going to die from the smoke so we ran to the bathroom and got towels and put them over our faces and the kids faces
he said do you have gaffer 's tape i said what he said do you have gaffer 's tape i said yeah somewhere in my halliburton he says we 've got to stop the smoke he said that 's all we can do we've got to stop the smoke i mean gene thank god for gene so we
put the room service menus over the vents in the wall we put blankets at the bottom of the door we put the kids on the windowsill to try to get some air
eleven people ended up dying in the fire five people jumped and died other people were killed by the smoke and
i remember a sort of a tussle at the door trying to get the door open in any case
twelve hours later i mean they put us in the lobby gene ended up using his coat and his fist in the coat to break open a liquor cabinet people were lying on the floor it was one of just the most horrifying nights
and then twelve hours later we rented a car as we had planned to and drove back to natasha 's village and we kept saying do you realize we were dying in a hotel fire like eight hours ago it's so weird how life just goes on natasha wanted to introduce her brother and father
to all the villagers and the day we showed up turned out to be a sixty year old man 's birthday this guy 's sixty years old so it turned into a dual celebration because natasha was the first person from this village ever to go to the united states
so these are the greenhouse tents this is the elders teaching gene their dances we drank a lot of rice wine we were both so drunk i couldn't believe it
you do for a year so i found out the name of every official on both the korean and american side and i photographed them and told them how famous they were going to be when this book was done
and four months later the adoption papers came through this is
saying goodbye to everybody at the orphanage this is father keene with natasha at the bus stop her great aunt at the airport i had
a wonderful deal with cathay pacific airlines for many years where they gave me free passes on all their airlines in return for photography it was like the ultimate perk
and the pilot i actually knew because they used to let me sit in the jump seat to tell you how long ago this was this is a tri star and so they let natasha actually sit in the jump seat and the pilot jeff cowley actually went back and adopted one of the other kids at the orphanage after
meeting natasha this is twenty eight hours later in atlanta it's a very long flight just to make things even crazier gail natasha 's new mom was three days away from giving birth to her own daughter
showing natasha her new cousins and uncles and aunts gene and gail know everyone in atlanta they're the most social couple imaginable so at this point natasha doesn't speak a word of english other than what little father keene
this is kylie her sister who 's now a doctor
this is a deal i had with natasha which is that when we got to atlanta she could take she could cut off my beard she never liked it very much she learned english in three months she entered seventh grade at her own age level
for the first time this is her cooking teacher
me that a lot of the kids thought she was stuck up because they would talk to her and she wouldn't answer and they didn't realize she didn't actually speak english very well in the beginning but what i noticed again as an observer was she was choosing who was going to be on her team
and seemed to be very popular very very quickly now remember the picture how much she looked like her grandmother at the beginning people were always telling natasha how much she looks like her mother gail
a tense moment in the first football game
and kylie i mean it was almost like kylie was her own child
now a lot of parents when they adopt actually want to erase their children 's history and gail and gene did the complete opposite they were studying korean they bought korean clothes
gene even did a little tile work in the kitchen which was that once upon a time there was a beautiful girl that came from hills of korea to live
king the captain of the cheerleaders beauty pageant used to
kodak hired natasha to be a translator for them at the olympics in korea her future husband jeff was working for canon cameras
and met natasha at the olympic village this is her first trip back to korea so there's her uncle this is her half sister she went back to the village that's her best friend 's mother
and i always thought that was a very annie hall kind of outfit
so interesting just to watch this is her mother in the background there
this is natasha 's wedding day gene 's looking a little older
this is sydney who 's going to be three years old in a couple of days and there's evan natasha would you just come up for a second
about forty things she's going to tell me that wasn't what happened that
anyway thank you mike and richard so much for letting us tell the story
