i'm going to take you around the world in eighteen minutes
of operations is in the u s
i knew even then that i would encounter cultural differences and misunderstandings but they popped up when i least
my first day i went to a restaurant and i ordered a cup of green tea with sugar
a pause the waiter said
one does not put sugar in green tea
put sugar in green tea
i understand i said that the japanese do not put sugar in their green tea but i'd like to
i am very sorry we do not have sugar well since i couldn't have
the way i wanted it i ordered a cup of coffee which the waiter brought over promptly packets of
failure to procure myself a cup of sweet green tea was not due to a simple misunderstanding
this was due to a fundamental difference in our ideas about choice
the american way to quote burger king is to have it your way because as starbucks says happiness is in your choices
but from the japanese perspective it's their duty to protect those who don't know any better
in this case the ignorant gaijin from making
let 's face it the way i wanted my tea was inappropriate according to cultural standards and they were doing their best to help me save
they think that choice as seen through the american lens
they don't even hold true at america 's own borders
some of these assumptions and the problems associated with them
how they were shaped by your
if a choice affects you then you should be the one to make it
this is the only way to ensure that your preferences and interests will be most fully accounted for it is essential for success
their guns regardless of what other people want or recommend
it's called being true to yourself
but do all individuals benefit from taking such an approach to choice
and i did a series of studies in which we sought the answer to this very question
group came in and they were greeted by miss smith who showed them six big piles of anagram
the kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do and they even got to choose which marker they would write their answers with
group of children came in they were brought to the same room shown the same
they were told that their anagrams and their and markers had been chosen by their mothers
with this procedure we were able to ensure that the kids across the three groups all did the same activity making it easier for us to compare performance
such small differences in the way we administered the activity yielded striking differences in how well they
as compared to when it was chosen for them by miss smith or their mothers
it didn't matter who did the choosing if the task was dictated by another their performance
when they were told that their been consulted
named mary said you asked my mother
asian american children performed best when they believed their mothers had made the choice second best when they chose for themselves
named natsumi even approached miss smith as she was leaving the room and
did it just like she said
if they had a concept of being true to one 's
or you could say that the
were shaped by the preferences of specific others clearly divided from others
when in contrast two or more individuals see their choices and their outcomes as intimately connected
they may amplify one another 's success by turning choosing into a
that is exactly what the american paradigm
but it is a mistake to assume that of choosing alone
second assumption which informs the american view of choice goes something like with twenty seven million
match com with what is it fifteen million date possibilities now
you will surely find the
coke diet coke sprite seven to be exact really caught me off
oh but it doesn't matter it's all just soda that's just one choice how many choices
when i put out juice and water in addition to these seven sodas now they perceived it as only three choices juice water and
the die hard devotion of many americans not just to a particular flavor of soda but to a particular brand
you and i know that coke is the better choice
and images do you associate with choice from warsaw said
for me it is fear
there are some dilemmas you see
i am used to no choice
bohdan from kiev said in response to how he felt about the new consumer marketplace
it is too much we do not need everything that is there
a sociologist from the warsaw survey agency explained
all around them they were never given a chance to learn how to react
and tomasz a young polish man said
i don't need twenty kinds of chewing gum i don't mean to say that i want no choice but many of these choices are quite artificial
in reality many choices are between things that are
the value of choice depends on our ability to perceive differences between the
see how one choice is unlike another
when there are too many choices to compare and contrast
choice no longer offers opportunities but imposes constraints
choice can develop into the very opposite of everything it represents in
when it is thrust upon those who are insufficiently prepared for it
my studies have shown that when you give people ten or more options when they're making a choice brings me to the
outside chicago a young couple susan and daniel mitchell were about to have their first baby a name for

the baby was delivered through a
but barbara suffered cerebral anoxia a loss of oxygen to the brain
the doctors gave the mitchells a choice
they could either remove barbara off the life support in which case she would die within a matter of hours or
they could keep her on life support
in which case she might still die within a matter of days if she survived she would remain in a permanent vegetative state never able to walk
talk or interact with others they had all suffered
they had all suffered the same tragedy
the doctors decided whether and when the life support would be

he taught us so much he gave us a new perspective on life another
another and another parent said
i feel as if i've played a role in an execution
but when the american parents were asked if they would they all said no
they all said no they could not imagine
number of cases they were even clinically
these parents could not contemplate giving up the choice because to do so would have gone contrary to everything they had been taught
her essay the white album joan didion writes
we interpret what we see
we live entirely by the imposition of a narrative line upon disparate images
by the ideas with which we have learned to freeze the shifting phantasmagoria
which is our actual experience
the story upon which the american dream depends is the story of limitless choice
it's a great story and it's understandable why they would be reluctant to revise it
but when you take a close look
you start to see the holes
and you start to see that the story can be told in many other ways
americans have so often tried to disseminate their ideas of choice
the actual experience that we try to understand and organize through narrative
varies from place to place
could benefit from incorporating new perspectives into their own narrative
that it is poetry that is lost in translation
this suggests that whatever is beautiful and moving
whatever gives us a new way to see
cannot be communicated to those who speak a different language
we have far more to gain than to lose
by engaging in the many translations of the many versions that
and the many that have yet to be written
no matter where we're from
and what your narrative is we all have a responsibility to open ourselves up to a wider array of what choice it teaches us when
that much closer to realizing the full potential of choice
if we learn to speak to one another
we can begin to see choice thank you
detail about your biography that we have not written in the program book but by now it's evident to everyone in this room you're blind and
i guess one of the questions on everybody 's mind is how does that influence your study of choosing because that's an activity that for most people is associated with visual inputs like aesthetics and color and so on
funny that you should ask that because one of the things that's interesting about being blind is you actually get a different vantage point when you observe the way sighted people make choices and as you just mentioned there's lots of choices out there that are very visual these days
yeah i as you would expect get pretty frustrated by choices like what nail polish to put on because i have to rely on what other people suggest and i can't decide
i asked these two ladies and the one lady told me well you should definitely wear ballet slippers well what does it look like
it's a very elegant shade of pink
okay great the other lady tells me to wear adorable
what does it look like
and so i asked them well how do i tell them apart
thing they had consensus on well if i could see them i would clearly be able to tell them apart
wondered was whether they were being affected by the name or the contents of the color so i decided to do a little
the women that could tell them apart when the labels were off they picked adorable and when the labels were on
