it's not about technology it's about people and stories
i could show you what recently was on television as a high quality video sixty minutes many of you may have seen it and it was the now director of the entire piece of the
who was adamantly opposed to these crazy devices that don't work
and it turns out that with sixty minutes cameras rolling in the background after he pretty much made his position clear on this he had his hook and he had his
it's the first time he 's felt like he 's had an arm in thirty nine years but that would sort of be jumping to the middle of the story
and i'm not going to show you that polished video i'm going to instead in a minute or two show you an early crude video because
few years ago i was visited by the guy that runs darpa
people that fund all the advanced technologies that
they have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers
i get this sort of unrequested by me anyway visit
from the military and the guy that runs darpa
the most remote places that we put soldiers hills of afghanistan iraq
they were quite proud of the fact that
car accident in a major city in the united states
part of the face it's probably not coming back
so they started giving me the statistics on how many of these kids had lost an arm and then the surgeon pointed out with a lot of anger
at the end of the civil war they were shooting each other with muskets if somebody lost an arm
we gave them a wooden stick with a hook on it
we give them a plastic stick with a hook on it
and they basically said this is unacceptable
and then the punchline so dean we're here because you make medical stuff you're going to give us an arm
and i was waiting for the five hundred pages of bureaucracy and paperwork and no the guy says
guy into this conference room
and wearing the arm you're going to give us
he or she is going to pick up a raisin or a grape off this table
the wrist flex at the elbow abduct and either way they
oh by the way dean it's going to fit on a fiftieth percentile female frame namely thirty two inches from the long
be completely self contained including all its power
so they finished that and i as you can tell am a bashful guy i told them they're
the surgeon says to me dean you need to know
more than two dozen of these kids have come back
i can not imagine i'm sorry you may have
but compared to that losing two seems like would be an inconvenience
anyway i went home that night i thought about it i literally could not sleep i
so i decided we've got to do this
trust me i've got a day job i've got a lot of day jobs most of my day job keeps me busy funding my fantasies like first and water and power and i've got a lot but i
but i did a little investigation
did a little investigation i still think they're
what it takes to make things like
great he said you got two years
that's under nine pounds that has all that capability
will take the other nine to make it functional and useful
agreed to disagree i went back and i started putting the team together the best guys i could find with a passion to do this at the end of exactly one year
we had a device with fourteen degrees of freedom all the sensors all the microprocessors all the stuff inside
i could show you it with a cosmesis on it that's so real it's eerie but then you wouldn't see all this cool stuff
i think you could see in aimee 's capabilities and attitudes
people with a desire to do something
are quite remarkable and nature is quite
literally he 's got no shoulder on one side and it high trans humeral on the other and that's chuck and randy together
after ten hours were playing in our office and we took some pretty cruddy home movies at the end of the one i'm going to show it's only about a minute and a couple of seconds long
chuck does something that to this day i'm jealous of i can't do it
he picks up a spoon picks it up
scoops out some shredded wheat
i can not do that
his wife was standing behind me she's standing behind me at the time and she says dean
chuck hasn't fed himself in nineteen years
so you've got a choice we keep the arm you keep
you keep this is chuck showing
he 's punching our controls guy the guy behind him is our engineer surgeon which is a convenient guy to have around
there's randy these guys are passing a rubber little ball between them
and just as in the spirit of
first gracious professionalism they are quite proud of this so they decide to share
this is a non trivial thing to do by the way imagine doing that with a wooden stick and a hook on the end of it doing
now chuck is doing something quite extraordinary at least for my limited physical skill
and now he 's going to do what darpa asked me for he 's going to pick up a grape he didn't drop it he didn't break it
but as i've learned from richard
i hadn't dealt with this kind of problem or frankly this whole segment of the medical world
i'll give you some astounding things
i put a bunch of guys in my plane and i said we're flying down to walter reed and we're going talk to these kids because frankly it doesn't matter whether we like this arm it doesn't matter whether the department of defense likes
when i told them that they weren't entirely enthusiastic but i told them it really doesn't matter what their opinion is there is only one opinion that matters the kids that are either going to use it
i told a bunch of my engineers look we're going to walk into walter reed
and you're going to see people lots of them
we walked into walter reed and i could not have been more wrong
we did see a bunch of people
a lot of them missing a lot of body parts
and parts they had left were burned half a face gone an ear burned
sitting at a table they were brought together for us and we started asking them all questions
i'd say to them we 're not quite as good as nature yet
i could give you fine motor control or i could let you curl forty pounds
i probably can't do both i can give you fast control
low reduction ratios in these gears or i can give you power i can't give you both
and we were trying to get them to all help us know what to give them and woman
given enough we're here to help you we need data we need to
after a half an hour maybe there was one guy at the far end of the table who wasn't saying much you could see he was missing an
he was leaning on his other arm
i called down to the end hey you haven't said much if we needed this or this what would you want and he said you know
the lucky guy at this table i lost so
much he had a great spirit like all the rest
and he made a few comments and the meeting ended we said goodbye to all these
they gave it to us they're not finished giving
they're not finished giving i started working harder
went out to brooke army medical center
and we saw lots of these kids lots of
and we've been working harder yet
and i get a call and we go back
we go back to walter reed and a kid literally
twenty some odd days before that
he 's got no legs
he 's got no arms he 's got a small residual limb on one side half of his face
this kid was from staten island and he said i you think
i turned around and went how are we going to do this anyway
he was just like all the rest of them he doesn't really want a lot
so i was on my way out here to help the families
to help the families of all the kids
some that have died some that have like brandon
what am i going to say this is not a happy thing look if this happens to you i can give you this stuff is still not at good at the original equipment you need to
a lot people there recovering
some further along than others but universally these people that have been through this had astounding attitudes
makes a huge difference to them i'll shut up except one
i have i don't think anybody does it intentionally
how much will they get
this country is involved as we've all heard in this great healthcare debate
is entitled to how much
i don't have an answer to that not everybody can be entitled to everything simply because you were born here it's not possible it would be nice but let 's be realistic they are tough questions there is polarized groups down there i don't know the answers
what do we need to do there is very polarized answers to that question too and i don't have any
those are political questions economic questions strategic
i don't have the answer but let me give you a simple is an easy
i know what these kids on the healthcare side
i was talking to one of them one hundred feet
it wouldn't have made and old pigeon jealous
now we got eagles out there a bird flying around
i think eventually we'll make these things extraordinary and i said to that kid
when your buddies are envious of your luke arm
because of what it can do and how it and i'll keep working
and whining and complaining about what our foreign policy ought to be
but while we have the luxury of whining and complaining about who is paying for what and how much we get
people that are out there giving us that great privilege of whining and complaining i know what they deserve everything humanly possible and we
