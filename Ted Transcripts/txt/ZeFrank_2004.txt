you know when chris first approached me to speak at ted i said no because i felt like i wasn't going to be able to make that personal connection
you know that i wanted to it's such a large conference but he explained to me that he was in a bind and that he was having trouble finding the kind of sex appeal and star power
so i said fine ted i mean chris
i want to speak as early in the morning as possible
the theme for ted two thousand and six and luckily he agreed
the theme in two years is going to be cute pictures of the
doesn't actually take pictures but
dear sir good day compliments of the day and my best wishes to you and family
i know this letter will come to you surprisingly but let it not be a surprise to you for nature has a way of arriving unannounced
for you to assure me of safety and honesty if i have to entrust any amount of money under your custody
i am mister michael bangoora
the son of late mister tiamu bangoora who was the minister of finance in sierra leone but was killed during a civil war
knowing your country to be economical conducive for investment and your people as transparent and trustworthy to engage in business on which premise i write you
before my father death he had the sum of twenty three million united states dollars which he kept away from the rebel leaders during the course of the war
this fund was supposed to be used for the rehabilitation of water reserves all over the country before the outbreak of war
when the war broke out the rebel leader demanded that the fund be given to him my father insisted it was not in his possession
and he was killed because of his refusal to release the
meanwhile my mother and i is the only person who knows about the fund because my father always confide in of the box
the fund was deposited as a family reassure in a safe reliable security company in dakar senegal
where i was only given temporary asylum i do not wish to invest the money in senegal due to unfavorable economic climate and so close to my country the only assistance i need from you
which i know you would do for me are the
be remitted three receive the funds into your account in trust take out your commission and leave the rest of the money
until i arrive after the transfer is complete sincerely mister michael bangoora
this is really embarrassing i was told backstage that i have eighteen minutes i only prepared fifteen
so if it's cool i'd like to just wait for three serfaas
serfaas are you a virgin
i mean like in the ted sense
thousand eight hundred and sixty am i good
some google guys last night
really cool we were getting wasted
and they were telling me that google software has gotten so advanced that based on your interaction with google over your lifetime they can actually predict what you are going to say and i was like
but they said no but don't
but they slipped up and they said that i could just type in what was i going to say next
and my name and it would tell me
was i going to say
and ze frank that's me am i feeling am i feeling lucky
am i feeling lucky oh
oh on a thursday i
sent out a link to a website that featured those clips to seventeen of my closest friends as part of my an invitation to my
i received a call from earthlink that said due to a ten cents per megabyte overage charge i owed them thirty thousand dollars
needless to say i was able to leave my job
more of as like an internet guru or swami
i i knew i had something about
what makes websites popular and
you know it's it's unfortunate that i don't have more time
i can come back next year
and it's been an amazing opportunity to kind of get to know
you know it's like a microscope to the rest of the world you can kind of peer into other people 's lives and
i also feel like i get a lot of inspiration
from the average user for example somebody wrote me they said hey ze if you ever come to boulder
you should rock out with us and i said why wait
and they said hey ze thanks for rocking out but i meant the kind of rocking out where we'd be naked
and that was embarrassing but you know it's kind of a collaboration between me and the fans so i said
you're saying you're saying holy crap how is his presentation so smooth
and i have to say that it's not all me this year i guess
chris has to take some credit here because in years past i guess there's been some sort of subpar speakers at which really allowed us
as speakers to get there in the trenches and practice at home so that we would be ready for this experience and i've got to say that
you know it's really really great to be here
not just the good stuff
you can do heckler mode hey moron get off the stage
case you run over time
just one last thing i'd like to say i 'd really and
all this stuff this internet stuff and you're not making any money
why and i say mom dad
trying you know i don't know if you're
all aware of this but the video the video game market kids are playing these video games oh but supposedly there's tons of money i mean like i think one hundred thousand dollars or so a year is being spent on these things so
i decided to try my hand i came up with a few games
is called atheist i figured it 'd be
move around and say some things
done this before i tried you come back
and this is great because you know for a quarter you can play this for a long time and chris had said in an email that you know we should really bring something new to ted something that we haven't shown anyone so
made this for ted it's christian it's the third in the series i'm hoping it's going to do well this year have a preference
so you can wait for the second coming which is a random number between one and five hundred million
so really what are we talking about here oh tech joy
tech joy to me means something because i get a lot of joy out of tech
making things using technology and i'm being serious here even though i'm using my sarcastic voice i
making things you know making things actually does give me a lot of joy it's the process of creation that keeps me sort of a bubble and a half above perpetual anxiety
in my life and it's that feeling of being about eighty percent complete on a project where you know you still have something to do but it's not finished and you're not
in a culture of guru ship it's so hard to use some software because you know it's unapproachable people feel like they have to read the manual so
i try to i try to create these very minimal activities that allow people to express themselves and hopefully
try to create meaningful environments for people to express themselves here i created a contest called when office supplies attack which i think really resonated with the working population
over five hundred entries in three weeks
again people from all over the country doing the watch is particularly incredible
online drawing tools you've probably seen a lot of them i think they're wonderful i think it's a chance for people to get to play with crayons and all that kind of stuff but i'm interested in the process the process of creating as the real event that i'm interested in
and the problem is that a lot of people suck at drawing and they get bummed out at this sort of you know stick figure awful little thing that they created
and eventually it just makes them stop playing with it or draw you know they draw penises and things like that
so the scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool in other words it's a helping tool you can draw your simple stick figure and then it collaborates with you to create sort of like a post war german etching
you can in fact it's tuned to be better at drawing things that look worse so we go ahead and we start scribbling
and so the idea is that you can really you know
and here are some of my favorites this is the little trap marionette that was submitted to
i mean this is incredible this is an eleven year old girl drew this and submitted it it's just
is not a joke but i think it's a it's a really fun and wonderful thing so
this is called the fiction project this is an online space which is it's basically a refurbished message board that
at a different at a different time i think that the
now tied up tied down mistress cruel approaches me now tied down it's up
it's it's an amazing way
if you come home and your spouse or whoever it is says let 's talk
that like chills you to the very core
but it's peripheral activities like these that allow people to get together doing fun things they actually get to know each other and it is sort of like low threshold
activities that i think are the key to bringing up some of our bonding social capital that we're lacking and very very quickly i love puppets
music lotte reiniger an amazing shadow puppeteer in the twenties that started doing more elaborate things i became interested in puppets and i just want to show one last thing to you ladies and gentlemen
