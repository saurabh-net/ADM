we 're pale gray creatures we hide in dark windowless rooms and generally avoid sunlight we make skinny models skinnier perfect skin more perfect and the impossible possible
and we get criticized in the press all the time but some of us are actually talented artists with years of experience and a real appreciation for images and photography
i along with hundreds of other volunteers knew we couldn 't just sit at home so i decided to join them for three weeks on may the thirteenth i made my way to the town of ≈çfunato it 's a small fishing town in iwate prefecture
about fifty thousand people one of the first that was hit by the wave
the waters here have been recorded at reaching over twenty four meters in height
and traveled over two miles inland as you can imagine the town had been devastated
we pulled debris from canals and ditches we cleaned schools we de mudded and gutted homes ready for renovation and rehabilitation we cleared tons and tons of stinking rotting fish carcasses from the local fish processing plant we got dirty and we loved it
everything had to be left behind at the end of my first week there i found myself helping out in an evacuation center in the town i was helping clean the onsen the communal onsen the huge giant bathtubs this happened to also be a place in the town
now it was emotional and it was inspiring and i 've always heard about thinking outside the box but it wasn 't until i had actually gotten outside of my box that something happened
as i looked through the photos there were some were over a hundred years old some still in the envelope from the processing lab i couldn 't help but think as a retoucher that i could fix that tear and mend that scratch and
i knew hundreds of people who could do the same
so we started retouching photos
this was the very first not terribly damaged but where the water had caused that discoloration on the girl 's face had to be repaired with such accuracy and delicacy
otherwise that little girl isn 't going to look like that little girl anymore and surely that 's as tragic as having the photo damaged
over time more photos came in thankfully and more retouchers were needed and so i reached out again on facebook and linkedin and within five days eighty people wanted to help from twelve different countries within two weeks i had one hundred and fifty people wanting to join in
within japan by july we 'd branched out to the neighboring town of rikuzentakata further north to a town called yamada once a week we would set up our scanning equipment in the temporary photo libraries that had been set up where people were reclaiming their photos
the time it took however to get it
back is a completely different story and it depended obviously on the damage involved it could take an hour it could take weeks it could take months the kimono in this shot pretty much had to be hand drawn or pieced together
picking out the remaining parts of color and detail that the water hadn 't damaged it was very time consuming
now all these photos had been damaged by water submerged in salt water covered in bacteria in sewage sometimes even in oil all of which over time is going to continue to damage them so hand cleaning them was a huge part of the project we couldn 't retouch the photo unless it was cleaned dry and reclaimed
the lady who brought us these photos was lucky as far as the photos go
when she collected the photos from us she shared a bit of her story with us her photos were found by her husband 's colleagues at a local fire department in the debris a long way from where the home had once stood and they 'd recognized him
the day of the tsunami he 'd actually been in charge of making sure the tsunami gates were closed he had to go towards the water as the sirens sounded
for her despite all of this those photos were the perfect gift back to him something he could look at again something he remembered from before that
helped us get ninety families hundreds of photographs back fully restored and retouched during this time we hadn 't really spent more than about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials most of which was printer inks
we take photos constantly a photo is a reminder of someone or something
a place a relationship a loved one they 're our memory keepers and our histories the last thing we would grab
and the first thing you 'd go back to look for that 's all this project was about
about restoring those little bits of humanity giving someone that connection back
when a photo like this can be returned to someone like this it makes a huge difference in the lives of the person receiving it
the project 's also made a big difference in the lives of the retouchers for some of them it 's given them a connection to something bigger giving something back using their talents on something other than skinny models and perfect skin
i would like to conclude by reading an email i got from one of them cindy the day i finally got back from japan after six months
as i worked i couldn 't help but think about the individuals and the stories represented in the images one in particular
a photo of women of all ages from grandmother to little girl gathered around a baby struck a chord because a similar photo from my family my grandmother and mother myself and newborn daughter hangs on our wall
across the globe throughout the ages our basic needs are just the same aren 't they thank you
