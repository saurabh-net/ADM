about the haiti earthquake by skype
my wife sent me a message whoa earthquake
and that was building collapse
all seen the photos of the collapsed buildings in
the national palace the equivalent of the white house
this is the largest supermarket in the caribbean at peak shopping time
this is a nurses college
this is the ministry of economics and finance
we have all heard about the tremendous human loss
in the earthquake in haiti
but we haven't heard enough about why all those lives
we haven't heard about why the buildings
that injured three hundred and thirty thousand
that displaced one point three million people
that cut off food and water and supplies for an entire nation a disaster of engineering
worked in haiti since two thousand and seven working with
which is the u n mission in haiti
we inspected schools and private
we inspected medical centers and food warehouses
we inspected government buildings this is the ministry of justice behind that door is the national judicial archives the fellow in the door andre filitrault
director of the center for interdisciplinary earthquake engineering research at the university of buffalo was examining it to see if it was safe to recover the archives
there is nothing here that we don't know
the failure points were the same
walls and slabs not tied properly into columns that's a roof slab hanging off the building
poor building materials not enough concrete not enough compression in the blocks
and we know how to build properly
the proof of this came five hundred times
power of the seven point zero that hit port au prince
five hundred times the power yet only under a thousand casualties
adjusted for population density that is less than one percent of the impact of the haitian quake
what was the difference between chile and haiti
seismic standards and confined masonry
where the building acts as a whole walls and columns and roofs and slabs tied together
to support each other instead of breaking off into separate members and failing
if you look at this building in
but it's not a pile of rubble
have been building with confined masonry for decades
right now aidg is working with kpff consulting engineers architecture for humanity to bring more confined masonry training into haiti this is
took one of our trainings
on his last job he was working with his boss and they started pouring the columns wrong
he took his boss aside and he showed him the materials on confined masonry
he showed him you know we don't have to do this wrong
cost us any more to do it the right way and they redid that
tied the rebar right they poured the columns right
and that building will be safe and every building
that they build going forward
to make sure these buildings are safe it's not going to take policy
it's going to take reaching out
to the masons on the ground
and helping them learn the proper techniques
now there are many groups doing this and the fellow in the vest there craig toten he has pushed forward to get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this
through haiti rewired through build change architecture for humanity
thirty thousand forty thousand masons across the country and create a movement of proper building the billions spent
the billions spent on reconstruction
you can train masons for dollars on every house that they end up building over their lifetime
the way at the top is the way that haiti 's been building for decades
the way at the top
is a poorly constructed building that will fail
the way at the bottom is a confined masonry building
where the walls are tied together the building is symmetric and it will stand up to an earthquake for all the disaster
there is an opportunity here to build better houses for the next generation so that when the next earthquake hits
a disaster but not a tragedy
