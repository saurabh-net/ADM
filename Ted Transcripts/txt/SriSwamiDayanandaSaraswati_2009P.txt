it cannot be consciously a contributor it
it the help of
the help of it
it can 't afford to doubt the person who tends the child it has to totally surrender
that implies a lot of trust
it begins to discover that the person trusted
is violating the trust it doesn 't know even the word violation
therefore it has to blame itself a wordless blame which is more
as the child grows to become an adult
one cannot contribute unless one feels secure one feels big one feels i have enough
not in terms of any status that you can command in the society
on that self it should be centered a bigness a wholeness otherwise
compassion is just a word and a dream you can be compassionate occasionally
more moved by empathy than by compassion
these two guys fight it out each one has got two games
both the players have to come to the net you see his whole
no human heart is denied of that empathy no religion can demolish that by indoctrination
no culture no nation and nationalism nothing can touch it because it is empathy and that capacity to empathize
you reach out to people
compassion is not defined in one form
then this occasional compassion we are not talking about it
i am going to cite the possibility of being whole which is within our experience everybody 's experience
in spite of a very tragic life one
even for a slapstick joke and
the subject me and the object the scheme of things fuse into oneness
an experience nobody can say i am denied of
an experience common to all and sundry
that experience confirms that in spite of all your limitations
all your wants desires unfulfilled and the credit cards and finally baldness
and finally baldness the
be different from you cannot be minus you
it has got to be you you cannot be a part of wholeness and still be whole your moment of happiness reveals that reality that realization that recognition
maybe i am the whole maybe the swami is right maybe the swami is right you start your new life
then everything becomes meaningful i have no more reason to blame myself
if one has to blame oneself one has a million reasons plus many but if i say in spite of my body being limited if it is black it is not white
body is limited any which way you look at it limited
and there is no way of your being not limitless too
and the wholeness is the reality of you when you relate to the world it is love first when you relate to the world the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness
if the object that you relate
you cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water laughter you learn swimming by swimming you learn cycling by cycling you learn cooking by cooking having some sympathetic people around you compassion
for compassion that 's interesting to me you act compassionately
you act compassionately as though you have compassion grind your teeth take all the support system if you know how to pray pray is
