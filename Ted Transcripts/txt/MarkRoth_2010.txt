talk to you today about my work on suspended animation now usually when i mention suspended animation people will flash me the vulcan sign and laugh but now i'm not talking about gorking people out to fly
to mars or even pandora as much fun as that might be i'm talking about the concept of using suspended animation to help people out in trauma
so what do i mean when i say suspended animation it is the process by which
so here is the sort of big idea if you look out at nature
you find that as you tend to see suspended animation you tend to see immortality
de animate them a bit so they're a little more immortal when they have that heart attack
an example of an organism or two that happens to be quite immortal would be plant seeds or bacterial spores
these creatures are some of the most immortal life forms on our planet and they tend to spend most of their time in suspended animation
to suggest that this all sort of about little tiny creatures i want to bring it close to home in the immortal germ line of human beings
that is the eggs that sit in the ovaries they actually sit there in a state of suspended animation for up to fifty years in the life of each woman so
then there's also my favorite example of suspended animation this is sea monkeys those of you with children you know about them
you go to the pet store or the toy store and you can buy these things you just open the bag and you just dump them in to the plastic aquarium and in about a week or so you'll have little shrimps swimming around
well i wasn't so interested in the swimming i was interested in what was going on in the bag the bag on the toy store shelf where those shrimp sat in suspended animation indefinitely so these
ideas of suspended animation are not just about cells and weird little organisms occasionally human beings
are briefly de animated and the stories of people who are briefly de animated that interest me the most are those having to do with the cold
ten years ago there was a skier in norway that was trapped in an icy waterfall
and she was there for two hours before they extracted her she was extremely cold and she had no heartbeat for all intents and purposes she was dead frozen
seven hours later still without a heartbeat they brought her back to life and she went on to be the head radiologist in the hospital that treated
a couple of years later so i get really excited about these things about a couple of years later there was a thirteen month old
the winter and they brought her back to life the next day she was doing so well they wanted to run tests on her she got cranky and just went home
so these are miracles right these are truly miraculous things that happen doctors have a saying that in fact you're not dead until you're warm and dead and it's true
back to life without any neurologic problems that's over fifty percent so what i was trying to do is think of a way that
i have to tell you something very odd and that is that being exposed to low oxygen does not always kill
so in this room there's twenty percent oxygen or so and if we reduce the oxygen concentration we will all be dead and in fact the animals we were working with in the lab
these little garden worms nematodes they were also dead when we exposed them to low oxygen and here 's the thing that should freak you out
and that is that when we lower the oxygen concentration further by one hundred times to ten parts per million they were not dead
they were in suspended animation and we could bring them back to life without any harm and this precise oxygen concentration ten parts per million that caused suspended animation is conserved
we can see it in a variety of different organisms one of the creatures we see it in is a fish and we can turn its heartbeat on and off by going in and out of suspended animation like you would a light switch so
this was pretty shocking to me
that we could do this and so i was wondering when we were trying to reproduce the work with the skier that we noticed that of course she had no oxygen consumption
and so maybe she was in a similar state of suspended animation but of course she was also extremely cold so we wondered what would happen if we took our suspended animals and exposed them to the cold
and so what we found out was that if you take animals that are animated like you and i and you make them cold that is these were the garden worms now they're dead
right it's a really good thing and so we were thinking about that about this relationship between these things and thinking about whether or not that's what happened to the skier
we have from the time we are slapped on the butt until we take our last dying breath that's when we're newborn to when we're dead we cannot reduce our metabolic rate below what's called a standard or basal metabolic rate
but i knew that there were examples of creatures also mammals that do reduce their metabolic rate such as ground squirrels and bears they reduce their metabolic rate in the wintertime when they hibernate
so i wondered might we be able to find some agent or trigger that might induce such a state in us and so
we went looking for such things and this was a period of time when we failed tremendously ken robinson is here he talked about the glories of failure well we had a lot of
we tried many different chemicals and agents and we failed over and over again so one time i was at home
watching television while my wife was putting our child to bed and i was watching a television show
it was a television show it was a nova show on pbs about caves in new mexico and this particular cave was
and this cave is incredibly toxic to humans the researchers had to suit up just to enter it it's filled with this toxic gas hydrogen sulfide
now hydrogen sulfide is curiously present in us we make it ourselves the highest concentration is in our brains
yet it was used as a chemical warfare agent in world war
you appear dead but if you were brought out into room air you can be reanimated without harm if they do that quickly so i thought wow i have to get some of now
it's post nine eleven america and when you go into the research institute and you say
hi i'd like to buy some concentrated compressed gas cylinders of a lethal gas
i have these ideas see about wanting to suspend people it's really going to be okay so that's kind of a tough day but i said there really is
basis for thinking why you might want to do this as i said this agent is in us and in fact here 's a curious thing it binds to the very place inside of your cells where oxygen binds
a person some hydrogen sulfide and might it be able to occupy that place like in a game of musical chairs where oxygen might bind
might we be able to use hydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold and we wanted to see whether we could reproduce this skier in a mammal
now mammals are warm blooded creatures and when we get cold we shake and we shiver right we try to keep our core temperature at thirty seven degrees by actually burning more oxygen so
it was interesting for us when we applied hydrogen sulfide to a mouse
it appeared dead it's oxygen consumption rate fell by tenfold and here 's the really important point
i told you hydrogen sulfide is in us it's rapidly metabolized and all you have to do after six hours of being in this state of de animation is simply put the thing out in room air and it warms up and it's none the worse for
now this was cosmic really because we had found a way to de animate a mammal
it was fine now in this state of de animation it could not go out dancing but it was not dead and it was not
so we started to think is this the agent that might have been present in the skier and might have she had more of it than someone else and might have been able
to reduce her demand for oxygen before she got so cold that she otherwise would have died as we found out with our worm experiments
so we wondered can we do anything useful with this capacity to control metabolic flexibility and
the things we wondered i'm sure some of you out there are economists and you know all about supply and demand and when supply is equal to demand everything 's fine
but when supply falls in this case of oxygen and demand stays high you're dead
so what i just told you is we can now reduce demand we ought to lower supply to unprecedented low levels without killing the animal
and with money we got from darpa we could show just that if you give mice hydrogen sulfide you can lower their demand for oxygen
well this was really cool we also found out that we could subject animals to otherwise lethal blood loss and we could save them if we gave them
so these proof of concept experiments led me to say i should found a company and we should take this out to a wider playing field
so these are the thought leaders in trauma medicine all over the world saying this is true so it seems that exposure to hydrogen sulfide decreases damage that you receive from being exposed to otherwise lethal low oxygen
i should say that the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide required to get this benefit
are low incredibly low in fact so low that physicians will not have to lower or dim the metabolism of people much at all to see the benefit i just mentioned
i want to say that we're in human trials now and so
you the phase one safety studies are over and we're doing fine we're now moved on we have to get to phase two and phase three it's going to take us a few years this has all moved very quickly
and the mouse experiments of hibernating mice happened in two thousand and five the first human studies were done in two thousand and eight and we should know in a couple of years whether it works or not
and this all happened really quickly because of a lot of help from a lot of people i want to mention that first of all my wife without whom this talk and my work would not be possible so thank you very much also
and also the wonderful scientists and business people at ikaria one thing those people did out there was take this technology
of hydrogen sulfide which is this start up company that's burning venture capital very quickly and they fused it with another company that sells another toxic gas that's more toxic than
and this gas that is delivered in over a thousand critical care hospitals worldwide now is approved on label and saves thousands of babies a year from certain death
so it's really incredible for me to be a part of this and i want to say that i think we're on the path of understanding metabolic flexibility in a fundamental way
and that in the not too distant future an emt might give an injection of hydrogen sulfide or some related compound
to a person suffering severe injuries and that person might de animate a bit they might become a little more immortal
their metabolism will fall as though you were dimming a switch on a lamp at home and then
they will have the time that will buy them the time to be transported to the hospital
to get the care they need and then after they
get that care like the mouse like the skier like the sixty five year old woman they'll wake up a miracle we hope not or maybe we just hope to make miracles a little more common
