popular votes more than any other presidential candidate of any race of any party in history if you compare how obama did against how john kerry had done four years earlier
democrats really like seeing this transition here where almost every state becomes bluer becomes more democratic even states obama lost like out west those states became more blue in the south in the northeast almost everywhere but with a couple of exceptions
here and there one exception is in massachusetts that was john kerry 's home state no big surprise obama couldn 't do better than kerry there or in arizona which is john mccain 's home obama didn 't have much improvement but there is also this part of the country kind of in the middle region here this kind of arkansas tennessee
oklahoma west virginia region now if you look at ninety six bill clinton the last democrat to actually win
so when we think about parts of the country like arkansas you know there is a book written called what 's the matter with kansas but really the question here obama did relatively well in kansas he lost badly but every democrat does he lost no worse than most people do but yeah what 's the matter with arkansas
rednecks quote unquote with guns and we think people like this probably don 't want to vote
we asked those people actually we didn 't ask them but when they conducted exit polls in every state in thirty seven states out of the fifty they asked a question that was pretty direct about race they asked this question
in deciding your vote for president today was the race of the candidate a factor we 're looking for people that said yes race was a factor moreover it was an important factor in my decision
and people who voted for john mccain as a result of that factor maybe in combination with other factors and maybe alone we 're looking for this behavior among white voters or really non black voters
so you see big differences in different parts of the country on this question in louisiana about one in five
white voters said yes one of the big reasons why i voted against barack obama is because he was an african american if those people had voted for obama even half of them obama would have won louisiana safely same is true with i think all of these states you see on the top of the list meanwhile
california new york we can say oh we 're enlightened but you know certainly a much lower incidence of this admitted i suppose manifestation of racially based voting
here is the same data on a map you kind of see the relationship between the redder states of where more people responded and said yes barack obama 's race was a problem for me you see
comparing the map to ninety six you see an overlap here this really seems to explain why barack obama did worse in this one part of the country so we have to ask why is racism predictable in some way is there something
driving this is it just about some weird stuff that goes on in arkansas that we don 't understand and kentucky or are there more systematic factors at work and so we can look at a bunch of different variables
these are things that economists and political scientists look at all the time things like income and religion education which of these seem to drive this manifestation of racism in this big national experiment we had on november fourth and there are a couple of these that have
strong predictive relationships one of which is education where you see the states with the fewest years of schooling per adult are in red and you see this part of the country the kind of appalachians region is less educated it 's just a fact and you see the relationship there with the racially based voting patterns
the other variable that 's important is the type of neighborhood that you live in
states that are more rural even to some extent of the states like new hampshire and maine they exhibit a little bit
of this racially based voting against barack obama so it 's the combination of these two things it 's education and the type of neighbors that you have which we 'll talk about more in a moment and the thing about states like arkansas and tennessee is that they 're both very rural and they are educationally impoverished
so yes racism is predictable these things among maybe other variables but these things seem to predict it we 're going to drill down a little bit more now into something called the general social survey this is conducted by the university of chicago every other year
and they ask a series of really interesting questions in two thousand they had particularly interesting questions about racial attitudes one simple question they asked is does anyone of the opposite race live in your neighborhood we can see in different types of communities that the results are quite different in cites about eighty percent of people have
black neighbors or really some neighbor of another race and people who have only white neighbors
and we see in some variables in terms of political attitudes not a lot of difference this was eight years ago some people were more republican back
and even some questions about race for example affirmative action which is kind of a political question a policy question about race if you will not much difference here affirmative action is not very popular frankly with white voters period but people with black neighbors and people with mono racial neighborhoods feel no differently about it really
but if you probe a bit deeper and get a bit more personal if you will
do you favor a law banning interracial marriage
there is a big difference people who don 't have neighbors of a different race are about twice as likely to oppose interracial marriage as people who do just based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you and likewise they asked not in two thousand but in the same survey in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six would you not vote for a qualified
urban versus rural it 's about who you live with racism is predictable and it 's predicted by interaction or lack thereof with people unlike you people of other races so if you want to address it the goal is to facilitate interaction with people of other races i have a couple of very obvious i suppose ideas for maybe how to do that
i 'm a big fan of cities especially if we have
facilitate more of the kind of networking the kind of casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis but also
this type of urban design which became more prevalent in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s and one thousand nine hundred and eighty s i think there is a relationship between that and the country becoming more conservative under ronald reagan but also here is another idea we have
is an intercollegiate exchange program where you have students going from new york abroad but frankly there are enough differences within the country now where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from nyu have them go study for a semester at the university of arkansas and vice versa do it at the high school level predictable
