i'm going to try to give you a view of the world as i see it the problems and the opportunities that we face
and then ask the question if we should be optimistic or pessimistic and then i'll let you in on a secret which is why i am an incurable optimist
showing you an al gore movie that you may have seen before all seen inconvenient
truth this is a little more inconvenient
our atmosphere seems to be getting warmer this is bad well it's been calculated a few degrees rise in the earth 's temperature would melt
should we feel good or should we feel bad that fifty years of foreknowledge accomplished so little well it depends really on what your goals are
and i think as my goals i always go back to gandhi 's talisman when mahatma gandhi was asked
how do you know if the next act that you are about to do is the right one or the wrong
he said consider the face of the poorest most vulnerable human being that you ever chanced upon
for those of us in this room it's not just the poorest and the most vulnerable individual it's the community it's the culture
it's the world itself and the trends for those who are at the periphery of our society who are the poorest and the most vulnerable
the trends give rise to a great case for pessimism but there's also a wonderful case for optimism let 's review them both first of all
there's two degrees or three degrees of climate change baked into the system it will cause rising seas it will cause saline deposited into wells and into lands
it will disproportionately harm the poorest and the most vulnerable as will the increasing rise of population
even though we've dodged paul ehrlich 's population bomb and we will not see twenty billion people in this decade as he had forecast we eat as if we were twenty billion
and we consume so much that again a rise of six point five billion to nine point
five billion in our grandchildren 's lifetime will disproportionately hurt the poorest and the most vulnerable that's why they migrate to cities
rural areas are no longer producing as much food as they did the green revolution never reached africa and with desertification sandstorms the gobi desert the
we are finding increasing difficulty of
to produce as many calories as it did even fifteen years ago so humans are turning more towards animal consumption
in africa last year africans ate six hundred million wild animals and consumed two billion kilograms
and every kilogram of bushmeat
contained hundreds of thousands of novel viruses that have never been charted
the genomic sequences of which we don't know
their fitness for creating pandemics we are unaware of
but we are ripe for zoonotic borne emerging communicable diseases
i would say explosive growth of technology
most of us are the beneficiaries of that growth
but it has a dark side in
and in technology that puts us on a collision course to magnify any anger hatred or feeling of marginalization
and in fact with increasing globalization for which there are big winners and even bigger losers
today the world is more diverse and unfair than perhaps it has ever been in history
one percent of us own forty percent of all the goods and services what will
the billion people today who live on less than one dollar a day rise to three billion
in the next thirty years
the one percent will own even more than forty percent of all the world 's goods and services not because they've grown richer but because the rest of the world has grown increasingly poorer
there's lots of reason for pessimism darfur is at its origin a resource war
last year there were eighty five thousand riots in china two hundred and thirty a day that required police or military intervention most of them were about resources
we are facing an unprecedented number scale of disasters some are weather related human rights related
a quaint forerunner of things to come it's a destabilized world
and unlike destabilized world in the past it will be broadcast to you on youtube you will see it on digital television and on your
what will that lead to for some it will lead to anger religious and sectarian violence and terrorism for others withdrawal
for others withdrawal nihilism materialism
will we become energized let 's look at one case the case of bangladesh first even if carbon dioxide emissions stopped today global warming would continue
and even with global warming if you can see these blue lines the dotted line shows even if
of greenhouse gasses stopped today the next decades will see rising sea levels a minimum
sea levels is the best case that we can hope for and it could be ten times that what will that to do to bangladesh let 's take a look so here 's bangladesh
seventy percent of bangladesh is at less than five feet above sea level let 's go up and take a look at the himalayas
and we'll watch as global warming makes them melt more water comes down the deforested areas here in the tarai will be unable to absorb the effluent because trees are like straws
that suck up the extra seasonal water now we're looking down south through the kali gandaki many of you i think have probably trekked here and we're going to cruise down and take a look
and in the seas rising from the south looking at the five major rivers that feed bangladesh and now let 's look from the south
looking up and let 's see this in relief
flows from the himalayas and take a look at this
as many as one hundred million refugees from bangladesh could be expected to migrate
into india and into china this is
the difficulty that one country faces but if you look at the
all around the earth wherever there is low lying area
area we're all in this together
this is not something that happens far away to people that we don't know global warming is something that happens to all of us all at once as are these newly emerging communicable diseases
twenty years ago no one had ever heard of west nile fever and then we watched as one case arrived on the east coast of the united states and it marched every year
westwardly do you remember no one had heard of ebola until we heard of hundreds of people dying in central africa from it
it's just the beginning unfortunately there have been thirty novel emerging
it's more than enough reason for pessimism but now let 's look at the case for optimism
of the bad news human beings have always risen to the challenge you just need to look at the list of nobel laureates
to remind ourselves we've been here before paralyzed by fear paralyzed into inaction when some
probably one of you in this room jumped into the breach and created an organization like physicians for social responsibility
which fought against the nuclear threat medicins sans frontieres that renewed our commitment to disaster relief
muhammad yunus we've seen the eradication of smallpox we may see the eradication of polio this year last year there were only two thousand cases in the world
we may see the eradication of guinea worm next year there are only thirty five thousand cases left in the world twenty years ago there were three and a half million and we've seen a new disease not like
the thirty novel emerging communicable diseases this disease is called sudden wealth syndrome it's an amazing phenomenon
all throughout the technology world we're seeing young people bitten by this disease of sudden wealth syndrome
but they're using their wealth in a way that their forefathers never did they're not waiting until they die to create foundations
we all felt that we were part of it that a better world was right around the corner that we were watching the birth of a world free of hatred and violence and prejudice today there's another kind of movement it's a movement
to save the earth it's just beginning five weeks ago a group of activists from the business community gathered together to stop a texas utility from
building nine coal fired electrical plants that would have contributed to destroying the environment six months ago
a group of business activists gathered together to join with the republican governor in california to pass ab thirty two
the most far reaching legislation in environmental history al gore
made presentations in the house and the senate as an expert witness can you imagine
we're seeing an entente cordiale between science and religion that five years ago i would not have believed as the evangelical community
has understood the desperate situation of global warming and now four thousand churches
is an amazing breakthrough something that should make all of us feel that hope is on the horizon and
on april fourteenth there will be step up day where there will be a thousand individual mobilized social activist movements in the united states on protest against legislation
concerts and you can feel this optimistic move to save the earth in the air now that doesn't mean that people understand
that global warming hurts the poorest and the weakest the most that means that people are beginning the first step which is acting out of their own self interest
but i am seeing in the major funders in care rockefeller rockefeller brothers fund hewlett mercy corps you guys google so many other organizations
a beginning of understanding that we need to work not just on primary prevention of global warming but on the secondary prevention of the consequences of global warming on the poorest and the most vulnerable
but for me i have another reason
to be an incurable optimist
and you've heard so many inspiring stories here and i heard so many last night that i thought i would share a little bit of mine
my background is not exactly conventional medical training and i lived in a himalayan monastery and i studied with a very wise teacher who kicked me out of the in the last century
in the summer of love
sixty seven two million people children died of smallpox it's not ancient history when you read
the biblical plague of boils that was smallpox pharaoh ramses the fifth whose picture is here died of smallpox to eradicate smallpox
we had to gather the largest united nations army in history we visited every house in india searching for smallpox one hundred and twenty million houses once every month for nearly two years
in a cruel reversal after we had almost conquered smallpox and this is what you must learn as a social entrepreneur the realm of the final inch
when we had almost eradicated smallpox it came back again because the company town of tatanagar drew laborers who could come there and get employment
and they caught smallpox in the one remaining place that had smallpox and they went home to die and when they did they took smallpox to ten other countries and reignited the epidemic and we had to start all over again
but in the end we succeeded
and the last case of smallpox this little girl rahima
in bangladesh when she coughed or breathed
and the last virus of smallpox left her lungs and fell on the dirt and the sun
killed that last virus thus ended a chain of transmission of history 's greatest horror
how can that not make you optimistic a disease which
killed hundreds of thousands in india and blinded half of all of those who were made blind in india ended
and most importantly for us here in this room a bond was created doctors health workers from thirty different countries of every race every religion every color
how can that not make you feel optimistic for the future thank you very much
