it is interesting that in the united states the most significant healthcare budget goes to cardiovascular disease care whether it's private
public there's no comparison at all in africa where it is a major killer it is totally ignored and that situation cannot be right
we must do something about it health status of a nation parallels development of that
is in africa eighty five percent of global disease burden for cardiovascular disease is in developing countries not in the west and yet ninety percent of the resources are in the west who is at risk
people like you it's not just the africans that should be concerned about that all friends of africa that will have reason to be in africa at some point in time should be very concerned about this deplorable situation
has anyone here wondered what will happen if you go back to your room at night and you start getting chest pains shortness of breath sweating you're having a heart attack
no you will die fifty percent will die within twenty four hours if not treated this is what's going on
in a look at the map of the us the graph here ten million people here ten million here by the time you get to fifty it's almost no one
after the time that they reach about forty five years old and fifty years old and those are the times they're most productive
if you cannot secure the parents you cannot grant the security of the african child
what are the risk factors it's very well known i'm not going to spend a lot of time on those these are just for information hypertension diabetes obesity
lack of exercise the usual suspects right here in tanzania thirty percent of individuals have hypertension
we cannot make the mistakes we've made with malaria and hiv in eight short years non communicable diseases will become the leading causes of death in africa
that is something to keep in mind we can't deal with it with situations like this this is a typical african hospital we can't depend on the elites they go
usa germany uk for treatment
you can't depend on foreign aid alone here is the situation countries are turning inwards post nine eleven united states has had a lot of trouble to deal with their own internal issues so
to fix those problems you can't rightly it's not their responsibility it is my responsibility i have to take care of my own problems if they help that's good but that is not my expectation
these worsening indices of healthcare or health studies in africa demand a new look we cannot keep on doing things the way we've always done them
if they have not worked we have to look for alternative solutions i'm here to talk to you about solutions this has been what has been a
to developing countries talk about sustainable investment no one
you can't raise money i have done businesses in healthcare in the united states i live in nashville tennessee healthcare capital of
very easy to raise money for healthcare ventures but start telling them you know we're going to try to do it in nigeria everyone runs away
is totally wrong those of you in the audience here if you want to help africa invest money in sustainable development
let me lead you through a day in the life of the heart institute so you get a glimpse of what we do and i'll talk a little bit more about it
can be done in a developing country environment we have twenty five positions right now all of them trained board certified in the us canada or britain
we have a policy that no one is ever turned away because of ability to pay we take care of
everyone whether you have one
and i will tell you how we're able to do it
we make sure that we select our equipment properly we go for modular units units that have multi modality functions have modular components easy to repair and because of that we do not
take things that are not durable and cannot last we emphasize training and we make sure that this process is regenerative very soon we will all be dead and gone but the problems will stay unless we have people taking over from where we stopped
we made sure that we produced some things ourselves we do not buy unit doses of radiopharmaceuticals we get the generators from the companies we manufacture them in house ourselves
that keeps the costs down so for a radiopharmaceutical in the us that you'll get a unit dose for two hundred and fifty dollars when we're finished manufacturing it in house we come at a price of about two
we recognize that the only way to bridge the gap between the rich and poor countries is through education and technology all these problems we're talking about if we bring development they will all disappear
the rural centers and we can use expertise in a very smart way this is the way our centers are set up
we currently have three locations in the caribbean and we're planning a fourth one and we have now decided to go into africa we will be doing
the west african heart institute in port harcourt nigeria that project will be starting within the next few months we hope to open in two thousand and eight nine and we will do
this model can be adapted to every disease process all the units all the centers are linked through
central server and all the images are populated to review stations and we designed this telemedicine solution
to us and we are happy to share what we have learned with anyone who is interested in doing it you can still be profitable
to see how this happens this is at the heart institute
the doctors from anywhere can log in i can call you in switzerland and say listen go into our system look at misters jones look at the study tell me what you think they'll give me that information and we'll make the care of the
better the patient doesn't have to travel he doesn't have to experience the anxiety of not knowing because of limited expertise
we also use electronic medical record system i'm happy to say that the things we have implemented eighty percent of us practices do not have them
and yet the technology is there but you know they have that luxury because if you can't get it in nashville you can travel to birmingham two hours away and you'll get it
if you can't get it in cleveland you can go to cincinnati we don't have that luxury so we have to make it happen
when we do it we will put the cost of care down and we'll extend it to the rural centers and make it affordable and everyone will get the care they deserve
it cannot just be technology we recognize that prevention must be part of the solution we emphasize that but you know you have to tell people what can be done
it's not possible to tell people to do what is going to be expensive and they go home and can't do it they need to be alive they need to feed
we recommend exercise as the most effective simple easy thing to do we have had walks
every year every march april we form people into groups and make them go into challenges
which group loses the most weight we give them prizes which groups record more walking distance by pedometer we give them prizes
we do this constantly we encourage them to bring children that way we start exposing the children from very early on on what these issues are because once they learn it they will stay with it
in doing this we have created at least one hundred skilled jobs in jamaica alone and these are physicians with expertise and special training we have taken care of over one thousand indigent patients that could have died
if you don't get this pacemaker you will be dead so we are pleased with that indirectly we have saved the government of jamaica
five million dollars from people that would have gone to miami or atlanta for care and we've hopefully saved a lot of lives
eighty five thousand dollars a month the government will not do that because they have competing needs they need to put resources elsewhere but we can still do it
because people say how can you do that this is how we can do that at least four thousand rich jamaicans that were heading to miami for treatment have self confessed
that they did not go to miami because of the heart institute of the caribbean and if they went to miami they will spend significantly more
to ten times more and they feel happy spending it at home getting the same quality of care and for that
for every one patient that has the money to pay it gives us an opportunity to take care of at least four people that do not have the resources to
this to work this progress must be sustainable so we emphasize training training is critical we have gone further we have formed a relationship
healthcare technology training programs training people in echocardiography cardiac ultrasound those kind of things
kind of stuff in the process i want you to just hear from the trainees themselves what it has meant for them
jason topping i'm a senior resident in anesthesia in intensive care at the university hospital of the west indies
i came to the heart institute in two thousand and six as part of my elective in my anesthesia and intensive care program
i spent three months at the heart institute there's been no doubt around my colleagues about the utility of the training i received here
i am an echocardiographer at the heart institute of the caribbean since the past
aspect of training in cardiology that the heart institute of the caribbean has introduced in jamaica very important
in terms of diagnosing cardiac diseases
the lesson in this is that it can be done and it can be sustained and you can make it possible for everyone who are we to decide that poor people cannot get the best care
when have you been appointed to play god it is not my decision my job is to make sure that every person
no matter what fate has assigned to you will have the opportunity to get the best quality healthcare in life
if we do this we can change the face of healthcare in africa africa has been good to us it is time for us to give back to africa i am going those who want to come i welcome you to come along with me thank you
