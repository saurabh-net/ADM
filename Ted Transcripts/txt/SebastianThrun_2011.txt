i loved cars when i turned eighteen i lost my best friend to a car accident
to saving one million people
every year now i haven 't succeeded so this is just a progress report but i 'm here to tell you a little bit about self driving cars
i saw the concept first in the darpa grand challenges where the u s government issued a prize to build a self driving car that could navigate a desert and even though a hundred teams were there these cars went nowhere
so we decided at stanford to build a different self driving car we built the hardware and the software
we made it learn from us
and we set it free in the desert
and the unimaginable happened it became the first car two million dollars
on building driving cars that can drive anywhere by themselves any street in california we 've driven one hundred and forty thousand miles
it 's the perfect driving mechanism
we 've driven in cities like in san francisco here we 've driven from san francisco to los angeles on highway one we 've encountered joggers busy highways toll booths
and this is without a person in the loop the car just drives itself in fact while we drove one hundred and forty thousand miles
people didn 't even notice
mountain roads day and night
and even crooked lombard street in san francisco
but i can do something for all the people who died do you know that driving accidents are the number one cause of death for young people
and do you realize that almost all of those are due to human error
and not machine error and can therefore be prevented by machines
do you realize that you ted users spend an average of fifty two minutes per day in traffic wasting your time on your daily commute
you could regain this time this is four billion hours wasted in this country alone
