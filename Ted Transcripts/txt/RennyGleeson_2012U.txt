it 's annoying when you hit this thing
you sort of get down there to the bottom and things get really dicey
but these things are everywhere they 're on sites big they 're on sites small this is a global experience what a four hundred and four page tells you is that you fell through the cracks
where this comes into play and why this is important is i head up a technology incubator and we had eight startups sitting around there and those startups are focused on what they are not what they 're not until one day athletepath which is a website that focuses on services for extreme athletes found this video
and what they learned was that those little things done right actually matter and that well designed moments can build brands
so you take a look out in the real world and the fun thing is you can actually hack these yourself you can type in an url and put in a four hundred and four and these will pop
this is one that commiserates with you this is one that blames you this is one that i loved this is an error page but what if this error page was also an opportunity so it was a moment in time where all of these startups had to sit and think
and got really excited about what they could be because back to the whole relationship issue what they figured out through this exercise was that a simple mistake can tell me what you 're not
