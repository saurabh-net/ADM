the fragrance that you will
smell you will never be able to smell this way again it a s a fragrance called beyond paradise which you can find in any store
i'm most grateful to them for this and it a s been split up in successive bits and a chord so what you a re smelling now is the top note and then will come what they call the heart the lush heart note
the eden top note is named after the eden project in the u k the lush heart note melaleuca bark note which does not contain any melaleuca bark because it a s totally forbidden
after that the complete fragrance now what you are smelling is
a combination of i asked how many molecules there were in there and nobody would tell me so i put it through a gc a gas chromatograph that i have in my office and it a s about four hundred
so what you a re smelling is several hundred molecules
do not get the impression that this is very subjective you are all smelling pretty much the same thing ok smell has this reputation of being
while the smell wafts over you let me tell you the history of an idea
is made up of atoms that come from what i call the upper east side of the periodic table a nice safe neighborhood you
want to leave it if you want to have a career in perfumery some people have tried in the nineteen twenties to add things from
bad parts and it didn a t really work these are the five atoms from which just about everything that you a re going to smell in real life from coffee to fragrance are made of
the top note that you smelled at the very beginning the cut grass green what we call in perfumery they a re weird terms and this would be called a green note because it smells of something green like cut grass this is cis three hexanol and
i had to learn chemistry on the fly in the last three years a very expensive high school chemistry education
this has six carbon atoms so hexa hexanol it has one double bond it has an alcohol on the end so
if you dress it up with atoms hydrogen atoms that a s what it looks like when you have it on your computer but actually it a s sort of more like this in the sense that the atoms have
a certain sphere that you cannot penetrate they repel ok now why does this thing smell
or violets well there are really two theories but the first theory is it must be the shape
you know the fit between a protein and whatever it is grabbing in this case a smell
and i will try and explain to you what a s wrong with this notion and the other theory is that we smell molecular vibrations now this is a totally insane idea and when i first came across it
in the early nineties i thought my predecessor malcolm dyson and bob wright had really taken leave of their senses and i a ll explain to you why this was the case
in normal receptors you have a molecule coming in it gets into the protein which is schematic here and it causes this thing to switch to turn to move in some way by binding
in certain parts and the attraction the forces between the molecule and the protein cause the motion this is a shape based idea now
wrong with shape is summarized in this slide the way
i expect everybody to memorize these compounds this is one page of work from a chemist a s workbook ok
two hundred thousand dollars roughly if you keep them on the low salaries with no benefits so this is a profoundly inefficient process
and my definition of a theory is it a s not just something that you teach people it a s labor saving a theory is something that enables you to do less work i love the idea of doing less work so
let me explain to you why a very simple fact that tells you why this shape theory really does not work very well
this is cis three hexanol it smells of cut grass this is
and this smells of rotten eggs ok now you will have noticed that vodka never smells of rotten eggs if it does you put the glass down you go to a different bar this is
in other words we never get the o h we never mistake it for an s h ok like
at no concentration even pure you know if you smelt pure ethanol it doesn a t smell of rotten eggs conversely there is no concentration at which the sulphur compound will smell like vodka
very hard to explain this by molecular recognition now i showed this to a physicist friend of mine who has a profound distaste for biology and he says that a s easy the things are a different color
of the o h stretch translated into the audible range
quite a different frequency now this kind of interesting because it tells you that you should be looking for a particular fact which is this nothing in the world smells like rotten eggs except s h ok now fact b
nothing in the world has that frequency except s h if you look on this imagine a piano keyboard the s h stretch
is in the middle of a part of the keyboard that has been so to speak damaged and there are no neighboring notes nothing is close to it you have a unique smell a unique vibration so now
searching high and low for several months i discovered that there was a type of molecule called a borane which has exactly the same vibration now the good news is so
this was not what they call a laboratory scale experiment and they wouldn a t have liked it at my college however i managed to hold of a borane eventually and
and it really does have the same if you calculate if you measure the vibrational frequencies they are the same as s h now
does it smell of sulphur well if you go back in the literature there a s a man who knew more about boranes than anyone
alive then or since alfred stock he synthesized all of them and in an enormous forty page paper in german
he says at one point my wife is german and she translated it for me and at one point he says ganz widerlich geruch an absolutely repulsive smell which is good
slight fly in the ointment is this that if we smell molecular vibrations we must have a spectroscope in our nose
now this is a spectroscope ok on my laboratory bench and it a s fair to say that if you look up somebody a s nose you a re unlikely to see anything resembling this and this is the main objection to the theory ok great we smell vibrations how
when people ask this kind of question they neglect something which is that physicists are really clever unlike biologists
this is a joke i a m a biologist ok so it a s a joke against myself bob jacklovich and john lamb at ford motor company in the days when ford was spending vast amounts of money on fundamental research discovered
a way to build a spectroscope that was intrinsically nanoscale in other words no mirrors no lasers no prisms no nonsense just a tiny device and he built this device and this device uses electron tunnelling
now i could do the dance of electron tunneling but i a ve done a video instead which is much more interesting here a s how it works electrons are fuzzy creatures and they can jump across gaps
but only at equal energy if the energy differs they can a t jump unlike us they won a t fall off
now if something absorbs the energy the electron can travel so here you have a system you have something and there a s plenty of that stuff in biology some substance giving an electron
and the electron tries to jump and only when a molecule comes along that has the right vibration does the reaction happen ok this is the basis for the device
that these two guys at ford built and every single part of this mechanism is actually plausible in biology
in other words i a ve taken off the shelf components and i a ve made a spectroscope what a s nice about this idea if you have a philosophical bent of mind is that then it tells you that the nose
the ear and the eye are all vibrational senses of course it doesn a t matter because it could also be that they a re not but it has a certain
it has a certain ring to it which is attractive to people who read too much nineteenth century german literature
and then a magnificent thing happened i left academia and joined the real world of business and
the first things that happened was we started going around to fragrance companies asking for what they needed because of course if you could calculate smell
you don a t need chemists you need a computer a mac will do it if you know how to program the thing right ok so you can try a thousand molecules you can try ten thousand molecules in a weekend
you cannot make a coumarin he says to me i bet you cannot make a coumarin now coumarin is a very common
a material in fragrance which is derived from a bean that comes from south america and it is the classic synthetic aroma chemical
the problem is it a s a carcinogen so nobody likes particularly to you know aftershave with carcinogens
there are some reckless people but it a s not worth it ok so they asked us to make a new coumarin and so we started doing calculations and the first thing you do is you calculate
the vibrational spectrum of coumarin and you smooth it out so that you have a nice picture of what this sort of chord so to speak of coumarin is
and then you start cranking the computer to find other molecules related or unrelated that have the same vibrations
we actually in this case i a m sorry to say
it happened it was serendipitous because i got a phone call from our chief chemist and he said look i a ve just found this such a beautiful reaction that even if this compound doesn a t smell of coumarin i want to do it it a s just such a nifty
one step i mean chemists have weird minds one step ninety percent yield you know and you get this lovely crystalline compound let us try it and i said first of all let me do the calculation
on that compound bottom right which is related to coumarin but has an extra pentagon inserted into the molecule
a little ten gram vial on the table in front of perfumers and it smells like coumarin and it isn a t coumarin and you a ve found it in three weeks this focuses everybody a s mind wonderfully
people often ask me is your theory accepted and i said well by whom i mean most you know there a s three attitudes you a re right and i don a t know why which is the most rational one at this point
right and i don a t care how you do it in a sense you bring me the molecules you know and you a re completely wrong and i a m sure you a re completely wrong
ok now we a re dealing with people who only want results and this is the commercial world and they tell us that even if we do it by astrology they a re happy
not actually doing it by astrology but for the last three years i a ve had what i consider to be the best job in the entire universe which is to put my
hobby which is you know fragrance and all the magnificent things plus a little bit of biophysics a small amount of self taught chemistry at the service of something that actually works thank you very much
