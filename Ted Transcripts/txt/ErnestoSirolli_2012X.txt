my life has been shaped
by seven years of work as a young man in africa from one thousand nine hundred and seventy one to one thousand nine hundred and seventy seven i look young but i 'm not and i
and i instead
instead and of course
and of course you never asked
the book was published in two thousand and nine we western donor countries have given the african continent two trillion american dollars in the last fifty years
i 'm not going to tell you the damage that that money has done just go and read her book read it from an african woman the damage that we have done we western people
or we are paternalistic the two words come from the latin root pater which means father but they mean two different things
i was given a slap in the face reading
above all in economic development
this should be the first principle of aid the first principle of aid is respect this morning the gentleman who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor and said can we can you imagine a city that is not neocolonial
when i was twenty seven years old
to only respond to people
and i invented a system called enterprise facilitation where you never initiate anything you never motivate anybody but you become a servant of the local passion the servant of local people who have a dream to become a better person
so what you do you shut up you never arrive in a community with any ideas and you sit
with the local people we don 't work from offices we meet at the cafe we meet at the pub we have zero infrastructure and what we do
we become friends and we find out what that person wants to do the most important thing is passion you can give somebody an idea if that person doesn 't want to do it what are you going to do
the person with the idea may not have the knowledge but the knowledge is available so years and years ago
i had this idea why don 't we for once instead of arriving in the community to tell people what to do
why don 't for once listen to them but not in community meetings let me
with community meetings entrepreneurs never come
and they never tell you in a public meeting what they want to do with their own money
what we do we work one on one
and to work one on one you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn 't exist you have to create a new profession
the profession is the family doctor of enterprise the family doctor of business who sits with you in your house at your kitchen table at the cafe and helps you find the resources to transform your passion into a way to make a living
i started this as a tryout in esperance in western australia i was a doing a ph d at the time trying to go away from this patronizing bullshit that we arrive and tell you what to do
and so what i did in esperance that first year was to just walk the streets and in three days i had my first client and i helped this first guy who was smoking fish from a garage was a maori guy
and i helped him to sell to the restaurant in perth to get organized and then the fishermen came to me to say you the guy who helped maori
can you help us and i helped these five fishermen to work together and get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in albany for sixty cents a kilo but we found a way
to take the fish for sushi to japan
for fifteen dollars a kilo and the farmers came to talk to me said hey you helped them can you help us in a year i had twenty seven projects going on and the government came to see me to say
one of the greatest management consultants planning is actually incompatible
how to get these people to come and talk to you you have to offer them
confidentiality privacy you have to be fantastic at helping them
and then they will come and they will come in droves in a community of ten thousand people we get two hundred clients can you imagine a community of four hundred thousand people the intelligence and the passion which presentation have you applauded the most this morning local passionate people
cure educate transport communicate for seven billion people in a sustainable way the technologies do not exist to do that who government forget about it
there 's a lovely story that i read in a futurist magazine many many years ago there was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of the city of new york in one thousand eight hundred and sixty
and in one thousand eight hundred and sixty this group of people came together and they all speculated about what would happen to the city of new york in one hundred years and the conclusion was unanimous the city of new york would not exist in one hundred years why because they looked at the curve and said if the population keeps growing at this rate
so what happens in forty years time in the year one thousand nine hundred in the united states of america there were one
thousand and one car manufacturing companies one thousand and one
the idea of finding a different technology had absolutely taken over and there were tiny tiny little factories in backwaters dearborn michigan henry ford
however there is a secret
to work with entrepreneurs first you have to offer them confidentiality otherwise they don 't come and talk to you
then you have to offer them absolute dedicated passionate service to them and then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship
the smallest company the biggest company has to be capable of doing three things beautifully
the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic you have to have fantastic marketing and you have to have tremendous financial management guess what
we have never met a single human being in the world who can make it sell it and look after the money
edison ford all the new companies google yahoo there 's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common only one none
only one none now we teach entrepreneurship
to sixteen year olds in northumberland
never the word i and the word we thirty two times he wasn 't alone when he started nobody started a company alone no one
so we can create the community
where we have facilitators who come from a small business background sitting in cafes in bars and your dedicated buddies
who will do to you what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this epic somebody who will say to you what do you need what can you do can you make it okay can you sell it can you look after the money oh no i cannot do this would you like me to find you somebody
we activate communities we have groups of volunteers supporting the enterprise facilitator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered
