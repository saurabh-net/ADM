and i was scared laughter really scared scared of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big unfamiliar words but as these conversations unfolded i experienced what alice must have when she went down that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world
that 's just how i felt as i had those conversations with the students i was amazed at the ideas that they had and i wanted others to experience this wonderland as well and i believe the key to opening that door is great communication
we desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grandest challenges from energy to environment to health care among others
and if we don 't know about it and understand it then the work isn 't done and i believe it 's our responsibility as non scientists to have these interactions
but these great conversations can 't occur if our scientists and engineers don 't invite us in to see their wonderland so scientists and engineers please talk nerdy to us
i want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy
and that your engineering is engaging
first question to answer for us so what tell us why your science is relevant to us don 't just tell me that you study trabeculae but tell me that you study trabeculae which is the mesh like structure of our bones because it 's important to understanding and treating osteoporosis
and when you 're describing your science
instead as einstein said make everything as simple as possible but no simpler you can clearly communicate your science without compromising the ideas
a few things to consider are having examples stories and analogies those are ways to engage and excite us about your content and when presenting your work
drop the bullet points have you ever wondered why they 're called bullet points laughter what do bullets do bullets kill and they will kill your presentation
a slide like this is not only boring but it relies too much on the language area of our brain and causes us to become overwhelmed
instead this example slide by genevieve brown is much more effective it 's showing that the special structure of trabeculae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the eiffel tower
and the trick here is to use a single readable sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what 's being described
so i think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland that is science and engineering and because the engineers that i 've worked with have taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd i want to summarize with an equation laughter take your science
subtract your bullet points and your jargon
divide by relevance meaning share what 's relevant to the audience
