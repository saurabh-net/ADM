i moved to america twelve years ago with my wife terry and our two kids actually truthfully we moved to los angeles
it 's a short plane ride from
americans don 't get irony
have you come across this idea
it 's not true i 've traveled the whole length and breadth of this country i have found no evidence that americans don 't get irony
it 's one of those cultural myths
like the british are reserved
i don 't know why people think this
but i knew that americans get irony when i came across that legislation no child left behind
because whoever thought of that title gets irony
it 's leaving millions of children behind now i can see that 's not a very attractive name for legislation
millions of children left behind i can see
in some parts of the country sixty percent of kids drop out of high school
in the native american communities it 's eighty percent
one estimate is it would
create a net gain to the u s economy over ten years
of nearly a trillion dollars
from an economic point of view this is good math isn 't
that we should do this it actually costs an enormous amount to mop up the damage from
the dropout crisis but the dropout crisis is just the tip of an iceberg what it doesn 't count are all the kids who are in school
but being disengaged from it
who don 't enjoy it who don 't get any real benefit from it and the reason is not that we 're not spending enough money america spends more money on education than most other countries
class sizes are smaller than in many countries
and there are hundreds of initiatives every year to try and improve education the trouble is
it 's all going in the wrong direction
there are three principles on which human life flourishes and they are contradicted
by the culture of education under which most teachers
have to labor and most students have to endure
the first is this that human beings are naturally different and diverse
i bet you they are completely different from each other
you would never confuse them would you
is based on not diversity
one of the effects of no child left behind
has been to narrow the focus onto the so called stem disciplines they 're very important
i 'm not here to argue against science and math on the contrary
a real education has to give equal weight to the arts the humanities to physical education an awful lot of kids
estimate in america currently is that something like ten percent of kids getting on that way are being diagnosed with various conditions under the broad title of attention deficit disorder
i just don 't believe it 's an epidemic
like this if you sit kids down hour after hour doing low grade clerical work
don 't be surprised if they start to fidget
children are not for the most part suffering from a psychological condition they 're suffering from childhood
they will learn without any further assistance very often children are natural learners it 's a real achievement to put that particular ability out or to stifle it
curiosity is the engine of achievement now the reason i say this is because one of the effects of the current culture here if i can say so has been to de professionalize teachers
there is no system in the world
teachers are the lifeblood of the success of schools but teaching is a creative profession
teaching properly conceived is not a delivery system
you know you 're not there just to pass on received information great teachers do that
but what great teachers also do is mentor stimulate provoke engage you see in the end education is about learning
but a wonderful guy he was wonderful
you know you can be engaged in the activity of something but not really be achieving it like
but if nobody 's learning anything
she may be engaged in the task of teaching but not actually
learning that 's it and part of the problem is i think that the dominant culture of education has come to focus on not teaching and learning but testing
now testing is important standardized tests have a place
but they should not be the dominant culture of education they should be diagnostic
if i go for a medical examination
i want some standardized tests i do
you know i want to know what my cholesterol level is compared to everybody else 's
on a standard scale i don 't want to be told on some scale my doctor invented in the
your cholesterol is what i call level orange
but all that should support
which of course it often does so in place of curiosity what we have is a culture of compliance
it 's why we all have different resumes
we create our lives and we can recreate them as we go through them it 's the common currency of being a human being it 's why human culture is so interesting and diverse and dynamic i mean other animals may well have imaginations and creativity but it 's not so much in evidence is it as ours i mean you may have a dog
sit staring out the window with a bottle of jack daniels
now it doesn 't have to be that way it really doesn 't
the thing about work in finland is this
they don 't obsess about those disciplines they have a very broad approach to education which includes humanities physical education the arts
but you can compare it to a state in america
many states in america have fewer people in them than that
but what all the high performing systems in the world do
is currently what is not evident
sadly across the systems in america
they individualize teaching and learning they recognize that it 's students who are learning
and the system has to engage them their curiosity their individuality and their creativity that 's how you get them to learn
the second is that they attribute a very high status to the teaching
to the school level for getting the job done
you see there 's a big difference here
between going into a mode of command and control in education that 's what happens in some systems you know central governments decide or state governments decide they know best and they 're going to tell you what to do the trouble is that
education doesn 't go on in the committee rooms of our legislative buildings it happens in classrooms and schools and the people who do it are the teachers and the students and if you remove their discretion it stops working
but i have to say it 's happening in spite of the dominant culture of education not because of it it 's like people are sailing into a headwind all the time
of education it 's like
education is an industrial process
that can be improved just by having better data and somewhere in i think the back of the mind of some policy makers is this idea that if we fine tune it well enough if we just get it right it will all hum along perfectly into the future
it won 't and it never did
the point is that education
is not a mechanical system it 's a human system
i was at a meeting recently in los angeles of they 're called alternative education programs these are programs designed to get kids back into education
they have certain common features they 're very personalized
they have strong support for the teachers
close links with the community and a broad and diverse curriculum and often programs which involve students outside school as well as inside school
so i think we have to embrace a different metaphor we have to recognize that it 's a human system and there are conditions under which people thrive
and conditions under which they don 't we are after all organic creatures
not far from where i live is a place called death valley
driest place in america and nothing grows there
nothing grows there because it doesn 't rain was carpeted in flowers
waiting for the right conditions to come about
and with organic systems if the conditions are right
and schools that were once bereft spring to life great leaders know that
the real role of leadership in education and i think it 's true at the national level the state level at the school level
the real role of leadership is climate control
creating a climate of possibility
and if you do that people will rise to it and achieve things that you completely did not anticipate and couldn 't have expected
there 's a wonderful quote from benjamin franklin there are three sorts of people in the world those who are immovable
people who don 't get they don 't want to get it they 're going to do anything about it there are people who are movable
and if the movement is strong enough
that 's in the best sense of the word a revolution
