the human voice mysterious spontaneous primal for me the human voice is the vessel on which all emotions travel except perhaps jealousy
and the breath the breath is the captain of that vessel
a child is born takes its first breath
and we behold the wondrous beauty of vocal expression mysterious spontaneous and primal
a few years ago i did a meditation retreat in thailand i wanted a place that i would have total silence and total solitude i spent two weeks at this retreat in my own little hut no music no nothing sounds of nature
trying to find the essence of concentration being in the moment on my last day the woman who looked after the place she came and we spoke for a minute and then she said to me
would you sing something for me and i thought but this is a place of total quiet and silence i can 't make noise
she said please sing for me so i closed my eyes i took breath
and the first thing that came up and out was summertime porgy and bess
the calm but alertness the focus but awareness and being totally in the moment
when you 're totally in the moment when i 'm totally in the moment the vessel of expression is open the emotions can flow from me to you and back extremely profound experience
and the thing about this piece that 's so special if you see it behind me it 's not notated in any way
no notes no flats no sharps but it 's a kind of structure and the singer
within this structure has total freedom to be creative spontaneous for example
there are different colors and each color gets a different type of singing pop country and western opera jazz and you just have to be consistent with that color
you see there are different lines you choose in your own tempo in your own way to follow the line but you must respect it
more or less and these little dots these represent a sort of sound that 's not a
vocal not a lyrical way of expressing the voice using the body it could be sneezing it could be coughing it could be animals
there 's armenian russian french english italian so within this structure one is free to me this piece is an ode to the voice because it 's mysterious as we can see
it 's quite spontaneous and it 's primal so i would like to share this piece with you it 's aria of john cage no
no the
