top left bottom right are the sex chromosomes women have two copies of that big x chromosome men have the x and of course that small copy of the y sorry boys but it 's just a tiny little thing that makes you different so if you zoom in on this genome
then what you see of course is this double helix structure the code of life spelled out with these four biochemical letters or we call them bases right a c g and t how many are there in the human genome three billion is that a big number
well everybody can throw around big numbers but in fact if i were to place one base on each pixel of this one thousand two hundred and eighty by eight hundred resolution screen
we would need three thousand screens to take a look at the genome so it 's really quite big and perhaps because of its size
that the world has completely changed and none of you know about it so
now what we do is we take a genome we make maybe fifty copies of it we cut all those copies up into little fifty base reads and then we sequence them massively parallel and then we bring that into software and we reassemble it and we tell you what the story is and so just to give you a picture of what this looks like the human genome project three gigabases right
one run on one of these machines two hundred gigabases
in a week and that two hundred is going to change to six hundred this summer and there 's no sign of this pace slowing
so the price of a base to sequence a base has fallen one hundred million times that 's the equivalent of you filling up your car with gas in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight waiting until two thousand and eleven and now you can drive to jupiter and back twice
and here 's all the new stuff guys this is a log scale you don 't typically see lines that go up like that
so the worldwide capacity to sequence human genomes is something like fifty thousand to one hundred thousand human genomes this year and we know this based on the machines that are being placed this is expected to double triple or maybe quadruple year over year for the foreseeable future
in fact there 's one lab in particular that represents twenty percent of all that capacity it 's called the beijing genomics institute
the chinese are absolutely winning this race to the new moon by the way what does this mean for medicine
so a woman is age thirty seven she presents with stage two estrogen receptor positive breast cancer she is treated with surgery chemotherapy and radiation she goes home two years later she comes back with stage three c ovarian cancer unfortunately treated again with surgery and chemotherapy
she comes back with acute myeloid leukemia
she goes into respiratory failure and dies eight days later so first the way in which this woman was treated in as little as ten years will look like bloodletting
and it 's because of people like my colleague rick wilson at the genome institute at washington university who decided to take a look at this woman postmortem and he sequenced he took skin cells healthy skin
in a particular gene called tp fifty three if you have this deleterious mutation in this gene you 're ninety percent likely to get cancer in your life
so unfortunately this doesn 't help this woman but it does have severe profound if you will implications to her family i mean if they have the same mutation and they get this genetic test and they understand it then they can go and get regular screens and they can catch cancer early and potentially live a significantly longer life
let me introduce you now to the beery twins diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of two their mom is a very brave woman who didn 't believe that the symptoms weren 't matching up and through some heroic efforts and a lot of internet searching she was able to
convince the medical community that in fact they had something else
what they had was dopa responsive dystonia and so they were given l dopa and their symptoms did improve but they weren 't totally asymptomatic significant problems remained turns out the gentleman in this picture is a guy named joe beery who was lucky enough to be the cio of a company called life technologies
they 're one of the two companies that makes these massive whole genome sequencing tools and so what he did was he got his kids sequenced and what they found was a series of mutations in a gene called spr which is responsible for producing serotonin among other things
so on top of l dopa they gave these kids a serotonin precursor drug and they 're effectively normal now guys this would never have happened without whole genome sequencing and at the time this was a few years ago it cost dollar one hundred thousand today it 's dollar ten thousand next year it 's dollar one thousand the year after it 's dollar one hundred give or take a year that 's how fast this is moving so here 's little nick
likes batman and squirt guns and it turns out nick shows up at the children 's hospital with this distended belly like a famine victim and it 's not that he 's not eating it 's that when he eats his intestine basically opens up and feces spill out into his gut so a hundred surgeries later he looks at his mom and says mom
please pray for me i 'm in so much pain
his pediatrician happens to have a background in clinical genetics and he has no idea what 's going on but he says let 's get this kid 's genome sequenced and what they find is a single point mutation in a gene responsible for controlling programmed cell death
so the theory is that he 's having some immunological reaction to what 's going on to the food essentially and that 's a natural reaction which causes some programmed cell death but the gene that regulates that down is broken
and so this informs among other things of course a treatment for bone marrow transplant which he undertakes and after nine months of grueling recovery he 's now eating steak with a one sauce
today it 's here and what it means for all of us is that everybody in this room could live an extra five ten twenty years just because of this one thing which is a fantastic story unless you think about humanity 's footprint on the planet and our ability to keep up food production so it turns out that the very same technology is also being used
to grow new lines of corn wheat soybean and other crops that are highly tolerant of drought of flood of pests and pesticides now look none not one
this is a typewriter a staple of every desktop for decades and in fact the typewriter was essentially deleted by this thing and then more general versions of word processors came about
but ultimately it was a disruption on top of a disruption it was bob metcalfe inventing the ethernet and the connection of all these computers that fundamentally changed everything and suddenly we had netscape and we had yahoo and we had indeed the entire dotcom bubble
revolution today this is where we are so what i 'd like you to consider is what does it mean when these dots don 't represent the individual bases of your genome but they connect to genomes all across the planet
so i just recently had to buy life insurance and i was required to answer a i have never had a genetic test b i 've had one here you go and c i 've had one and i 'm not telling thankfully i was able to answer a and i say that honestly in case my life insurance agent is listening but what would have happened if i had said c
consumer applications for genomics they will flourish do you want to see whether you 're genetically compatible with your girlfriend sure dna sequencing on your iphone there 's an app for that
there 's already a lab today that tests
and a third cousin 's genome was also sitting there and there was software that could compare these two and make these associations not hard to imagine my company has software that does this right now
now this is probably a good thing right you have bigger clan gatherings and so on but maybe it 's a bad thing as well how many fathers in the room raise your hands
okay so experts think that one to three percent of you are not actually the father of your child
or not and so i urge you all to wake up and to tune in and to influence the genomic revolution that 's happening all around you thank you
