thank you for being here and i say thank you for being here because
i was silent for seventeen years and the first words that i spoke were in washington dc on the twentieth anniversary of earth day and my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak
thank you for being here
my mother out in the audience
was out in the audience say my dad said to me that a s one
i turned around because i didn a t recognize where my voice was coming from
heard my voice in seventeen years so i turned around and i looked and i said god who 's saying what i a m thinking
and then i realized it was me you know and i kind of laughed and i could see my father yeah he really is crazy
well i want to take you on this journey and the journey i believe is a metaphor for all of our journeys and so even though this one is kind of unusual i want you to think about
collide beneath the golden gate and
a half a million gallons of oil
it disturbed me so much that i decided that i was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles
and it was a big thing in my little community of point reyes station in inverness california because there was only about maybe three hundred and fifty people there in the winter a this was back in seventy one
and so when i came in and i started walking around
people they just knew what was going on and people would drive up next to me and say john what are you doing and i a d say well i a m walking for the environment
and they said no you a re walking to make us look bad right you a re walking to make us feel bad and maybe there was some truth to that because i thought that if i started walking everyone would you know follow
because of the oil everybody talked about the polllution and so
i argued with people about that i argued and i argued
do that when you were sixteen
i didn a t know about the environment then they a re back in philadelphia and so
i told my mother i a m happy though i a m really happy she said if you were happy son you wouldn a t have to say mothers
twenty seventh birthday i decided because i argued so much and i talk so much you see that i was going to stop speaking for just one day one day to give it a rest
and so i did i got up in the morning and i didn a t say a word and i have to tell you it was a very moving experience because for the first time i began listening
i began listening and what i heard
it kind of disturbed me because what i used to do when i thought i was listening was i would listen just enough to hear what people had to say and think that i could
i knew what they were going to say and so i stopped listening and in my mind i just kind of raced ahead and thought of what i was going to say back while they were still finishing up
and then i would launch in well just ended communication
so on this first day i actually listened and it was very sad for me because i realized that for those many years i had not been learning i was twenty seven i thought i knew everything
and another day and another day until finally i promised myself for a year i would keep quiet because i started learning more and more
and i needed to learn more so for a year i said i would keep quiet and then on my birthday i would reassess what i had learned and maybe i would talk again well that lasted seventeen years
played the banjo and i painted and i wrote my journal and
i tried to study the environment by reading books
i decided that i was going to go to school
so i did i walked up to ashland oregon where they were offering an environmental studies degree
an environmental studies degree only five hundred miles
i had a newspaper clipping
you really want to go to school here you
we have a special program for you they did and in those two years i graduated with my first degree a bachelor a s degree and my father came out he was so proud he said listen we a re really proud of you son
but what are you going to do with a bachelor a s degree you don a t ride in cars you don a t talk you
i hunched my shoulder i picked my backpack up again and i started walking
i walked all the way up to port townsend washington where i built a wooden boat
walked across washington idaho and down
i had written the university of montana two years earlier and said i'd like to go to school
i said i'd be there in about two years
and i was there i showed up in two years and they i tell this story because they really helped me there are two stories in montana the first story is i didn a t have any money that a s a sign i used a lot
and they said don 't worry about that the director of the program said come back tomorrow he gave me one hundred and fifty dollars and he said register for one credit you a re going to go to south america
came back he said to me he said ok john now that you've registered for that one credit you can have a key to an office you can matriculate you a re matriculating so you can use the library
and what we a re going to do is we a re going to have all of the professors allow you to go to class they a re going to save your grade
and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money
they don a t do that in graduate schools i don a t think but i use that story because they really wanted to help me
and i had thirteen students when i first walked into the class and i explained with a friend who could
i could see they were looking for the schedule to see when they could get out
they had to take that class with me two weeks later everyone was trying to get into our class and i learned in that class because i would do things like this
but what i learned was that sometimes i would make a sign and they said things that i absolutely did not mean but i should have
and so what came to me is if you were a teacher and you were teaching if you weren a t learning you probably weren a t teaching very well
i hunched my shoulder i got my backpack and i went on to the university of wisconsin
i spent two years there writing on oil spills no one was interested in oil spills
was the only one in the united states writing on oil spills
my dad came out again he said i don't know how you do this son i mean you don't ride in cars you don a t talk my sister said maybe i should leave you alone because you seem to be doing a lot better when you a re not saying anything
well i put on my backpack again i put my banjo and i walked all the way to the east coast put my foot in the atlantic ocean a it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the united states
ninety the twentieth anniversary of earth day that a s when i began to speak and that a s why i said thank you for being here because it's sort of like that tree in the forest
falling and if there's no one there to hear does it really make a sound and i a m thanking you and i'm thanking my family because they had come to hear me speak
and that a s communication and they also taught me
one of those things that came out of the silence the listening to each other
really very important we need to listen to each other
my journey kept going on
my dad said that a s one and i still didn a t let that go
i worked for the coastguard was made a u n goodwill ambassador i wrote regulations for the united states i mean i wrote
oil spill regulations i mean twenty years ago if someone had said to me john do you really want to make a difference
yeah i want to make a difference he said you just start walking east get out of your car and just start walking east and as i walked off a little bit and they'd say yeah and shut up
my time at the coast guard was a really good time and after that i only worked one year i said that 's enough
one year 's enough for me to do that i got on a sailboat and i sailed down to the caribbean and
you know i forgot the most important thing which is why i started talking which i have to tell you i started talking because i had studied environment
and the informal level i learned about
people and what we do and how we are
how we treated each other
because if we are the environment then all we need to do is look around us and see
we treat ourselves and how we treat each other
and so that a s the message that i had and i said well i'm going to have to spread that message and i got in my sailboat sailed all the way through the caribbean
it wasn't really my sailboat i kind of worked on that boat got to venezuela and i started walking
there i am walking past the guard gate and the guard stops and says
and i started walking off possessed me
the road turned into the jungle
and i got to i start saying free at last thank god almighty i a m free at last
what was that about i a m saying what was that about i took me one hundred miles to figure out in my heart in
in my heart in had become a
i was a prisoner and i needed to escape the prison that i was in
was the fact that i did not drive
or use motorized vehicles now how could that be because when i started it seemed very appropriate to me my decision to just
i had no idea i was going to become a u n ambassador i had no idea i would have a
and so i realized that i had a responsibility to more than just me
and that i was going to have to change you know we can do it
i was going to have to change and i was afraid to change because i was so used to the guy who only just walked
i was so used to that person
that i didn a t want to stop
i didn a t know who i would be
but i know i needed to i know i needed to change because it would be the only way that i could be here today
and i know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we a ve gotten to but there a s another place for us to go and we
go to the place of who we are becoming and so
i want to encourage you
to go to that next place to let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in as comfortable as it may be because
we have to do something
we have to change now
as our former vice president said
we have to become activists so
if my voice can touch you if my actions can touch you if my being here can touch you please let it be
and i know that all of you have touched me
while i a ve been here
and take this out into the world because we are the environment
and how we treat each other
is really how we a re going to treat the environment
so i want to thank you for being here
i want to end this
