now before you get up in arms
or you pick a favorite color i want to define what i mean by revolution
now why steve why do we need a revolution
we need a revolution because things aren 't working
and we are last place in so many things for example
social factors we 're last place in europe in innovation there we are right at the end right at the bottom last place as a culture that doesn 't value innovation we 're last place in health care and that 's important for a sense of well being and there we are not just last in the e u we 're last in europe at the very bottom
and worst of all it just came out three weeks ago many of you have seen it the economist we 're the saddest place on earth relative to gdp per capita
the saddest place on earth
that 's social let 's look at education where do we rank three weeks ago in another report by the oecd last in reading math and science last business
why as a result what happens the lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses
and this is despite the fact that everybody knows that small business is the engine of economies we hire the most people we create the most taxes
so if our engine 's broken guess what
last in europe gdp per capita
and these are facts guys this isn 't story tale it 's not make believe
it 's not it 's not a conspiracy i have got against bulgaria these are facts so i think it should be really really clear that our system is broken the way we think the way we behave our operating system of behaving is broken we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave to transform bulgaria for the better for ourselves for our friends
because and this is going to be drastic to some of you because we are handicapping ourselves we 're holding ourselves back because we don 't value play
i said play all right in case some of you forgot what play is this is what play looks like babies play kids play adults play we don 't value play in fact we devalue play
and we devalue it in three areas let 's go back to the same three areas social forty five years of what of communism
and instead what do we value because it 's shown the way we apply generate and use knowledge
is affected by our social and institutional context which told us what in communism to be serious to be really really serious
water that will kill them i have been told by babas and dyados that we shouldn 't let our kids play so much because life is serious and we need to train them for the seriousness of life
we have a serious meme running through it 's a social gene running through us it 's a serious gene it 's forty five years of it that 's created what i call the baba factor
and here 's how it works step one woman says i want to have a baby iskam baby step two we get the baby woohoo but then what happens in step three i want to go back to work because i need to further my career or i just want to go have coffees i 'm going to give bebko to baba
but we need to remember that baba 's been infected by the serious meme for forty five years so what happens she passes that virus on to baby and it takes a really really really long time as the redwood trees for that serious meme to get out of our operating system
play it 's a crap system
we went to this prestigious little school and they say they 're going to study math ten times a week and science eight times a week and reading five times a day and all this stuff and we said well what about play and recess and they said ha there won 't be a single moment in the schedule
to put bolts in pre drilled holes but i 'm sorry the problems of today are not the problems of the industrial revolution we need adaptability the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative
we don 't need mechanized workers but no now our meme goes into work where we don 't value play we create robotic workers that we treat like assets to lever and just throw away what are qualities of a bulgarian work autocratic
do what i say because i 'm the chef i 'm the boss and i know better than you untrusting you 're obviously a criminal so i 'm going to install cameras
that 's somehow unprofessional and bad and at the end of the day it 's unfulfilling because you 're controlled you 're restricted you 're not valued and you 're not having any fun
in social in education and in our business don 't value play and that 's why we 're last because we don 't value play
and you can say that 's ridiculous steve what a dumb idea it can 't be because of play
just play that 's a stupid thing we have the serious meme in us
well i 'm going to say no and i will prove it to you
in the next part of the speech that play is the catalyst it is the revolution that we can use to transform bulgaria for the better play our brains
are hardwired for play evolution has selected over millions and billions of years for play in animals and in humans and you know what
evolution does a really really good job of deselecting traits that aren 't advantageous to us and selecting traits for competitive advantage nature isn 't stupid and it selected for play throughout the animal kingdom for example ants
and they learn tasks better skills
kittens play we all know kittens play but what you may not know is that kittens deprived of play are unable to interact socially they can still hunt but they can 't be social bears play
but what you may not know is that bears that play more survive longer it 's not the bears that learn how to fish better it 's the ones that play more
and a final really interesting study
the more you play the bigger the brains there are
dolphins pretty big brains play a lot
but who do you think
with the biggest brains are the biggest players
yours truly humans kids play we play of every nationality of every race of every color of every religion it 's a universal thing we play
and it 's not just kids it 's adults too really cool term neoteny the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults and who are the biggest neotenists humans we play sports we do it for fun or as olympians or as professionals we play musical instruments we dance we kiss we sing we just goof around
we 're designed by nature to play from birth to old age we 're designed to do that
continuously to play and play a lot and not stop playing it is a huge benefit
just like there 's benefits to animals there 's benefits to humans
for example it 's been shown
to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala in the area where it controls emotions it 's been shown to promote pre frontal cortex development where a lot of cognition is happening as a result what happens we develop more emotional maturity if we play more
we develop better decision making ability if we play more
little exercise just for a second close your eyes
and try to imagine a world without play
what does this world look like
is it fun is it playful or maybe the workplace of your friends here we 're forward thinking is it fun is it playful
or is it crap is it autocratic controlling restrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling
we have this concept that the opposite of play is work
we even feel guilty if we 're seen playing at work oh my colleagues see me laughing i must not have enough work or oh i 've got to hide because my boss might see me
but i have news for you our thinking is backwards the opposite of play is not work the opposite of play is depression
it increases our openness to change it improves our ability to learn it provides a sense of purpose and mastery two key motivational things that increase productivity
you know the professional athlete that loves skiing he 's serious about it but he loves it he 's having fun he 's in the groove he 's in the flow
our thinking is backwards we shouldn 't be feeling guilty we should be celebrating play
quick example from the corporate world fedex easy motto people service profit if you treat your people like people if you treat them great they 're happier they 're fulfilled they have a sense of mastery and purpose what happens they give better service
not worse but better and when customers call for service and they 're dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled how do the customers feel they feel great
people service profit play increases productivity not decreases and you 're going to say
gee that can work for fedex out there in the united states but it can 't work in bulgaria
it does work in bulgaria you guys two reasons one play is universal there 's nothing weird about bulgarians that we can 't play besides the serious meme that we have to kick out two i 've tried it i 've tried at sciant when i got there we had zero happy customers not one customer would refer us
through some basic change change like improving transparency
change like promoting self direction and collaboration encouraging collaboration not autocracy the things like having a results focus i don 't care when you get in in the morning i don 't care when you leave i care that your customer and your team is happy and you 're organized with that why do i care if you get in at nine o 'clock
basically promoting fun through promoting fun and a great environment we were able to transform sciant and in just three short years sounds like a long time but change is slow every customer from zero to every customer referring us
above average profits for the industry and happy stakeholders
it does and it can work in bulgaria there 's nothing holding us back except our own mentality about play
so some steps that we can take to finish up
how to make this revolution through play first of all you have to believe me
if you don 't believe me well just go home and think about it some more or something second of all if you don 't have the feeling of play in you you need to rediscover play whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy that you enjoyed only six months ago but now that you 've got that promotion you can 't enjoy because you feel like you have to be serious rediscover it
i 'm going to encourage constructive criticism
i 'm going to let you challenge authority because it 's by challenging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the rut that we 're in and create innovative solutions to problems of today
we 're not always right as leaders we 're going to eradicate fear fear is the enemy of play
you know what let them use their mobile phone for personal calls
heaven forbid let them be on the internet
let them be on instant messengers
we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave
but we don 't need
what we need is a players uprising
what we need is a players uprising what we need is a players uprising seriously we need to band together today is the start of the uprising but what you need to do is fan the flames of the revolution you need to go and share your ideas and your success stories of what worked
about reinvigorating our lives our schools and our work with play
about how play promotes a sense of promise and self fulfillment of how play promotes innovation and productivity and ultimately how play creates meaning
because we can 't do it alone we have to do it together and together if we do this and share these ideas on play we can transform bulgaria for the better
