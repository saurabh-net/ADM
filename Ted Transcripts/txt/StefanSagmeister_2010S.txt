trying to see if i can actually train my mind in a particular way overall well being
then this january my mother died
and pursuing a film like that just
seemed the last thing that was interesting to me
so in a very typical silly designer fashion after years worth of work
pretty much all i have to show for it are the titles for the film
over the sayan valley in indonesia
in that year what i did do a lot was look at all sorts of surveys looking at a lot of data on this subject men and women report
very very similar levels of happiness this is a very quick overview of all the studies that i looked at that climate plays no role that if you live in the best climate in san diego in the united states or in the shittiest climate in buffalo new york
if you make more than fifty thousand bucks a year in the u s any salary increase you 're going to experience will have only a tiny tiny influence on your overall well being black people are just as happy as white people are
if you 're old or young it doesn 't really make a difference if you 're ugly or if you 're really really good looking it makes no difference whatsoever you will adapt to it and get used to it if you have manageable health problems
a fellow ted speaker jonathan haidt came up with this beautiful little analogy
between the conscious and the unconscious mind he says that the conscious mind is this tiny rider on this giant elephant the unconscious and the rider thinks that he can tell the elephant what to do but the elephant really has his own ideas
if i look at my own life i 'm born in one thousand nine hundred and sixty two in austria if i would have been born a hundred years earlier
the big decisions in my life would have been made for me meaning i would have stayed in the town that i was born in i would have very much likely entered the same profession that my dad did and i would have very much likely married a woman that my mom had selected
let our unconscious influence those decisions in ways that we are not quite aware of if you look at the statistics and you see that the guy called george when he decides on where he wants to live is it florida or north dakota
he goes and lives in georgia and if you look at a guy called dennis when he decides what to become is it a lawyer or does he want to become a doctor or a teacher best chance is that he wants to become a dentist
and if paula decides should she marry joe or jack somehow paul sounds the most interesting
and so even if we make those very important decisions for very silly reasons it remains statistically true that there are more georges living in georgia and there are more dennises becoming dentists and there are more paulas who are married to paul than statistically viable
american data and i thought well those silly
americans they get influenced by things that
then of course i looked at my mom and my dad
so i am looking still for a stephanie i 'll figure something out
if i make this whole thing a little bit more personal and see what makes me happy as a designer the easiest answer of course is
do more of the stuff that i like to do and much less of the stuff that i don 't like to do for which it would be helpful to know what it is that i actually do like to do
i 'm a big list maker so i came up with a list one of them is to think without pressure
this is a project we 're working on right now with a very healthy deadline it 's a book on culture and as you can see culture is rapidly drifting around
doing things like i 'm doing right now traveling to cannes the example i have here is a chair that came out of the year in bali clearly influenced by local manufacturing and culture
not being stuck behind a single computer screen all day long and be here and there quite consciously design projects that need an incredible amount of various techniques just basically to fight straightforward adaptation
being close to the content that 's the content really is close to my heart this is a bus or vehicle for a charity for an ngo that wants to double the education budget in the united states
carefully designed so by two inches it still clears highway overpasses
working on projects that actually have visible impacts like a book for a deceased german artist whose
and lately to be involved in projects where i know about fifty percent of the project technique wise and the other fifty percent would be new so in this case
it 's an outside projection for singapore on these giant times square like screens
and i of course knew stuff as a designer about typography
even though we worked with those animals not so successfully but i didn 't quite know all that much about movement or film
keeping a diary since i was twelve about my own happiness
