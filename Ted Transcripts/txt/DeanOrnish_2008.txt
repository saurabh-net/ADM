to change our genes is to make new ones as craig venter has so elegantly shown another is to change our lifestyles and
what we're learning is how powerful and dynamic these changes can be that you don't have to wait very long to see the benefits when you eat healthier manage stress exercise
and love more your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen but more than that your brain gets measurably bigger things that were thought impossible just a few years ago can actually be measured now this was
what were we just talking about
and other things that can make it worse that can cause you to lose brain cells the usual suspects like saturated fat and sugar nicotine opiates cocaine too much alcohol and chronic stress
your skin gets more blood flow when you change your lifestyle so you age less quickly your skin doesn't wrinkle as much your heart gets more blood flow we've shown that you can actually reverse heart disease that
these clogged arteries that you see on the upper left after only a year become measurably less clogged and the cardiac pet scan shown on the lower left the blue means no blood flow a year later orange and white is maximum blood flow
nicotine which constricts your arteries can cause a heart attack or a stroke but it also causes impotence half of guys who smoke are impotent how sexy is that
we're also about to publish a study a study showing you can change gene expression in men with prostate cancer this is what's called a heat map and the different colors and along the side on the right are different genes and we found that over five hundred genes were favorably
in effect turning on the good genes the disease preventing genes turning off the disease promoting genes and so these findings i think are really
very powerful giving many people new hope and new choices and companies like navigenix and dna direct and twenty three andme that are giving you your genetic profiles are giving some people a sense of gosh well what can i do about it
well our genes are not our fate and if we make these changes they're a predisposition but if we make bigger changes than we might have made otherwise we can actually change how our genes are expressed thank you
