we really need to put the best we have to offer within reach of our children
if we don't do that we're going to get the generation we deserve
the elite parents librarians professionals whatever it is a bunch of our activities are in fact in trying to get the best we have to offer within reach
of those around us or as broadly as we can i'm going to start and end this talk with a couple things that are carved in stone one is what's on the boston public library carved above their door is free to all
kind of an inspiring statement and i'll go back at the end of this i'm a librarian and what i'm trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledge
to as many people as want to read it and the idea of using technology is perfect for us i think we have the opportunity to one up the greeks
problem was you actually had to go to alexandria to go to it on other hand if you did then great things happened i think we can one up the greeks
and achieve something and i'm going to try to argue only one point today that universal access to all knowledge
is within our grasp so if i'm successful then you'll actually come away thinking yeah we could actually achieve the great vision
of everything ever published everything that was ever meant for distribution available to anybody in the world that's ever wanted to have access to it
yes there's issues about how money should be distributed and that's still being refigured out but i'd say there's plenty of money and there's plenty of demand so we can actually achieve that
i'm going to go over the technological social and sort of where are we as a whole trying to get to that particular vision and the way i'm going to try to do this is do it like the amazon com website
the books music video and just go step media type by media type just go and say all right how we doing on this so if we start with books
where are we well first you have to as an engineer scope the problem how big is it if you wanted to put all of the published works online so that anybody could have it available
well how big a problem is it well we don't really know but the largest print library in the world is the library of congress it's twenty six million volumes twenty six million volumes it's by far and away the largest print library in the world and a book if you had a book
is about a megabyte so you know if you had it in microsoft word so a megabyte twenty six million megabytes is twenty six terabytes it goes mega
so for the cost of a house or around here a garage you can put you can have spinning all of the words in the library of congress
that's pretty neat then the question is what do you get you know is it worth trying to get there do you actually want it online some of the first things that people do is
they make book readers that allow you to search inside the books and that's kind of fun and you can download these things and look around them in new and different ways and you can get at them remotely if you happen to have a laptop there's starting to be some of these
sort of page turn ee interfaces that look a whole lot like books in certain ways and you can search them make little tabs and
it's kind of cute still very book like on your laptop but i don't know reading things on a laptop whenever i pull up my laptop it always feels like work
i think that's one of the reasons why the kindle is so great i don't have to feel like i'm at work to read a kindle it's starting to be a little bit more specified
but i have to say that there's older technologies that i tend to like
i like the physical book
and i think we can go and use our technology to go and digitize things put them on the net and then download print them and bind them and end up with books again
and we sort of said well how hard is this and it turns out to not be very hard we actually went off to make a bookmobile and a bookmobile the size of a van with a satellite dish a printer binder and cutter and kids make their own books it costs about three dollars
to download print and bind a normal old book and they actually come out kind of nice looking you can actually get really good looking books for on the order of one penny per page sort of the parts cost
for doing this so the idea of this technology actually may end up putting books back in people 's hands again there are some other bookmobiles running around this is eric eldred making books at walden pond thoreau 's works this is just before he got kicked out by the parks
for competing with the bookstore there in india they've got another couple bookmobiles running around and this is the opening day at the library of alexandria the new library of alexandria in egypt
was quite popularly attended and kids starting to make their own books and a happy kid with the first book that he 's ever
so the idea of being able to use this technology to end up with paper where i can handle sort of sounds a little retro but i think it still has its place and being sort of from the silicon valley sort of utopia and sort of you know
world we thought if we can make this technology work in rural uganda we might have something so we actually got some funding from the world bank to try it out and we found in about thirty days we could go and take a couple folks from
so the books were in the library we could get it to people if they're digitized but we didn't know how to quite get them digitized everybody thought the answer is send things to india and china
and so we've tried that and i'll go over that in a moment there are some newer technologies for delivering that have happened
are actually quite exciting as well one is a print on demand machine that looks like a rube goldberg machine we have one of these things now it's completely cool it's all conveyor belt and it makes a
and it's called the espresso book machine and in about ten minutes you can press a button and make a book something else i'm quite excited about in this particular domain
beyond these sort of kiosky things where you can get books on demand is some of these new little
and one of my favorites in this is the one hundred dollar laptop and i don't mean to
steal any thunder here but we've gone and used one of these things to be an e book reader so here 's one of the
units and you can it actually turns out to be a really good looking e book reader
and we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it and it turns out that two hundred dots per inch means that you can put scanned books on them
that look really good at two hundred dots per inch it's kind of the equivalent of a three hundred dot print laser printer we're in good enough shape you actually can go and read scanned books quite easily so the idea of electronic books is starting
to come about but how do you do all this scanning so we thought okay well let 's try out this send books to india thing and there was a project with funded by the national science foundation sent a bunch of scanners and the american libraries were supposed to send books
well they didn't they didn't want to send their books so we bought one hundred thousand books and sent them to india and then we learned why you don't want to send books to india
the lesson we learned out of this is scan your own books if you really care about books you're going to scan them better especially if they're valuable books if they're new books and you can just you know
butcher them because you could just buy another one that's not such a big deal in terms of doing high quality scanning but do things that you love
but the indians have been scanning a lot of their own books about three hundred thousand now doing very well the chinese did over a million and the egyptians are about thirty thousand but we sent thought ok if we're going to need to do this
let 's do it in library how do we go and do this and how do we get it down so that it's a cost point that we could afford and we sort of picked the price point of ten cents a page if it's basically the cost of xeroxing
to digitize ocr package it up make it so that you could download print and bind it the whole shebang we would have achieved something
so we started out trying to figure out how do we get to ten cents and we tried these robot things and they worked pretty well sort of these auto page turning things if we can have mars rovers
think you could turn pages but it actually turns out to be pretty hard to turn pages and the volume isn't there so anyway so we ended up making our own book scanner
and with two digital high grade professional digital cameras controlled museum lighting so even if it's a black and white book
you can go and get the proper intonation so you basically do a beautiful respectful job this is not a fax this is the idea is to do a beautiful job
as you're going through these libraries and we've been able to achieve ten cents a page if we run things in volumes this is what it looks like at the university of toronto
and actually it turns out to you know pay a living wage people seem to love it yes it's a little boring but some people kind of get into the zen of it
and especially if it's kind of interesting books that you care about in languages that you can read we actually have been able to do a pretty good job of this at getting ten cents a page so ten cents a page
three hundred pages in your average book thirty dollars a book the library of congress if you did the whole darn thing twenty six million books is about seven hundred and fifty million dollars
but a million books i think actually would be a pretty good start and that would cost thirty million dollars that's not that big a bill and what we've been able to do is get into libraries we've now got
eight of these scanning centers in three countries and libraries are up for having their books scanned the getty here is moving their books
to the ucla which is where we have one these scanning centers and scanning their out of copyright books which is fabulous so we're starting to get the institutional responsibility the thing we're missing is the ten cents
if we can get the ten cents all the rest of it flows we've scanned about two hundred thousand books now we're scanning about fifteen thousand books a month and it's starting to gear up another factor of two
from there so all in all that's going very well and we're starting to move out of the just out of copyright into the out of print world
so i think of we're kind of going from the out of copyright library stuff and amazon com is coming from the in print world
and i think we'll meet in the middle some place and have the classic thing that you have which is a publishing system and a library system working in parallel
and so we're starting up a program to do out of print works but loaning them
what loaning means i'm not quite sure but anyway loaning out of print works from the boston public library the woods hole oceanographic institute
and a few other libraries that are starting to participate in this program to try out this model of where does a library stop and where does the bookstore
take over so all in all it's possible to do this in large scale we're also going back over microfilm and getting that online
so we can do ten cents a page we're going fifteen thousand books a month and we've got about two hundred and fifty thousand books online counting all the other projects that are starting to add in
so what i wanted to argue is books are within our grasp the idea of taking on the whole ball of wax is not that big a deal yes it costs tens of millions
low hundreds of millions but one time shot and we've got basically the history of printed literature online
and then there's business model issues about how to try to effectively market it and get it to people but it is within our grasp technologically
and law wise at least for the out of print and out of copyright we suggest to be able to get the whole darn thing online
now let 's go for audio and i'm going to go through these so how much is there well as best we can tell there are about two to three million disks having been published so seventy eight s long playing records and
cds or at least that's the largest archives of published materials we've been able to sort of point at it costs about ten dollars a piece to go and take a disk and put it online if you're doing things in volume
and we've been starting to make these available by going and offering shelf space on the net in the united states it doesn't cost you to give something away
right if you give something to a charity or to the public you get a pat on the back and a tax donation except on the net
can go broke if you put up a video of your garage band and it starts getting heavily accessed you can lose your guitars or your house this doesn't make any sense so we've offered unlimited storage unlimited bandwidth forever for free
bands a day signing up they give permission and we get about forty or fifty concerts a day we have about forty thousand concerts everything the grateful dead ever did
up on the net so that people can see it and listen to this material so audio is possible to put up
but the rights issues are really pretty thorny we've got a lot of collections now a couple hundred thousand items and it's growing over time
that are really meant for a large scale theatrical distribution it's just not that many but half of those were indian but anyway it's doable but we've only found about a thousand of these things that to be
out of copyright so we've digitized those and made those available but we've found that there's lots of other types of movies that haven't really seen the light of day archival films we've found also
a lot of political films a lot of amateur films all sorts of things that are basically needing of a home a permanent home so we've been starting to make these available and it's grown to be very
which has just been great fun television comes quite a bit larger we started recording twenty channels of television twenty four hours a day
sort of the biggest tivo box you've ever seen it's about a petabyte so far of worldwide television
mostly for cost reasons which is the nine eleven sort of from nine eleven two thousand and one for one week what did the world see
cnn were saying that palestinians were dancing in the streets were they let 's look at the palestinian television and find out how can we have
now a lot of these materials so we've got about one hundred thousand pieces up there so
and all of the pages on it every two months and actually it's really been pioneered by alexa internet which donates this collection to the internet archive
and it's been growing along for the last eleven years and it's a fantastic resource and we've made a way back machine that you can then go and see old
kind of the way they were if you go and search on something this is google com the different versions of it that we have this is what it looks like when it was an alpha release
and this is what it looked like at stanford so anyway you've got basically an idea of where things came from mostly people want to see their old stuff out of this if there's one thing that we want to learn from the library of alexandria version one which is probably best known for
burning is don't just have one copy so we've started to we've made another copy of all of this and we actually put it back in the
flood zone in amsterdam and in the middle east right so anyway so we're hedging our bets here if we go and put it in a couple more places i think we'll be in good
shape there's a political and social question out of this is all of this as we go digital is it going to be public or private there's some large companies that have seen this vision that are doing large scale digitization but they're locking up the public domain
the question is is that the world that we really want to live in what's the role of the public versus the private as things go forward how do we go and have a world where we both have libraries and publishing
in the future just as we basically benefited as we were growing up so universal access to all knowledge i think it can be one of the greatest achievements of humankind
like the man on the moon or the gutenberg bible or the library of alexandria it could be something that we're remembered for for millennia for having achieved
and as i said before i'll end with something that's carved above the door of the carnegie library carnegie one of the great capitalists of this country carved above his legacy free to the people thank you very much
