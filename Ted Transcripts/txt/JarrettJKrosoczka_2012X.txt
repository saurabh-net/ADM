my name is jarrett krosoczka and i write and illustrate books for children
but well before my imagination was my vocation
my imagination saved my life
when i was a kid i loved to draw and the most talented artist i knew was my mother
and when your parent is a drug addict it 's kind of like charlie brown trying to kick the football because as much as you want to love on that person as much as you want to receive love from that person every time you open your heart you end up on your back
so throughout my childhood my mother was incarcerated and i didn 't have my father because i didn 't even learn his first name until i was in the sixth grade
but i had my grandparents my maternal grandparents joseph and shirley who adopted me just before my third birthday and took me in as their own after they had already raised five children so two people who grew up in the great depression
there in the very very early eighty s took on a new kid i was the cousin oliver of the sitcom of the krosoczka family the new kid who came out of nowhere
and i would like to say that life was totally easy with them they each smoked two packs a day each nonfiltered and by the time i was six i could order a southern comfort manhattan dry with a twist rocks on the side the ice on the side so you could fit more liquor in the drink
but they loved the hell out of me they loved me so much
and they supported my creative efforts because my grandfather was a self made man he ran and worked in a factory my grandmother was a homemaker
but here was this kid who loved transformers and snoopy and the ninja turtles and the characters that i read about i fell in love with
and they became my friends so my best friends in life were the characters i read about in books
i went to gates lane elementary school in worcester massachusetts and i had wonderful teachers there
most notably in first grade mrs alisch
and i just i can just remember the love that she offered us as her students when i was in the third grade
and afterwards we all went back to our classrooms and we drew our own renditions of his main character rotten ralph
and suddenly the author appeared in our doorway
two words that made a colossal difference in my life
when i was in the third grade i wrote a book for the first time the owl who thought he was the best flyer
our own creation story so i wrote a story about an owl who challenged hermes to a flying race and the owl cheated
and hermes being a greek god grew angry and bitter and turned the owl into a moon so the owl had to live the rest of his life as a moon while he watched his family and friends play at night
i was clearly worried about my intellectual property
it was a story that was told with words and pictures exactly what i do now for a living and i sometimes let the words have the stage on their own
using my imagination and that 's what writing is writing is using your imagination on paper and i do get so scared because i travel to so many schools now and that seems like such a foreign concept to kids that writing would be using your imagination on paper if they 're allowed to even write now within the school hours
so i loved writing so much that i 'd come home from school
and i would take out pieces of paper and i would staple them together and i would fill those blank pages with words and pictures just because i loved using my imagination and so these characters would become my friends there was an egg a tomato a head of lettuce and a pumpkin
and they all lived in this refrigerator city
and in one of their adventures they went to a haunted house that was filled with so many dangers like an evil blender
and through pictures now when i was in sixth grade the public funding all but eliminated the arts budgets in the worcester public school system
i went from having art once a week to twice a month to once a month to not at all i had art
so he walked into my room one evening and he sat on the edge of my bed and he said jarrett it 's up to you but if you 'd like to we 'd like to send you to the classes at the worcester art museum and i was so thrilled
so from sixth through twelfth grade once twice sometimes three times a week i would take classes at the art museum and i was surrounded by other kids who loved to draw other kids who shared a similar passion
now my publishing career began when i designed the cover for my eighth grade yearbook
and if you 're wondering about the style of dress i put our mascot in i was really into bell biv devoe and mc hammer and vanilla ice at the time
and to this day i still can do karaoke to ice ice baby without looking at the screen
don 't tempt me because i will do it
so i get shipped off to private school k through eight public schools but for some reason my grandfather was upset that somebody at the local high school had been stabbed and killed
so he didn 't want me to go there
he wanted me to go to a private school and he gave me an option
you can go to holy name which is coed or st john 's which is all boys
very wise man because he knew i would i felt like i was making the decision on my own and he knew i wouldn 't choose st john 's so i went to holy name high school which was a tough transition because like i said i didn 't play sports and it was very focused on sports but i took solace in mr shilale 's art
i just couldn 't wait to get to that classroom every day
so how did i make friends i drew funny pictures of my teachers well
in english class in ninth grade my friend john who was sitting next to me laughed a little bit too hard
mr greenwood was not pleased
i was sent to the hall and i thought oh no i 'm doomed my grandfather 's just going to kill me and he came out to the hallway and he said let me see the paper and i thought oh no he thinks it 's a note and so i took this picture and i handed it to him
and he said to me you 're really talented
you 're really good you know the school newspaper needs a new cartoonist and you should be the cartoonist just stop drawing in my class
so my parents never found out about it i didn 't get in trouble i was introduced to mrs casey
handling such heavy issues as
seniors are mean freshmen are nerds
the prom bill is so expensive
i can 't believe how much it costs to go to the prom
and i took the headmaster to task
and then i also wrote an ongoing story about a boy named wesley who was unlucky in love and i just swore up and down that this wasn 't about me
but all these years later it was totally
but it was so cool because i could write these stories i could come up with these ideas and they 'd be published in the school paper
on my fourteenth birthday my grandfather and my grandmother gave me the best birthday present ever
a drafting table that i have worked on ever since here i am twenty years later and i still work on this table every day on the evening of my fourteenth birthday
i was given this table and we had chinese food and this was my fortune you will be successful in your work i taped it to the top
left hand of my table and as you can see it 's still there
now i never really asked my grandparents for anything
well two things rusty who was a great hamster and lived a great long life when i was in fourth grade
i just wanted a video camera
and after begging and pleading for christmas i got a second hand video camera and i instantly started making my own animations on my own
and all throughout high school i made my own animations i convinced my tenth grade english teacher to allow me to do my book report on stephen king 's misery as an animated short
and i kept making comics
i kept making comics and
at the worcester art museum i was given the greatest piece of advice by any educator i was ever given mark lynch he 's an amazing teacher and he 's still a dear friend of mine
and i was fourteen or fifteen and i walked into his comic book class halfway through the course
from his face and he looked at me and he said forget everything you learned and i didn 't understand he said you have a great style celebrate your own style don 't draw the way you 're being told to draw draw the way you 're drawing and keep at it because you 're really
now when i was a teenager i was angsty as any teenager was but after seventeen years of having a mother who was in and out of my life like a yo yo and a father who was faceless i was angry
and when i was seventeen i met my father for the first time upon which i learned i had a brother and sister i had never known about
and on the day i met my father for the first time i was rejected from the rhode island school of design
my one and only choice for college
but it was around this time i went to camp sunshine to volunteer a week and working with the most amazing kids kids with leukemia and this kid eric changed my life eric didn 't live to see his sixth birthday
and eric lives with me every day so after this experience my art teacher mr shilale he brought in these picture books
and it was there that i wrote a story about a giant orange slug who wanted to be friends with this kid the kid had no patience for him and i sent this book out to a dozen publishers and it was rejected every single time
but i was also involved with the hole in the wall gang camp an amazing camp for kids with all sorts of critical illnesses and it 's those kids at the camp that read my stories and i read to them and i saw that they responded to my work
i graduated from risd my grandparents were very proud
and i moved to boston and i set up shop i set up a studio and i tried to get published i would send out my books i would send out hundreds of postcards
who was just this really hyper kid i started calling him monkey boy
and i went home and wrote a book called good night monkey boy and i sent out one last batch of postcards
and i received an email from an editor at random house with a subject line nice work exclamation point dear jarrett i received your postcard i liked your art so i went to your website and
for a contract for my first book good night monkey boy which was published
and my local paper celebrated the news the local bookstore made a big deal of it
my grandparents they were in the middle of it they were so happy they couldn 't have been more proud mrs alisch was there mr shilale was there mrs casey was there mrs alisch cut in front of the line and said i taught him how to read
i got my first piece of significant fan mail where this kid loved monkey boy so much that he wanted to have a monkey boy birthday cake
for a two year old that is like a tattoo
and i got this picture and i thought this picture is going to live within his consciousness for his entire life he will forever have
this photo in his family photo albums so that photo since that moment is framed in front of me while i 've worked on all of my books i have ten picture books out punk farm
baghead ollie the purple elephant i just finished the ninth book in the lunch lady series which is a graphic novel series about a lunch lady who fights crime
i 'm expecting the release of a chapter
book called platypus police squad the frog who croaked
and i travel the country visiting countless schools letting lots of kids know that they draw great cats and i meet bagheads
lunch ladies treat me really well
to see my name in lights because kids put my name in lights twice now the lunch lady series has won the children 's choice book of the year in the third or fourth grade category and those winners were displayed
on a jumbotron screen in times square
punk farm and lunch lady are in development to be movies so i am a movie producer and i really do think thanks to that video camera i was given in ninth grade i 've seen people have punk farm birthday parties people have dressed up as punk farm for halloween
a punk farm baby room which makes me a little nervous for the child 's well being in the long term and i get the most amazing fan mail and i get the most amazing projects and the biggest moment for me came last halloween the doorbell rang and it was a trick or treater dressed as my character
it was so cool now my grandparents
are no longer living so to honor them i started a scholarship at the worcester art museum
for kids who are in difficult situations but whose caretakers can 't afford the classes and
you are alive and that 's
two beautiful daughters and my goal is to surround them by inspiration by the books that are in every single room of our house to the murals i painted in their rooms
