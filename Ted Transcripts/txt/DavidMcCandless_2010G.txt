all suffering from information overload or data glut and the good news is there might be an easy solution to that and that's using our eyes more so visualizing information so that we can see the patterns and connections that matter
and then designing that information so it makes more sense or it tells a story or allows us to focus only on the information that's important
this is the billion dollar gram and this image arose out of frustration i had with the reporting of billion dollar amounts in the press that is they're meaningless without context
five hundred billion for this pipeline twenty billion for this war it doesn't make any sense so the only way to understand it is visually and relatively
so i scraped a load of reported figures from various news outlets and then scaled the boxes according to those amounts and the colors here represent the motivation behind the money so purple is
fighting and red is giving money away and green is profiteering and what you can see straight away is you start to have a different relationship to the numbers you can literally see them
is opec 's revenue this green box here seven hundred and eighty billion a year and this little pixel in the corner three billion that's their climate change fund
and it mushroomed slightly afghanistan mushroomed now to three thousand billion so
so there it is two hundred and twenty seven billion is what africa owes and the recent financial crisis how much of this diagram might that figure take up what has that cost the world
think is the appropriate sound effect for that much money
eleven thousand nine hundred billion so by visualizing this information we turned it into a landscape
that you can explore with your eyes a kind of map really a sort of information map and when you're lost in information an information map is kind of useful
so i want to show you another landscape now we need to imagine what a landscape of the world 's fears might look like let 's take a look this is mountains
timeline of global media panic sars brownish here
sars brownish here the millennium
terrible disaster these little green
peaks are asteroid collisions and in summer here killer wasps
a very interesting and odd pattern hidden in this data that you can only see when you visualize it let me highlight it for you see this line this is a landscape for violent video games
as you can see there's a kind of odd regular pattern in the data twin peaks every year if we look closer we see those peaks occur at the same month every year
that gap there there's a gap and it affects all the other stories why is there a gap there you see where it starts september two thousand and one when we had something very real
so i've been working as a data journalist for about a year and i keep hearing a phrase all the time which is this data is the new oil
data is the new soil because for me it feels like a fertile creative medium you know over the years online we've laid down
a huge amount of information and data and we irrigate it with networks and connectivity and it's been worked and tilled by unpaid workers and governments
but it's a really fertile medium and it feels like visualizations infographics data visualizations they feel like flowers blooming from this medium
what rises twice a year once in
chocolate you might want to get some chocolate in any other guesses
being single over the summer and then the lowest day of the year of course christmas day who would do that
so there's a titanic amount of data out there now
way interesting things can emerge
so information is beautiful data is beautiful i wonder if i could make my life beautiful and here 's my visual c v i'm not quite sure i've succeeded pretty blocky the colors aren't that great but i wanted to convey something to you
i started as a programmer and then i worked as a writer for many years about twenty years in print online and then in advertising and only recently have i started designing and
never been to design school i've never studied art or anything i just kind of learned through doing and when i started designing i discovered an odd thing about myself i already knew how to design
but it wasn't like i was amazingly brilliant at it but more like i was sensitive to the ideas of grids and space and alignment and typography
and i don't feel like i'm unique i feel that everyday all of us now are being blasted by information design it's being poured into our eyes through the web and we're all visualizers now we're all demanding a visual aspect to our information
i was curious about this so it led me to the work of a danish physicist called tor norretranders and he converted the bandwidth of the senses into computer terms so here we go this is your senses pouring into your senses every second
your sense of sight is the fastest it has the same bandwidth as a computer network then you have touch which is about the speed of a usb key and then you have hearing and smell which has the throughput of a hard
and then you have poor old taste which is like barely the throughput of a pocket calculator and that little square in the corner zero point seven percent that's the amount we're actually aware of
so a lot of your vision the bulk of it is visual and it's pouring in it's unconscious and the eye is exquisitely sensitive to patterns in variations in color shape and pattern
it loves them and it calls them beautiful it's the language of the eye and if you combine that language of the eye with the language of the mind which is about words and numbers and concepts you start speaking two languages simultaneously each enhancing the other
so you have the eye and then you drop in the concepts and that whole thing it's two languages both working at the same time
so we can use this new kind of language if you like to alter our perspective or change our views let me ask you a simple question with a really simple
so massive in fact that it can contain all the other military budgets in the world inside itself gobble gobble gobble gobble gobble now you can see africa 's total debt there and the u k budget deficit for reference so
that might well chime with your view that america is a sort of warmongering military machine out to overpower the world with its huge industrial military complex
other top industrialized nations economies inside itself it's so vastly rich so its military budget is bound to be enormous
so to be fair and to alter our perspective we have to bring in another data set and that data set is gdp or the country 's earnings who has the biggest budget
you know mobilize enormous its forces but of course china has an enormous population so if we do the same we see a radically different picture
we need relative figures that are connected to other data so that we can see a fuller picture and then that can lead to us changing our perspective as hans rosling the master my master said
this one i'm a bit of a health nut i love kind of like taking supplements and being fit but i can never
worth investigating but only for the conditions listed below and then the supplements below the line are perhaps not
now this image constitutes a huge amount of work we scraped like one thousand studies from pubmed the biomedical database
what it points to is that visualizing information like this is a form of knowledge compression it's a way of squeezing an enormous amount of information and understanding into a small space
and once you've curated that data and once you've cleaned that data and once it's there you can do cool stuff like this so i converted this into an interactive app so i can now
so let 's filter that out so heart is filtered out so i if i'm curious about that i think no no i don't want to take any synthetics i just want to see plants and just show me herbs and plants i've got all the natural ingredients now this
i can update it in a second new evidence comes out i just change a row on a spreadsheet doosh again the image recreates itself so it's cool it's kind of living
kind of can go beyond data and it can go beyond numbers and i like to apply information visualization to ideas and concepts
this is a visualization of the political spectrum in an attempt for me to try and understand how it works and how the ideas
it's made up of concepts it explores our worldviews and it helps us it helps me anyway to see what others think to see where they're coming from and it feels just incredibly cool to do that
and what was most exciting for me designing this was that when i was designing this image i desperately wanted this side the left side to be better than the right side being a kind of journalist a left leaning
but i couldn 't because i would have created a lopsided biased diagram so in order to really create a full image
the perspectives on the right hand side and at the same time kind of uncomfortably recognize how many of those qualities were actually in me which was very very annoying and
but not too uncomfortable because there's something unthreatening about seeing a political perspective versus being told or forced to listen to one it's actually you're capable of holding conflicting viewpoints
so just to wrap up i wanted to say that it feels to me that design is about solving problems and providing elegant solutions and information design
so visualizing information can give us a very quick solution to those kinds of problems and even when the information is
