talk to you today about a whole new way to think about sexual activity and sexuality education by comparison
if you talk to someone today in america about sexual activity you 'll find pretty soon you 're not just talking about sexual activity you 're also talking about baseball
because baseball is the dominant cultural metaphor that americans use to think about and talk about sexual activity
and we know that because there 's all this language in english that seems to be talking about baseball but that 's really talking about sexual activity so for example
and if you 're a benchwarmer you might be a virgin or somebody who for whatever reason isn 't in the game maybe because of your age or because of your ability
or because of your skillset
a bat 's a penis and a nappy dugout is a vulva or a vagina
a glove or a catcher 's mitt is a condom
a switch hitter is a bisexual person and we gay and lesbian folks play for the other team and then there 's this one
if there 's grass on the field play ball
and that usually refers to if a young person specifically often a young woman is old enough to have pubic hair she 's old enough to have sex with
this baseball model is incredibly problematic it 's sexist it 's heterosexist it 's competitive it 's goal directed and it can 't result in healthy sexuality developing in young people or in adults
so we need a new model i 'm here today to offer you that new model
and it 's based on
the trigger for sexual activity what happens during sexual activity and the expected outcome of sexual activity
so when do you play baseball
you play baseball when it 's baseball season and when there 's a game on the schedule
it 's not exactly your choice
it 's competitive we 're not playing with each other we 're playing against each other and when you show up to play baseball nobody needs to talk about what we 're going to do or how this baseball game might be good for us everybody knows the rules you just take your position and play the game
but when do you have pizza well you have pizza
well you have pizza when you 're hungry
for pizza it starts with an internal sense an internal desire or a need huh i could go for some pizza
we 're looking for an experience that both of us will share that 's satisfying for both of us
and half and even if you 've had
pizza with somebody for a very long time don 't you still say things like
should we get the usual laughter or maybe something a little more adventurous
okay so when you 're playing baseball so if we talk about during sexual activity when you 're playing baseball you 're just supposed to round the bases in the proper order one at a time you can 't hit the ball and run to right field that doesn 't work and you also can 't get to second base and say
and also of course with baseball there 's like the specific equipment and a specific skill set not everybody can play baseball
it 's pretty exclusive okay but what about pizza when we 're trying to figure out what 's good for pizza isn 't it all about
you score as many runs as you can
there 's always a winner in baseball
and that means there 's always a loser in baseball
there 's no winning how do you win pizza
and sometimes that can be different amounts over different times or with different people or on different days and we get to decide
when we feel satisfied if we 're still hungry we might have some more
if you eat too much though you just feel gross
so what if we could take this pizza model and overlay it on top of sexuality education a lot of sexuality education that happens today is so influenced by the baseball model and it sets up education that
and those young people become older people but if we could create sexuality education that was more like pizza we could create education that invites people to think about their own desires to make deliberate decisions about what they want
to talk about it with their partners and to ultimately look for not some external outcome
but for what feels satisfying and we get to decide that
you may have noticed in the baseball and pizza comparison under the baseball it 's all commands they 're all exclamation points
but under the pizza model they 're questions
and who gets to answer those questions you do
