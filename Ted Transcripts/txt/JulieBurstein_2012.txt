a small clay pot that i made in college
that began in japan centuries ago as a way
this one is more than four hundred years old
each one was pinched or carved out of a ball of clay
and it was the imperfections that people cherished everyday pots like this
to fire i just took this out of the kiln last week and the kiln itself
you do it outside and you take
and as soon as you see that the glaze has melted inside you can see that faint sheen you turn the kiln off and you reach in with these long metal tongs
but here in the united states we ramp up the drama a little bit and we drop
i love raku because it allows and choose a glaze
to room temperature in the space of just a minute
for the process of creativity i find in so many things that tension between what i can control and what i have to let go happens all the time
whether i 'm creating a new radio show
when i sat down to write a book
about creativity i realized that the steps were reversed i had to let go at the very beginning
in the stories of hundreds of
and as i listened to these stories
more often than you might think
the best way to learn about anything
the first embrace is something that we think oh this is very easy
speak about needing to be open to embrace experience and that 's hard to do when you have a lighted rectangle in your pocket
the filmmaker mira nair speaks about growing up in a small town in india
its name is bhubaneswar and here 's a picture of one of the temples in her town
we played cricket all the time we kind of grew up in the rubble the major thing that inspired me that led me on this path that made me a filmmaker eventually was traveling folk theater that would come through the town
and i would go off and see these great battles of good and evil by two people in a school field with no props but with a lot of
you know passion and hashish as well and it was amazing you know the folk tales of mahabharata and ramayana the two holy books the epics that everything comes out of in india they say after seeing that jatra the folk theater i knew i wanted to get on you know and perform
so being open for that experience that might change you is the first thing we need to embrace
the novelist richard ford speaks about a childhood challenge that continues to be something he wrestles with today he 's severely dyslexic
and still to this day can 't read silently much faster than i can read aloud but there were a lot of benefits to being dyslexic for me because when i finally did reconcile myself to how slow i was going to have to do it then i think i came very slowly
into an appreciation of all of those qualities of language and of sentences that are not just the cognitive aspects of language the syncopations the sounds of words what words look like where paragraphs break where lines break i mean i wasn 't so badly dyslexic that i was disabled from reading i just had to do it really slowly
and as i did lingering on those sentences as i had to linger
i fell heir to language 's other qualities which i think has helped me write sentences overcome dyslexia
he had to learn from it he had to learn to hear the music in language
helps them focus on finding their own voice the sculptor richard serra
talks about how as a young artist he thought he was a painter
and he lived in florence after graduate school
while he was there he traveled to madrid where he went to the prado to see this picture
it 's from one thousand six
and it 's the picture of a little princess and her ladies in waiting
and if you look over that little blonde princess 's shoulder you 'll see a mirror and reflected in it
the king and queen of spain
who would be standing where you might stand to look at the picture in this painting too
he 's standing on the left
randomness and i wasn 't getting anywhere so i went back and dumped all my paintings in the arno and i thought i 'm going to just start playing around
he went and saw this painting by a guy who 'd been dead for three hundred years and realized
he moved to new york city and he put together a list of verbs
to roll to crease to fold
he would do the same thing
and when he got to the direction
richard serra had to let go of painting
in order to embark on this playful exploration
that led him to the work that he 's known for today so experience and challenge
and limitations are all things we need to embrace for creativity to flourish
there 's a fourth embrace
and it 's the hardest it 's the embrace of loss
the oldest and most constant of human experiences
in order to create we have to stand in that space between what we see in the world and what we hope for looking squarely at rejection
educator parker palmer calls it the tragic
and my friend dick nodel likes to say you can hold that tension like a violin string and make something beautiful
who at the beginning of his career was known for his street photography for capturing a moment on the street and also for his beautiful photographs of landscapes of tuscany
with a straight view downtown to the world trade center
and he photographed those buildings in every sort of light
you know where this story
and i raised my camera to take a peek just to see if there was something to see and some
and when i asked her why no pictures she said it 's a crime scene no photographs allowed and i asked her what would happen if i was a member of the press
and she told me oh look back there and back a block was the press corps tied up
in a little penned in area
and i said well when do they go in and she said probably never
and as i walked away from that i had this crystallization
probably from the blow because it was an insult in a way i thought
we need a record and i thought i 'm gonna make that record i 'll find a way to get in because i don 't want to see this history disappear
for nine months almost every day
looking at these photographs today brings back the smell of smoke that lingered on my clothes when i went home to my family at night
my office was just a few blocks away
and we wondered was it difficult for joel meyerowitz to make such beauty out of such devastation
after the fact into this residue and like many other ruins you go to the ruins of the colosseum or the ruins of a cathedral someplace and they take on a new meaning when you watch the weather
i mean there were afternoons i was down there and the light goes pink and there 's a mist in the air and you 're standing in the rubble and i found myself recognizing both
the inherent beauty of nature and the fact that nature as time is erasing this wound
time is unstoppable and it transforms the event it gets further and further away from the day and light and seasons
you have to take a picture
when i saw joel meyerowitz recently i told him how much i admired his passionate obstinacy his determination to push through all the bureaucratic red tape
he 's right we all wrestle with experience and challenge limits and loss
creativity is essential to all of us
whether we 're scientists or teachers
image of a japanese tea bowl this one is at the freer gallery in washington d c
it 's more than a hundred years old and you can still see the fingermarks where the potter pinched it
but as you can also see this one did break at some point in its hundred years
using gold lacquer to repair it
this bowl is more beautiful now
having been broken than it was when it was first made
of the cycle of creation and destruction
of control and letting go
of picking up the pieces and making something new
