on a human dominated planet putting unprecedented pressure on the systems on earth this is bad news but perhaps surprising to you it's also part of the good news we're the first generation
in fact we're in a phase where transformative change is necessary which opens the window for innovation for new ideas and new paradigms this is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity in the global phase of sustainability
on this journey i'd like to bring apart from yourselves a good friend a stakeholder who 's always absent when we deal with the negotiations on environmental issues a stakeholder who refuses to compromise planet earth
so i thought i'd bring her with me today on stage to have her as a witness of a remarkable journey which humbly reminds us
period of grace we've had over the past ten thousand years this is the living conditions on the planet over the last one hundred thousand years
it's a very important period it's roughly half the period when we've been fully modern humans on the planet we've had the same roughly abilities that developed civilizations as we know it
this is the environmental conditions on the planet here used as a proxy temperature variability it was a jumpy ride eighty thousand years back in a crisis we leave africa
we colonize australia in another crisis sixty thousand years back we leave asia for europe in another crisis forty thousand years back and then we enter the remarkably stable holocene phase
the only period in the whole history of the planet that we know of that can support human development a thousand years into this period we abandon our
the roman the greek and the story as you know it the only phase as we know it that can support
the trouble is we're putting a quadruple sqeeze on this poor planet a quadruple sqeeze which as its first squeeze has
the majority of the planet aspiring for development having the right for development are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle a momentous pressure
to avoid the risk that we may be destabilizing the west antarctic ice sheet holding six meters level rising the risk of destabilizing the greenland ice sheet holding another seven meters sea level
now you would have wished the climate pressure to hit a strong planet a resilient planet but unfortunately the third pressure is the ecosystem decline never have we seen in the past fifty years
such a sharp decline of ecosystem functions and services on the planet one of them being the ability to regulate climate on the long term in our forests land and biodiversity the forth pressure is
the notion and the evidence that we need to abandon our old paradigm that ecosystems behave linearly predictably controllably
in our so to say linear systems and that in fact surprise is universal as systems tip over very rapidly abruptly and often irreversibly this dear friends poses
human pressure on the planet of momentous scale we may in fact have entered a new geological era the anthropocene where humans are the predominant driver of change at a planetary level
now as a scientist what's the evidence for this well the evidence is
you can take virtually any parameter that matters for human well being nitrous oxide methane deforestation overfishing land degredation loss of species they all show
the same pattern over the past two hundred years simultaneously they branch off in the mid fifties ten years after the second world war
showing very clearly that the great acceleration of the human enterprise starts in the mid fifties you see for the first time an imprint on the global level
and i can tell you you enter the disciplinary research in each of these you find something remarkably important the conclusion that we may have come to the point where we have to bend the curves
we may have entered the most challenging and exciting decade in the history humanity on the planet the decade when we have to bend the curves
now as if this was not enough to just bend the curves and understanding the accelerated pressure on the planet we also have to recognize the fact that systems do have multiple stable states separated by thresholds illustrated here by this ball and cup diagram
the depth of the cup is the resilience of the system now the system may gradually under pressure of climate change erosion biodiversity loss
lose the depth of the cup the resilience but appear to be healthy and appear to suddenly under a threshold be tipping over
changing state and literally ending up in an undesired situation
where new biophysical logic takes over new species take over and the system gets locked do we have evidence of this yes coral reef systems
loses its resilience soft corals take over and we get undesired systems that cannot support economic and social development the arctic
a beautiful system a regulating biome at the planetary level taking the knock after knock on climate change appearing to be in a good state no scientist could predict
in two thousand and seven suddenly what could be crossing a threshold the system suddenly very surprisingly loses thirty to forty percent of its summer ice cover
and the drama is of course that when the system does this the logic may change it may get locked in an undesired state because it changes color absorbs more energy
and the system may get stuck in my mind the largest red flag warning for humanity that we are in a precarious situation
as a sideline you know that the only red flag that popped up here was a submarine from an unnamed country that planted a red flag at the bottom of the arctic to be able to control the oil resources now
if we have evidence which we now have that wetlands forests the rainforests behave in this nonlinear way
thirty or so scientists around the world gathered and asked a question for the first time do we have to put the planet into the the pot so we have to ask ourselves are we threatening this extraordinarily stable holocene state
are we in fact putting ourselves in a situation where we're coming too close to thresholds that could lead to deleterious and very undesired if now catastrophic change for human development
you know you don't want to stand there in fact you're not even allowed to stand where this gentleman is standing at the foaming slippery waters at the threshold in fact there's a fence
to keep ourselves safe in the holocene and could we even thanks to major advancements in earth systems science identify the thresholds the points where we may expect nonlinear change and could we even
this work which was published in nature late two thousand and nine after a number of years of analysis led to the final proposition
that we can only find nine planetary boundaries with which under active stewardship would allow ourselves to have a safe operating space these include of course climate it may surprise you that it's not only climate
and ocean acidification being the three big systems where the scientific evidence of large scale thresholds in the paleo record of the history of the planet
big nitrogen and phosphorus cycles on the planet land use change rate of biodiversity loss freshwater use functions which regulate
biomass on the planet carbon sequestration diversity and then we have two parameters which we were not able to quantify air pollution including warming gases and air polluting sulfates and nitrates but also chemical pollution
in fact most evidence indicates that these nine may behave as three musketeers one for all all for one you degrade forests you go beyond the boundary on land you undermine the ability of the climate system
to stay stable the drama here is in fact that it may show that the climate challenge is the easy one if you consider the whole challenge of sustainable development
this is the big bang equivalent then of human development within the safe operating space of the planetary boundaries what you see here in black line is the safe operating space the quantified
boundaries as suggested by this analysis the yellow dot in the middle here is our starting point the pre industrial point where we're very safely in the safe operating space in the fifties we start branching out
the rate of biodiversity loss which is the sixth extinction period in the history of humanity one of them being the extinctions of the dinosaurs
to guide humanity to put the light on our so far overpowered industrial vehicle which operates as if we're only on a dark straight highway
now the question then is how gloomy is this is then sustainable development utopia well there's no science to suggest in fact there is ample science to indicate that we can do this transformative change that we have the ability
to now move into a new innovative a transformative gear across scales the drama is of course is that two hundred countries on this planet have to simultaneously start moving in the same direction
towards a much more flexible a much more adaptive approach where we recognize that redundancy both in social and environmental systems is key to be able to deal with a turbulent era
of global change we have to invest in persistence in the ability of social systems and ecological systems to withstand shocks and still remain in that desired cup
we have to invest in transformations capability moving from crisis into innovation and the ability to rise after
and of course to adapt to unavoidable change this is a new paradigm we're not doing that at any scale on governance but is it happening anywhere do we have any examples of success on this mindshift being applied at the local level
well yes in fact we do and the list can start becoming longer and longer there's good news here for example from latin america where plow based farming systems of the fifties and sixties
led farming basically to a dead end with lower and lower yields degrading the organic matter and fundamental problems at the livelihood levels in paraguay uruguay and a number of countries brazil
leading to innovation and entrepreneurship among farmers in partnership with scientists into an agricultural revolution of zero tillage systems combined with mulch farming with locally adapted technologies which today for example
the australian great barrier reef is another success story under the realization from tourist operators fishermen
the australian great barrier reef authority and scientists that the great barrier reef is doomed under the current governance regime
but the window of opportunity was innovation and new mindset which today has led to a completely new governance strategy to build resilience
a crisis new partnerships actors locally transforming these into a key component of sustainable urban planning so crisis leading into opportunities
now what about the future well the future of course has one massive challenge which is feeding a world of nine billion people we need nothing less than a new green revolution and the planet boundaries shows that
has to go from a source of greenhouse gases to a sink it has to basically do this on current land we cannot expand anymore because it erodes the planetary boundaries we cannot continue consuming water
as we do today with twenty five percent of world rivers not even reaching the ocean and we need a transformation well interestingly and based on
my work and others in africa for example we've shown that even the most vulnerable small scale rainfall farming systems with innovations and supplementary irrigation to bridge dry spells and droughts
local action based partnerships and cross scale institutional innovations
where local actors together can deal with the global commons at a large scale but even on the
doing it on offshore wind systems all the way to the u s where you give the guaranteed price for investment in renewable energy but you can subsidize electricity to poor people
you get people out of poverty you solve the climate issue with regards to the energy sector while at the same time stimulating innovation
many many examples of transformative opportunities around the planet the key though in all of these the red thread is
the shift in mindset moving away from a situation where we are simply are pushing ourselves into a dark future where we
our future and we say what is the playing field on the planet what are the planetary boundaries within which we can safely operate and then backtrack
innovations within that but of course the drama is it clearly shows that incremental change is not an option so there is scientific evidence
say the harsh news that we are facing the largest transformative development since the industrialization in fact what we have to do over the next forty years
is much more dramatic and more exciting than what we did when we moved into the situation we're in today
now science indicates that yes we can achieve a prosperous future within the safe operating space if we move simultaneously
