what we are showing here is on this axis here i'm showing percent of infected adults and
on this axis i'm showing dollars per person in income
and the size of these bubbles the size of the bubbles here that shows
a sizable bubble there were quite many people infected in the united states and up there you see uganda they had almost five percent infected
and quite a big bubble in spite of being a small country then and they were probably the most infected country in the world now what
now you have understood the graph
and now in the next sixty seconds we will play the hiv epidemic in the world but first i have a new invention here
i have solidified the beam of the first we have the
rise in uganda and zimbabwe they went upwards like this in asia the first country to be heavily infected was thailand
they reached one to two percent then uganda started to turn back whereas zimbabwe skyrocketed and some years later south africa had a terrible rise of hiv frequency
look india got many infected but had a low level and almost the same happens here see uganda coming down zimbabwe coming down russia went to one percent
in the last two to three years we have reached a steady state of hiv epidemic in the world
twenty five years it took but steady state doesn't mean that things are getting better it's just that they have stopped getting worse and it has
now let me make a fast replay of botswana botswana upper middle income country in southern africa democratic government good economy and this is what happened
they started low they skyrocketed they peaked up there in two thousand and three
and now they are down but they are falling only slowly because in botswana with good economy and governance they can manage to treat people
and if people who are infected are treated they don't die of aids these percentages won 't come down because people can survive ten to twenty years
so there's some problem with these metrics now but the poorer countries in africa the low income countries down here there
the rates fall faster of the percentage infected because people still die in spite of pepfar the generous pepfar
all people are not reached by treatment and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries only sixty percent are left on treatment
only by stopping the transmission that the world will be able to deal with it doctorugs is too costly had we had the vaccine or when we will get the vaccine
something more effective but the drugs are very costly for the poor not the drug in itself but the treatment and the care which is needed around it so when we look at
one thing comes out very clearly you see the blue bubbles and people say hiv is very high in africa i would say hiv is very different in africa
the highest hiv rate in the world in african countries and yet you'll find
down here the same rate as united states and you'll find madagascar and you'll find a lot of african countries about as low as the rest of the world
this terrible simplification that there's one
africa and things go on in one way in africa we have to stop that it's not respectful and it's not very clever to think that
i had the fortune to live and work for a time in the united states i found out that salt lake city and san francisco were different
and so it is in africa it's a lot of difference so why is it so high is it war no it's not look here war torn congo is down there two three four percent
and this is peaceful zambia neighboring country fifteen percent and there's good studies of the refugees coming out of congo they have two three percent infected and peaceful zambia much higher
now studies clearly showing that the wars are terrible that rapes are terrible but this is not the driving force for the high levels in africa so
if you look at the macro level it seems more money more hiv
so this is the difference within tanzania and i can't avoid showing kenya look here at kenya i've split kenya in its provinces here it goes
see the difference within one african country it goes from very low level to very high level and most of the provinces in kenya is quite modest so what is it
the highly infected are four percent of all population and they hold fifty percent of the hiv infected hiv
all over the world look you have bubbles all over the world here brazil has many hiv infected arab countries not so much but iran is quite high they have heroin addiction and also prostitution in iran
india has many because they are many southeast asia and so on but there is one part of africa and the difficult thing is at the same time not to make a uniform statement about africa not to come to simple
ideas of why it is like this on one hand on the other hand because there is a scientific consensus
about this pattern now unaids have made good data available finally about the spread of hiv
it could be concurrency it could be some virus types it could be that there is
but and if you are in an unfavorable situation more sexually transmitted diseases it can be one in one hundred but
what we think is that it could be concurrency and what is concurrency in sweden we have no concurrency we have serial monogamy
vodka new year 's eve new partner for the spring vodka midsummer 's eve new partner for the fall vodka and it goes on like this you know and you collect a big number of exes and we have a terrible chlamydia
you can get this chart free we have uploaded unaids data on gapminder org and we hope that when we act on global problems in the future
we will not only have the heart we will not only have the money but we will also use the brain thank you very much
