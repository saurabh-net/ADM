excited to be given the opportunity to come and speak to you today about what i consider to be the biggest stunt on earth or perhaps not quite on earth a parachute jump from the very edge of
more about that a bit later on what i'd like to do first is take you through a very brief helicopter ride of stunts and the stunts industry in the movies and in television
and show you how technology has started to interface with the physical skills of the stunt performer in a way that makes the stunts bigger and actually makes them safer than they've ever been before
i've been a professional stunt man for thirteen years i'm a stunt coordinator and as well as perform stunts i often design them
during that time health and safety has become everything about my job it's critical now that when a car crash happens it isn't just the stunt person we make safe it's the crew we can't be killing camera men we can't be killing stunt men we can't be killing anybody
or any passerby so safety is everything but it wasn't always that way in the old days of the silent movies
lloyd here hanging famously from the clock hands a lot of these guys did their own stunts they were quite remarkable they had no safety no real technology what safety they had was very scant
this is the first stunt woman rosie venger an amazing woman you can see from the slide very very strong she really paved the way at a time when nobody was doing stunts let alone women
my favorite and a real hero of mine is yakima canutt yakima canutt really formed the
he worked with john wayne and most of those old punch ups you see in the westerns yakima was either there or he stunt coordinated this is a screen capture from stagecoach
highly dangerous but also you'll notice it doesn't look as though i'm wearing anything underneath the suit the firesuits of old the bulky suits the thick woolen suits have been replaced with modern materials
like nomex or more recently carbonex fantastic materials that enable us as stunt professionals to burn for longer look more spectacular and in pure safety
now we've got technology this thing is called an air ram it's a frightening piece of equipment for the novice stunt performer because it will break your legs very very quickly if you land on it wrong
said that it works with compressed nitrogen and that's in the up position when you step on it either by remote control or with the pressure of your foot it will fire you
not today car stunts is another area where technology and engineering advances have made life easier for us and safer we can do bigger car stunts than ever before now
like this not to hurt ourselves too much the picture in the bottom right hand corner there is of some crash test dummy work that i was doing showing how stunts work in different areas really
and testing breakaway signpost pillars a company makes a lattix pillar which is a network a lattice type pillar that collapses when it's hit the car on the left drove into the steel pillar
you can just see underneath the car there is a black rod on the floor by the wheel of the other car that's the piston that was fired out of the floor we can flip lorries coaches
buses anything over with a nitrogen cannon with enough power it's a great job really
i sort of forget how bizarre some of those conversations are the next thing that i'd like to show you is something that dunlop asked me to do earlier this year with our channel five 's fifth gear show a loop the loop biggest in the world only one person had ever done it before
now the stuntman solution to this in the old days would be let 's hit this as fast as possible sixty miles an hour let 's just go for it foot flat to the floor well you'd die if you did that
we went to cambridge university the other university and spoke to a doctor of mechanical engineering there a physicist who taught us that it had to be thirty seven miles an hour even then i caught seven g
and lost a bit of consciousness on the way in that's a long way to fall if you get it wrong that was just about right so again science helps us and with the engineering too the modifications to the car and the wheel
old fashioned stunts what's interesting about high falls is that although we use airbags and some airbags
so you don't slip off the side like you used to if you land a bit wrong so they're a much safer proposition just basically though it is a basic piece of equipment
it's a bouncy castle with slats in the side to allow the air to escape that's all it is a bouncy castle that's the only reason we do it see it's all fun this
and on the other side of the fence that physical art the physical performance of the stuntman has interfaced with the very
technology in i t and in software not the cardboard box but the green screen
this is a shot of terminator the movie two stunt guys doing what i consider to be a rather benign stunt it's thirty feet it's water it's very simple
with the green screen we can put any background in the world on it moving or still and i assure you nowadays you can't see the joint
this is a parachutist with another parachutist doing exactly the same thing completely in the safety of a studio and yet with the green screen we can have some moving image that a skydiver took and put in the sky moving and the clouds whizzing by
and this is a guinness world record attempt they asked me open their fiftieth anniversary show in two thousand and four and again technology meant that i could do the fastest abseil over one hundred meters and stop within a couple of feet of the ground
so that's the balloon big gas balloon it's that shape because the helium has to expand my balloon will expand to five hundred times and look like a big
the top these are the dummies being dropped from one hundred thousand feet and there is the camera that's strapped to them you can clearly see the curvature of the earth at that
i spoke with him on the phone a few months ago he 's a very humble and wonderful human being he sent me an email saying if you get this thing off the ground
i wish you all the best and he signed it happy landings which i thought was quite lovely he 's in his eighties and he lives in florida he 's a tremendous guy
this is him in a pressure suit now one of the challenges of going up to altitude is when you get to thirty thousand feet it's great isn't it when you get to thirty thousand feet
you can really only use oxygen above thirty thousand feet up to nearly fifty thousand feet you need pressure breathing which is where you're wearing a g suit this is him in his old rock and roll jeans there
pushing him in those turned up jeans you need a pressure suit you need a pressure breathing system with a g suit that squeezes you that helps you to breathe in and helps you to
above fifty thousand feet you need a space suit a pressure suit certainly at one hundred thousand feet no aircraft will fly
a jet engine it needs to be rocket powered or one of these things a great big gas balloon it took me a while it took me years to find the right balloon team to build the balloon that would do this job i found that team in america now
this is the step off he 's written on that thing the highest step in the world and what must that feel like i'm excited and i'm scared both at the same time in equal measures and this is the camera that he had on him as he tumbled
the little black dots are people it's hundreds of feet high it's enormous that's in new mexico that's the u s air force museum
this is morocco last year in the atlas mountains training in preparation for some high altitude jumps this is what the view is going to be like at ninety thousand feet for me
now you may think this is just a thrill seeking trip a pleasure ride just the world 's biggest stunt well there's a bit more to it than that
trying to find a space suit to do this has lead me to an area of technology that i never really expected when i set about doing this
a company in the states who make suits for nasa that's a current suit this was me last year with their chief engineer that suit would cost me about a million and a half dollars
and it weighs three hundred pounds and you can't skydive in it so i've been stuck for the past fifteen years i've been trying to find a space suit that would do this job or someone that will make one something revolutionary happened a little while ago
at the same facility that's the prototype of the parachute i've now had them custom make one the only one of its kind in the world and that's the only suit of its kind in the world it was made by a russian that's designed most of the suits of the past
eighteen years for the soviets he left the company because he saw as some other people in the space suit industry an emerging market for space suits for space tourists you know if you are in an aircraft at thirty thousand feet
and so we expect it's not much fun we expect and others expect that perhaps the faa the caa might say you need to put someone in a suit that's not inflated
i would like to bring costa on if he 's here to show you the only one of its kind in the world i was going to wear it but i thought i'd get costa to do it my lovely assistant
thank you he 's very hot thank you
the communication headset you'll see on lots of space suits it's a two layer suit nasa suits
this is a very lightweight suit it weighs about fifteen pounds it's next to nothing especially designed for me it's a working prototype i will use it for all the jumps would you just give us a little twirl please costa thank you very much
and it doesn't look far different when it's inflated as you can see from the picture down there i've even skydived in it in a wind tunnel which means that i can practice everything i need to practice in safety before i ever jump out of anything thanks very much
just about it from me the status of my mission at the moment is it still needs a major sponsor i'm confident that we'll find one
i think it's a great challenge and i hope that you will agree with me it is the greatest stunt on earth thank you very much
