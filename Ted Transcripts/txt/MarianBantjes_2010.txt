by reciting a oh beloved dentist
your rubber fingers in my mouth your voice so soft and muffled lower the mask dear dentist lower the mask
okay in this presentation i'm going to be putting the right side of your brains through a fairly serious workout you're going to see
lot of imagery and it's not always connected to what i'm talking about so i need you to kind of split your brains in half let the images flow over one side and listen to me on the other
so i am one of those people with a transformative personal story six years ago after twenty years in graphic design and typography
i changed the way i was working and the way most graphic designers work to pursue a more personal approach to my work
with only the humble attempt to simply make a living doing something that i loved
something weird happened i became bizarrely popular
my current work seems to resonate with people in a way that has so taken me by surprise that i still frequently wonder what in the hell is going on
and slowly coming to understand that the appeal of what i do may be connected to why i do it
so where my work as a graphic designer was to follow strategy my work
follows my heart and my interests with the guidance of my ego
to create work that is mutually beneficial to myself and a client now this is heresy in the design world the ego is not supposed to be involved in graphic design
but i find that for myself without exception the more i deal with the work as something of my own as something that is personal the more
qualities like does it bring joy
is there a sense of wonder and does it invoke curiosity
this is a scientific diagram by the way i don't have time to explain it but it has to do with dna and
so i have a particular imaginative approach to visual work
the things that interest me when i'm working are visual structure
surprise and anything that requires figuring things out so for this reason i'm particularly drawn to systems and patterns
and puzzling it is i started by creating a series of tiling units and these tiling units i designed specifically so that they would contain parts of letter forms within their shapes
so that i could then join those pieces together to create letters and then words within the abstract patterning
so here 's the word puzzle again
and here it is with the abstract surrounding and as you can see it's extremely difficult to read but all
to do is fill certain areas of those letter forms and i can bring those words out of the background pattern
and this way working with the art director i'm able to bring it to just the right point that it's puzzling for the audience they can figure out that there's something they have to read but it's not impossible for them to read
so ultimately my goal is to create something unexpected
to this end i have worked in sugar for stefan sagmeister three time ted speaker and this
eating cereal for breakfast all of my life and for that same amount of time i've been spilling sugar on the table and just kind of playing with it with my fingers
and eventually i used this technique to create a piece of artwork and then i used it again to create six pieces for stefan 's book things in my life i've learned so far
and these were created without sketches just freehand
by putting the sugar down on a white surface and then manipulating it to get the words and designs out of it
give to their parents which is in itself a form of honor
this what you can do with some household tinfoil
okay well it's what i can do with some i'm very
wonder in design as an impetus to
to say i wonder is to say i question i ask and to experience wonder is to experience
so i'm currently working on a book which plays with both senses of the word as i explore some of my own ideas and inquiries in rather peacock like
the world is full of wonder but the world of graphic design for the most part is not
so i'm using my own writings as a kind of testing ground for a book that has an interdependency between word and image as a kind of
force i think that one of the things that religions got right was the use of visual wonder to deliver a message
i think this true marriage of art and information is woefully underused in adult literature and i'm mystified as to why visual wealth is not more commonly used to enhance intellectual wealth
when we look at works like this we tend to associate them with children 's literature there's an implication
that ornamental graphics detract from the seriousness of the content but i really hope to have the opportunity to change that perception
but i'm nearly done for some reason i thought it would be a good idea to put an intermission
and this is it just to give you and me a
i do these valentines i've been sending out valentines on a fairly large scale since two thousand and five these are my valentines from two thousand and five and two thousand and six
and i started by doing just a single image like this and sending them out to each person but in
i got the cockamamie idea to hand draw each valentine for everyone on my mailing
i reduced my mailing list to one hundred and fifty people
and i drew each person their own unique valentine and put their name on it and numbered it and signed it and sent it out believe it or not i devised this as a time saving
i was very busy in the beginning of that year and i didn't know when i was going to find time to design and print a single valentine and i thought i could kind of do this piecemeal as i was traveling
last year i took a more conceptual approach to the valentine i had this idea that i wanted people to receive a kind of mysterious love letter like a found fragment in their mailbox
i wanted it to be something that was not addressed to them or signed by me something that caused them to wonder what on earth this thing
and i specifically wrote four pages that don't connect there were four different versions of this and i
so that they begin in the middle of a sentence end in the middle of a sentence and they're on the one hand universal so i
been a love letter to them and i'm just going to read one of them to you
you 've never really been sure of this but i can assure you that this quirk you're so self conscious of is intensely endearing
just please accept that this piece of you escapes with your smile and those of us who notice are happy to catch it in passing
time spent with you is like chasing and catching small birds but without the scratches and bird shit
that is to say your thoughts and words flit and dart disconcertedly elusive at times but when caught and examined
such a wonder such a delightful reward there's no passing time with you only collecting the collecting of moments with the hope for preservation and at the same time release
and it's so crushing to think that you may not know how truly wonderful you are how inspiring and delightful and really truly the most completely
so valentine 's day is coming up in a couple of days and these are currently arriving in mailboxes all around the world this year i got what i really have to say is a rather brilliant to laser cut my
used christmas cards so i solicited friends to send me their used christmas cards and
i made five hundred of these each one of them is completely different i'm just really really thrilled with them i don't have that much else to say but
they turned out really well
i do spend a lot of time on my work and one of the things that i've been thinking about recently is what is worth while what is it that's worth spending my time on and my life on in this way
and yes sometimes i'm swayed by money but ultimately i don't consider that a worthy goal
the conditions i work under and the audience that i'm able to reach
so i might ask who is it for
what does it say and what does it do
you know i have to tell you it's really
difficult for someone like me to come up on stage at this conference with these and
it's very very common for designers and people in the visual arts to feel that we're not contributing enough
or worse that all we're doing is contributing to landfill
here i am i'm showing you some
but i've come to believe that truly imaginative visual work
is extremely important in society
work that is interesting unusual intriguing work that maybe opens up that sense of inquiry in the
that i'm seeding the imagination of the populace
because inspiration is cross pollinating
a philanthropist or a babysitter
and this isn't something that you can quantify or track or measure and we tend to undervalue things in society that we can't measure
but i really believe that a fully operating rich society needs these seeds coming from all directions and all disciplines
in order to keep the gears of inspiration and imagination flowing and cycling and growing
so that's why i do what i do
and why i spend so much time and effort on it
and why i work in the commercial public sphere as opposed to the isolated private sphere of fine art
actually really feel that it's worthwhile to spend my valuable and limited time on this earth in this way and i thank you for allowing me to show it to you by reciting a
