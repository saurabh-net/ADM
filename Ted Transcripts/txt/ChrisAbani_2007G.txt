i just heard the best joke about bond emeruwa i was having lunch with him just a few minutes ago and a nigerian journalist comes and this will only make sense if you've ever watched a james bond movie
and a nigerian journalist comes up to him and goes aha we meet again so
here mostly because i'm nigerian and if you leave me alone i'll talk for like two hours but i just want to say good afternoon good evening
an incredible few days it's downhill from now on i wanted to thank emeka and chris but also most importantly all the invisible people behind here that you just see flitting around the whole place
that have made sort of this space for such a diverse and robust conversation it's really amazing
been in the audience i'm a writer and i've been watching people with the slide shows and scientists and bankers and i've been feeling a bit like a gangsta rapper at a bar mitzvah
what have i got to say about all this and i was watching jane yesterday and i thought it was really great and i was watching those incredible slides of the
chimpanzees and i thought wow what if a chimpanzee could talk you know what would it say my first thought was well you know there's george bush
but then i thought but why be rude to chimpanzees i guess there goes my green card
about news stories about africa we're not really talking about african narratives and it's important to make a distinction because if the news is anything to go by
forty percent of americans can't either can't afford health insurance or have the most inadequate health insurance and have a president who despite
the protest of millions of his citizens even his own congress continues to prosecute a senseless war so if news is anything to go by the us is right there with zimbabwe right which
the truth is americans everything we know about america everything americans come to know about being american isn't from the news it we i lived there we don't go home at the end of the
think well i really know who i am now because the wall street journal says that the stock exchange closed at this many points what we know about how to be who we are
to remember because you know in africa the complicated questions we want to ask about what all of this means has been asked from the rock paintings of the san people
through the sundiata epics of mali to modern contemporary literature if you want to know about africa read our literature and not just things fall apart because that would be like saying i 've read gone with the wind and so i know everything about america
very important there's a poem by jack gilbert called the forgotten dialect of the heart he says
when the sumerian tablets were first translated they were thought to be business records but what if they were poems and
my love is like twelve ethiopian goats standing still in the morning light
shiploads of thuja are what my body wants to say to your body giraffes are this desire in the
this is important it's important because misreading is really the chance for complication and opportunity the first igbo bible
was translated from english in about the eighteen hundreds by bishop crowther who was a yoruba and it's important to know igbo is a tonal language
and so they'll say the word igwe and igwe same spelling one means sky or heaven and one means bicycle
so god is in heaven surrounded by his angels was
this is good because language complicates things
you know we often think that language mirrors the world in which we live and i find that's not true the language actually makes the world in which we live
everything all of this is story and it's important to remember that because if we don 't then we become
to remember that because otherwise ten years from now we'll be back here trying to tell this story again so
what it says to me then is that it's not really the problem isn't really the stories that are being told or which stories are being told
the problem really is the terms of humanity that we're willing to bring to complicate every story and that's really what it's all about
a nigerian joke well it's just a joke anyway
so there's tom dick and harry and they're working construction and tom opens up his lunch box and there's rice in it and he goes on this rant about twenty years my wife has been packing rice for lunch if she goes it again tomorrow i'm gonna throw myself off this building and kill myself
and dick and harry repeat this the next day tom opens his lunchbox there's rice so he throws himself off and kills himself and tom dick and harry follow and now the inquest you know
tom 's wife and dick 's wife are distraught they wished they'd not packed rice but harry 's wife is confused because she said you know harry had been packing his own lunch for twenty years
this seemingly innocent joke when i heard it as a child in nigeria was told about igbo yoruba and hausa with the hausa being harry
so what seems like an eccentric if tragic joke about harry becomes a way to spread ethnic hatred
my father was educated in cork in the university of cork in the fifties in fact every time i read in ireland people get me all mistaken and they say oh this is chris o 'barney from cork
was also in oxford in the fifties and he had growing up as a child in nigeria my father used to say to me you must never eat or drink in a yoruba person 's house
because they will poison you
it makes sense now when i think about it because if you'd known my father you would 've wanted to poison him
the beginning of the biafran nigerian civil war and
the war ended after three years and i was growing up in school and the federal government didn't want us taught about the history of the war because they thought it probably would make us
so huddled around books with photographs of people in auschwitz i learned the melancholic history of my people through the melancholic history of another people i mean picture this really picture this a
teaching jewish holocaust history to young igbo children story is powerful story is fluid and it belongs to nobody
and it should come as no surprise that my first novel at sixteen was about neo nazis taking over nigeria to institute the fourth reich makes perfect sense
to blow up strategic targets and take over the country and they were foiled by a nigerian james bond called coyote williams and a jewish
but also the book was launched in time for me to be accused of constructing the blueprint for a foiled coup attempt so at eighteen i was bonded off to prison in nigeria
i grew up very privileged and it's important to talk about privilege because we don't talk about it here a lot of us are very privileged i grew up servants cars televisions all that stuff
my story of nigeria growing up was very different from the story i encountered in prison and i had no language for it i was completely terrified completely broken and
kept trying to find a new language a new way to make sense of all of this six months after that with no explanation they let me go now for those of you who have seen me at the buffet tables know that it was because it was costing them too much to feed
but i mean i grew up with this incredible privilege and not just me millions of nigerians grew up with books and libraries in fact we were talking last night about how
all of the steamy novels of harold robbins had done more for sex education of horny teenage boys in africa than any sex education programs ever
all of those are gone we are squandering the most valuable resource we have on this continent the valuable resource of the imagination
in the film sometimes in april by raoul peck idris elba is poised in a scene with his machete raised and he 's being forced by a crowd to chop up his best friend
chop him up shut him up and as idris moves fraser screams stop
it's not the look of horror and terror on fraser 's face that stops idris or us it's the
it's one that says don 't do this and i'm not saying this to save myself although this would be nice i'm doing it to save you
because if you do this you will be lost
to be so afraid that you're standing in the face of a death you can't escape and that you're soiling yourself and crying but to say in that moment as fraser says to idris tell my girlfriend i love
in that moment fraser says
i am lost already but not you not you this is a redemption we can all aspire to
as a writer i find that african writers have always been the curators of our humanity on this continent
the question is how do i balance narratives that are wonderful with narratives
of wounds and self loathing and this is the difficulty that i face i am trying to move beyond political rhetoric to a place of ethical questioning i am asking us to balance the idea of our complete vulnerability
with the complete notion of transformation or what is possible as a young middle class nigerian activist i launched myself along with a whole generation of us into the campaign to stop the government and i asked millions of people
without questioning my right to do so to go up against the government and i watched them being locked up in prison and tear gassed i justified it and i said this is the cost of revolution have i not myself been imprisoned have i not myself been beaten righteous righteous war excuse
have been human six days
but only sometimes but this is a good thing it's
you don't know anything about africa you're all idiots and so they said tell me about africa professor abani so i went to google earth and learned about africa
and the truth be told this is it isn't it there are no essential africans and most of us are as completely ignorant as everyone else about the continent we come from and yet we want to make profound statements about it i want to believe
that we can be agnostic about this that we can rise above all of this when i was ten i read james baldwin 's another country and that book broke me
not because i was encountering homosexual sex and love for the first time but because the way james wrote about it made it impossible for me to attach otherness to it here jimmy said here is love all of it
the fact that it happens in another country takes you quite by surprise my friend ronald gottesman says there are three kinds of people in the world those who can count and those
he also says that the cause of all our trouble is the belief in an essential pure identity religious ethnic historical
i want to leave you with a poem by yusef komunyakaa that speaks to transformation it's called ode to the doctorum and i'll try and read it the way yusef would be proud to hear it read gazelle i killed you
for how easy it is to be nailed to a board weathered raw as white butcher
paper last night i heard my daughter praying for the meat here at my feet
you know it wasn't anger that made me stop my heart till the hammer fell weeks ago you broke me as a woman once shattered me into a song beneath
before you slouched into that grassy hush and now i'm tightening lashes shaping hide as if around a ribcage shaped like five
ghosts cannot slip back inside the body 's drum you've been seasoned by wind dusk and sunlight pressure can make everything whole again
tacked into the ebony wood your face has been carved five times i have to drive trouble in the hills
trouble in the valley and trouble by the river too there is no palm wine fish salt kadoom kadoom kadoom
kadoom kadoom kadoom now i have beaten
a song back into you rise and walk away like a panther thank
