want to talk a little bit today about labor and work
when we think about how people work
that all people care about is money and the moment we give people money we can direct them to work one way we can direct them to work another way this is why we give bonuses to bankers and pay in all kinds of ways and we really have this incredibly simplistic view of why people work and what the labor market looks like
at the same time if you think about it there 's all kinds of strange behaviors in the world around us think about something like mountaineering and mountain climbing if you read books of people who climb mountains difficult mountains do you think that those books are full of moments of joy and happiness
no they are full of misery in fact it 's all about frostbite and difficulty to walk and difficulty of breathing cold challenging circumstances and if people were just trying to be happy the moment they would get to the top they would say this was a terrible mistake i 'll never do it again
it suggests that we care about the fight about the challenge it suggests that there 's all kinds of other things that motivate us
to work or behave in all kinds of ways and for me personally i started thinking about this after a student came to visit me this was a student that was one of my students a few years earlier
and he came one day back to campus and he told me the following story
he said that for more than two weeks he was working on a powerpoint presentation he was working in a big bank this was in preparation for a merger and acquisition and he was working very hard on this presentation graphs tables information he stayed late at night every day
and the day before it was due he sent his powerpoint presentation to his boss
and his boss wrote him back and said
nice presentation but the merger is canceled and the guy was deeply depressed now at the moment when he was working he was actually quite happy
every night he was enjoying his work he was staying late he was perfecting this powerpoint presentation but knowing that nobody would ever watch that
and to start with we created a little experiment
in which we gave people legos
and we asked them to build with legos and for some people
we gave them legos and we said hey would you like to build this bionicle for three dollars we 'll pay you three dollars for it
this was what we called the meaningful condition people built one bionicle after another after they finished every one of them we put them under the table and we told them that at the end of the experiment we will take all these bionicles we will disassemble them we will put them back in the boxes and we will use it for the next
inspired by david my student and this other condition we called the sisyphic condition and if you remember the story about sisyphus sisyphus was punished by the gods to push
the same rock up a hill and when he almost got to the end the rock would roll over and he would have to start again
and you can think about this as the essence of doing futile work you can imagine that if he pushed the rock on different hills at least he would have some sense of progress
also if you look at prison movies sometimes the way that the guards torture the prisoners is to get them to dig a hole
and when the prisoner is finished they ask him to fill the hole back up and then dig again there 's something about this cyclical version of doing something over and over and over that seems to be particularly demotivating
so in the second condition of this experiment that 's exactly what we did we asked people
would you like to build one bionicle for three dollars and if they said yes they built it
we gave them the one that they built and we broke so this was an endless cycle of them building and us destroying in front of their eyes
now what happens when you compare these two conditions
the first thing that happened was that people built many more bionicles they built eleven versus seven in the meaningful condition versus the sisyphus condition
and by the way we should point out that this was not a big meaning people were not curing cancer or building bridges
people were building bionicles for a few cents and not only that everybody knew that the bionicles would be destroyed quite soon so there was not a real opportunity for big meaning but even the small meaning made a difference
now we had another version of this experiment in this other version of the experiment we didn 't put people in this situation we just described to them the situation much as i am describing to you now and we asked them to predict what the result would be what happened
people predicted the right direction but not the right magnitude people who were just given the description of the experiment
if you think about it there are some people who love legos and some people who don 't
and you would speculate that the people who love legos will build more legos even for less money because after all they get more internal joy from it
and the people who love legos less will build less legos because the enjoyment that they derive from it is lower and that 's actually what we found in the meaningful condition there was a very nice correlation between love of lego and the amount of legos people built
what happened in the sisyphic condition
in that condition the correlation was zero there was no relationship between the love of lego and how much people built which suggests to me that with this manipulation of breaking things in front of people 's eyes we basically crushed any joy that they could get out of this activity we basically eliminated it
i can 't tell you who they were but they were a big company in seattle and this was a group within this software company that was put in a different building and they asked them to innovate and create the next big product for this company
and the week before i showed up the ceo of this big software company went to that group two hundred engineers and canceled the project
and i stood there in front of two hundred of the most depressed people i 've ever talked to and i described to them some of these lego experiments and they said they felt like they had just been through that experiment
and i asked them i said how many of you now show up to work later than you used to
and then i asked them i said what could the ceo have done to make you not as depressed and they came up with all kinds of ideas they said the ceo could have asked them
to present to the whole company about their journey over the last two years and what they decided to do he could have asked them to think about which aspect of their technology could fit with other parts of the organization he could have asked them to build some prototypes some next generation prototypes and seen how they would work
and i think the ceo basically did not understand the importance of meaning if the ceo just like our participants thought the essence of meaning is unimportant then he wouldn 't care
and he would tell them at the moment i directed you in this way and now that i am directing you in this way everything will be okay but if you understood how important meaning is then you would figure out that it 's actually important to spend some time energy and effort in getting people to care more about what they 're doing
and we had three conditions in the first condition people wrote their name on the sheet
found all the pairs of letters gave it to the experimenter the experimenter would look at it scan it from top to bottom say uh huh and put it on the pile next to them
in the second condition people did not write their name on it the experimenter looked at it took the sheet of paper did not look at it did not scan it and simply put it on the pile of pages so you take a piece you just put it on the side
and in the third condition the experimenter got the sheet of paper and directly put it into a shredder
what happened in those three conditions
in this plot i 'm showing you at what pay rate people stopped so low numbers mean that people worked harder they worked for much longer in the acknowledged condition people worked all the way down to fifteen cents at fifteen cents per page they basically stopped these efforts
in the shredder condition it was twice as much thirty cents per sheet and this is basically the result we had before you shred people 's efforts output you get them not to be as happy with what they 're doing but i should point out by the way
that in the shredder condition people could have cheated they could have done not so good work because they realized that people were just shredding it
so maybe the first sheet you would do good work but then you see nobody is really testing it so you would do more and more and more so in fact in the shredder condition people could have submitted more work and gotten more money and put less effort into it
but what about the ignored condition would the ignored condition be more like the acknowledged or more like the shredder or somewhere in the middle it turns out it was almost like the shredder now there 's good news and bad news here
the bad news is that ignoring the performance of people is almost as bad as shredding their effort in front of their eyes
ignoring gets you a whole way out there the good news is that by simply looking at something that somebody has done scanning it and saying uh huh that seems to be quite sufficient to dramatically improve people 's motivations
so the good news is that adding motivation doesn 't seem to be so difficult the bad news is that eliminating motivations seems to be incredibly easy and if we don 't think about it carefully we might overdo it
so this is all in terms of negative motivation or eliminating negative motivation
i don 't know about you but every time i assemble one of those it takes me much longer it 's much more effortful it 's much more confusing i put things in the wrong way
i can 't say enjoy those pieces
i can 't say i enjoy the process
but when i finish it i seem to like those ikea pieces of furniture more than i like other ones
but it turns out they were very unpopular people did not want them and they thought about all kinds of reasons for that maybe the taste was not good no the taste was great what they figured out was that there was not enough effort involved
so what did they do
they took the eggs and the milk out of the powder
now i think a little bit like the ikea effect by getting people to work harder they actually got them to love what they 're doing to a higher degree
so how do we look at this question experimentally we asked people to build some origami we gave them instructions on how to create origami and we gave them a sheet of paper and these were all novices and they built something that was really quite ugly
nothing like a frog or a crane
but then we told them we said look this origami really belongs to us you worked for us but i 'll tell you what we 'll sell it to you how much do you want to pay for it and we measured how much they were willing to pay for it and we had two types of people we had the people who built it
or do you think i love this origami and everybody else will love it as well which one of those two is correct turns out the builders not only loved the origami more they thought that everybody would see the world in their view they thought everybody else would love it more as well
in the next version we tried to do the ikea effect we tried to make it more difficult so for some people we gave the same task for some people we made it harder by hiding the instructions at the top of the sheet we had little diagrams of how do you fold origami for some people we just eliminated that
so now this was tougher
what happened well in an objective way the origami now was uglier
it was more difficult now when we looked at the easy origami we saw the same thing builders loved it more evaluators loved it less when you looked at the hard instructions the effect was
larger why because now the builders loved it even more
they loved it even less because in reality it was even uglier than the first version
of course this tells you something about how we evaluate things now think about kids
imagine i asked you how much would you sell your kids for
your memories and associations and so on most people would say for a lot a lot of money
and when you were about to leave the parents said hey by the way just before you leave if you 're interested they 're for sale
most people say not that much
and this is because our kids are so valuable not just because of who they are but because of us because they are so connected to us and because of the time and connection and by the way if you think that ikea instructions are not good think about the instructions that come with kids those are really tough
we don 't see that other people don 't see things our way
let me say one last comment
if you think about adam smith versus karl marx
adam smith had the very important
notion of efficiency he gave an example of a pin factory
he said pins have twelve different steps and if one person does all twelve steps production is very low but if you get one person to do step one and one person to do step two and step three and so on
production can increase tremendously and indeed this is a great example and the reason for the industrial revolution and efficiency
karl marx on the other hand said that the alienation of labor is incredibly important in how people think about the connection to what they are doing and if you make all twelve steps you care about the pin but if you make one step every time maybe you don 't care as much
and i think that in the industrial revolution adam smith was more correct than karl marx
but the reality is that we 've switched
and now we 're in the knowledge economy
to decide on their own about how much effort attention caring how connected they feel to it are they thinking about labor on the way to work and in the shower and so on all of a sudden
so when we think about labor we usually think about motivation and payment as the same thing but the reality is that we should probably add all kinds of things to it meaning creation challenges ownership identity pride etc
