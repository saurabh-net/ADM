's my student he 's about my age and he 's in san quentin state prison when tony was sixteen years old one day one moment
one day one moment let 's do this
and those three words tony 's going to remember because the next thing he knows he hears the pop there 's the punk on the ground puddle of blood and that 's felony murder twenty five to life parole at fifty if you 're lucky and tony 's not feeling very lucky
so when we meet in my philosophy class in his prison and i say in this class we will discuss the foundations of ethics tony interrupts me
what are you going to teach me about right and wrong
i know what is wrong i have done wrong i am told every day by every face i see every wall i face that i am wrong
if i ever get out of here there will always be a mark by my name i 'm a convict i am branded wrong what are you going to tell me about right and wrong
so i say to tony sorry
but it 's worse than you think you think you know right and wrong
how do we know that it 's wrong maybe you and i disagree maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong maybe it 's you maybe it 's me but we 're not here to trade opinions everyone 's got an opinion we are here for knowledge our enemy is thoughtlessness this is philosophy
and something changes for tony
could be i 'm wrong i 'm tired of being wrong i want to know what is wrong i want to know what i know
what tony sees in that moment is the project of philosophy
the project that begins in wonder what kant called admiration and awe at the starry sky above and the moral law within what can creatures like us know of such things
it is the project that always takes us back to the condition of existence what heidegger called the always already there it is the project of questioning what we believe and why we believe it what socrates called the examined life socrates a man wise enough to know that he knows nothing socrates died in prison
doing his homework he learns his whys and wherefores his causes and correlations his logic his fallacies turns out tony 's got the philosophy muscle his body is in prison but his mind is
free tony learns about the ontologically promiscuous the epistemologically anxious the ethically dubious the metaphysically ridiculous that 's plato descartes nietzsche and bill clinton
so when he gives me his final paper in which he argues that the categorical imperative is perhaps too uncompromising to deal with the conflict that affects our everyday and challenges me to tell him whether therefore we are condemned to moral failure i say
i don 't know let us think about that because in that moment there 's no mark by tony 's name it 's just the two of us standing there it is not professor and convict it is just two minds ready to do philosophy and i say to tony let 's do this
