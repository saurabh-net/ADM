i went to spain a few months ago
the best foie gras of my life
because what i saw i'm convinced is
ridiculous right foie gras and the future of cooking there's not a food today that's more maligned than
really it happened here in san francisco to i'm not saying that
i'm not saying that a rationale
for being opposed to foie gras
the reasons usually just boil down to the gavage which is the force feeding basically you take a goose or a duck and you
is that it's so freakin delicious
you can also bike the tour de france without steroids
not a lot of people are doing it and for good reason so several months ago
a friend of mine sent me this link to this guy
gorge on food to prepare for the harsh realities of winter
and the rest of the year they're free to roam around eduardo 's
land and eat what they want so no gavage no force feeding no factory like conditions no cruelty
and it's shockingly not a new idea his great granddad started when eduardo
the coveted french gastronomic prize
as he said to me that really pissed the french off
all over the papers i read about
spanish chef accused and the french accused him spanish chef accused
of cheating the accused him of paying off the judges
huge scandal for a few weeks couldn't find a shred of evidence
look at the guy he doesn't look like a guy who 's paying off french judges for his
down and very soon afterward new controversy
he 's lying and should be disqualified as funny as it sounds articulating it now and reading about it actually if
that is until i went to
i saw first hand a system that is incredibly complex and then at the same time like
and he said to me really from the first moment my life 's work
is to give the geese what they want
that about fifty times in the
i'm just here to give the geese what they want actually when i showed up he was lying down with the geese with
you know i thought like i'm speaking to you now right i figured it out
doing this and amazingly the geese who were on the other side of the paddock when i was around get the hell away from this kid when i lowered my voice they all came right up to us
right up to us like right up to here right along the fence line and fence line was amazing in itself the fence like this conception of fence that we have it's totally backward with him the electricity on this fiberglass fence
is only on the outside
he rewired it he invented it i've never seen it fence in animals you
he electrifies only the outside
why because he said to me that he felt like the geese and he proved this actually not just
a conceit he proved this the geese felt manipulated when they were
on the outside so it would protect them against coyotes and other predators
now what happened they ate and he showed me on a chart how they ate about twenty percent more
feed to feed their livers
this extra hard land into a tasting menu
upgrades the life for these geese and they are allowed to take whatever they want another irony the double irony is that on the figs and the olives eduardo can make more money selling those than he can on the foie gras he doesn't care
they get what they want they leave the rest for me and i sell
how i've been trained you want to look and see what good foie gras is it's got to be bright yellow it's the indication that
because he doesn't force feed because he doesn't
to seed he took the seeds he planted it on his thirty acres all around and the geese love the lupin bush not for the bush but for the seeds and when they eat the seeds their foie gras turns yellow radioactive yellow bright yellow
of the highest quality foie gras yellow i've ever seen
for real is he making some
like you know because he seemed to have answer for everything and it was always nature it was never him and i was like
into working with his landscape so it's like here i am i'm on the fence about this guy but increasingly
eating up his every word and we're sitting there and i hear
they're called back and back and back and then they circle around
and his geese are calling up now to the wild geese and the wild geese are calling down and it's getting louder and louder and they circle and circle and they land no way no way
i look at eduardo who 's near tears looking at this
and i say you 're telling me that your geese are calling to the wild geese to say come for a visit and he says the dna of a
i said that i said isn 't that what they're put on this earth for to fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm
their dna is to find the conditions that are conducive to life to happiness
they find it here the don't need anything more
brilliant right imagine i don't know imagine a hog farm in like north carolina and a wild pig comes
got to taste it before i left
took me to his neighborhood restaurant and he served me some of his
it was incredible and the problem with saying that of course is that you know at this point it risks hyperbole really easily
and i'd like to make a metaphor but i don't have one really i was drinking this guy 's kool aid so much he could have served me goose feathers and i would have been like this guy 's a genius
really in love with him at this point but it truly was the best foie gras of my life so much so that i don't think i had ever really had foie gras until that moment
but this was transformative really transformative and i say to you taste experience with
a lot of honesty and you could taste
herbs you could taste spices and i kept i said you know i swear to god i tasted star
when he harvests the foie gras he sticks them in this jar
pepper no oil no spices
need salt and pepper and he doesn't need spices because he 's got this potpourri of herbs and flavors
that his geese love to gorge on adria the
how come you don't give him this
how come no one 's really heard of you
and it may be because of the wine or it may be because of my excitement he answered me directly and he said they create
a dish where all the vectors point at us
and as he said i think
it's a gift from god
with god saying you've done good work simple
i flew home i'm on the flight with my little black book and i took you know pages and pages of notes about it i really was moved and in the corner of one of these one my notes
he said i think it's an insult to history
and i wrote insult to history
on the plane and i'm just tearing my hair out it's like why didn't i follow up on that what the hell does that
some research when i got back jews invented foie gras
jews invented foie gras by accident
they were looking for an alternative to schmaltz
and he didn't want it just in the fall he wanted it all year round and he demanded that the jews supply enough for everyone
and the jews fearing for their life had to come up with an ingenious idea or at least in a great moment
of fear for their lives
liver and the good stuff they kept for themselves supposedly anyway i believe that one
and if you think about it mega farms feed lots
whether we're talking about beef cattle
or we're talking about chickens
or we're talking about broccoli
whatever it is it's a mindset that is reminiscent of general motors it's rooted in extraction
take more sell more waste more
we need now to adopt
a new conception of agriculture
really new one in which we stop treating
the planet as if it were some kind of business in liquidation
and stop degrading resources under the guise of cheap food
we can start by looking to farmers
like eduardo farmers that rely on nature for solutions for answers
rather than imposing solutions on nature
listening as janine benyus one of my favorite writers and thinkers about this topics says listening to nature 's operating instructions
the great thing for chefs the great blessing for chefs
is that the most ecological choice for food
also the most ethical choice for food whether we're talking about brussel sprouts or foie gras
and it's also almost always and i haven't found an example otherwise but almost always
