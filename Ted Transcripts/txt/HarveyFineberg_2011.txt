you like to be better than you are
suppose i said that with just a few changes in your genes you could get a better memory more precise more accurate and quicker or maybe you 'd like to be more fit stronger with more stamina would you like to be more attractive and self confident
how about living longer with good health
or perhaps you 're one of those who 's always yearned for more creativity which one would you like the most
how many would opt for memory
quite a few more how about fitness
who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid take out your personal communications device i give you permission and perhaps take another look at kathryn schultz 's book on being wrong because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever
biological evolution consider this is it just about the past or is it about the future does it apply to others or does it apply to us this is another look at the tree of life in this picture
i 've put a bush with a center branching out in all directions because if you look at the edges of the tree of life every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms it has survived it has demonstrated
we branch off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago in the interval there have been perhaps twenty or twenty five different species of hominids
some have come and gone we have been here for about one hundred and thirty thousand years it may seem like we 're quite remote from other parts of this tree of life but actually for the most part
the basic machinery of our cells is pretty much the same do you realize
that we can take advantage and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin used to treat diabetics this is not like human insulin this is the same protein that is chemically indistinguishable from what comes out of your pancreas
and speaking of bacteria do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body maybe ten times more i mean think of it when antonio damasio asks about your self image do you think about the bacteria
our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria it 's warm it 's dark it 's moist it 's very cozy and you 're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part it 's really like an easy street for bacteria with the occasional
interruption of the unintended forced rush to the exit but otherwise
you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria just as they are essential to your life they help in the digestion
but what will come in the future are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species or are we destined to become something different something perhaps even better adapted to the environment
now let 's take a step back in time to the big bang fourteen billion years ago
the earth the solar system about four and a half billion years the first signs of proto life maybe three to four billion years ago on earth the first multi celled organisms perhaps as much as eight hundred or a billion years ago
and then the human species finally emerging
in the last one hundred and thirty thousand years in this vast unfinished symphony of the universe life on earth is like a brief measure the animal kingdom like a single measure and human life
and human life a small grace
fascinated by the elegance and beauty
of biology i became enamored of the power of evolution and i realized something very fundamental in most
of the existence of life in single celled organisms each cell simply divides and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells but at the time multi celled organisms come online
things start to change sexual reproduction enters the picture and very importantly with the introduction of sexual reproduction that passes on the genome the rest of the body becomes expendable in fact you could say
that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction
now i have to confess when i was a college undergraduate i thought okay sex death sex death death for sex it seemed pretty reasonable at the time
as a physician that i was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of
evolution not necessarily contradictory just different i was trying to preserve the body i wanted to keep us healthy i wanted to restore health from disease i wanted us to live long and healthy lives evolution is all about passing on the genome
to the next generation adapting and surviving through generation after generation from an evolutionary point of view you and i are like the booster rockets designed to send the genetic payload into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea
i think we would all understand the sentiment that woody allen expressed when he said i don 't
that is the sole test of survival and success at the bottom of the ocean bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce if fish were there sous vide cooked fish nevertheless have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them
so what does this mean
as we look back at what has happened in evolution and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase
i would say that there are a number of possibilities the first is that
we will not evolve we have reached a kind of equipoise and the reasoning behind that would be first we
have through medicine managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population and secondly we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it and by the way
immigrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can 't any longer have the isolation
that is necessary for evolution to take place
and as far as isolation goes when we as a species do colonize distant planets there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way but there 's a third possibility
an enticing intriguing and frightening possibility i call it neo evolution the new evolution that is not simply natural but guided and chosen by us
as individuals in the choices
how could it be possible that we would do this consider first the reality that people today in some cultures are making choices about their offspring
they 're in some cultures choosing to have more males than females it 's not necessarily good for the society but it 's what the individual and the family are choosing
think also if it were possible
to make the genetic adjustments that would cure or prevent diseases what if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer 's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke
wouldn 't you want to make those changes in your genes if we look ahead these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible
the human genome project started in one thousand nine hundred and ninety and it took thirteen years it cost two point seven billion dollars
the year after it was finished in two thousand and four you could do the same job for twenty million dollars in three to four months
today you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about twenty thousand dollars and in the space of about a week it won 't be very long before the reality will be the one thousand dollar human genome and it will be increasingly available for everyone just a week ago
the national academy of engineering awarded its draper prize to francis arnold and willem stemmer two scientists who independently developed techniques
to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way what frances arnold calls directed evolution
a couple of years ago the lasker prize was awarded to the scientist shinya yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult
skin cell a fibroblast and by manipulating just four genes he induced that cell to revert to a pluripotential stem cell
a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body these changes are coming the same technology that has
produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves but induce immunity against other viruses believe it or not there 's an experimental trial going on with vaccine against influenza that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant
can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco these are all reality today and in the future will be evermore possible imagine then just
two other little changes you can change the cells in your body but what if you could change the cells in your offspring what if you could change the sperm and the ova or change the newly fertilized egg and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life
eliminate the diabetes eliminate the hemophilia reduce the risk of cancer who doesn 't want healthier children
and then that same analytic technology that same engine of science that can produce
the changes to prevent disease
will also enable us to adopt super
why not have the quick twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer why not live longer
these will be irresistible and when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we want
we will have converted old style evolution into neo evolution we 'll take a process that normally might require one hundred thousand years and we can compress it down to a thousand years and maybe even in the next one hundred years these are choices
that your grandchildren or their grandchildren are going to have before them
will we use these choices to make a society that is better that is more successful that is kinder or will we selectively choose different attributes
that we want for some of us and not for others of us will we make a society that is
more boring and more uniform or more robust and more versatile these are the kinds of questions
that we will have to face and most profoundly of all will we ever be able to develop the wisdom to us thank you
