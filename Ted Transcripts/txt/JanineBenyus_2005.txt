it is a thrill to be here at a conference that's devoted to inspired by nature you can imagine
and i'm also thrilled to be in the foreplay section did you notice this section is foreplay because i get to talk about
critters which is the western grebe you haven't lived until you've seen these guys do their courtship dance i was on bowman lake in glacier national park which is a long skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it and my partner and i have a rowing shell and so we were rowing
and one of these western grebes came along and what they do for their courtship dance is they go together the two of them
the two mates and they begin to run underwater they paddle faster and faster and faster until they're going so fast that they literally lift up
out of the water and they're standing upright sort of paddling the top of the water
and one of these grebes came along while we were rowing and so we're in a skull and we're moving really really quickly and this grebe i think sort of
mistaked us for a prospect and started to run along the water next to us in a courtship dance for
miles it would stop and then start and then stop and then start now that is foreplay
i almost i came this close to changing species at that moment
and in design what's happened since the book came out the book was mainly about research in biomimicry and what's happened since then
the champion adapters in the natural world who might inspire us so this is a picture from a galapagos trip that we took with some wastewater treatment engineers they purify wastewater and some of them were very resistant actually to being there
they said to us at first was you know we already do biomimicry we use bacteria to clean our water
an organism to do your wastewater treatment is an old old technology called domestication this is
big problems give me a design challenge sustainability speed bump that's keeping you from being sustainable and they said scaling which is the build up of minerals inside of pipes
and they said you know what happens is mineral just like at your house mineral builds up and then the aperture closes and we have to flush the pipes with toxins or we have to dig them up
so if we had some way to stop this scaling and so i picked up some shells on the beach and i asked them what is scaling what's inside your pipes and they said calcium carbonate
and i said that's what this is this is calcium carbonate
ok to create a shell so the same sort of a process without the proteins is happening on the inside of their pipes they didn't know
this is not for lack of information it's a lack of integration you know it's a silo people in silos they didn't know that the same thing was happening so one of them thought about it and said
well if this is just crystallization that happens automatically out of seawater self assembly then why aren't shells infinite in size what stops the
why don't they just keep on going and i said well in the same way
that they let go of pro that they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization and then they all sort of leaned in
that protein that stop protein and it's an environmentally friendly way to stop scaling in pipes
that changed everything from then on you could not get these engineers back in the boat
first day they would take a hike and it was click click click click five minutes later they were back in the boat we're done you know i've seen that island after this
about the natural world is one thing learning from the natural world that's the switch that's the profound switch
they realized was that the answers to their questions are everywhere they just needed to change the lenses with which they saw the world three point eight billion
years of field testing ten to thirty craig venter will probably tell you i think there's a lot more than thirty million well adapted
so it's the conscious emulation of life 's genius it's not slavishly mimicking although al is trying to get the hairdo going
it's not a slavish mimicry it's taking the design principles the genius of the natural world
and learning something from it now in a group with so many it people i do have to mention that one i'm not going to talk about and that is that your field is one that has learned an enormous amount from living things on the software side
so there's computers that protect themselves like an immune system and we're learning from gene regulation and biological development
we're learning from neural nets genetic algorithms evolutionary computing that's on the software
what's interesting to me is that we haven't looked at this
as much i mean these machines are really not very high tech in my estimation in the sense that
is not at all up to snuff in terms of what life would call a success so what can we learn about making not just computers but everything
the plane you came in cars the seats that you're sitting on how do we redesign
the world that we make the human made world me are key
how does life make things
this is the opposite this is how we make things it's called heat beat and treat that's what material scientists call it and it's carving things down from the top with ninety six percent waste left over
its shape is what gives it the function of being able to
in other words structure it gives it information by adding information to matter
and thirdly how does life
make things disappear into systems because life
doesn't really deal in things
things in the natural world divorced from their systems
i'm reading more and more now
at the same time i'm listening to a lot of businesses and finding what their sort of grand challenges are the two groups are not talking to each other at all
try to go through twelve really quickly
ok one that's exciting to me is self assembly
heard about this in terms of nanotechnology back to that shell the shell is a self assembling material
on the lower left there is a picture of mother of pearl forming out of sea water it's a layered structure that's mineral and then polymer
and it makes it very very tough it's twice as tough as our high tech ceramics
but what's really interesting unlike our ceramics that are in kilns it happens in sea water
ok people are starting this is sandia national labs a guy named jeff brinker has found a way to have a self assembling coding process imagine being able to make ceramics at room temperature
by simply dipping something into a liquid
the molecules in the liquid together so that they jigsaw together in the same way as this crystallization works
precursors to a pv cell to a solar cell onto a roof and having it self assemble into a layered structure that harvests light
here 's an interesting one for the it world bio silicon
this is a diatom which is made of silicates and so silicon which we make right now it's part of our carcinogenic problem in the manufacture of our chips this is a bio mineralization process that's now being mimicked
imagine being able to and again it's a templated process and it solidifies out of a liquid
the people at lucent technologies have found have no distortion whatsoever it's one of the most distortion free lenses we know of and there's many of them all over its entire body what's interesting again
is that it self assembles a woman named joanna aizenberg at lucent
now learning to do this in a low temperature process to create these sort of lenses she's also looking at fiber optics
that's a sea sponge that has a fiber optic down at the very base of it there's fiber optics that work better than ours actually to move light
but you can tie them in a knot they're incredibly flexible here 's another big idea co two as a feedstock
guy named geoff coates at cornell said to himself you know plants do not see co two as the biggest poison of our time we see it that way plants are busy making long chains of starches and glucose
out of co two he 's found a way he 's found a catalyst and he 's found a way to take co two and make it into polycarbonates biodegradable plastics out of co two how plant like
solar transformations the most exciting one there are people who are mimicking the energy harvesting device inside of purple bacterium the people at asu even more interesting lately in the last couple of weeks people have seen that
in a fuel cell in the anode of a fuel cell and in a reversible fuel cell in our fuel cells we do it with platinum life does it with a very very common
a team has now just been able to mimic that hydrogen juggling
that's very exciting for fuel cells to be able to do that without platinum power of shape here 's a
we've seen that the fins of this whale have tubercles on them and those little bumps actually increase
in for instance the edge of an airplane increase efficiency by about thirty two percent
light comes through it bounces back off the layers it's called thin film interference imagine being able to self assemble products with the last few layers
with just water that's what a leaf does see that up close picture it's a ball of water and those are dirt particles and that's an up close picture of a lotus leaf
there's a company making a product called lotusan which mimics when the building facade paint dries it mimics
the bumps in a self cleaning leaf and rainwater cleans the
our big grand challenge quenching
here are two organisms that pull water the one on the left is the namibian beetle pulling water out of fog the one on the right is a pill bug pulls water out of
does not drink fresh water
pulling water out of monterey fog and out of
the sweaty air in atlanta before it gets into a building
key technologies separation technologies are going to be extremely important what if we were to say
no more hard rock mining
what if we were to separate out metals
from waste streams small amounts of metals in water that's what microbes do
and the silk being formed from a spider isn't that beautiful 's recipe book
because life uses only a subset even the toxic ones
to figure out the elegant recipes that would take the small subset
of the periodic table and create
the task of green chemistry timed degradation
packaging that is good until you don't want it to be good any more and dissolves on cue
that's a mussel you can find in the waters out here
threads holding it to a rock are timed at exactly two years they begin to dissolve
that little guy over there
around the world not getting to patients and the reason is that
the refrigeration somehow gets broken what's called the cold chain gets broken a guy named bruce rosner stays alive for
and months and months and is able to regenerate itself and he found a way to dry out vaccines
encase them in the same sort of sugar capsules as the tardigrade has within its cells
from organisms this is a session about water learning about organisms that can do without water
and lasts and lasts without refrigeration
not going to get to twelve
but what i am going to do is tell you that the most important thing besides all of these adaptations
is the fact that these organisms
have figured out a way
to do the amazing things they do
while taking care of the place
going to take care of their offspring
when they're involved in foreplay having their genetic material
and that means finding a way to do what they do without destroying the place that'll take care
there are millions and millions of geniuses talk about
this thing ok great ok so that's the healing one sensing and responding
feedback is a huge thing this is a locust there can be eighty million of them in a square kilometer and yet they don't collide with one another and yet we have three point six million car collisions a year
there's a person at newcastle who has figured out that it's a very large neuron and she's actually
that means you know net fertility farming we should be growing fertility and oh yes we get food too because we have to grow
has done the opposite so farming based on how a prairie builds soil ranching based on how a native ungulate herd
but creates incredibly sparkling productivity
this is the simple design brief i mean it looks simple because the system over three point eight billion years has worked this out that is
those organisms that have not been able to figure out how to enhance or sweeten their places
are not around to tell us about it
life and this is the secret trick this is the magic trick
life creates conditions conducive to life it builds soil it cleans air it cleans water it mixes the cocktail of gases that you and i need to live and it does
in the middle of having great foreplay
meeting their needs so it's not mutually exclusive making of this place
