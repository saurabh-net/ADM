thank you very much the first ted has been great ca have you met anyone interesting rb well the nice thing about ted is everybody 's interesting i was very glad to see goldie hawn because i had
to make to her i'd had dinner with her about two years ago and i'd she had this big wedding ring and i put it on my finger and i couldn't get
i went home to my wife that night and she wanted to know why i had another woman 's big massive big wedding ring on my finger and anyway the next morning we had to go along to the jeweler and get it
so we're going to put up some slides of one of your some of your companies here you've started one or two in your time
so you know virgin atlantic virgin records i guess it all started with a magazine called student and then yes all these other ones as well i mean how do you do this
i mean i think i learned early on that if you can run one company you can really run any companies i mean companies are all
finding the right people inspiring those people you know drawing out the best in people and i just love learning
and i'm incredibly inquisitive and i love taking on you know the status quo and trying to turn it upside down
one long learning process and if i see you know if i fly on somebody else's airline and find the experience is not a pleasant one which it wasn't in twenty one years ago
was a bizarre thing because you made this move that a lot of people advised you was crazy and in fact
in a way it almost took down your empire at one point i had a conversation with one of the investment bankers who at the time when you basically sold virgin records
the world 's fourth biggest record company for the twenty fifth biggest airline and that you were out of your mind why did you do that well i think that
we had we were being attacked by british airways they were trying to put our airline out of business and
they launched what's become known as the dirty tricks campaign and i realized that the whole empire was likely to come crashing down unless i chipped in a chip and
in order to protect the jobs of the people who worked for the airline and protect the jobs of the people who worked for the record company i had to sell the family jewelry to protect the airline
post napster you're looking like a bit of a genius actually for that as well rb yeah as it turned out to be the right
it was sad at the time but we moved on
we have a lot of fun and i think the people who work for it enjoy it we we as i say we go in and shake up other industries i mean virgin brides
i mean virgin brides what happened
we couldn't find any customers
curious why i think you missed an opportunity with your condoms launch you called it mates i mean couldn't you have used the virgin brand for that as well
virgin no longer or something rb again we may have had i became
what are the numbers on this i mean how big is the group overall how much what's the total revenue rb it's about twenty five billion dollars now in total ca and how many employees
about fifty five thousand ca so you've been photographed in various ways at various times and
never worrying about putting your dignity on the line or anything like that tea ca ok
that was a wonderful car boat in which rb oh that car that we actually we we it was a tedster event that i think is that
a minute rb it's a tough job isn't it ca i
when i first came to america i used to try this with employees as well and cola bottle
twenty five years earlier we'd launched the sex pistols god save the queen and
never expected that twenty five years later that she'd actually knight us but somehow she must have had a forgetful memory i think
well god saved her and you got your just reward do you like to be called
in america i hear people saying sir richard and think there's some shakespearean play taking
can you use your knighthood for
if you're having problems getting a booking in a restaurant or something that might be worth using it ca you know it's not richard branson it's
let 's look at the space thing i think with us we've got a video that shows to and
so that's the bert rutan designed spaceship rb yeah it'll be
ready in well ready in twelve months and then we do twelve months extensive testing and then
twenty four months from now people
take a ride into space
quite a bit of it the logos and he 's building the space station in new mexico
basically he 's just taken
and the space station will be one
back into this giant eye but he 's absolutely genius when it comes
but you didn't have him design the engine
is quite erratic so i think that he wouldn't be the best to design
to design a wonderful talk here
many times i mean i think with the ballooning and boating expeditions we've done in the past
the sea i think six times by helicopters so and each time i didn't expect to come home to tell the tale so in those moments you certainly wonder what you're doing up there or
you got to when did you think this is it i might be
each one actually i think we came close and i mean first of all we nobody had actually crossed the atlantic in a hot air balloon before so we had to
build a hot air balloon that was capable of flying in the jet stream and we weren't quite sure when a balloon actually got into the jet stream whether it would actually survive
two hundred two hundred and twenty miles an hour winds that you can find up there and so just the initial
lift off from sugarloaf to cross the atlantic as were pushing into the jet stream this enormous balloon the top of the balloon
and it just took off and it was like holding onto a thousand horses and we were just
crossing every finger praying that the balloon would hold together which
the ends of all those balloon trips were
and left me holding on
me jump but once his weight had gone the balloon just shot up to
twelve thousand feet and i ca and you inspired an
i put on my oxygen mask and stood on top of the balloon with my parachute looking at the
my courage to jump into the north sea which and it was a very very very lonely few moments but anyway we
i knew i had about half an hour 's fuel left
and i also knew that
the chances were that if i jumped i would only have a couple of minutes of life left so i climbed back into the capsule and
make sure that i was making the right decision and wrote some notes to my family and then climbed back up again looked down at those clouds again climbed back into the capsule again
and then finally just thought there's a better way i've got you know this enormous balloon above me it's the biggest parachute
why not use it and so i managed to fly the balloon down through the clouds and about
fifty feet before i hit the sea threw myself over and the balloon hit the sea and went shooting back up ten thousand feet without me but it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and ca what did you write to
just what you would do in a situation like that just i love you very much and
i'd already written them a letter before going on this trip which just in case anything had happened but fortunately they never had to use it
your companies have had incredible pr value out
regarded as this great hero in the u k and elsewhere and cynics might say you know this is just a smart business guy doing what it takes to
how much was the pr
as an airline owner the last thing you should be doing is heading off in balloons and boats and crashing into the they had a point
you must have been a genius from the get go right
didn't weren't you just terrible at school rb i was dyslexic
i had no understanding of schoolwork whatsoever
i certainly would have failed iq tests
and it was one of the reasons i left school when i was fifteen years old and
if i if i'm not interested in something
i don't grasp it as somebody who 's dyslexic you also have some quite bizarre situations
i've had to you know i've been running the largest group of private companies in europe but haven't been able to know the difference between net and gross and so the board meetings have been
and so it's like good news or bad news and generally the people would say oh well that's bad news ca but just to clarify the twenty five billion is gross right that's gross rb well i
so when i turned fifty somebody took me outside the
draw on a diagram here 's a net in the sea and the fish have been pulled from the sea into this net
and that's the profits you've got left over in this little net everything else is eaten and i finally worked it all
you a rebel then or how would you
yeah i think i was a bit of a maverick and
but i and i was yeah i was fortunately good at sport and so at least i had something to excel at at school ca and
some bizarre things happened just earlier in your life i mean there's the story about your mother allegedly dumping you in a field aged four and saying ok
was you know she felt that we needed to stand on our own two feet from an early age so she did things to us which now she'd be arrested for
such as pushing us out of the car and telling us to find our own way to granny 's about five miles before we actually got there
and making us go on wonderful long bike rides and we were never allowed to watch television
too coddled they don't know what they've got we're going to raise a generation of
i think if you're bringing up kids you just want to smother them with love and praise and enthusiasm so i don't think you can mollycoddle your kids too much
you didn't turn out too bad i have to say
your headmaster said to you i mean he found you kind of an enigma at your school he said you're either going to be a millionaire or go to prison and i'm not sure which which of those
both i think i went to prison first i was actually prosecuted under two quite ancient acts in the
mentioning the word venereal disease in public which we had a center where we would help young people who had problems and one of the
and then subsequently never mind the bollocks here 's the sex pistols the word bollocks the police decided
was a rude word and so we were arrested for using the word bollocks on the sex pistols album and
john mortimer the playwright defended us
and he asked if i could find a linguistics expert to
come up with a different definition of the word bollocks and so i rang up nottingham university and i asked to talk to the professor of linguistics
and he said look bollocks is not a has nothing to do with balls whatsoever it's actually a nickname given to priests in the eighteenth century
a priest myself and so i said would you mind coming to the court and he said he'd be delighted and i said and he said would you like me to wear my dog collar and i said yes that
so our key witness was argued that it was actually never mind the priest here 's the sex pistols and the judge found us reluctantly found us not that is outrageous
is any of it true is there an element of truth in it
i don't actually think that the stereotype of a business person
come back and come back for more and i think all you have in life is your reputation and it's a very small world
and i actually think that the best way of becoming a successful business leader is
the people who love you and who see you spending you keep getting caught up in these new projects but it almost feels like you're addicted to launching new stuff you get excited by
and kapow i mean do you think about life balance how do your family feel about each time you step into something big and
and so we spend a very good sort of three months away together yes i 'll you know be in touch we're very lucky we have this tiny little island in the caribbean
you started talking in recent years about this term capitalist philanthropy what is that
works you know the alternative communism has not
the problem with capitalism is with that wealth and
i think it's important that the individuals
in that fortunate position do not end up competing for bigger and bigger boats and bigger and bigger cars
you know use that money to either create new jobs or to tackle
around the world ca and what are the issues that you worry about most care most about want to turn your
well there's i mean there's a lot of issues i mean global warming certainly is a massive threat to mankind
and we are putting a lot of time and energy into a trying to come up with alternative fuels and
we just launched this prize which is really a prize in case we don't get an answer on alternative fuels in case we don't actually manage to get the carbon
we need to try to encourage people to come up with a way of extracting carbon out of the earth 's atmosphere and we just you know there weren't really people working on that before so we wanted people to try to
the best brains in the world to start thinking about that and also to try to extract the methane out of the earth 's atmosphere as well
yes i mean we've got we're setting up something called the war room which is maybe the wrong word we're trying to maybe we'll change it but anyway it's a war room to try to coordinate all
going on in africa all the different social problems in africa and try to look at best
practices so for instance there's a doctor in africa that's found that if you give a mother antiretroviral drugs at twenty four weeks
the war room sounds it sounds powerful and dramatic and is there a risk
the kind of the business heroes of the west
get so excited about i mean they're used to having an idea getting stuff done and they believe profoundly in their ability to make a difference in the world is there a risk that we go to places like africa and say
this problem and we can do it i've got all these billions of dollars you know da da da here 's the big idea and kind of
making a mess of it do you worry about that on this particular
situation we're actually we're working with the government on it i mean thabo mbeki 's had his problems with accepting hiv and aids are related but this is a way i think of him tackling this problem
and instead of the world criticizing him it's a way of working with him with his government it's important that if people do go to africa and do try to help
they don't just go in there and then leave after a few years it's got to be consistent but i think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial
clinics in africa where we're going to be giving free antiretroviral drugs free tb treatment and free malaria treatment but
we're also trying to make them self sustaining clinics so that people pay for some other aspects ca i mean
a lot of cynics say about someone like yourself or bill gates or whatever that this is really being
i think that everybody people do things for a whole variety of different reasons and i think that you know when i'm on me deathbed i will want to feel that
i've made a difference to other people 's lives and that may be a selfish thing to think
the way i've been brought up i think if i'm in a position to radically change other people 's lives for the better i should do so ca how
i'm fifty six ca i mean the psychologist erik erikson says that
as i understand him and i'm a total amateur but that
people are driven by this desire to grow and that's where they get their fulfillment
sixties the mode of operation shifts more to the quest for wisdom and a search for legacy
i don't think i think too much about legacy i mean i like to you know my grandmother lived to one hundred and one
i just want to live life to its full you know if i can make a difference i hope to be able to
make a difference and i think one of the positive things at the moment is you've got sergey and larry from google for instance
good friends and thank god you've got two people who genuinely care about the world
with that kind of wealth if they had that kind of wealth and they didn't care about the world it would be very worrying and you know they're going to make a hell of a difference to the world
and you actually did inspire me i looked at you i thought well he 's made it maybe there is a different way so i would like to thank you for that inspiration and for coming to ted today thank you
