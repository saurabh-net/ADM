as a way to help girls of african descent
prepare for their passage into womanhood these girls just needed
a way to invite their fathers into their lives on their own terms
and all the girls quickly backed her up
they started dreaming about the decorations
but even if i could have slowed down those girls
as long as they have infrastructure mentorship
and resources they can build what they need not only they acted sweet
so as the seasons changed and it was time to plan the dance again one girl named brianna spoke up
and this whole thing is making me sad
and to become their own heroes so
we want every girl to experience the dance right
i said girls well well he contacted me immediately
his doors are always open
because one thing he did know that when fathers are connected to their children it is less likely that they will return sixteen inmates and
sixteen inmates and girls were invited
the girls were dressed in their sunday best they laughed together
even experienced an opportunity to have a physical connection
something that a lot of them didn 't even have
and pull out her chair
so we needed to create something that they could take with them
this was going to be used as a touchstone so when they started to miss each other
and feel disconnected they could reconnect through this image because our daddies
he 's even here today
because of barbed wires and metal doors
we have just created a form for girls who have heavy questions on their heart
and given the fathers the freedom
