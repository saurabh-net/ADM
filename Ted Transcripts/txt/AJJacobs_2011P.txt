last decade subjecting myself to pain and humiliation hopefully for a good cause which is self improvement
and i 've done this in three parts so first i started with the mind and i decided to try to get smarter by reading the entire encyclopedia britannica from a to z or more precisely from it had its downsides
because leviticus says you cannot shave so this is what i looked like by the end
thank you for that reaction laughter i look a little like moses or ted kaczynski i got both of them so there was the topiary there
and there 's the sheep now the final part of the trilogy was i wanted to focus on the body and try to be the healthiest person i could be the healthiest person alive so that 's what i 've been doing the last couple of years
and i just finished a couple of months ago and i have to say thank god because living so healthily was killing me
it was so overwhelming because the amount of things you have to do it 's just
mind boggling i was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers
and they were telling me all the things i had to do i had to eat right exercise meditate pet dogs because that lowers the blood pressure i wrote the book on a treadmill and it took me about a thousand miles to write the book
went into sunscreen i was like a glazed doughnut for most of the year
that i should also wipe down all of the remote controls and iphones in my house because those are just orgies of germs so that
now it 's a little extreme i admit but if you think about this this is actually the freakonomics authors wrote about this that more people die on a per mile basis from drunk walking than from drunk driving
so something to think about tonight if you 've had a couple
so i finished and it was a success
so i finished and i

have stabilized so now i 'm back to
adopting many not all i don 't wear a helmet anymore but dozens of healthy behaviors that i adopted during my year it was really a life changing project and i of course don 't have time to go into all of them let me just tell you two really quickly
the first is and this was surprising to me i didn 't expect this to come out but i live a much quieter life now
and this is a real underestimated under appreciated health hazard not just because it harms our hearing which it obviously does but it actually initiates the fight or flight response a loud noise will get your fight or flight response going and this
over the years can cause real damage cardiovascular damage
the world health organization just did a big study that they published this year and it was done in europe and they estimated that one point six million years of healthy living are lost
every year in europe because of noise pollution so they think it 's actually very deadly and by the way it 's also terrible for your brain
they put dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall so that they could concentrate so without noise reduction technology our country would not exist so as a patriot i felt it was important to i wear all the earplugs and the earphones
that joy is so important to your health that very few of these behaviors will stick with me unless there 's some sense of pleasure and joy in them and just to give you one instance of this food
but i think we can use their techniques and apply them to healthy food to give just one example we love crunchiness mouthfeel so i basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness into a lot of my recipes throw in some sunflower seeds
and you can almost trick yourself into thinking you 're eating doritos laughter and the
