over the last few years i've been had the opportunity to do this closing conference and
thought that there was absolutely no way in hell to top that
and i mean this without irony i think i can speak for everybody in the audience when i say that i wish to god that you were the president of the united
is the title of my talk today
i just want to give you a quick overview first of all please remember i'm completely politically correct and i mean everything with great affection if any of you have sensitive stomachs or are feeling queasy now is the time to check your blackberry
just to review this is my tedtalk we're going to do some jokes some gags
some little skits and then we're going to talk about the l one point so
the one of the questions i ask myself is was this the most distressing ted ever let 's try and sum things up
and david pogue singing show
this is the most distressing ted ever i've been working with neil gershenfeld on next year 's ted bag and if the if the conference is anywhere near this distressing then it we're going to have a scream bag next year here
here back at ted university
so robert wright i don't know i felt like if there was anyone that helen needed to give antidepressants to it might have been him i want to deliberately interfere with his dopamine levels
he was talking about morality economy class morality is we want to bomb you back to the stone age business class morality is don't bomb japan they built my car and first class morality is don't bomb mexico they clean my house
yes it is politically incorrect
all right now i want to do a little bit of the
i wanted to show you guys i wanted to talk about a revolutionary
new computer interface that lets you work with images just as easily as you as a completely natural and you can
you can use really natural hand gestures to like
now we had a harvard professor here she was from harvard i just wanted to mention and and she was actually a professor from harvard and she was talking about now
one of the things that is very important to me is to try and figure out what on earth am i here for and that's why i went out and i picked up a best selling business book
you know it basically uses as its central premise greek mythology and it's by a guy named pastor rick warren and it's called the porpoise
and rick is as a pagan god which i thought was kind of appropriate in a certain way and now we're going to have kind of a little more visualization about rick warren right now
and green is daniel dennett
scales here are religiosity from zero percent or atheist to one hundred percent bible literally true and then this is books sold the logarithmic scale
thousand three hundred thousand three million thirty million three hundred million ok now they're duking it out now
of pulling ahead kind of pulling ahead yup and his installed base is getting a little bigger
but darwin 's dangerous idea is coming back it's coming back let me turn the trails on so you can see that a little bit
things that's very important is nicholas negroponte talked to us about one lap dance per
about one laptop per child
that are important for this revolutionary device i'll tell you a little bit about the design parameters and then i'll show it to you in person first of all it needs to be small it needs to be flat so it's transportable lightweight portable uses very very little power
very very high resolution has to be visible in bright daylight will work anywhere and broadly applicable across many platforms now we've actually done some research neil gershenfeld and the fab labs went out into the market
they did some research we came back and we think we have the perfect prototype of what the students in the field are actually asking for and here it is the one hundred dollar computer
ok ok ok ok excellent
now i bought this device from clifford stoll for about nine hundred bucks and he and his team of junior high school students were doing real science so we're trying to check and trying to douse here and see who uses marijuana
only if we open enough locker doors
ok now smallpox is an extremely distressing illness we had doctor larry brilliant talking about how we eradicated smallpox i wanted to show you the stages of smallpox we start this is day one two
day three she gets a massively big pox on her shoulder day
three day four day five
good news is because i'm a trained medical professional i know that even though she'll be scarred for life she's going to make a full
now the good news about architects for humanity is they're really kind of the most amazing group they've been sponsoring a design competition to come up with innovative medical housing solutions clinic solutions
so i want to show you some prototypes
the u n you know they took twenty years just to add a flap to a tent but i think we have some more exciting things this is a home made entirely out of fruit roll ups you can eat it
but the thing that i'm really really excited about
is this incredible granola house and the granola house has a special sun chip roof to collect water and recycle it
well on this side it has regular sour patch kids and gummy bears to let in the light but on this side it has sugary gummy bears to diffuse the light more slightly
and we we wanted just to show you what this might look like in situ
so einstein einstein tell me what's your favorite song no i said what's your favorite song
i said what's your favorite song free bird
ok so einstein what's your favorite singing group
you say that again what's your favorite singing group
have the sound up on the laptop please
it's a little hard to hear the whole message so i wanted to
so i wanted to help you a little bit so
talked a lot about global warming but you know as jill said
so al i actually think i'm rather good at branding so i've tried to figure out a good design process to come up with a new term to replace global warming so we started with babel fish
we put in global warming and then we decided that we'd change it from english to dutch into het globale verwarmen from dutch to chinese into
chinese to portuguese aquecer se global then portuguese to
finally back into the english which is we're totally the virgin mary
so first of all we decided that we needed about
one third bookstore one third google cafe about twenty percent registration eighty percent luxury hotel about five percent for restrooms
then of course we wanted to have the simulcast lounge the lobby and the steinbeck forum now let me show you how that literally translated into the design program so first
so we build this building on stilts then up here is where we're going to put the new steinbeck auditorium
and finally we're going to put the marriott hotel and the portola plaza on the top
now i don't know about you but sometimes i have these images in my head of separated at birth i don't know about you but when i see aubrey de grey i immediately go to gandalf the
ok now we've heard of course that we're all soldiers here so what i'd really really like you to do now is pick up your white piece of paper does everybody have their white piece of paper
we put up the elmo for a moment if we put up the elmo
then we'll get you know i'll give you a model that you can work from ok
and then i want you to fold that note into a paper airplane
and once you've folded it into a paper airplane i want you to take some anthrax
and i want you to put that in the paper airplane and then i want you to throw it on jim young can
to talk about global warming a little bit black men ski
ten years later the snow packs eroded and if you notice the trees have started turning yellow the water level of the lake has started drying
a few years later there's no snow left at all
and all the trees have turned brown
this year unfortunately the lake bed 's turned into an absolute cracked dry bed and i fear if we do nothing for our planet in twenty years it's going to look like this
i wish i knew how to quit you
