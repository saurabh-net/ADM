at ted we aimed to try to clarify the overwhelming complexity and richness that we experience at the conference in a project called big
and the big viz is a collection of six hundred and fifty sketches that were made by two visual artists david sibbet from the grove
and kevin richards from autodesk made six hundred and fifty sketches that strive to capture the essence of each presenter 's ideas
and the consensus was it really worked these sketches brought to life the key ideas the portraits the magic moments that we all experienced last year
this year we were thinking why does it work what is it about animation graphics illustrations that create meaning and this is an important question to ask and answer because
the more we understand how the brain creates meaning the better we can communicate and i also think the better we can think and collaborate together so this year we're going to visualize how the brain visualizes
through various processes the processing of course begins with the eyes light enters hits the back of the retina and is circulated most of which is streamed to the very back of the brain at the primary visual cortex and primary visual cortex
just simple geometry just the simplest of shapes but it also acts like a kind of relay station that re radiates and redirects information to many other parts of the brain
as many as thirty other parts that selectively make more sense create more meaning through the kind of ah ha experiences
we're only going to talk about three of them so the first one is called the ventral stream it's on this side of the brain and this is the part of the brain that will recognize what something is it's the what detector look at a hand look at
a second part of the brain is called the dorsal stream and what it does is locates the object in physical body space
so if you look around the stage here you'll create a kind of mental map of the stage and if you closed your eyes you'd be able to mentally navigate it you'd be activating the dorsal stream if you
the third part that i'd like to talk about is the limbic system and this is deep inside of the brain it's very old evolutionarily
and it's the part that feels it's the kind of gut center where you see an image and you go oh i have a strong or emotional reaction to whatever i'm seeing
so the combination of these processing centers help us make meaning in very different ways so what can we learn about this how can we apply this insight
now we've augmented this and spatialized this information many of you may remember the magic wall that we built in conjunction with perceptive pixel where we quite literally create an infinite wall
and so we can compare and contrast the big ideas so the act of engaging and creating interactive imagery enriches meaning it activates a different part of the brain
and then the limbic system is activated when we see motion when we see color and there are primary shapes and pattern detectors that we've heard about before so the point of this is what we make meaning
by seeing by an act of visual interrogation the lessons for us are three fold first use images to clarify what we're trying to communicate secondly make those images interactive so that we engage much more fully
and the third is to augment memory by creating a visual persistence these are techniques that can be used to be that can be applied in a wide range of
everything else there's always a room always a place to be able to make sense of all of the components in the strategic plan this is a time lapse view
the question who 's the boss you'll be able to figure that out
so the act of collectively and collaboratively building
the image transforms the collaboration no powerpoint is used in two days but instead the entire team creates a shared mental model that they can all agree on and move forward on
and this can be enhanced and augmented with
some emerging digital technology and this is our great unveiling for today and this is an emerging set of technologies that use large screen displays with intelligent calculation in the background to make the invisible visible
here what we can do is look at sustainability quite literally so a team can actually look at all the key components that heat the structure and make choices and then see the end result that is visualized on this screen
so making images meaningful has three components the first again is making ideas clear by visualizing them secondly making them interactive and then thirdly
making them persistent and i believe that these three principles can be applied to solving some of the very tough problems that we face in the world today thanks so much
