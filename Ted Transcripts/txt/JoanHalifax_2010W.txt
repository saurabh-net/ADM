compassion has many faces some of them are fierce some of them are wrathful some of them are tender some of them are wise a line that the dalai lama once said he said love and compassion
without them humanity cannot survive
and i would suggest it is not only humanity that won 't survive but it is all species on the planet as we 've heard today
it is the big cats and it 's the plankton
two weeks ago i was in bangalore in india i was so privileged to be able to teach in
in that hospice there were thirty one men and women who were actively dying
and i walked up to the bedside of an old woman who was breathing very rapidly fragile obviously in the latter phase of active dying i looked into
a line from the mahabharata the great indian epic
and yudhisthira replied the most wondrous thing in the world is that all around us people can be dying and we don 't realize it can happen to us
i looked into the face of one of these women and i saw in her face the strength that arises when natural compassion is really present i watched her hands as she bathed an old man
my gaze went to another young woman
as she wiped the face
of another dying person and it reminded me of something that i had just been present for every year or so i have the privilege of taking clinicians into the himalayas and the tibetan plateau
and we looked into the rags and there was this pair of eyes the rags were unwrapped
from a little girl whose body was massively burned
who cleaned the wounds of this baby and dressed the wounds
i know those hands and eyes
they touched me as well they touched me at that time they have touched me throughout my sixty eight years
they touched me when i was four and i lost my eyesight and was partially paralyzed and my family brought in a woman whose mother had been a slave to take care of me
she had phenomenal strength and it was really her strength i believe that became the kind of mudra and imprimatur that has been a guiding light in my life
and there are various facets and there 's referential and non referential compassion
it is that ability to really stand strong and to recognize also that i 'm not separate from this suffering but that is not enough because compassion which activates the motor cortex means that we aspire
we actually aspire to transform suffering and if we 're so blessed we engage in activities that transform suffering
that component is that we cannot be attached to outcome
now i worked with dying people for over forty years
i had the privilege of working
on death row in a maximum security prison for six years and i realized so clearly in bringing my own life experience from working with dying people and training caregivers
that any attachment to outcome
would distort deeply my own capacity to be fully present to the whole catastrophe
and when i worked in the prison system it was so clear to me this
are particular conditions i had that condition to a certain extent from my own childhood illness eve ensler whom you 'll hear later has had that condition activated amazingly in her through the various waters of suffering that she has been through
and those enemies are things like pity moral outrage
moral outrage the very word terror
the very word terror of our entire globe
now we know from neuroscience that compassion has some very extraordinary qualities for example
a person who is cultivating compassion when they are in the presence of suffering
they feel that suffering a lot more than many other people do this is called resilience
another thing about compassion is that it really enhances what 's called neural integration it hooks up all parts of the brain
another which has been discovered by various researchers at emory and at davis and so on is that compassion enhances our immune system
in the face of psycho social and physical poisons of the toxins of our world but compassion the generation of compassion actually mobilizes
why don 't we train our children in compassion people in our
and the archetype of this in buddhism is avalokiteshvara kuan yin it 's a female archetype
she who perceives the cries of suffering in the
i say that for thousands of years women have
met in intimacy the archetype
she who perceives the cries of suffering in the world
women have manifested for thousands of years the strength arising from compassion in an unfiltered unmediated way in perceiving suffering as it is
they have infused societies with kindness and we have really felt that as woman after woman has stood on this stage in the past day and a half
and they have actualized compassion through direct action
jody williams called it it 's good to meditate i 'm sorry you 've got to do a little bit of that jody step back give your mother a break okay
he sees something in the path
he looks it 's a dog he drops to his knees he sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg
the wound is just filled with maggots
so as not to harm them
i believe that women and girls today
have to partner in a powerful way with men with their fathers
the women in this room are lotuses in a sea of fire
may we actualize that capacity for women everywhere thank you
