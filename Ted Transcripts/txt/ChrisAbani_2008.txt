look away from the darkest things about us because
i really believe that we're never more beautiful than when we're most ugly because that's really the moment we really know what we're made of
chris said i grew up in nigeria with a whole generation in the eighties of students who were protesting a military dictatorship which has finally ended so it wasn't just me there was a whole generation of us
but what i've come to learn
is that the world is never saved in grand messianic gestures but in the simple
in south africa they have a phrase called
only way for me to be human is for you to reflect my humanity back at me but if you're like me my humanity is more like a window i don't really see it i don't pay attention to it until
like a bug that's dead on the window then suddenly i see it and usually it's never good it's usually when i'm cussing in traffic
someone who is trying to drive their car and drink coffee and send emails and make notes so
what ubuntu really says is that there is no way for us to be human without other people
very complicated so i thought i should
some stories i should tell you some stories about remarkable people so i thought i'd start with my mother and she was dark
my mother was english my parents met in oxford in the fifties and my mother moved to nigeria and
she was five foot two very feisty and very english
this is how english my mother is or was she just passed she came out to california to los angeles to visit me and we went to malibu which she thought was very
and then we went to a fish restaurant
and we had chad the surfer dude serving us and he came up and my mother said do you have any specials
my mother turned to me and said what
i said english mum and she shook her head and said so this woman
who converted from the church of england to catholicism when she married my father
and there's no one more rabid than a catholic convert
decided to teach in the rural areas in nigeria particularly among igbo women the billings ovulation method
which was the only approved birth control by the catholic church wasn't too good
so she took me along to translate
never discuss their period with their husbands
how swollen is your vulva
she never would have thought of herself as a feminist my mother
but she always used to say anything a man can do i can fix and
when my father complained about this situation where she's taking a seven year old boy to teach this birth control you know he used to say oh you're turning him into you're teaching him how to be a woman my mother said someone has
this woman during the biafran war
we were caught in the war it was my mother with five little children
it takes her one year through refugee camp after refugee camp to make her way to an airstrip where we can fly out of the country
at every single refugee camp she has to face off soldiers who want to take my elder brother mark who was nine and make him a boy soldier can you imagine this five foot two woman standing up to men with guns who want to kill us
all through that one year my mother never cried one time not
but when we were in lisbon in the airport about to fly to england
it was basically see through with five really hungry looking kids came over and asked her what had happened and she told this woman and so this woman emptied out her suitcase and
all of her clothes to my mother and to us and the toys of her kids who didn't like that very much
any kind of horror but the simple act of kindness from a complete stranger will unstitch you
the old women in my father 's village after this war
and they would sing these dirges made up of these names dirges so melancholic that they would scorch you
and they would sing them only when they planted the
as though they were seeding the hearts of the dead
but when it came for harvest time they would sing these joyful songs that were made up of the names of every child who had been born that these women enacted
these women enacted a lot of transformation
and the word for marriage was the same one rebuilding rwanda
did you also know that after apartheid when the new government went into the parliament houses
which would seem to suggest that apartheid was entirely the business of men
all of this to say never really counted
always rites of passage for young men
men were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women that's essentially what it is and a lot of rituals involved killing
little animals progressing along so when i turned thirteen and i mean it made sense it was
agrarian community somebody had to kill the animals there was no whole foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at so when i turned thirteen it was my turn now to kill a goat
this weird sensitive kid who couldn't really do it
but i had to do it and i was supposed to do this alone but a friend of mine called emmanuel who was significantly older than me who 'd been a boy soldier during the biafran war decided to come with me which sort of
made me feel good because he'd seen a lot of things now when i was growing up he used to tell me stories about how he used to bayonet people and their intestines would fall out but they would keep running
so this guy comes with me and i don't know if you've ever heard a goat or seen one
they sound like human beings
my friend brad kessler says
we didn't become human until we started keeping goats
a goat 's eyes are like a child
puts his hand over the mouth of the goat covers
this guy who 'd seen so much and who to whom the killing of a goat must have seemed such a quotidian experience
still found it in himself to try to protect me
i was a wimp i cried for a very long time and afterwards he didn't say a word he just sat there watching me cry for an hour and then afterwards he said to me
it will always be difficult
but if you cry like this every time you will die of
just know that it is enough sometimes to know that it is difficult
i was born two days after christmas
so growing up you know i had a cake and everything but i never got any presents because born two days after christmas
about nine and my uncle had just come back from germany and we had the catholic priest over my mother was entertaining him with tea and my uncle suddenly says where are chris presents and
but he was desperate to show that he'd just come back so he summoned me up and he said go into the bedroom my bedroom take anything you want out of the
he thought i'd take a book
but i found an inflatable sheep
waving this buzzing sheep around
was completely unflustered just stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said it 's all right daphne i'm scottish
my last days in prison
my cellmate was fourteen years old
the name was john james
if a family member committed a crime
so here was this fourteen year old kid on death row
and he had smuggled in two comics two comic books spiderman and x men he was obsessed
and when he got tired of reading them he started to teach the men in death row how to read with these comic books
and so i remember night after night you'd hear all these men these really hardened criminals huddled around john james reciting take that spidey
say how do you know and he said oh i heard it on the
they handcuffed him to a chair
that they built their own gods
come together as a community
and their wish would then be brought to a priest who would find a ritual object and the appropriate sacrifices would be made
became unruly and began to ask for human sacrifice destroy the god
they would knock down the shrine
we're building gods that have gone rampant
time we started knocking them their names
it doesn't require a tremendous thing
all it requires is to recognize among us every day the few of us that can see are surrounded by people amazing people
who offer all of us
the mirror to our own
i want to end with a poem by an american poet
by an american poet called lucille clifton
the poem is called libation
and it's for my friend vusi
who is in the audience here
i offer to this ground
i imagine an old man crying here
out of the sight of the overseer he pushes his tongue
where his tooth would be if he
in that space where his tooth would be
where his land would be his house his wife
his house his wife beautiful daughter
he wipes sorrow from his face
and puts his thirsty finger to his thirsty tongue and tastes the salt
i call a name that could be his this is for you
