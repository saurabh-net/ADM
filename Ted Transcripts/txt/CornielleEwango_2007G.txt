i 'm born in the western congo in an area around here and then went to university in kisangani
and after i finished i went to this area the ituri forest but what i 've been doing when i was about fourteen
i grew in my uncle 's house and my father was a soldier and my uncle was a fisherman and also a poacher what i 've been doing from fourteen to seventeen was i was assisting them collecting
around seventeen to twenty years i became myself a poacher and i wanted to do it because
i believed to continue my studies
i wanted to go to university but my father was poor
and i said no way i 'm not doing it my family 's poor my area don 't have better health care i want to be a doctor to serve them
three times that means three years and i start getting old i say oh no i continue so i did tropical ecology and plant botany
when i finished i went to the ituri forest for my internship it 's where i really getting passion with what i 'm doing right up
that time the ituri forest was created as a forest reserve
okapi faunal reserve because of this beautiful creature that is a forest giraffe
through evolution we have this forest giraffe that lives only in congo it has also some beautiful primates thirteen species highest diversity we can find in one single area in africa and it has the ituri forest itself
about one thousand three hundred species of plants so far known
i joined the wildlife conservation society working there in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five but i started working with them as a student in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one i was appointed as
and i wanted to be formed to a training center and a research center with the end of the dictatorship regime of mobutu sese seko that most of you know life became very very difficult and the work we have been doing
was completely difficult to do and to achieve it when kabila started his movement to liberate congo so mobutu soldiers
started moving and retreated so they started fleeing from the east to the west and the okapi faunal reserve is
so there was a road from goma somewhere here and coming like this so
they might go through pass through the okapi faunal reserve congo has five of the world 's richest sites of protected area and the okapi faunal reserve is one of them so soldier was fleeing in the okapi faunal reserve on their way they looted everything
torture wars oh my god you can 't believe
every person was looking his way where to go we don 't know and it was for us the young
the first time really we hear the language of war of guns
and even people who faced the rebellion of one thousand nine hundred and sixty three after our independence they didn 't believe
what was happening they were killing people they were doing whatever they want because they have power who have been doing that young children child soldiers
purpose so that we start them for
agriculture for medicine for whatever and for science for the study of the flora and the change of the forest that is people moving around that 's even pygmies and this is a bright guy
after we have lost everything
i have to save something even myself my life and life of the staff i buried some of our new vehicle engines i buried it to save it and some of equipment went with them on the top of the canopy to save it he 's not collecting plants he 's going to save our equipment on the canopy
coltan extraction gold mining so we started talking with them convincing them that we are in a protected area there are regulations that it 's prohibited to do
you think that soldiers who are dying are not important and your animals you are protecting are most important we don 't think so we have to do it because to let our movement advance i say no way you are not going to do it here
we started talking with them and i was negotiating
tried to protect our equipment tried to protect our staff and the villages of about one thousand five hundred people
and we continued but i was doing that negotiating with them sometimes we are having meeting and they are talking with jean pierre bemba with mbusa nyamwisi with kabila and i 'm there sometimes they talk to my own language that is lingala
forest and every time daily after we have meeting
one day we went to meet the chief commander he had the same iridium cell phone like me and he asked me do you know how to use this i said i have never seen it
what we are doing after that that was the situation of
i started this with seventy dollars and start fundraising money to where i 've been going i had opportunity to go all over where herbarium for my african material is and
they supported me a bit and i built this now it 's doing work to train young congolese and also what one of the speciality we are doing
my design is tracking the global warming effect on biodiversity and what the impacts of the ituri forest is playing to uptake carbon this is one of the studies we are doing on a forty hectare plot where we have tagged
i didn 't find this but now i think that i would have titled it the language of guns
because of the language of guns i don 't think that someone may blame google
because it 's doing the right things even if people like al qaeda are using google to connect between them but it 's serving millions for the best but what is doing with gun industries thank you how can we
many many of you have seen the talents of africans but there are few who are going to school many are dying because of all those kind of pandemics hiv malaria poverty not going to school
what you can assist us it 's by building capacities how many have got opportunity like me to go to u s do a master 's and go now i 'm in the netherlands to do a ph d but many of them are just here because they don 't have money and they can 't go even to university they can 't even attain the bachelor 's degree building capacities
for the young generation is going to make a better generation and a better future tomorrow for africa
