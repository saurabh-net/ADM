we still have one foot in the dark ages and when you listen to some of the presentations here and
the extraordinary range of human capability our understandings and then you contrast it with the fact we still call this planet earth
pretty extraordinary we have one foot in the dark ages just quickly aristotle his thing was
not flat stupid it a s round galileo he had the inquisition so he had to be a little bit more polite he was it a s not in the middle you know and
really said it for me and this should give you goose bumps we shall not cease from exploration and the end of our exploring shall be to return where we started
and know the place for the first time and the next lines are through the unknown remembered gate where the last of earth
love what you a re doing i admire the guts i admire the courage but your rockets are pointed in the wrong goddamn direction
it a s all a question of perspective let me try and tell you i don a t mean to insult you but
if i and i a m not doing this for real because it would be an insult so i a m going to pretend and it softens the blow i a m going to tell you what you a re thinking if i held up a square that was one foot square the color of
and i held up another square that was the root two square so it a s one point five times bigger and was the color of the oceans and i said
what is the relative value of these two things well it a s the relative importance you would say yeah yeah yeah we all know this water covers twice the area of the planet
stupidly called earth if you think that that a s the relative importance two to one you a re wrong by a factor of ten
now you a re not as thick as two short planks but you sound like it when you say earth because that demonstration if i turned around this way that earth
plane would be as thin as paper it a s a thin film two dimensional existence the ocean representation would have a depth to it
aquatic that means that us terrestrials occupy a minority the problem we have in believing that is you just have to give up this notion that this earth was created for us because
a problem we have if this is an ocean planet and we only have a small minority of this planet it just interferes with a lot of
latest film aliens of the deep it a s incredible it features two of these deep rovers and i can criticize them because these sweet things
this i think represents one of the most beautiful classic submersibles built if you look at that
and this one actually carries two great manipulators it actually is a very good working sub that a s what it was designed for the problem with it is and the reason i
never build another one like it is this is a product of two dimensional thinking it a s what we humans do when we go in the ocean as engineers we take all our terrestrial hang ups all our
a seat works in a two dimensional world where gravity blasts down on that seat ok and in a two dimensional world
inner atmosphere it has two atmospheres a lesser outer gaseous atmosphere a lighter one most of life on earth is in that inner atmosphere
and that life enjoys a three dimensional existence which is alien to us fish do not sit
their mothers don a t say to little baby fish careful you don a t fall over they don a t fall over they don a t fall
submersible or even remote that just takes advantage that this is a three dimensional space this is the way we should be going into the oceans this is a three dimensional machine
what we need to do is go down the ocean with the freedom of the animals and move in this three dimensional space ok this is good stuff this is man a s first attempt at flying underwater right now i a m just coming down on this gorgeous big
giant manta ray she has twice the wingspan that i do there i a m coming she sees me and just notice
and turns she doesn a t sit there and try and blow air into a tank and kind of flow up or sink down she just rolls and the craft
that i a m this hasn a t been shown before chris asked us to show stuff that hasn a t been shown before i wanted you to notice that she actually turned to come back
i am i see her coming back coming up underneath me i put reverse thrust and i try and pull gently down i a m trying to do everything very gently we spent about three hours and
this is the first flying machine this was the first prototype this was a fly by wire it has wings there a s no silly buoyancy tanks it a s permanently positively buoyant and
she just blew me away she just rolled
right away from underneath and really that a s the only
ever made in this machine it took ten years to build this lady here
look that ugly but the camera a s so close that it a s just distorted
there she goes right overhead this is a wide angle camera she a s just a few inches off the top of my head
he just crossed over the top of my head
this is an incredible encounter with a manta i a m speechless
we a ve been just feet apart i a m going back down
trying to fly and keep up with that animal it wasn a t the lack of maneuverability that we had it was the fact she was going so slow i actually designed that to move faster through the water
because i thought that was the thing that we needed to do to move fast and get range but after that encounter i really did want to go back with that animal and dance she wanted to dance and so what we needed to do was increase the wing area so that we just had more
grip develop higher forces so the sub that was outside last year this is the one you see the larger wing area here
also clearly it was such a powerful thing we wanted to try and bring other people and we could figure out how to do it so we opened the world a s first flight school the rational for the world a s first flight school goes something like when the coastguards come up to me and say
they used to leave us alone when we were diving these goofy little spherical things but when we started flying around in underwater jet fighters they got a little nervous and they would come up and say
you have a license for that and then i a d put my sunglasses on the beard that would all sprout out and i would say i don a t need no stinking license
i write these stinking license which i do so bob gelfons around here but
what comes next in thirty seconds i can a t tell you but
the patent for underwater flight karen and i we were looking at it some business partners wanted us to patent it we weren a t sure about that we a ve decided we a re just going to let that go it just seems wrong to try and
the freedom for underwater flight so anybody who wants to copy us and come and join us go for it the other thing is that
got much lower costs we developed some other technology called spider optics and craig ventner asked me to make an announcement here this morning
