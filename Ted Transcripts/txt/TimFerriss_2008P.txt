you can tell by the power squat i was a very confident boy and not without reason i had a very charming routine at the time which was to wait until late in the evening when my parents were decompressing from a hard day 's work
my parents found it necessary for peace of mind and at noon each day the campers would go to a pond where they had
and i tried to come up for air and my lower back hit the bottom of the tube i went wild eyed and thought i was going to die a camp counselor fortunately came over and separated us
from that point onward i was terrified of swimming that is something that i did not get over my inability to swim has been one of my greatest humiliations and
when i realized that i was not the incredible hulk but there is a happy ending to this story at age thirty one that's my age now
in august i took two weeks to re examine swimming and question all the of the obvious aspects of swimming
and went from swimming one lap so twenty yards like a drowning monkey at about two hundred beats per minute heart rate i measured it to
going to montauk on long island close to where i grew up and jumping into the ocean and swimming one kilometer in open water getting out and feeling better than when i went in and i came out in my speedos european style
feeling like the incredible hulk and that's what i want everyone in here to feel like the incredible hulk at the end of this presentation more specifically i want you to feel like you're capable
of becoming an excellent long distance swimmer a world class language learner and a tango champion
and i would like to share my art if i have an art it's deconstructing things that really scare the living hell out of me so moving
and the turnaround in swimming came when a friend of mine said i will go a year without any stimulants this is a six double espresso per day type of guy if you can complete a one kilometer open water race
so the clock started ticking i started seeking out triathletes because i found that lifelong swimmers often couldn't teach what they did i tried
even did lessons with olympians nothing helped and then chris sacca who is now a dear friend mine had completed an iron man with one hundred and three degree temperature said i have the answer to your prayers and he introduced me to
the work of a man named terry laughlin who is the founder of total immersion swimming that set me on the road to examining biomechanics so here are the new rules of swimming if any of you are afraid of swimming
or not good at it the first is forget about kicking very counterintuitive so it turns out that propulsion
the only way you can do that is to not swim on top of the water the body is denser than water ninety five percent of it would be at least submerged naturally so you end up number three not swimming in the case of freestyle
on your stomach as many people think reaching on top of the water but actually rotating from streamlined right to streamlined left
below his head and far in front and so his entire body really is underwater the arm is extended below the head the head is held in line with the spine
so that you use strategic water pressure to raise your legs up very important especially for people with lower body fat
the entry point for his right hand notice this he 's not reaching in front and catching the water rather he is entering the water at a forty five degree angle
then propelling himself by streamlining very important incorrect above which is what almost every swimming coach will teach
not their fault honestly and i'll get to implicit versus explicit in a moment below is what most swimmers will find enables them to do what i did which is going from
twenty one strokes per twenty yard length to eleven strokes in two workouts with no coach no video monitor and now i love swimming
as it enters the water and that will get you very far
need to know languages material versus method i like many people came to the conclusion that i was terrible at languages
i suffered through spanish for junior high first year of high school and the sum total of my knowledge was pretty much donde esta el bano and i wouldn't even catch
the response a sad state of affairs then i transferred to a different school
sophomore year i had a choice of other languages most of my friends were taking japanese so i thought why not punish myself i'll do japanese six months later i had the chance to go to japan
my teachers assured me they said don 't worry you'll have japanese language classes every day to help you cope it will be an amazing experience my first overseas experience in fact
so my parents encouraged me to do it i left i arrived in tokyo amazing i couldn't believe i was on the other side of the world i met my host family things went quite well i think all things considered my first evening
you've never seen a more confused japanese woman
i walked in to school and
a teacher came up to me and handed me a piece of paper i couldn't read any of it hieroglyphics it could have been because
there had been something lost in translation the japanese classes were not japanese instruction classes per se they were the normal high school curriculum for japanese students the other four thousand nine hundred and ninety nine students in the school who were japanese besides the american
and that's pretty much my response
and that set me on this panic driven search
for the perfect language method i tried everything i went to kinokuniya i tried every possible book every possible cd nothing worked until i found this
this is the joyo kanji this is a tablet rather or a poster of the one thousand nine hundred and forty five common use characters as determined by the ministry of education in one
many of the publications in japan limit themselves to these characters to facilitate literacy some are required to and this became my holy grail my rosetta stone as soon as i focused on this material i took off
i ended up being able to read asahi shinbu asahi newspaper about six months later so a total of eleven months later and went from japanese i to japanese vi ended up doing translation work at age sixteen when i returned to the u s and
have continued to apply this material over method approach to close to a dozen languages now someone who was terrible at languages and at any given time speak read and write five or six
this brings us to the point which is it's oftentimes what you do not how you do it that is the determining factor this is the difference between being effective doing the right things and being efficient doing things well whether or not
you can also do this with grammar i came up with these six sentences after much experimentation having a native speaker allow you to deconstruct their grammar by translating these sentences into past present future will show you subject object verb placement of indirect direct objects gender and so forth
from that point you can then if you want to acquire multiple languages alternate them so there is no interference we can talk about that if anyone in interested and now i love languages
so ballroom dancing implicit versus explicit very important you might look at me and say that guy must be a ballroom dancer but no you'd be wrong because my body is very poorly designed for most things pretty well designed for lifting heavy
perhaps i used to be much bigger much more muscular and so i ended up walking like this i looked a lot like
orangutan our close cousins or the incredible hulk
ten women two guys usually a good ratio the instructor says you are participating immediately death sweat
fight or flight fear sweat because i tried ballroom dancing in college stepped on the girl 's foot with my heel she screamed i was so concerned with her perception of what i was doing
and she pulled back threw down her arms put them on her hips turned around and yelled across the room this guy is built like a god damned mountain of muscle and he 's grabbing me like a which i found encouraging
of mice and men style and she looked up and said now that's better so i bought a month 's worth of classes and
proceeded to look at i wanted to set competition so i'd have a deadline parkinson 's law the perceived complexity of a task will expand to fill the time you allot it so i had a very short deadline for a competition
i got a female instructor first to teach me the female role the follow because i wanted to understand the sensitivities and abilities that the follow needed to develop
so i wouldn't have a repeat of college and then i took and inventory of the characteristics along with her of
the of the capabilities and elements of different dancers who 'd won championships i interviewed these people because they all
i compared the two lists and what you find is that there is explicitly expertise they recommended certain training methods then there were implicit commonalities that none of them seemed to be
now the protectionism of argentine dance teachers aside i found this very interesting so i decided to focus on three of those commonalities
long steps so a lot of milongueros the tango dancers will use very short steps i found that longer steps were much more elegant so you can have
in her own right very famous so i think you'll agree they look quite good together now what i like about this video
is it's actually a video of the first time they ever danced together because of his lead he had a strong lead he didn't lead with his chest which requires you lean forward i couldn't develop the attributes in my toes the strength in my feet to do that so he uses a lead
on his shoulder girdle and his arm so he can lift the woman to break her for example that's just one benefit of that so then we broke it down
many different types i have hundreds of hours of footage all categorized much like george carlin categorized his
so using my arch nemesis spanish no less to learn tango so fear is your friend fear is an indicator sometimes it shows you what you shouldn 't do more often than not it shows you exactly what you should
and the best results that i've had in life the most enjoyable times have all been from asking a simple question what's the worst that can happen especially with fears you gained when you were a child
the analytical frameworks the capabilities you have apply them to old fears apply them to very big dreams and when i think of what i fear now
simple when i imagine my life what my life would have been like without the educational opportunities that i had
it makes me wonder i've spent the last two years trying to deconstruct the american public school system to either fix it or
and have done experiments with about fifty thousand students thus far built i'd say about a half dozen schools my readers at this point and if any of you are interested in that
i would love to speak with you i know nothing i'm a beginner but i ask a lot of questions and i would love your advice thank you very much
