went to visit a friend in hong kong
at the time i was very superstitious
so upon landing this was still at the old hong kong airport that's kai tak
was smack in the middle of the city i thought
if i see something good i'm going to have a great time here in my two weeks
and if i see something negative
i'm going to be miserable indeed
got to a full stop
in front of this little billboard
to see some of the design companies in hong kong in my stay there
and it turned out that
i just went to see you know what they are doing in hong kong
i flew back to austria packed my bags
and another week later i was again on my way to hong kong still superstitions
and thinking well if that winner billboard is still up
i'm going to have a good time working here but if it's gone
it's going to be really miserable and stressful
so it turned out that not only was the billboard still up
but they had put this one right next to it
on the other hand it also taught me where superstition gets me because i really had a terrible time however i did have
a number of real moments of happiness in my life
you know i think what the conference brochure
refers to as moments that take your breath away
since i'm a big list maker i actually
now you don't have to go through the trouble of reading them and i won 't read them for you i know that it's incredibly boring to hear about other people 's i did do
is i actually looked at them
two different possibilities there's one from a consumer 's point of view where i was happy while experiencing design and i'll just give you one example
my brother had this great yamaha motorcycle that he was willing to borrow to me freely
i remember it as a true
moment of happiness you know of course they are
this combination of at least two of them being you know design objects
and you know there's a scale of happiness when you talk about in design
the motorcycle incident would definitely be you know situated somewhere here right in there between delight and bliss now there is the
from a designer 's standpoint if you're happy while actually doing it
one way to see how happy designers are when they're designing could be to look at the
authors photos on the back of their monographs
as well as the mexicans are very happy while somewhat the spaniards
while somewhat the spaniards and i think particularly
and i think particularly be doing all that
last november a museum opened in tokyo called the mori museum
in a skyscraper up on the fifty sixth floor
and i went very eagerly to see it because well also with an eye on this conference they interestingly
exhibit off into four different in different forms
this apple by yoko ono that of course later on was you know
made into the label for the beatles under nirvana
a little an interesting theory about abstraction this is
actually an yves kline painting and the theory was that if you abstract an image
you really you know open
as much room for the unrepresentable and
you know are able to involve the viewer more silk
and lastly under harmony they had this thirteenth century from
now what i took away from the exhibit was that maybe with the exception
maybe with the exception most of
and i felt a little bit cheated because the visualization that's a really easy thing to do and you know my studio we've done it all the time this is you know
a book a happy dog and you take it out it's an aggressive dog it's a happy david byrne and an angry david
or a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face you know that's not a big deal to accomplish
to accomplish gotten to the point
you know within advertising or within the movie industry happy has gotten such a bad
want to do something with the subject and still appear authentic
you almost would have to you know
do it from a cynical point of view
a couple of weeks ago designed a box set for the talking heads where the happiness
much much more difficult is
this where the designs actually can evoke happiness and
show you three that actually did this for me
done by a young artist in new york who calls himself
everybody who has ridden the new york subway system will be familiar
printed his own version of these signs met every wednesday at a subway stop with twenty of his friends they divided up the different subway lines
now the way this works in the system is that nobody ever looks at these signs so you're you're really
in the subway and you kind of stare at something and it takes you a while until it actually you realize that this says something different than what it normally says
mean that 's at least how it made me happy and also gave this
from the mta to everybody sort of like pretending that it's an art project financed by the metropolitan transit authority
new york project this is at p s one
a sculpture that's basically a square room by james turrell that has a retractable ceiling opens up
dusk and dawn every day you don't see the horizon you're just in there watching the incredible subtle changes of color in the sky the room is
the room is something to be seen
demeanor changes when they go
and for sure i haven't looked
than those three projects that i'm showing here
i would definitely say that observing vik muniz cloud a couple of years ago in manhattan
for sure made me happy as well
but my last project is again from a young designer in new york he 's from korea originally and he took it upon himself to print fifty five thousand
speech bubbles empty speech bubbles stickers large ones and small ones and he goes around new york and just puts them empty as they are on posters
people go and fill them in
this one says please let me die in peace
i think that was the most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good this is on a musician poster that says
i am concerned that my cd will not sell more than two hundred thousand units and that as a result my recoupable advance
from my label will be taken from me after which my contract will be cancelled and i'll be back doing journey covers on bleecker street
i think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved wins jee gets to have his project the public gets
sweeter environment and different public gets a place to express themself and the advertisers finally get somebody to look at their ads
was a question of course that was on my mind for a while
you know can i do more of the things that i like doing in design and less of the ones
that i don't like to be doing
brought me back to my list making you know just to see what i actually like about my job you know one just working without pressure
without being frazzled or as nancy said before like
this is you know related to it getting out of the studio
then of course trying to you know work on things where the content is actually important for me
being able to enjoy the end results
i found another list in one of my diaries
just about at that time an austrian magazine called and asked
the whole thing just fell together so i just one of the things
french company asked us to design five billboards for them again we could supply the content for it me and myself
this one so it 's trying did one more of
this is again for a magazine dividing pages
this is having this is the same thing
it's just you know photographed from the side this is from the front
then it 's guts again it's the same thing guts is just the same room
it's for with the light on about fifteen years ago
