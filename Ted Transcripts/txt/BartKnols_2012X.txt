i hate them don 't you
that awful buzzing sound at night around your ears that drives you absolutely crazy
knowing that she wants to stick a needle in your skin and suck out your blood
that 's awful right in fact
there 's only one good thing i can think of when it gets to mosquitos
they prefer to bite my wife
but that 's fascinating right why does she receive more bites than i do
and the answer is smell
the smell of her body
and since we all smell different and produce chemicals on our skin
so my wife smells nicer than i do
or i just stink more than she does
and therefore we set up various experiments
why did we set up these experiments
because half the world 's population
runs the risk of contracting a killer disease like malaria through a simple mosquito
every thirty seconds somewhere on this planet a child dies of malaria
and paul levy this morning he was talking about the metaphor of the seven hundred and twenty seven crashing into the united states well in africa
but we undertook some remarkable experiments that managed us to resolve this puzzle very quickly indeed first we observed that not all mosquito species bite on the same part of the body in a large cage
and in that cage we released mosquitos
to see where they were biting on the body of that person
and we found some remarkable differences on the left here you see the bites
in contrast the african malarial mosquito had a very strong preference for biting the ankles
and feet of this person and that of course we should have known all along because they 're called mosqui toes you see
on the smell of human feet until we came across a remarkable statement in the literature
that said that cheese smells after feet rather than the reverse of limburger cheese
which smells badly after feet to attract african malaria mosquitos and you know what
it worked in fact it worked so well
that now we have a synthetic mixture of the aroma of limburger cheese that we 're using in tanzania and has been shown there to be two to three times more attractive to mosquitos
as it is now used in the fight against malaria
one of the best ways of killing mosquitos
is not to wait until they fly around like adults and bite people and transmit disease
it 's to kill them when they 're still in the water
and they 're accessible you can actually walk up to that pool and you can kill them there
and last year we thought very very hard
how can we resolve this problem
until we realized that just like us
and so we set up another crazy experiment because we collected the smell of these larvae
here we have a bar with four holes and we put the smell of these larvae in the left hole ooh that was very quick and then you see the dog it 's called tweed it 's a border collie he 's examining these holes and now he 's got it already
he 's going back to check the control holes again but he 's coming back to the first one and now he 's locking into that smell
which means that now we can use dogs
with these inspectors to much better find the breeding sites of mosquitos in the field and therefore have a much bigger impact on malaria
since we also know that people that carry malaria parasites smell different compared to people that are uninfected she 's convinced that we can train dogs to find people that carry the parasite
that means that in a population where malaria has gone down all the way and there 's few people remaining with parasites that the dogs can find these people we can treat them with anti malarial drugs and give the final blow
my third story is perhaps even more remarkable
and i should say has never been shown to the public until today
and ultimate revenge against mosquitos ever
in fact people have told me that now they will enjoy being bitten by mosquitos
and the question of course is what would make someone enjoy being bitten by mosquitos
and the answer i have right here it does miracles
let me show you how this works
here in this box i have a cage
and i will show you how quickly and three hours later
what we see at the bottom of the cage
is dead mosquitos very dead mosquitos
we can actually use this to contain outbreaks of mosquito born diseases of epidemics right
and better still imagine what would happen if in a very large area everyone would take these drugs this drug for just three weeks
that would give us an opportunity to actually eliminate malaria as a disease
so cheese dogs and a pill to kill mosquitos that 's the kind of out of the box science that i love doing
for the betterment of mankind
