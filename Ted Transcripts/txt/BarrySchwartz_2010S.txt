so there is among many people certainly me and most of the people i talk to a kind of collective dissatisfaction with the way things are working with the way our institutions
our kids teachers seem to be failing them
our doctors don't know who the hell we are and they don't have enough time for us we certainly can't trust the bankers
and we certainly can't trust the brokers they almost brought the entire financial system down and even as we do our
all too often we find ourselves having to choose between doing what we think is the right thing and doing the expected thing or the required thing or the profitable
thing so everywhere we look pretty much across the board we worry that the people we depend on don't really have our interests at heart
or if they do have our interests at heart we worry that they don't know us well enough to figure out what they need to do in order to allow us to
if things aren't going right the first response is let 's make more rules
let 's set up a set of detailed procedures to make sure that people will do the right thing give teachers scripts
to follow in the classroom so even if they don't know what they're doing and don't care about the welfare of our kids as long as they follow the scripts our kids will get educated
in fees more and more rules to protect us against an indifferent uncaring set of institutions we have to deal with
or or maybe and in addition to rules let 's see if we can come up with some really clever incentives
so that even if the people we deal with don't particularly want to serve our interests it is in their interest to serve our
the magic incentives that will get people to do the right thing even out of pure selfishness so we offer teachers bonuses
if the kids they teach score passing grades on these big test scores that are used to evaluate the quality of school systems
rules and incentives sticks and carrots we passed a bunch of rules to regulate the financial industry in response to the recent collapse there's the dodd frank act
there's the new consumer financial protection agency that is temporarily being headed through the backdoor by elizabeth warren
maybe these rules will actually improve the way these financial services companies behave we'll see
in addition we are struggling to find some way to create incentives for people in the financial services industry that will have them
more interested in serving the long term interests even of their own companies rather than securing short term profits
so if we find just the right incentives they'll do the right thing as i said selfishly and if we come up with the right rules and regulations they won 't drive us all over a cliff
and ken and i certainly know
that you need to reign in the bankers if there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse it is that
but what we believe and what we argue in the book is that there is no set of rules no matter how detailed
no matter how specific no matter how carefully monitored and enforced there is no set of rules that will get us what we need
why because bankers are smart people and like water they will find cracks
in any set of rules you design a set of rules that will make sure that the particular reason why the financial system almost collapsed
again it is naive beyond description to think that having blocked this source of financial collapse you have blocked all possible
sources of financial collapse so it's just a question of waiting for the next one and then marveling at how we could have been so stupid as not to protect ourselves against that
what we desperately need beyond or along with better rules and reasonably smart incentives is we need virtue we need character
we need people who want to do the right thing and in particular the virtue that we need most of all
is the virtue that aristotle called practical wisdom practical wisdom is the moral
will to do the right thing and the moral skill to figure out what the right thing is so aristotle was very
in watching how the craftsmen around him worked and he was impressed at how they would improvise novel solutions to novel problems problems that they hadn't anticipated
so one example is he sees these stonemasons working on the isle of lesbos and they need to measure out round columns
well if you think about it it's really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler
so what do they do they fashion a novel solution to the problem they created a ruler that bends what we would call these days a tape measure
a flexible rule a rule that bends and aristotle said hah they appreciated that sometimes to design rounded columns you need to bend the
dealing with other people demands a kind of flexibility that no set of rules can encompass wise people know when and how
to bend the rules wise people know how to improvise the way my co author ken and i talk about it they are kind of like jazz musicians the rules are like the notes on the page
you started but then you dance around the notes on the page coming up with just the right combination for this particular moment with this particular set of fellow players
so for aristotle the kind of rule bending rule exception finding and improvisation
that you see in skilled craftsmen is exactly what you need to be a skilled moral craftsman and in interactions with people almost all the time it is this kind of
if you are a rule bender and an improviser mostly to serve yourself what you get is ruthless manipulation of other people
so it matters that you do this wise practice in the service of others and not in the service of yourself and so the will to do the right thing is just as important as the moral skill of improvisation
and exception finding together they comprise practical wisdom which aristotle thought was the master
virtue so i'll give you an example of wise practice in action it's the case of michael
he had a pretty low wage job he was supporting his wife and a child and the child was going to parochial school
then he lost his job
he panicked about being able to support his family one night he drank a little too much and he robbed a cab driver
stole dollar fifty he robbed him at gunpoint
it was a toy gun he got
he had never committed a crime before he was a responsible husband and father he had been faced with desperate circumstances
all this would do is wreck a family and so she improvised a sentence eleven months and not only that but release every day to go to work
it turned out the prosecutor was not happy
that judge forer ignored the sentencing guidelines and sort of invented her own and so he appealed and he asked for the mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery
he did after all have a toy gun the mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery is five years
had to follow the law and by the way this appeal went through after he had finished serving his sentence so he was out and working and michael disappeared
so that is an example both of wisdom in practice and the subversion of wisdom by rules that are meant of course to make things better now consider miss dewey miss dewey 's a teacher in a texas elementary school
she found herself listening to a consultant one day who was trying to help teachers boost the test scores of the kids so that the school would reach the elite category
in percentage of kids passing big tests all these schools in texas compete with one another to achieve these milestones and there are bonuses and various other treats that come if you beat the other schools
don't waste your time on kids who can't pass the test no matter what you do
third don't waste your time on kids who moved into the district too late for their scores to be counted focus all of your time and attention on the kids who are on the bubble
the so called bubble kids kids where your intervention can get them just maybe over the line from failing to passing so miss dewey heard this
and she shook her head in despair while fellow teachers were sort of cheering each other on and nodding approvingly it's like they were about to go play a football game for miss dewey this isn't why she became a teacher
now ken and i are not naive and we understand that you need to have rules you need to have incentives people have to make a living
but the problem with relying on rules and incentives is that they demoralize professional activity
and they demoralize professional activity in two senses first they demoralize the people who are engaged in the activity judge forer quits and miss dewey in completely disheartened
and second they demoralize the activity itself the very practice is demoralized and the practitioners are demoralized it creates people when you manipulate incentives to get people to do the right thing
it creates people who are addicted to incentives that is to say it creates people who only do things for incentives
now the striking thing about this is that psychologists have known this for thirty years psychologists have known about
negative consequences of incentivizing everything for thirty years we know that if you reward kids for drawing pictures they stop caring about the drawing and care only about the reward
if you reward kids for reading books they stop caring about what's in the books and only care about how long they are if you reward teachers for kids test scores they stop caring about educating and only care about test preparation
if you were to reward doctors for doing more procedures which is the current system they would do more if instead you reward doctors for doing
fewer procedures they will do fewer what we want of course is doctors who do just the right amount of procedures and do the right amount for the right reason
namely to serve the welfare of their patients psychologists have known this for decades and it's time for policymakers to start
paying attention and listen to psychologists a little bit instead of economists
and it doesn't have to be this way we think ken and i that there are real sources of hope we identify one set of people in all of these practices who we call canny outlaws these are people
who being forced to operate in a system that demands rule following and creates incentives find away around
the rules find a way to subvert the rules so there are teachers who have these scripts to follow and they know that if they follow these scripts the kids will learn nothing
and so what they do is they follow the scripts but they follow the scripts at double time and squirrel away little bits of extra time during which they teach in the way that they actually know is
so these are little ordinary everyday heroes and they're incredibly admirable but there's no way that they can sustain this kind of activity in the face of a system that either roots them out or grinds them down
so canny outlaws are better than nothing but it's hard to imagine any canny outlaw sustaining that for an indefinite period of time more hopeful
and we talk about several one in particular is a judge named robert russell
and one day he was faced with the case of gary pettengill pettengill was a twenty three year old vet
he was married he had a third kid on the way he suffered from ptsd in addition to the bad
and recurrent nightmares and he had started using marijuana
to ease some of the symptoms
he was only able to get part time work because of his back and so he was unable to earn enough to put food on the table and take care of his family so he started selling marijuana he was busted in a drug sweep
his family was kicked out of their apartment and the welfare system was threatening to take away his kids under normal sentencing procedures
judge russell would have had little choice but to sentence pettengill to serious jail time as a drug
but judge russell did have an alternative and that's because he was in a special court he was in a court called the veterans court
in the veterans court this was the first of its kind in the united states judge russell created the veterans court it was a court only for veterans who had broken the law
and he had created it exactly because mandatory sentencing laws were taking the judgment out of
no one wanted non violent offenders and especially non violent offenders who were veterans to boot to be thrown into prison
they wanted to do something about what we all know namely the revolving door of the criminal justice system and what the veterans court did was it treated each criminal as an individual tried to get inside their problems
to fashion responses to their crimes that helped them to rehabilitate themselves and didn't forget about them once the judgment was made stayed with them followed up on them made sure that they were sticking to whatever plan
had been jointly developed to get them over the hump there are now twenty two cities that have veterans courts like this why has the idea
well one reason is that judge russell has now seen one hundred and eight vets in his veterans court
as of february of this year and out of one hundred and eight guess how many have gone back through the revolving door of justice into prison none
anyone would glom onto a criminal justice system that has this kind of a record so here 's is a system
and it seems to be catching there's a banker who created a for profit community bank that encouraged bankers i know this is hard to believe encouraged bankers who worked there to do well
by doing good for their low income clients the bank helped finance the rebuilding of what was otherwise a dying community
though their loan recipients were high risk by ordinary standards the default rate was extremely low the bank was profitable
the bankers stayed with their loan recipients they didn't make loans and then sell the loans they serviced the loans they made sure that their loan recipients were
staying up with their payments banking hasn't always been the way we read about it now in the newspapers
even goldman sachs once used to serve clients before it turned into an institution
that serves only itself banking wasn't always this way and it doesn't have to be this way
so there are examples like this in medicine doctors at harvard who are trying to transform medical education
so that you don't get a kind of ethical erosion and loss of empathy which characterizes most medical students in the course of their medical training and the way they do it is to give third year medical students patients who they follow for an entire year
so the patients are not organ systems and they're not diseases they're people people with lives and in order to be an effective doctor you need to treat people who have lives and not just disease in addition to which there's an enormous amount of back and forth mentoring
of one student by another of all the students by the doctors and the result is a generation we hope of doctors who do have time for the people they treat we'll see
so there are lots of examples like this that we talk about each of them shows that it is possible to build on and nurture character
and keep a profession true to its proper mission what aristotle would have called its
and ken and i believe that this is what practitioners actually want people want to be allowed to be virtuous
they want to have permission to do the right thing they don't want to feel like they need to take a shower to get the moral grime off their bodies everyday when they come home from work
aristotle thought that practical wisdom was the key to happiness and he was right there's now a lot of research being done in psychology on what makes people happy
and the two things that jump out in study after study i know this will come as a shock to all of you the two things that matter most to happiness are love and work
rules and incentives don't tell you how to be a good friend how to be a good parent how to be a good spouse or how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer or a good teacher
rules and incentives are no substitutes for wisdom indeed we argue there is no substitute for wisdom and so practical wisdom
does not require heroic acts of self sacrifice on the part of practitioners in giving us the will
