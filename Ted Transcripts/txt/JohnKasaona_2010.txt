how is it possible for a man with so much time to tell his story in eighteen minutes i think it will be quite a challenge for me
these days they talk about famine hiv and
my story that i would like to share with you today is the one about success
it is about a country in the southwest of africa
has got two point one million people
but it is only twice the size of i come from
in the remote northwest part of the country it's called kunene region
and in the center of kunene region is the village of sesfontain this is where i was born this is where i'm coming from
most people that are following and brad pitt will
they love namibia for its beautiful dunes
that are even taller than the and time have
and time have very strange shapes
very strange shapes to this
to this a himba
you might wonder why are you wearing these western clothes i'm a himba and namibian a himba is one of the twenty nine ethnic groups in namibia we live
i grew up herding looking after our livestock goats sheep and cattle and one
my father actually took me into the bush he said
i want you to become
just walk up to it
and smack it on the
and he will let go of the goat and may not
then he said if you see a you
in this way i actually started to learn about
in addition to being a himba i'm also
and it is very important
and hunt as they wished but we black we were not
to use wildlife whenever we tried to we were called
and as a result we were fined and locked up
for control over my country and
you know during war time there are militaries armies that and the
and tusks and they could sell these things for anything
the same year almost every himba had was almost at the
was almost at the when
went into the house of one of our neighbors and took his sleeping child out of
even today that memory is still in people 's mind they can pinpoint the exact location where this all happened
you just go to school and they sent me off to school just to get busy somewhere there and the year i went to school
actually got a job with a non governmental organization called irdnc integrated rural development and nature conservation
they actually spend a lot of
a year in the communities they were trusted by the local communities like despair surrounded joshua and
then the people from irdnc proposed to
do you have anybody in your communities or people
that know the bush very well and that
and that doing elsewhere
doing elsewhere has helped
as people started feeling ownership
started coming back and that's actually becoming a foundation for conservation in namibia
with independence the whole approach of community getting involved was embraced by that actually help
to build on this foundation the very first one
and being open to new at every himba
and at this sacred fire the
speak through the headman and advise us where to get water where to get grazings and where to go
and i think this is the best way the environment
and here are the new using
i think is much easier than talking through a spirit that you can't see isn't it and these things we were taught by outsiders we learned these things from
we needed new boundaries to describe our traditional lands
we needed to learn more things like gps just to see whether
can gps really reflect the true reflection of the land or is this just a thing made somewhere in the west and we then wanted to see whether we can match our ancestral maps with digital maps made somewhere in the world
we actually started realizing our dreams
and we maintained honoring our traditions but we were still open to new ideas
the second element is that we wanted to have a life
we can benefit through many things most poachers like my father
like my father our own people
and sometimes once they were caught they
brought back into the communities and they were made part of the
they were put in charge to stop others from
when this thing started going on we started becoming one community we knew our connection to nature and that was a very very strong thing in namibia
the last element that actually helped develop these things was the given legal status over
the other partners that we have got is business communities
bring namibia onto the world
and they have also helped
and most of my conservation colleagues today that you find in namibia have been trained
through the initiative through the involvement of world wildlife
in the most up to date conservation practices they have also given funding for two decades to this whole program and so far with the support of world wildlife fund
been able to scale up the very small programs to national programs
was no more an isolated village somewhere hidden away in
we are now part of the global village
since my father 's first job as a community game guard it's unfortunate that he passed away
and he cannot see the as i
as i twenty lions in the
twenty lions in the one hundred and
in the world this is outside the
now in big numbers but they are now far away from our village because the natural plain has and everything they
this other thing has multiplied from of animals
and what started as very small community rangers getting community involved has now
has now instituted institutions
and these are run by the communities themselves for their benefit today we have got sixty
that manage and protect over thirteen million hectares of land in namibia we have
in the world has community
in two thousand and eight conservancy generated five point seven million dollars this is
based on the respect of our natural resources and we are able to use this money for many things very important
we invest this money in aids and hiv education you know that africa is being affected by
and this is the good news from africa that we have to shout from the
help me and our partners great plains
where buffalo and other animals have suffered
and many communities are in decline that
and africa serving as a model to the united states
we were successful in namibia because we
much more than just a healthy
come and talk to me about
and better yet come to namibia and see for yourself how we have done it
learn more and see how you can help cbnrm
in africa and across the world and
