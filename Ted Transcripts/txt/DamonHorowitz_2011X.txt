that is the word that comes to mind
we 're the new technologists we have a lot of data so we have a lot of power
how much power do we have scene from a movie apocalypse now great movie
we 've got to get our hero captain willard to the mouth of the nung river so he can go pursue colonel kurtz the way we 're going to do this is fly him in and drop him off so the scene the sky is filled with this fleet of helicopters carrying him in and there 's this loud thrilling music in the background this wild music
because of all of the data that we have let 's take an example what can we do with just one person 's data what can we do with that guy 's data
i can look at your financial records i can tell if you pay your bills on time i know if you 're good to give a loan to i can look at your medical records i can see if your pump is still pumping see if you 're good to offer insurance to
i can look at your clicking patterns when you come to my website i actually know what you 're going to do already because i 've seen you visit millions of websites before and i 'm sorry to tell you you 're like a poker player you have a tell i can tell with data analysis what you 're going to do before you even do it i know what you like i know who you are and that 's even before
what 's the right thing to do
now i see some puzzled looks like why are you asking us what 's the right thing to do
we 're just building this stuff somebody else is using it fair enough but it brings me back
some of our great technologists then some of our great physicists studying nuclear fission and fusion just nuclear stuff we gather together these physicists in los alamos
so we can make money so we can protect ourselves if he was up to no good or should we respect his privacy protect his dignity and leave him alone
i 'm sure everybody here has an opinion about iphone versus android let 's do a show of hands
to make his experiences better and to protect ourselves in case he 's up to no good or should we leave him alone collect his data leave
leave you 're safe
okay last question harder question
when trying to evaluate what we should do
in this case should we use a kantian deontological moral framework or should we use a millian consequentialist one not as many votes
about our hand held devices than about the moral framework we should use to guide our decisions how do we know what to do with all the power we have if we don 't have a moral framework
we know more about mobile operating systems
but what we really need is a moral operating system
and maybe if we want to be on surer footing what we really want is a moral framework that will help guide us there that will tell us what kinds of things are right and wrong in the first place and how would we know in a given situation what to do
so let 's get a moral framework we 're numbers people living by numbers how can we use numbers as the basis for a moral framework
i know a guy who did exactly that
plato that 's right remember him old philosopher you were sleeping during that class
if you 've got two of something you add two more you get four that 's true no matter what thing you 're talking about it 's an objective truth about the form of two the abstract form when you have two of anything two eyes two ears two noses just two protrusions those all partake of the form of two they all participate in the truths
what if there were a pure form of justice what if there are truths about justice and you could just look around in this world and see which things participated partook of that form of justice then you would know
what was really just and what wasn 't it wouldn 't be a matter of just opinion or just appearances
that 's a stunning vision i mean think about that how grand how ambitious that 's as ambitious as we are he wants to solve
aristotle thought ethics wasn 't a lot like math he thought ethics was a matter of making decisions in the here and now using our best judgment to find
the right path if you think that plato 's not your guy but don 't give up maybe there 's another way that we can use numbers as the basis of our moral framework
look at the choices measure out which one 's better and know what to do that sound familiar that 's a utilitarian moral framework john stuart mill was a great advocate of this nice guy besides and only been dead two hundred years so
basis of utilitarianism i 'm sure you 're familiar at least the three people who voted for mill before are familiar with this but
here 's the way it works what if morals what if what makes something moral is just a matter of if it maximizes pleasure and minimizes pain
it does something intrinsic to the act it 's not like its relation to some abstract form it 's just a matter of the consequences you just look at the consequences and see if overall it 's for the good or for the worse that would be simple then we know what to do let 's take an example suppose i go up
and i say i 'm going to take your phone not just because it rang earlier
that has a very high utility to prevent that damage and compared to the little pain that it 's going to cause because it 's going to be embarrassing when i 'm looking on his phone and seeing that he has a farmville problem and that whole bit
that 's overwhelmed by the value of looking at
choice but maybe you don 't feel that way either maybe you think it 's his phone it 's wrong to take his phone so let 's stop
we 're right in the thick of it this philosophical thicket and this goes on for thousands of years because these are hard questions and i 've only got fifteen minutes so let 's cut to the chase
how should we be making our decisions is it
there 's not a formula
happily we 're not machines and we can do it not only can we think we must hannah arendt said
the sad truth is that most evil done in this world is not done by people who choose to be evil it arises from not thinking that 's what she called the banality of evil
and the response to that is that we demand the exercise of thinking from every sane person
so let 's do that let 's think in fact let 's start right now every person in this room do this think of the last time you had a decision to make where you were worried to do the right thing where you wondered what should i be doing bring that to mind and now
reflect on that and say how did i come up that decision what did i do did i follow my gut did i have somebody vote on it or did i punt to legal or now we have a few more choices good work
what you just did that 's the first step towards taking responsibility for what we should do with all of our power
now the next step try this
go find a friend and explain to them how you made that decision not right now wait till i finish talking do it over lunch and don 't just find another technologist friend
or heaven forbid find a philosopher and talk to them in fact find somebody from the humanities why because they think about problems differently than we do as technologists
you 're thinking about the relevance of seventeenth century french theater how does that bear upon venture capital well that 's interesting that 's a different way of thinking and when you think in that way you become more sensitive to the human considerations
which are crucial to making ethical decisions so imagine that right now you went
and you found your musician friend and you 're telling him what we 're talking about about our whole data revolution and all this maybe even hum a few bars of our theme music dum ta da da dum dum ta da da dum well your musician friend will stop you and say you know the theme music for your data revolution that 's an opera
that 's wagner it 's based on norse legend it 's gods and mythical creatures fighting over magical
jewelry that 's interesting now it 's also a beautiful opera and we 're moved by that
about right and wrong and we care about right and wrong
we care what happens in that opera we care what happens in apocalypse now and we certainly care what happens with our technologies we have so much power today it is up to us to figure out what to do and that 's the good news
we 're the ones writing this opera this is our movie we figure out what will happen with this technology we determine how this will all end thank you
