but for a school it could be very difficult virtual dissection table
the dissection without a human cadaver
and the table form is important
so this is exactly the way students will see the real anatomy as you can see
so i cut right here
then it 's going to show inside
and i can change my cut
you can see some internal organs
so we call this the slicer mode
so if i want to see the back side i can flip and see from behind
uncomfortable to you or disturbing to you
so instead of just butchering the body i 'd like to do more clinically meaningful dissections what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to peel off all the skin muscles and bones just to see a few internal organs
you don 't want to hear oops in real surgery
i 'm going to make a cut right there
so let me show you i 'm going to start with the skeletal structure
and i can add a few internal organs
and i can build muscles
another thing i can show you
and also if you want you can compare
and then it 's ready for another session
