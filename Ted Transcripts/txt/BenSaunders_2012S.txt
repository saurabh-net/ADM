does the constant supply of information steal our ability to imagine or replace our dreams of achieving after all if it is being done somewhere by someone and we can participate virtually then why
job titles but i 've spent more than two percent now of my entire life living in a tent inside the arctic circle so i get out of the house a fair bit and in my nature i guess i am a doer of things more than i am a spectator or a contemplator of things and it 's that
dichotomy the gulf between ideas and action that i 'm going to try and explore briefly
the pithiest answer to the question why that 's been dogging me for the last twelve years
there is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever oh we may learn a little about the behavior of the human body at high altitudes and possibly medical men may turn our observation to some account for the purposes of aviation
but otherwise nothing will come of it we shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver and not a gem nor any coal or iron we shall not find a single foot of earth that can be planted with crops to raise food so it is no use
if you cannot understand that there is something in man which responds to the challenge of this mountain and goes out to meet it that the struggle is the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward then you won 't see why we go
leaving the house embarking on these grand adventures is joyful and fun however doesn 't tally that neatly with my own experience the furthest i 've ever got away from my front door was in the spring of two thousand and four i still don 't know exactly what came over me but my plan
was to make a solo and unsupported crossing of the arctic ocean
i planned essentially to walk from the north coast of russia to the north pole and then to carry on to the north coast of canada no one had ever done this i was twenty six at the time
a lot of experts were saying it was impossible and my mum certainly wasn 't very keen on the idea
felix baumgartner going up rather than just coming down you 'll appreciate the sense of apprehension as i sat in a helicopter thundering north and the sense i think if anything of impending doom i sat there wondering what on earth i had gotten myself into
there was a bit of fun a bit of joy i was twenty six i remember sitting there looking down at my sledge i had my skis ready to go i had a satellite phone a pump action shotgun in case i was attacked by a polar bear i remember looking out of the window and seeing the second helicopter we were both thundering through this incredible siberian
and that journey lasted ten weeks seventy two days i didn 't see anyone else we took this photo next to the helicopter beyond that i didn 't see anyone for ten weeks
the north pole is slap bang in the middle of the sea so i 'm traveling over the frozen surface of the arctic ocean nasa described conditions that year as the worst since records began i was dragging one hundred and eighty kilos of food and fuel and supplies about four hundred pounds the average temperature for the ten weeks was minus thirty five minus fifty was the coldest
so again there wasn 't an awful lot of joy or fun to be had
for nearly three months was unique to me no one else will ever could ever possibly see the views the vistas that i saw for ten weeks
and that i guess is probably the finest argument for leaving the house i can try to tell you what it was like
but you 'll never know what it was like and the more i try to explain that i felt lonely i was the only human being in five point four million square miles it was cold nearly minus seventy five with windchill on a bad day the more words fall short and i 'm unable to do it justice
and it seems to me therefore that
the doing you know to try to experience to engage to endeavor rather than to watch and to wonder that 's where the real meat of life is to be found the juice that we can suck out of our hours and days
and i would add a cautionary note here however in my experience there is something addictive about tasting life at the very
edge of what 's humanly possible now i don 't just mean in the field of daft macho edwardian style derring do but also in the fields of pancreatic cancer there is something addictive about this and in my case i think polar expeditions are perhaps not that far removed from
having a crack habit i can 't explain quite how good it is until you 've tried it but it has the capacity to burn up all the money i can get my hands on to ruin every relationship i 've ever had so be careful what you wish for
scott set out just over a hundred years ago to try to become the first person to reach the south pole no one knew what was there it was utterly unmapped at the time we knew more about the surface of the moon than we did about the heart of antarctica
scott as many of you will know was beaten to it by roald amundsen and his norwegian team who used dogs and dogsleds scott 's team were on foot all five of them wearing harnesses and dragging around sledges and they arrived at the pole to find the norwegian flag already there i 'd imagine pretty bitter and demoralized
there is a sort of misconception nowadays that it 's all been done in the fields of exploration and adventure when i talk about antarctica people often say hasn 't you know that 's interesting hasn 't that blue peter presenter just done it on a
but scott 's journey remains unfinished no one has ever walked from the very coast of antarctica to the south pole and back again it is arguably the most audacious endeavor of that edwardian golden age of exploration and it seemed to me high time given everything we have figured out
in the century since from scurvy to solar panels that it was high time someone had a go at finishing the job so that 's precisely what i 'm setting out to do this time next year in october i 'm leading a team of three
and it 'll also be a four month chance for me to finally come up with a pithy answer to the question why
if i wanted to know for example how many stars were in the milky way how old those giant heads on easter island were most of you could find that out right now without even standing up
and yet if i 've learned anything in nearly twelve years now of dragging heavy things around cold places it is that true real inspiration and growth only comes from adversity and from challenge
from stepping away from what 's comfortable and familiar and stepping out into the unknown
in life we all have tempests to ride and poles to walk to and i think metaphorically speaking at least we could all benefit from getting outside the house a little more often if only we could sum up the courage i certainly would implore you to open the door just a little bit and take a look at what 's outside
