way out on a limb and say that it is the most diverting paper ever published in the journal of ultrasound in medicine the title is observations of in utero masturbation
now on the left you can see the hand that's the big arrow and the penis on the right the hand hovering
and over here we have in the words of radiologist israel meisner the
the penis in a fashion resembling masturbation movements bear in mind this was an ultrasound so it would have been moving images
above the level of their injury wherever that is there is such a thing as a knee orgasm in the literature
i think the most curious one that i came across was a case report of a woman who had an orgasm every time she brushed her teeth this was
sensory motor action of brushing her teeth was triggering orgasm and she went to a neurologist who was fascinated he checked to see if it was something in the toothpaste but no it happened with any brand
they stimulated her gums with a toothpick to see if that was doing it no it was the whole you know motion
and the amazing thing to me is that now you would think this woman would like have excellent oral hygiene
she this is what it said in the journal paper she believed that she was possessed by demons and switched to mouthwash for her oral care it's
interviewed when i was working on the book i interviewed a woman who can think herself to orgasm she was part of a study at rutgers university you gotta love that
i interviewed her in oakland in a sushi restaurant and i said so could you do it right here and she said yeah but i'd rather finish my meal if you
but afterwards she was kind enough to demonstrate on a bench outside it was remarkable it took about one minute and i said to her are you just doing this all the time
no honestly when i get home i'm usually too tired
she said that the last time she had done it was on the disneyland tram
you will trigger an orgasm and it is a fact that you can trigger spinal reflexes in dead people
a certain kind of dead person a beating heart cadaver now this is somebody who is braindead legally dead definitely checked out
but is being kept alive on a respirator so that their organs will be oxygenated for transplantation now in one of these braindead people
if you trigger the right spot you will see something every now and then there is a reflex called the lazarus reflex and this is
very unsettling for people working in
you can trigger the lazarus
in a dead person why not the orgasm reflex i asked this question to a brain death expert stephanie mann who was foolish enough to return my emails i said so
could you concievably trigger an orgasm in a dead person she said yes if the sacral nerve is being oxygenated you conceivably could
writing a book ideal marriage you know very heavy hetero guy but he wrote in this book ideal marriage he said that he could differentiate between the semen of a young man which he said had a fresh exhilarating smell
the semen of mature men whose semen smelled quote remarkably like that of the flowers of the spanish chestnut sometimes quite freshly floral and then again sometimes extremely pungent
ninety nine in the state of israel a man began hiccuping and this was one of those cases that went on and on he tried everything his friends suggested nothing seemed to help
days went by at a certain point the man still hiccuping had sex with his wife and lo and behold the hiccups went away he told his doctor who
at a certain point they suggested that unattached hiccupers could try masturbation
because there is like a whole demographic unattached married single
in the nineteen hundreds early nineteen hundreds gynecologists a lot of gynecologists believed that when a woman has an orgasm the contractions serve to
suck the semen up through the cervix and sort of deliver it really quickly to the egg thereby upping the odds of conception it was called the upsuck theory
if you go all the way back to hippocrates physicians believed that orgasm in women was not just helpful for conception but
necessary doctors back then were routinely telling men the importance of pleasuring their wives in his book
i loved this guy i got a lot of mileage out of theodore van de velde he had this line
his book that supposedly comes from the habsburg monarchy where there was an empress maria theresa who was having trouble
i don't know on the record somewhere
was five women and outfitted them with cervical caps containing artificial semen
and in the artificial semen was a radio opaque substance such that it would show up on an x ray this is the nineteen fifties
women sat in front of an x ray device and they masturbated and masters and johnson looked to see if the semen was being sucked up did not find any evidence of upsuck
you may be wondering how do you make artificial semen
i have an answer for you i have two answers you can use flour and water or cornstarch and water i actually found three separate recipes in the literature
my favorite being the one that says you know they have the ingredients listed and then in a recipe it will say for example yield two dozen cupcakes this one said yield one ejaculate
less effective at head banging their way into the egg british sexologist roy levin has speculated that
this is perhaps why men evolved to be such enthusiastic and frequent masturbators he said if i keep tossing myself off i get fresh sperm being made which i thought was an interesting
idea theory so now you have an evolutionary excuse
there is considerable evidence for upsuck in the animal kingdom
pigs for instance in denmark the danish national committee for
pig production found out that if you sexually stimulate a sow while you artificially inseminate her you will see a six percent increase in the farrowing rate which is the number of piglets produced
so they came up with this plan this five point stimulation plan for the sows and they had the farmers there is posters they put in the barn and they have a dvd and i got a copy of this dvd
this is my unveiling because i am going to show you a clip
all looks very innocent he 's going to be doing things with his hands that the boar would use his snout lacking hands okay
the boar has a very odd courtship repertoire the weight of the
a point in this video towards the beginning where they zoom in for a close up of his hand with his wedding ring as if to say it 's okay it's just his job
now i said when i was in denmark my host was named anne marie and i said
why don't you just stimulate the clitoris of the pig why don't you have the farmers do that that's not one of your five steps she said i have to read you what she said because i love it she said
it was a big hurdle just to get farmers to touch underneath the vulva so we thought let 's not mention the clitoris right now
because as i mentioned the clitoris is inside the vagina so possibly you know a little more arousing than it looks
and i also said to her now these sows i mean you may have noticed there the sow doesn't look to be in the throes of ecstasy and she said
you can't make that conclusion because animals don't register pain or pleasure on their faces in the same way that we do they tend to
pigs for example are more like dogs they use the upper half of the face the ears are very expressive so you're not really sure what's going on with the pig primates on the other hand we use our
this is the ejaculation face of the stump tailed macaque and interestingly this has been observed in female macaques but only when mounting another female
with women a lot of this is happening inside this did not stop masters and johnson they developed an artificial coition machine this is
kind of going like this and the woman would have sex with it that is what they would do pretty amazing sadly this device has been dismantled this just kills me not because i wanted to use it i wanted to see it one fine day
this was not idle curiosity doctor kinsey had heard and there was a theory kind of going around at the time this being the nineteen forties
that the force with which semen is thrown against the cervix was a factor in fertility
in fact he found that in three quarters of the men the stuff
just kind of slopped out it wasn't spurted or thrown or ejected under great force however the record holder landed just shy of the eight foot mark which is impressive
his name is not mentioned
in his write up in his write up of this experiment in his book kinsey wrote
two sheets were laid down to protect the oriental carpets
is my second favorite line in the entire ouevre of alfred kinsey my favorite being cheese crumbs spread before a pair of copulating rats
