in northern ireland right up in the very very north end of it there where it's absolutely freezing cold this is me running around in the back garden mid summer
i couldn't pick a career in ireland the obvious choice is the military but to be honest it actually kind of sucks
my mother wanted me to be a dentist but the problem was that people kept blowing everything up so i actually went to school in belfast which was where all the action happened
and this was a pretty common sight the school i went to was pretty boring they forced us to learn things like latin
the school teachers weren't having much fun the sports were very dirty or very painful so i cleverly chose rowing which i got very good at and i was actually rowing for my school here until this fateful day and i flipped over right in front of the entire school
and they left the programming manuals laying around and so students like myself with nothing to do we would learn how to program it
also around this time at home this was the computer that people were buying it was called the sinclair zx eighty this was a one k computer and you'd buy your programs on cassette tape
one second because i heard that there's a prerequisite to speak here at ted you have to have a picture of yourself from the old days with big hair so i brought a picture with big hair i just want to get that out of the way so after the sinclair zx eighty
came along the very cleverly named sinclair zx eighty one and you see the picture at the bottom there's a picture of a guy doing homework with his son that's what they thought they had built it for
this is the guy that invented it sir clive sinclair and he 's showing his machine you had this same thing in america it was called the timex sinclair one thousand
to play a game in those days you had to have an imagination to believe that you were really playing battlestar galactica the graphics were just horrible you had to have an even better imagination to play this game death rider
but of course the scientists couldn't help themselves they started making their own video games this is one of my favorite ones here where they have rabbit breeding so males choose the lucky rabbit
was around this time we went from one k to sixteen k which was quite the leap and if you're wondering how much sixteen k is this ebay logo here is sixteen k
and in that amount of memory someone programmed a full flight simulation program and that's what it looked like
i spent ages flying this flight simulator and i honestly believed i could fly airplanes by the end of it here 's clive sinclair now launching his
color computer he 's recognized as being the father of video games in europe he 's a multi millionaire and i think that's why he 's smiling in this photograph
so i went on for the next twenty years or so making a lot of different games some of the highlights were things like the terminator aladdin
the teenage mutant hero turtles because i was from the united kingdom they thought the word ninja was a little too mean for children so they decided to call it hero instead i personally preferred the spanish version which was tortugas ninja
then the last game i did was based on trying to get the video game industry in hollywood to actually work together on something instead of licensing from each other to actually work now chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me
that the video game industry in two thousand and five became a twenty nine billion dollar business it grows every year last year was the biggest year
by two thousand and eight we're going to kick the butt of the music industry by two thousand and ten we're going to hit forty two billion forty three percent of gamers are female so there's a lot more female gamers than people are really aware
the average age of gamers well obviously it's for children right well no actually it's thirty years old and interestingly the people who buy the most games are thirty seven so thirty seven is our target audience
all video games are violent of course the newspapers love to beat on this but eighty three percent of games don't have any mature content whatsoever
so it's just not true online gaming statistics i brought some stuff on world of warcraft it's five point five million players it makes about eighty million bucks a month in subscriptions it costs fifty bucks just to install it on your computer
making the publisher about another two hundred and seventy five million the game costs about eighty million dollars to make so basically it pays for itself in about a month a player in a game called project entropia
actually bought his own island for twenty six thousand five hundred dollars you have to remember that this is not a real island he didn't actually buy anything just some data
but he got great terms on it this purchase included mining and hunting rights ownership of all land on the island and a castle with no furniture included
this market is now estimated at over eight hundred million dollars annually and what's interesting about it is the market was actually created by the gamers themselves
they found clever ways to trade items and to sell their accounts to each other so that they could make money while they were playing their games
it turns out they're actually in hollywood bowl in los angeles listening to the l a philharmonic playing video game music
that's what the show looks like you would expect it to be cheesy but it's not it's very very epic and a very beautiful concert and the people that went there absolutely loved it
you think these people are doing they're actually bringing their computers so they can play games against each other and this is happening in every city around the world this is happening in your local cities too you're probably just not aware of it
i want you to do is to try to understand it we're on this curve and the graphics are getting so ridiculously better and i'm going to show you up to maybe two thousand and seven so
you need to be really an incredible artist and once we get enough of those guys we're going to want more fantasy artists that can create places we've never been to before or characters that we've just never seen before
so the obvious thing for me to talk about today is graphics and audio but if you were to go to a game developers conference what they're all talking about is emotion purpose meaning understanding and feeling
hear about talks like can a video game make you cry and these are the kind of topics we really actually care about
i came across a student who 's absolutely excellent at expressing himself and this student agreed that he would
i like many of you live somewhere between reality and video games some part of me a true living breathing person has become programmed electronic and virtual
the boundary of my brain that divides real from fantasy has finally begun to crumble i'm a video game addict and this is my story the
year of my birth the nintendo entertainment system also went into development
i played in the backyard learned to read and even ate some of my vegetables
but as was the case for most of my generation
i spent a lot of time in front of the tv
when my parents bought my sister and i our first i'm a video game
it's not because of a certain number of hours i have spent playing or nights i have gone without sleep to finish the next level it is because i have had life altering experiences in virtual space and video games had begun to erode my own understanding of what is
i'm addicted because even though i know i'm losing my grip on
from an early age i learned to invest myself emotionally in what unfolded before me on screen
today after twenty years of watching tv geared to make me emotional
a decent insurance commercial can bring tears to my eyes
am just one of a new generation that is growing up
a generation who may experience much more meaning through video games than they will through the real world video games are nearing an evolutionary leap
a point where game worlds will look and feel just as real as the films we see in theatres or the news we watch on tv and while my sense of free will in these virtual worlds may still be limited what i do learn applies to my real life second quarter mile
unlike any pop culture phenomenon before it video games actually allow us to become part of
but the beauty of video games
lies not in the lifelike graphics the vibrating joysticks or virtual surround sound
lies in that these games are beginning to make me emotional
a well designed video game will seamlessly weave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience as one becomes more experienced the awareness of physical control melts
just me and the game
the fate of the world my hands
i know violent video games make my mother worry what troubles me is not that video game violence is becoming more and more like real life violence but that real life violence is starting to look more and more
these are all troubles outside of myself
i however have a problem very close to home something has happened
perhaps there is a single part of our brain that holds all of our gut instincts the things we know to do before we even think while some of these instincts may be innate most are learned and all of them are hardwired into our brains
these instincts are essential for survival in both real and virtual worlds
only in recent years has the technology behind video games allowed for a true overlap
as gamers we are now living by the same laws of physics in the same cities and doing many of the same things we once did in real life only virtually
consider this my real life car has about twenty five thousand miles on it in all my driving games i've driven a total of thirty one four hundred and fifty nine
to some degree i've learned how to drive from the game the sensory cues are very similar it's a funny feeling when you have spent more time doing something on the tv
when i am driving down a road at sunset all i can think is this is almost as beautiful as my games are for my virtual worlds are perfect more beautiful and rich than the real world around us
i'm not sure what the implications of my experience
today i believe big brother would find much more success brainwashing the masses with video games rather than just simply tvs video games are fun
engaging and leave your brain completely vulnerable to
but maybe brainwashing isn't always
the future of video games holds for our civilization but as virtual and real world experiences increasingly overlap there is a greater and greater potential for other people to feel the same way i do
what i have only recently come to realize is that beyond the graphics sound game play and emotion it is the power to break down reality that is so fascinating and addictive to me
i know though that no matter how amazing video games may
or how flat the real world may seem to us that we must stay aware of what our games are teaching us and how they leave us feeling when we finally do unplug
i found that video very very thought provoking and that's why i wanted to bring it here for you guys to see and what was interesting about it is the obvious choice for me to talk about was graphics and audio but as you heard michael talked about all
elements as well video games give an awful lot of other things too and that's why people get so addicted the most important one being fun
the name of this track is the magic to come who is that going to come from is it going to come from the best directors in the world as we thought it probably would i don't think so i think it's going to come from
the children who are growing up now that aren't stuck with all of the stuff that we remember from the past they're going to do it their way using the tools that we've created the same with students or highly creative people writers and people like that
as far as colleges go there's about three hundred and fifty colleges around the world teaching video game courses a
this is my daughter her name 's emma she's seventeen months old and i've been asking myself what is emma going to experience in the video game world and as i've shown here
we have the audience she's never going to know a world where you can't press a button and have millions of people ready to play you know we have the technology she's never going to know a world where the graphics just aren't stunning and really immersive
and as the student video showed we can impact and move she's never going to know a world where video games aren't incredibly emotional and will probably make her cry i just hope she likes video games
