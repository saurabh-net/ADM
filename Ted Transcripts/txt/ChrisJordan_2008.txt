is about the behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously on a collective level
and what i mean by that it's the behaviors that we're in denial about and the ones that operate below the surface of our daily awareness
and as individuals we all do these things all the time everyday it's like when you're mean to your wife because you're mad at somebody else
or when you overeat because your feelings are hurt or whatever and
when we do these kind of things when three hundred million people do unconscious behaviors then it can add up to a catastrophic consequence that nobody wants and no one intended and that's what i look at with my photographic work
and as you get a little bit closer it starts looking like lots of pipes like maybe a
and in fact this is one million plastic cups which is the number of plastic cups that are used on airline flights in the united states every six hours
we use four million cups a day on airline flights and virtually none of them are reused or recycled they just don't do that in that industry
now that number is dwarfed by the number of paper cups we use every day and that is forty million cups a day for hot beverages most of which is coffee i couldn't fit forty million cups on a canvas but i was able to put four hundred and ten thousand
speaking of justice there's another phenomenon going on in our culture that i find deeply troubling and that is that america right now has the largest percentage of its population in prison of any country on earth
one out of four people one out of four humans in prison
are americans imprisoned in our country
and i wanted to show the number the number is two point three million americans were incarcerated in two thousand and five and that's gone up since then but we don't have the numbers yet so i wanted to show two point three million prison uniforms
and in the actual print of this piece each uniform is the size of a nickel on its edge they're tiny they're barely visible as a piece of material
and to show two point three million of them required a canvas that was larger than any printer in the world would print and so i had to divide it up into multiple panels that are ten feet tall by twenty five feet wide
more than four hundred thousand people die in the united states every year from smoking cigarettes and so this piece is made up of lots and lots of boxes of cigarettes and as you slowly step back you see that it's a painting by van gogh called skull with cigarette
it's a strange thing to think about that on nine eleven when that tragedy happened three thousand americans died and do you remember the response it reverberated around the world
the tobacco lobby it's too strong we just dismiss it out of our consciousness
and knowing what we know
about the destructive power of cigarettes we continue to allow our children our sons and daughters to be in the presence of the influences that start them smoking
and this is what the next piece is about this is just lots and lots of cigarettes sixty five thousand cigarettes which is equal to the number of teenagers
who will start smoking this month and every month in the us more than seven hundred thousand children in the united states aged eighteen and under begin smoking every year
one more strange epidemic in the united states that i want to acquaint you with is this
phenomenon of abuse and misuse of prescription drugs
this is an image i've made out of lots and lots of vicodin well actually i only had one vicodin that i scanned lots and lots of times
and so as you stand back you see two hundred and thirteen thousand vicodin pills which is the number of hospital emergency room visits yearly in the united states attributable to abuse and misuse of prescription painkillers and anti anxiety medications
one third of all drug overdoses in the u s and that includes cocaine heroin alcohol everything one third of drug overdoses are prescription medications
this is a piece that i just recently completed about another tragic phenomenon and that is the phenomenon this growing obsession we have with breast augmentation surgery
three hundred and eighty four thousand women american women last year
for elective breast augmentation surgery
given to young girls who are about to go off to college
so i made this image out of barbie dolls
and so as you stand back
you see this kind of floral pattern and as you get all the way back you see thirty two thousand barbie dolls which represents the number of breast augmentation surgeries that are performed in the u s each month
the vast majority of those are on women under the age of twenty one and strangely enough the only plastic surgery that is more popular than breast augmentation is liposuction and most of that is being done by men
have this fear that we aren't feeling enough as a culture right now
this kind of anesthesia in america at the moment
and our grief about what's going on in our culture right now what's going on in our country the atrocities that are being committed in our names around the world they've gone missing these feelings have gone missing our cultural joy our national joy is nowhere to be seen
and one of the causes of this i think is that as each of us attempts to build this new kind of world view this
this holographic image that we're all trying to create in our mind of the inter connection of things the environmental footprints one thousand miles away of the things that we buy the social consequences
ten thousand miles away of the daily decisions that we make as consumers as we try to build this view and try to educate ourselves about the enormity of our culture
the information that we have to work with is these gigantic numbers
bush 's new budget is in the trillions and these are numbers that our brain just doesn't have the ability to comprehend
we can't make meaning out of these enormous statistics
more than they do now
if we can find that
then we'll be able to find within each one of us
what it is that we need to find to face the big question
which is how do we change
that to me is the big question
that we face as a people right now how do we change how do we change as a culture each individually
take responsibility for the one piece of the solution that we are in charge
is that you don't have to make yourself
to look at these issues
not pointing the finger at america in a blaming way i'm simply saying this is who we are right now
if there are things that we see that we don't like about our culture then we have a choice
the degree of integrity that each of us can
bring to the surface to bring to this question
as we show up for the question of how do we change it's already defining us
and it will profoundly affect
the well being the quality of life
of the billions of people
i'm not speaking abstractly about this
this is who we are in this room
right now in this moment thank
