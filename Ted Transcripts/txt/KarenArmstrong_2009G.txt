years i've been feeling frustrated because as a religious historian i've become acutely aware of the centrality of compassion in
all the major world faiths every single one of them has evolved their own version of what's being called the golden rule
and equally important is the negative version don 't do to others what you would not like them to do to you
look into your own heart discover what it is that gives you pain and then refuse under any circumstance whatsoever to inflict that pain on anybody else
people have emphasized the importance of compassion not just because it sounds good but because it works people have
found that when they have implemented the golden rule as confucius said all day and every day not just a question of doing your good deed for the day and then
returning to a life of greed and egotism but to do it all day and every day you dethrone yourself from the center of your world put another
know in our ego bound existence but you know you'd never know it a lot of the time that this was so central to the religious life
because with a few wonderful exceptions very often when religious people come together religious leaders come together they're arguing about abstruse doctrines
i sometimes see when i'm speaking to a congregation of religious people a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces because people often want to be right instead
and that of course defeats the object of the exercise now why was i so grateful to ted because they took me very gently from my book lined study
brought me into the twenty one st century enabling me to speak to a much much wider audience than i could have ever conceived
because i feel an urgency about this if we don't manage to implement the golden rule
so that we treat all peoples wherever and whoever they may be as though they were as important as ourselves i doubt that we'll have a viable world to hand on to the next generation the task of our time
one of the great tasks of our time is to build a global society as i said where people can live together in peace and the religions that should be making a major contribution are instead
as part of the problem
and of course it's not just religious people who believe in the golden rule this is the source of all morality this imaginative act of empathy putting yourself in the
of another and so we have a choice it seems to me
we can either go on bringing out or emphasizing the dogmatic and intolerant aspects of our faith or we can
go back to the rabbis rabbi hillel the older contemporary of jesus who when asked by a pagan
to sum up the whole of jewish teaching while he stood on one leg said that which is hateful to you do not do to your neighbor that is the torah and everything else is only commentary
and the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that any interpretation of scripture that bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate
we need to revive that spirit and it's not just going to happen because a spirit of love wafts us down we have to make this happen and we can do it
the modern communications that ted has introduced already i've been tremendously heartened at the response of all our partners
in singapore we have a group going to use the charter to heal divisions recently
have sprung up in singaporean society and some members of the parliament want to implement it politically
in malaysia there is going to be an art exhibition in which leading artists are going to be taking
people young people and showing them that compassion also lies at the root of all art throughout europe
the muslim communities are holding events and discussions are discussing the centrality of compassion in islam and in all faiths
but it can't stop there it can't stop with the launch religious teaching this is where we've gone so wrong concentrating solely on believing abstruse doctrines religious teaching must always lead to action
and i intend to work on this till my dying day and i want to continue with our partners
to do two things educate and stimulate compassionate thinking
if you're just going to think about it you also have to do it i want them to get the media involved because the media are crucial
in helping to dissolve some of the stereotypical views we have of other people which are dividing us from one another the same applies to educators i'd like youth to get
a sense of the dynamism the dynamic and challenge of a compassionate lifestyle and also see that it demands acute intelligence not just a gooey feeling
i'd like to call upon scholars to explore the compassionate theme in their own and in other people 's traditions and perhaps above all
to encourage a sensitivity about uncompassionate speaking so that because people have this charter
whatever their beliefs or lack of them they feel empowered to challenge uncompassionate speech
thought of putting the charter online i was still stuck in the old world of a whole bunch of boffins sitting together in a room and issuing yet another arcane statement
and ted introduced me to a whole new way of thinking and presenting ideas because that is what is so wonderful about
in this room all this expertise if we joined it
we could change the world and of course the problems sometimes seem insuperable
but i'd just like to quote finish at the end with a reference to a british author an oxford author whom i don't quote very often
but he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind ever since i read it when i was a schoolgirl it's in his book the four loves
he said that he distinguished between erotic love when two people gaze spellbound into each other 's
eyes and then he compared that to friendship
when two people stand side by side as it were shoulder to shoulder with their eyes on a common goal
we don't have to fall in love with each other but we can become friends and
i am convinced i felt it very strongly during our little deliberations at vevey that when people of all different persuasions come together
working side by side for a common goal differences melt away and we learn amity and we learn to live together and to get to know one another thank you very much
