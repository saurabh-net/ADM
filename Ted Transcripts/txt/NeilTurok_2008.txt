was simply astonishing to me to find an organization that appreciated both those sides
so i thought i'd start off by just telling you a little bit about myself and why i lead this schizophrenic life
well i was born in south africa and my parents were imprisoned for resisting the racist regime
when they were released we left
and we went as refugees to kenya and tanzania both were very young countries then and full of hope for the future
we had an amazing childhood didn't have any money but we were outdoors most of the time we had fantastic friends
and we saw the wonders of the world like kilimanjaro serengeti and the olduvai gorge
well then we moved to london for high school and
much to say about that it was rather dull
but i came back to africa at the age of seventeen as a volunteer teacher to
which is a tiny country surrounded at that time by apartheid south africa
well eighty percent of the men in lesotho worked in the mines over the border in brutal conditions
which got through to me
to try to take the kids outside as often as possible to try to connect the academic stuff with the real world
but i took them outside one day and i said i want you to estimate the height of the building and i expected them to put a ruler next to the wall size it up with a finger and make an estimate of the height
one little boy very small for his age he was the son of one of the poorest families in the village and he wasn't doing that he was scribbling with chalk on the pavement
well i hadn't thought of that one
and many experiences like this happened to me another one is that i met a miner he was home on his three month leave from the mines
sitting next to him one day
he said there 's only one thing that i really loved at school me
these and many similar experiences convinced me that there are just tons of bright kids in africa
inventive kids intellectual kids and starved of opportunity and if africa is going to get fixed it's by them not well after
i traveled across africa before returning to england
so gray and depressing in comparison and i went to cambridge
and there i fell for theoretical physics well i'm not going to explain this equation but theoretical physics is really an amazing subject we can write down all the laws of physics we know in one line
and admittedly it's in a very shorthand notation
and it contains eighteen free parameters ok which we have to fit to the data
so it's not the final story but it's an incredibly powerful summary
of everything we know about nature at the most basic level
and apart from a few very important loose ends which you've heard about here like dark energy and dark matter this equation describes seems to describe everything about the universe and what's in it what banged
about the big bang what banged
and she's right it's a question we've all been avoiding the standard explanation is that the universe somehow sprang into existence full of a strange kind of energy inflationary energy
but the puzzle of why the universe emerged in that peculiar state is completely unsolved
now i worked on that theory for a while with stephen hawking and others
then i began to explore another alternative
the alternative is that the big bang wasn't the beginning
and the bang was just a violent event in a pre existing universe well this possibility is actually suggested by the latest theories
the unified theories which try to explain all those eighteen free parameters in a single framework which will hopefully predict all of them
and i'll just share a cartoon of this idea here it's all i can convey
according to these theories there are extra dimensions in space not just the three that we're familiar with but at every point in the room there are more dimensions and in particular there's one rather strange one
in the most elegant unified theories we have the strange one looks likes this that we live in a three dimensional world
we live in one of these worlds and i can only show it as a sheet but it's really three dimensional and a tiny distance away there's another
also three dimensional and they're separated by a gap the gap is very tiny and i've blown it up so you can see it but it's really a tiny fraction
of the size of an atomic nucleus i won 't go into the details of why we think the universe is like this but it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know
well i got interested in this because it seemed to me that it was an obvious question which is what happens if these two three dimensional worlds should actually collide
and if they collide it would look a lot like the big bang but it's slightly different than in the conventional picture the conventional picture of the big bang is a point
the bang is extended it's not a point the density of matter is finite and we have a chance of a consistent set of equations that can describe the whole process
so to cut a long story short we've explored this alternative we've shown that it can fit all of the data that we have
and in this scenario not only was the big bang not the beginning as you can see from the picture it can happen over and over again it may be that we live in an endless universe both in space and in time and there's been
bangs in the past and there will be bangs in the future
and maybe we live in an endless universe
well making and testing models of the universe
is for me the best way i have of enjoying and appreciating the universe we need to make the best
we really try to convince ourselves they're wrong that's progress when we prove things wrong and gradually we hopefully move closer and closer to understanding the world
i pursued my career something
was always gnawing away inside me what about africa what about those kids i'd left behind
but scale the area according to some quantity
so here 's just the standard area map of the world by the way africa is very large and the next map now shows africa 's gdp
and here 's a projection for two thousand and fifteen
big changes are happening in the world
but they're not helping africa what about africa 's population the population isn't out of proportion to its area but africa leads the world in deaths from often preventable causes malnutrition and birth complications
and birth complications then there's hiv aids
and then there's deaths from war
ok currently there are forty five thousand people a month dying in the congo
as a consequence of the war there over coltan and diamonds and other things it's still going on
what about africa 's capacity to do something about these problems well here 's the number of physicians in africa
here 's the number of people in higher education
and here most shocking to me the number of scientific research papers coming out of africa it just doesn't exist
and this was all very eloquently argued at ted africa
that all of the aid that's been given has completely failed to put africa onto its own two feet
my parents were both elected to the first parliament alongside nelson and winnie mandela they were the only other couple
and in two thousand and one i took a research leave to visit them
and while i was busy working i was working on these colliding worlds in the day and i learned that there was a desparate shortage of skills
in industry in government in education the ability to make and test models
not only to every single area of science today
but also to modern society itself
and if you don't have math
you're not going to enter the modern age
so i had an idea and the idea was very simple the idea was to set up an african institute for mathematical sciences or aims
try to give them a fantastic education
well as a cambridge professor i had many contacts and to my astonishment they backed me one hundred percent they said go and do it
with the best lecturers in the world who i knew would come because of the interest in africa
and put them together and just let the sparks fly
so we bought a derelict hotel near cape town
it's a eighty room art deco hotel from the nineteen twenties the area was kind of seedy so we got a eighty room hotel for one hundred thousand dollars it's a beautiful building
we decided we would refurbish it
and then put out the word we're going to start the best maths institute in africa in this hotel
well the new south africa is a very exciting country and those of you who haven't been there you should go it's very very interesting what's happening and we recruited wonderful staff highly motivated
the other thing that's happened which was good for us is the internet even though the internet is very expensive all over africa there are internet cafes everywhere and bright young africans are desperate and they're very ambitious
they want to be the next einstein
and so when word came out that aims was opening it spread very quickly via e mail and our website and we got lots of applicants
well we designed aims as a twenty four hour learning environment and it was fantastic to start a university from the beginning you have to rethink what is the university for
and that's really exciting so we designed it to have interactive teaching no droning on
we emphasize problem solving working in groups every student discovering and maximizing their own potential and not chasing grades
we especially emphasize areas of great relevance to africa 's development
because in those areas scientists working in africa will have a competitive advantage they'll publish be invited to conferences they'll do well they'll have successful careers
and aims has done extremely well here is a list of last year 's graduates graduated in june and what they're currently doing forty eight of them
and where they are is indicated over here and where they've gone so these are all postgraduate students and they've all gone on to master 's and ph d degrees in excellent places
more important the pan african student body is a continual source of strength pride and commitment to africa
we illustrate aims progress by coloring in the countries of africa
so here you can see behind this list
when a county is colored yellow we've received an application orange
we've accepted an application and green a student has graduated
so here is where we were after the first graduation in two thousand and four and we set ourselves a goal of turning the continent green
so there's two thousand and five six seven eight
well on the way to achieving our initial goal
we had some of the students filmed at home before they came to aims and i'll just show you one that
that in particular
so tendai came to aims
my name is tendai mugwagwa and i was a student at aims in two thousand and three and two thousand and four after leaving aims i went on to do a master 's in applied mathematics at the university of cape town in south africa
after that i came to the netherlands where i'm now doing a ph d in
very independently she communicates well with the so all in all
another student in the first year of aims was shehu and he 's shown here with his favorite high school teacher and then entering university in northern nigeria
and after aims shehu wanted to do high energy physics and he came to cambridge he 's about to finish his ph d and he was filmed recently with someone you all know it
here are the current students at aims there are fifty three of them from twenty different countries including twenty
women so now i'm going to get to my ted business well we had a party this is africa we have good parties in africa and last month they threw a surprise party for me here 's somebody you've seen already
and somehow stays smiling in spite of everything going on back home
but she wants to continue in physics and she's doing extremely well this is lydia
lydia is the first ever woman to graduate in mathematics in the central african republic and she's now at
well it's not my ted wish it's our wish as you've already gathered and our wish has two parts one is a dream and the other 's a plan ok
ted dream is that the next einstein will be african
striving for the heights of creative genius
we want to give thousands of people the motivation
the encouragement and the courage to obtain the high level skills they need to help africa
among them will be not only brilliant scientists i'm sure of that from what we've seen at aims they'll also be the african gates brins and pages of the future
what we need to do is to replicate it
we want to roll out fifteen aims centers in the next five years all over africa each will have a pan african student body
but specialize in a different area of science we want to use science to overcome the national and cultural barriers as it does at aims and we want to add elements to the curriculum we want to add entrepreneurship and policy skills
the expanded aims will be a coherent pan african institution and its graduates will form a powerful network working together for peace and progress across the continent over the last
we've been visiting sites in africa looking at potential sites for new aims centers and here are the ones we've selected
and each of these centers has a strong local team
each is in a beautiful place an interesting place which international lecturers will be happy to visit and our partners across africa are extremely enthusiastic about this everyone wants an aims center in their country
and last november the conference of all the african ministers of science and technology held in mombasa
called for a comprehensive plan to roll out aims so we have political support right across the continent it won 't be easy
at every site there will be huge challenges local scientists must play leading roles
and governments must be persuaded to buy in
the institutes have got to be relevant innovative cost effective and high quality why because we want africa to be rich
easy to remember the basic rules we need
so just in ending let me say the only people who can fix africa are talented young africans by unlocking and nurturing their creative potential we can create a step change in africa 's future
over time they will contribute to african development and to science in ways we can only imagine thank you
