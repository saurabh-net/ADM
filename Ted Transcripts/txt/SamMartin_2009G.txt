so i am indeed going to talk about the spaces men create for themselves but first i want to tell you why i'm here i'm here for two reasons these two guys are my two sons ford and
when ford was about three years old we shared a very small room together in a very small space my office was on one half of the bedroom and his
it had everything i needed it was quiet there was enough space and i had control which was very important as i was building this space i thought to myself surely i'm not the only guy to have to
have carved out a space for his own so i did some research and i found that there was an historic precedence hemingway had his writing space
had two or three manspaces which is pretty unique because he lived with both his wife and his mother in graceland in the popular culture superman had the fortress of solitude and there was of course the batcave
so i realized then that i wanted to go out on a journey and see what guys were creating for themselves now
and this to me is a pretty classic manspace it has neon concert posters a bar and of course the leg lamp
i soon realized that manspaces didn't have to be only inside this guy built a bowling alley in his backyard out of landscaping timbers astroturf and he found the scoreboard in the trash
so pretty early on in my investigations i realized what i was finding was not what i expected to find which was quite frankly a lot of beer can pyramids and overstuffed couches and flat screen tvs
there were definitely hang out spots but some were for working some were for playing some were for guys to collect their things most of all i was just surprised with what i was finding take this place for example
on the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage this is in long island new york the only thing that might tip you off is the round window on the inside it's a recreation of a sixteenth century japanese tea house the man imported all the materials from japan
and he hired a japanese carpenter to build it in the traditional style it has no nails or screws all the joints are hand carved and hand scribed
and he trains in the space he trains other people and right off the garage he has his own trophy room where he can sort of bask in his accomplishments which is another sort of important part
so as i came to the end of my journey i found over fifty spaces and they were unexpected and they were surprising but they were also i was really impressed by how personalized they were and how much work went into them
and i realized that's because the guys that i met were all very passionate about what they did and they really loved their professions and they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies and so they created these spaces
to reflect what they love to do and who they were so if you don't have a space of your own i highly recommend finding one and getting into it thank you very much
