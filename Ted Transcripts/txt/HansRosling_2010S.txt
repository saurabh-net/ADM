i'm going to talk now about how world population has changed from that
year and into the future
but i will not use digital technology as i've done during my first five tedtalks instead i
and i am today launching a brand new analog teaching technology that i picked up from ikea this box this box contains one billion people
and they lived away then there was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world people were healthy
this was the economic level at which sweden was
but in contrast to this in the developing world far away
the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day and they were saving
to be able to buy a pair of shoes
there was an enormous gap in the world when i grew up
and this gap between the west and the rest has created a mindset of the world which we still use linguistically when we talk about the west and the developing world
but the world has changed and it's overdue to upgrade that mindset and that
up to two thousand and ten is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population just look how many the world population has
since i went to school
and of course there's been economic growth
so the western population moved over to here and now their aspiration is not only to have a car now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination and they want to fly
so this is where they are today and the most successful of the developing countries they have moved on you know and they have become emerging economies we call them and they are now buying cars
happened a month ago was that the chinese company geely they acquired the volvo company and then finally the swedes understood that something big had happened in the world
and the tragedy is that the two billion over here
for food and shoes they are still almost as poor as they were fifty years ago
the new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions the three billions here which are also becoming emerging
because they are quite healthy relatively well educated and they already also have two or three children per woman
aspiration now is of course to buy a bicycle
and then later on they would like to have a motorbike
but this is the world we have today no longer any gap
the distance from the poorest here the very poorest to the very richest over here is wider than ever
but there is a continuous world from walking biking driving to
this is the new world we have today in two thousand and ten
i'm going to project into two thousand and fifty
i was in shanghai recently
and i listened to what's happening in china and it's pretty sure that they will catch up
we invest in the right green technology so that we can avoid severe climate change and energy can still be relatively cheap then they will move all the way
and they will start to buy electric cars
this is what we will find
so what about the poorest two billion
what about the poorest two billion they move on
here population comes in because there we already have two to three children per woman family planning is widely used
so these two billion will in the next decades increase to three billion and they
four billion there is nothing but a nuclear war
of a kind we've never seen that can stop this from because we already have
and only if get out of poverty they get education they get improved child survival they can buy a bicycle and a cellphone and come here then population growth will stop in two thousand and
we cannot have people on this level looking for food and shoes because then we get continued population growth
and let me show you why by converting back to the old time
dark blue is africa brown is europe green is the middle east and this light blue is south asia that's india and this is china
the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school sixty percent seventy percent eighty percent ninety
child survival small families and all the rest the rainbow of developing countries with very large families and poor child
what has happened i start the world here we go can you see as the years pass by child survival is increasing they get soap hygiene education vaccination and penicillin and then family planning
they get up to ninety percent child survival then families decrease and most of the arab countries in the middle east is falling down there look bangladesh catching up with india
world joins the western world with good child survival and small family size but we still have the poorest billion can you see the poorest billion those boxes i had over here
they are still up here and they still have a child survival of only seventy to eighty percent meaning that if you have six children
actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world we can stop at nine billion if we do the right things child survival is the new green
it's only by child survival that we will stop population growth i'm not an optimist
i'm not an optimist neither am i a
a very serious possibilist it's a new category where we take emotion apart and we just work analytically with the world it can be
and look at the position of the old west
box was all alone leading the world living its own life
the role of the old west in the new world is to become the foundation of the nothing more nothing less
nothing more nothing less a very important role
do it well and get used to it thank you very much
