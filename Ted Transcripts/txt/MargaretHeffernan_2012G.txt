alice was unusual partly because of course she was a woman which was pretty rare in the one thousand nine hundred and fifty s and she was brilliant she was one of the at the time the youngest fellow to be elected to the royal college of physicians she was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married after she had kids
and even after she got divorced and was a single parent she continued her medical work and she was unusual because she was really interested in a new science the emerging field of epidemiology the study of patterns in disease
but like every scientist she appreciated that to make her mark what she needed to do was find a hard problem and solve it
the hard problem that alice chose was the rising incidence of childhood cancers most disease is correlated with poverty but in the case of childhood cancers the children who were dying seemed mostly to come from
families so what she wanted to know could explain this anomaly
now alice had trouble getting funding for her research in the end she got just one thousand pounds from the lady tata memorial prize and that meant she knew she only had one shot at collecting her data
life had they started school
and when her carbon copied questionnaire started to come back one thing and one thing only jumped out with the statistical clarity of a kind that most scientists
can only dream of by a rate of two to one the children who had died had had mothers who had been x rayed when pregnant now that nevertheless alice stewart rushed
it was fully twenty five years before the british and medical british and american medical establishments
it was open it was freely available but nobody wanted to know
a child a week was dying
but nothing changed openness alone
alice was very warm very empathetic with her patients george frankly preferred numbers to people but he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship he said my job
is to prove dr stewart wrong
he actively sought disconfirmation different ways of looking at her models at her statistics different ways of crunching the data in order to disprove her
he saw his job as creating conflict around her theories because it was only by not being able to prove that she was wrong that george could give alice the confidence she
needed to know that she was right it 's a fantastic model
such collaborators alice and george were very good at conflict they saw it as thinking so what
well first of all it requires that we find people who are very different from ourselves that means we have to resist the neurobiological drive which means that we really prefer people mostly like ourselves and it means we have to seek out people with different
that requires a lot of patience and a lot of energy and the more i 've thought about this the more i think really that that 's a kind
if you don 't really care
and it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds alice 's daughter told me that every time alice went head to head with a fellow scientist they made her think and think and think
of lives so how do organizations think of conflict
in surveys of european and american executives fully eighty five percent of them acknowledged that they had issues or concerns at work that they were afraid to raise afraid of the eighty five percent
is a really big number
it means that organizations mostly can 't do what george and alice so triumphantly did they can 't think together
and it means that people like many of us who have run organizations and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can mostly fail
and then we have to get really good at
that could really hurt people he was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help but when he looked around his organization nobody else seemed to be at all worried
so he didn 't really want to say anything after all maybe they knew something he didn 't maybe he 'd look stupid but he kept was leave a job
joe and i found a way for him to raise his concerns and what happened then is what almost always happens in this situation it turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and doubts so now joe had allies they could think together
and yes there was a lot of conflict and debate and argument but that allowed everyone around the table to be creative to solve the problem
and to change the device
joe was what a lot of people might think of
and his colleagues don 't think of him as a crank
well the university of delft
requires that its phd students have to submit five statements that they 're prepared to defend it doesn 't really matter what the statements are
from information that is secret
handle don 't want to handle
the conflict that it provokes but when we dare to break that silence or when we dare to see and we create conflict we enable ourselves and the people around us to do our very open networks are essential
but the truth won 't set us free until we develop the skills and
