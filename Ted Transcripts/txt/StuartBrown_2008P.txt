go a flyby of play
it's got to be serious if the new york times puts a cover story of their february seventeenth sunday magazine about play
at the bottom of this it says it 's deeper than gender seriously but dangerously fun
a sandbox for new ideas about evolution
not bad except if you look at that cover what's missing you see any adults
well lets go back to the fifteenth century
this is a courtyard in europe
and a mixture of one hundred and twenty four different kinds of play
all ages solo play body play
games taunting and there it is and i think this is a typical picture of what it was like in a courtyard then
i think we may have lost something in our culture
so i'm gonna take you through
and from out of stage left comes this wild male polar bear with a predatory gaze
of you who 've been to africa or had a junkyard dog come after you there is a fixed kind of predatory gaze that you know you're in trouble
but on the other side of that predatory gaze is a female husky
in a play bow wagging her tale and something very unusual happens that fixed behavior
which is rigged and stereotyped and ends up with a meal changes and this polar bear stands over the husky
no claws extended no fangs taking a look
this is in nature it overrides a carnivorous nature and what otherwise would have been a short fight to the death
if you'll begin to look closely at the husky that's bearing her throat to the polar bear
and look a little more closely they're in an altered
state they're in a state of play and it's that state
and it's that state that allows these
two creatures to explore the possible they are beginning to do something that neither would have done without the play signals
and it is a marvelous example of how a differential in power can be overridden
by a process of nature that's within all of us now how did i get involved in this john mentioned that i've done some
with murderers and i have the texas tower murderer opened my eyes
in retrospect when we studied his tragic mass murder
to the importance of play in that this individual by deep study was found to have severe play deprivation charles whitman was his name
and our committee which consisted of a lot of hard scientists did feel at the end of that study that the absence of play and a progressive suppression of developmentally normal play
led him to be more vulnerable to the tragedy that he perpetrated and that finding has stood the test of time unfortunately even into more recent times at virginia tech
and other studies of populations at risk sensitized me to the importance of play
but i didn't really understand what it was and it was many years in taking play histories of individuals before i really began to recognize that
i didn't really have a full understanding of it and i don't think any of us has a full understanding of it by any means but
there are ways of looking at it that i think can give you give us all a taxonomy a way of thinking about it and this image is for humans the beginning point of play
when that mother and infant lock eyes and the infant 's old enough to have a social smile what happens
brain of each of them
becomes attuned so that the joyful emergence of this earliest of play scenes and the physiology of that is something we're beginning to get a handle on
and i'd like you to think that every bit of more complex play builds on this base
for us humans and so now i'm going to take you through sort of a way of looking at play but it's never just
one thing we're going to look at body play
which is a spontaneous desire to get ourselves out of gravity this is a
if you're having a bad day try this jump up and down wiggle around you're going to feel better and you may feel like this character who is also just
for its own sake it doesn't have a particular purpose and that's what's great about play if its purpose is more important than the act of doing it it's probably not play and there's a whole other type of play which is object play
and they don't throw it at each other but this is a fundamental part of being playful the human hand in manipulation of objects
is the hand in search of a brain the brain is in search of a hand and play is the medium by which those two are linked in the best way
we heard this morning jpl is an incredible place they have located two consultants
tried to figure out why and he came to the conclusion quite on his own that the students who could no longer solve problems such as fixing cars hadn't worked with their hands
before they will hire a research and development problem solver even if they're summa cum laude from harvard or cal tech if they haven't fixed cars haven't done stuff with their hands early in life
with their hands they can't problem solve as well so play is practical and it's very important now one of the things about play
has to be safe exploration this happens to be ok he 's an anatomically interested little boy and that's his mom other situations wouldn't be quite so
good but curiosity exploration are part of the play scene if you want to belong you need social play and social play is part of what we're about here today
and is a byproduct of the play scene rough and tumble play these lionesses seen from a distance looked like they were fighting
open mouth with no fangs balletic movements curvilinear movements all specific to play and rough and tumble play
a great learning medium for all of us preschool kids for example should be allowed to dive hit whistle scream be chaotic
and develop through that a lot of emotional regulation and a lot of the other social byproducts cognitive emotional and physical that come as a part of rough and tumble play
rare where the red sox won the world series but take a look at the face and the body language of everybody in this fuzzy picture and you can get a sense that they're all at play imaginative play
really important part of being a player is imaginative solo play
and i love this one because it's also what we're about we all have an internal narrative that's our own inner story the unit of intelligibility of most of our brains is the story
i'm telling you a story today about play
well this bushman i think is talking about the fish that got away that was that long but it's a fundamental part of the play scene
so what does play do for the brain well a lot
we don't know a whole lot about what it
does for the human brain because funding has not been exactly
heavy for research on play i walked into the carnegie asking for a grant they'd given me a large grant when i was an academician
for the study of felony drunken drivers and i thought i had a pretty good track record and by the time i had spent half an hour talking about play it was obvious that they were not
is some good science nothing lights up the brain like play three dimensional play fires up the cerebellum
a lot of impulses into the frontal lobe the executive portion helps contextual memory be developed
and and and and so it's for me its been an extremely nourishing scholarly adventure
to look at the neuroscience that's associated with play and to bring together people who in their individual disciplines hadn't really thought of it that way and that's part of what the national
i'm sorry i don't have a playful looking subject but it allows mobility which has limited the actual study of play
and we've got a mother infant play scenario that we're hoping to complete underway at the moment the reason i put this here is also to queue up my thoughts about objectifying what play does
to play at a certain period of their juvenile years
and you suppress play they squeak they wrestle they pin each other that's part of their play if you stop that behavior
on one group that you're experimenting with and you allow it in another group that you're experimenting with and then you present those rats
with a cat odor saturated collar
they're hardwired to flee and they both hide out
the non players never come out they die the players
slowly explore the environment and begin again to test things out
that says to me at least in rats and i think they have the same neurotransmitters that we do and a similar cortical architecture that
play may be pretty important for our survival and and and there are a lot more animal studies that i could talk about now this is a
in domestic animals and others when they're play deprived they and rats also they don't develop a brain that is normal
now the program says that the opposite of play is not work
and i think if you think about life without play
no humor no flirtation no movies no games no fantasy
and and and try and imagine
a culture or a life adult or otherwise
and the thing that's so unique about our species is that we're really designed to play through our whole lifetime
and we all have capacity to play signal nobody misses that dog i took a picture of on a carmel beach a couple of weeks ago what's going to follow from that behavior
is play and you can trust it the basis of human trust is established through play signals and we begin to lose those signals culturally and otherwise as
that's a shame i think we've got a lot of learning to do now jane goodall has here a play face along with one of her favorite chimps so part of the signaling system of play
has to do with vocal facial body gestural you know you can tell and i think when we're getting into collective play its really important for
groups to gain a sense of safety through their own sharing of play signals you may not know this word
it should be your biological first name and last name because neoteny means the retention of immature qualities into adulthood and we are by physical anthropologists
by many many studies the most neotenous the most youthful the most flexible the most plastic of all creatures and therefore the most playful and this gives us a leg up on adaptability
now there is a way of looking at play that i also want to emphasize here
which is the play history your own personal play history is unique and often is not something we think about particularly this is a book written by a consummate player by the name of kevin carroll
kevin carroll came from extremely deprived circumstances alcoholic mother absent father inner city philadelphia black had to take care of a younger brother
found that when he looked at a
out of a window into which he had been confined
he felt something different and so he followed up on
the transformation of his life from the deprivation and what one would expect potentially prison or death
become a linguist a trainer for the seventy six ers and now is a motivational speaker and he gives play as
force over his entire life now there's another play history that i think is a work in progress
those of you who remember al gore during the
first term and then during his successful but unelected run for the presidency
and looking at his history which is common in the press it seems to me at least looking at it from a shrink 's point of view that a lot of his life was
summers were hard hard work
in the heat of tennessee summers he had the expectations of his senatorial father and washington d c and although
i think as he now is
by paying attention to what is his own passion and his own inner drive which i think has its basis in all of us in our play history
into how that connects with your life now
and you'll find you may change jobs which has happened to a number people when i've had them do this in order to be more empowered through their play
or you'll be able to enrich your life by prioritizing it and paying attention to it most of us work with groups and i
put this up because the d school the design school at stanford thanks to david kelley and a lot of others who have been visionary about its establishment
this is our maiden voyage in this we're about two and a half three months into it and it's really been fun there is our star
nobel prize stuart thompson in neuroscience so we've had brendan who 's from ideo and the rest of us sitting aside
and watching these students as they put play principles into practice in the classroom
and one of their projects was to
see what makes meetings boring
and to try and do something about it
so what will follow is a student made film about just that
flow is the mental state of apparition in which the person is fully immersed in what he or she is doing characterized by a feeling of energized focus full involvement and success in the process of the activity
an important key insight that we learned about meetings is that people pack them in one after another disruptive to
take the meeting off and have peace of mind that you can come back to me because when you need it again
the meeting is literally hanging in your
the wearable meeting because when you put it on you immediately get everything you need to have a fun and productive and useful meeting but when you take it off that's when the real action happens
set aside time to play but where your life becomes infused minute by minute hour by hour with body
object social fantasy transformational kinds of play and i think you'll have a better and more empowered life thank you
it sounds to me like what you're saying is that there may be some temptation on the part of people to look at your work and go i think i've heard this in my kind of pop psychological understanding of play
yeah i don't think that's accurate and i think probably because animals have taught us that if you stop a cat from playing which you can do and we've all seen how cats
around stuff they're just as good predators as they would be if they hadn't played and if you imagine a kid pretending to be
or a race car driver or a fireman they don't all become race car drivers
you know so there's a disconnect between preparation for the future which is what most people are comfortable in thinking about play as and thinking of it as a separate
biological entity and this is where my chasing animals for four five years really changed my perspective from a clinician to what i am now
which is that play has a biological place
dream and they rehearse and they do some other things that help memory and that are a very important part of sleep and dreaming the next step of evolution in mammals and creatures with divinely superfluous neurons will
and the fact that the polar bear and husky or magpie and a bear or you and i and our dogs can crossover and have that
how do you keep and i know you're part of the scientific research community and you have to justify with grants and proposals like everyone else how do you prevent and some of the data that you've produced the good science that
is hot to handle how do you prevent either the media's interpretation of your work or the scientific
that play enhances your intelligence well let 's round these kids up put them in pens and make them play for months at a time
the only way i know to do it is to have accumulated the advisers that i have who go from practitioners who can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever a state of play
so people know that it's there and then you get an fmri specialist and you get frank wilson and you get other kinds of hard scientists including neuroendocrinologists and you get them into a
group together focused on play
pretty hard not to take it seriously
long term as learning some of the basic things about public health
