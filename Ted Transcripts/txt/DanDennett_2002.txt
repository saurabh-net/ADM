how many creationists do we have in the room probably none i think we're all darwinians and yet many darwinians are anxious
little uneasy would like to see some limits on just how far the darwinism goes it's all right you know spiderwebs sure they are products of evolution the world wide web not so sure
beaver dams yes hoover dam no what do they think it is that prevents the products of human ingenuity from being themselves fruits of the tree of life and hence in some sense obeying
going to talk a little bit about
mind that we have a lot on the program here so you're out in the woods or you're out in the pasture and you see this ant crawling up this blade of grass
climbs up to the top and it falls and it climbs and it falls and it climbs trying to stay at the very top of
what is this ant doing what is this in aid of what
goals is this ant trying to
climbing this blade of grass what's in it for the ant and the answer is nothing
there's nothing in it for the ant well then why is it doing this is it just a fluke yeah it's just a fluke
it's a lancet fluke it's a little brain worm it's a parasitic brain worm that has to get into the stomach of a sheep or a cow in order to continue its life
salmon swim upstream to get to their spawning grounds and lancet flukes commandeer a passing ant crawl into its brain and drive it up
by a parasite that infects the brain inducing suicidal behavior pretty scary well does anything like that happen with human beings
this is all on behalf of a cause other than one 's own genetic fitness of course well it may already have occurred to you that
islam means surrender or submission of self interest to the will of allah well it's ideas not worms that
now am i saying that a sizable minority of the world 's population has had their brain
hijacked by parasitic ideas no it's worse than that most
a lot of ideas to die for freedom if you're from new hampshire justice truth communism
many people have laid down their lives for communism and many have laid down their lives for capitalism and many for catholicism and
these are just a few of the ideas that are to die for they're infectious yesterday amory lovins spoke about infectious
of abuse in effect this is unthinking engineering well most of the cultural spread that goes on is not brilliant new
out of the box thinking it's infectious repetitis and we might as well try to have a theory of what's going on when that happens so that we can understand the conditions of infection
hosts work hard to spread these ideas to others i myself am a philosopher and
one of our occupational hazards is that people ask us what the meaning of life is and you have to have a bumper sticker
most of us now that the me decade is well in the past now we actually do this one set of ideas or another have simply
our biological imperatives in our own lives this is what our summum bonum is it's not maximizing the number of grandchildren we have now this is a profound biological
it's the subordination of genetic interest to other interests and no other species does anything at all like it well how are we going to think about this it is on the one hand a biological effect and a very large one unmistakable
now what theories do we want to use to look at this well many theories but how could something tie them together
the idea of replicating ideas ideas that replicate by passing from brain to brain richard dawkins whom you'll be hearing later in the day
not his yes he started it but it's everybody 's idea now and he 's not responsible for what i say about
i'm responsible for what i say about memes actually i think we're all
for not just the intended effects of our ideas but for their likely misuses
so it is important i think to richard and to me that these ideas not be abused and misused they're very easy to misuse that's why they're dangerous
and it's just about a full time job trying to prevent people who are scared of these ideas from caricaturing them and then running off
to one dire purpose or another so we have to keep plugging away trying to correct the misapprehensions so that
only the benign and useful variants of our ideas continue to spread but it is a problem
we don't have much time and i'm going to go over just a little bit of this and cut out because there's a lot of other things that are going to be said so let me just point out
are like viruses that's what richard said back in ninety three and you might think well how can that be i mean a virus is you know it's stuff what's a meme made of
viral telecommunications but what's a virus a virus is a string of nucleic acid with attitude that
is something about it that tends to make it replicate better than the competition does and that's what a meme is an information packet with attitude what's a meme made
that can be pronounced then there's all the other memes that can't be pronounced there are different species of
the shakers gift to be simple simple beautiful furniture and of course they're basically extinct
and one of the reasons is that among the creed of
one should be celibate not just the priests everybody well it's not so surprising
they've gone extinct but in fact that's not
they survived as long as they did at a time when the social safety nets weren't there and there were lots of widows and orphans
needed a foster home and so they had a ready supply of converts and they could keep it going and in principle it could 've gone on forever
with perfect celibacy on the part of the hosts the idea being passed on through proselytizing instead of through the gene
so the ideas can live on in spite of the fact that they're not being passed on genetically a meme can flourish in spite of having a negative impact on genetic fitness
after all the meme for shakerdom was essentially a sterilizing
there are other parasites which do this which render
i'm just going to draw your attention to just one of the many implications of the memetic perspective
which i recommend i've not time to go into more of it in jared diamond 's wonderful book guns germs and steel
he talks about how it was germs more than guns and steel that conquered
the new hemisphere the western hemisphere that conquered the rest of the world when european explorers and travelers
spread out they brought with them the germs that they had become essentially immune to that they had learned how to
hundreds and hundreds of years thousands of years of living with domesticated animals who were the sources of those pathogens and they just wiped out
and we're doing it again we're doing it this with
yesterday a number of people nicholas negroponte and others spoke about all the wonderful things that are happening when our ideas get spread out thanks to all the new technology all over the world and i agree it is
largely wonderful largely wonderful but
among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world thanks to our technology are a lot of toxic
now this has been realized for some time sayyid qutb is one of the founding fathers of fanatical islam
one of the ideologues that inspired
one has only to glance at its press films fashion shows beauty contests ballrooms wine bars and broadcasting
these memes are spreading around the world and they are
wiping out whole cultures they are wiping out languages they are wiping out traditions and practices and it's not our fault
than it's our fault when our germs lay waste to people that haven't developed the immunity we have
an immunity to all of the junk that lies around the edges of our culture we're a free society so we let pornography and all these things we shrug them off they're like a mild cold they're not a big deal for us
but we should recognize that for many people in the world they are a big deal and we should be very alert to this as we spread
our education and our technology one of the things that we are doing is we're the vectors of memes that are
by the hosts of many other memes as a dire threat to their favorite memes the memes that they are prepared to die for
well now how are we going to tell the good memes from the bad memes that is not the job of the science of memetics memetics is morally neutral and
this is not the place for hate and anger if you've had a friend who 's died of aids then you
the way to deal with that is to do science and understand how it spreads and why in a morally neutral
plenty of room for moral passion once we've got the facts and can figure out the best thing to do and as with germs the trick is not to try to annihilate them you will never annihilate
the germs what you can do however is foster public health measures and the like that will encourage the evolution of
