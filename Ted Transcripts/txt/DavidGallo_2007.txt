and we used to see the most mysterious animals out the window that you couldn't describe these blinking lights a world of bioluminescence like fireflies
doctor edith witter she's now at the research conservation association was able to
come up with a camera that could capture some of these incredible animals and that's what you're seeing here on the screen that's all bioluminescence so like i said just like fireflies there's a flying turkey
the tree i know i'm a geologist by training but i love that
of the bioluminescence they use to avoid being eaten some they use to attract prey but all of it from an artistic point of view is positively amazing and a lot of what goes on inside here 's a fish with glowing eyes pulsating eyes
some of the colors are designed to hypnotize
that's the unknown world and today we've only explored three percent of what's out in the oceans already we've found the world 's highest mountains the world 's deepest valleys
we find more life we think and diversity and density than the tropical rainforest which tells us that we don't know much about this planet at all there's still ninety seven percent
as a kid i knew them as calamari mostly this is an octopus this is the work of doctor roger hanlon at the marine
and it's just fascinating how cephalopods with their eyes incredible eyes sense their surroundings look at light look at patterns there's an octopus moving across the reef finds a spot to settle down curls up
in the next bit we're going to see a couple squid this is a squid now males when they fight if they're really aggressive they turn white and these two males are fighting they do it by bouncing their butts together which is an interesting
a male on the left and a female on the right now the male has managed to split his coloration so the female only always sees the kinder gentler squid the
see it again let 's take a look at it again watch the coloration white on the right
on the left he takes a step back so he 's keeping off the other males by splitting his body and comes up on the other side
but they can do pretty amazing things here we're going to see one backing into a crevice and watch his tentacles he just pulls them in makes him look just like algae
ok just an amazing thing
here 's an octopus sometimes they don't want to be seen when they move because predators can see them here this guy can actually make himself look like a rock
and if you're an octopus or a cephalopod you really understand how to use your surroundings to hide in the next scene you're going to see a nice coral bottom in the foreground
an octopus ain't that amazing
now roger spooked him so he took off in a cloud of ink
lands the octopus says oh i've been seen the best thing to do is to get as big as i can get
that big brown makes his eyespot very big one two three
now he 's gone and so am i thank you very much
