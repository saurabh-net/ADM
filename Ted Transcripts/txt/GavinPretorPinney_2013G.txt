they get a bad rap if you think about it the english language has written into it negative associations towards the clouds someone who 's down or depressed
they 're under a cloud and when there 's bad news in store there 's a cloud on the horizon i saw an article the other day it was about problems with computer processing over the internet
a cloud over the cloud
the annoying frustrating obstructions and then they rush off and do some blue sky thinking
aristophanes the ancient greek playwright he described the clouds as the patron godesses of idle fellows
reluctant to allow ourselves the indulgence of just allowing our imaginations to drift along in the breeze and i think that 's a pity i think we should perhaps do a bit more of it i think we should be a bit more willing perhaps to
of existential angst you know you 're thinking about your own mortality and there on the horizon it 's the grim reaper what would that mean
but one thing i do know is this the bad press that clouds get is totally unfair i think we should stand up for them which is why a few years ago i started the cloud appreciation society
tens of thousands of members now in almost one hundred countries around the world and all these photographs that i 'm showing they were sent in
by members and the society exists to remind people of this clouds are not something to moan about far from it they are in fact the most diverse evocative poetic aspect of nature
i think if you live with your head in the clouds every now and then it helps you keep your feet on the ground
and i want to show you why with the help of some of my favorite types of clouds let 's start with this one it 's the cirrus cloud named after the latin for a lock of hair
it 's composed entirely of ice crystals cascading from the upper reaches of the troposphere and as these ice crystals fall they pass through different layers with different winds and they speed up and slow down giving the cloud these brush stroked appearances these brush stroke forms known
as fall streaks and these winds up there can be very very fierce they can be two hundred miles an hour three hundred miles an hour these clouds are bombing along but from all the way down here they appear to be moving gracefully
slowly like most clouds and so to tune into the clouds is to slow down to calm down it 's like a bit of everyday meditation
tendrils down below rarer still the kelvin helmholtz cloud
not a very snappy name needs a rebrand
undulating of the air and if the difference in those speeds is just right the tops of the undulations curl over in these beautiful breaking wave like vortices
if you look up and you pay attention to the sky you 'll see them sooner or later maybe not quite as dramatic as these but you 'll see them and you 'll see them around where you live clouds are the most egalitarian of nature 's displays because we all have a good fantastic view of the sky
pay attention to what 's so commonplace so everyday so mundane that everybody else misses it
one cloud that people rarely miss is this one the cumulonimbus storm cloud
they are the embodiment of the powerful elemental force and power that drives our atmosphere to be there is to be connected in the driving rain and the hail to feel connected to our atmosphere
it 's to be reminded that we are creatures that inhabit this ocean of air we don 't live beneath the sky we live within it
and that connection that visceral connection to our atmosphere
but the one cloud that best expresses why cloudspotting is more valuable today than ever is this one the cumulus cloud
the sharp crisp outlines of this formation make it the best one for finding shapes in and it reminds us
you have to now contend with answering a mountain of unanswered emails updating a facebook page feeding your twitter feed
and cloudspotting legitimizes doing nothing
being in the present not thinking about what you 've got to do and what you should have done but just being here letting your imagination lift from the everyday concerns down here and just being in the present it 's good for you and it 's good for the way you feel
