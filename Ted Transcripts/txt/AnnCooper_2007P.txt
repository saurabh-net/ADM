we needed to teach children the symbiotic relationship between a healthy planet healthy food and healthy kids and that if we don 't do that
food the way the usda puts food on kids plates that 's unhealthy and allows unhealthy food into schools and by tacitly all of us send our kids or grandchildren or nieces or nephews to school and tell them to learn
you know learn what 's in those schools and when you feed these kids bad food that 's what they 're learning so that 's really what this is all about
the way we got here is because of big agribusiness we now live in a country where most of us don 't decide by and large what we eat we see big businesses monsanto and dupont who brought out agent orange and stain resistant carpet they control ninety percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country these are ten companies
control much of what 's in our grocery stores much of what people eat and that 's really really a problem so when i started thinking about these issues and how i was going to change what kids ate i really started focusing on what we would teach them and the very first thing was about regional food
trying to eat food from within our region and clearly with what 's going on with fossil fuel usage or
you know we really have to start thinking about whether or not we should or could be moving food one thousand five hundred miles before we eat it so we talked to kids about that and we really start to feed kids
regional food and then we talk about organic food now most school districts can 't really afford organic food but we as a nation have to start thinking about consuming growing and feeding our children food that 's not chock full of chemicals we can 't keep feeding our kids pesticides and herbicides and antibiotics and hormones we can 't keep doing
u s agriculture uses one point two billion pounds of pesticides every year that means every one of us and our children consumes what would equal a five pound bag those bags you have at home if i had one here and ripped it open and
the usda allows these antibiotics these hormones and these pesticides in our food supply and the usda paid for this ad in time magazine okay we could talk about rachel carson and ddt but we know it wasn 't good for you and
it really is just a new idea i mean people toss around sustainability but we have to figure out what sustainability is in less than two hundred years you know just in a few generations we 've gone from being two hundred being one hundred percent ninety five percent farmers to less than two percent of farmers
we now live in a country that has more prisoners than farmers two point one million prisoners one point nine million farmers and we spend thirty five thousand dollars on average a year keeping a prisoner in prison and school districts spend five hundred dollars a year feeding a child it 's no wonder you know we have criminals
and if that 's not enough they 've gone on to say most before they graduate high school this means that forty or forty five percent of all school aged children could be insulin dependent
within a decade within a decade what 's going to happen
because eight year olds don 't get to decide and if they do you should be in therapy you know we are responsible for what kids eat
big companies spend twenty billion dollars a year marketing non nutrient foods to kids twenty billion dollars a year ten thousand ads most kids see they spend five hundred dollars for every one dollar five hundred dollars marketing foods that kids shouldn 't eat for every one dollar marketing healthy nutritious
which is why i say it 's a social justice issue now i said i 'm doing this in berkeley and you might think oh berkeley of course you can do it in berkeley well this is the food i found twenty four months ago this is not even food this is the stuff we were feeding our kids extremo burritos corn dogs
that they could figure it out that we could sell this stuff to kids you know what 's wrong with teaching kids that chicken looks like chicken
you know we have to change the way we teach kids about these things there 's a lot of stuff we can do there 's a lot of schools doing farm to school programs
there 's a lot of schools actually getting fresh food into schools now in berkeley we 've gone totally fresh we have no high fructose corn syrup no trans fats no processed foods we 're cooking from scratch every day we have twenty five percent of our
now one of the things that what happened when i went into berkeley is i realized that you know this was all pretty amazing to people very very different and i needed to market it
i came up with these calendars that i sent home to every parent and these calendars really started to lay out my program now i 'm in charge of all the cooking classes and all the gardening classes in our school district
so this is a typical menu this is what we 're serving this week at the schools
and you see these recipes on the side those are the recipes that the kids learn in my cooking classes they do tastings of these ingredients in the gardening classes they also may be growing them and we serve them in the cafeterias if we 're going to change children 's relationship to food it 's delicious nutritious food in the cafeterias
now you 've probably garnered that i don 't love the usda and
have to start changing this we have to make kids understand that their food choices make a big difference
that we now have grown a generation maybe two of kids where one out of every four meals is eaten in fast food one of every four meals is eaten in a car and one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a tv or computer
what are kids learning where is the family time where is socialization where is discussion where is learning to talk
and we have to pull it all together we have composting in all of our schools we have recycling in all of our schools you know the things that we maybe do at home and think are so important we have to teach kids about in school it has to be so much a part of them
and change how we feed kids we really have to rethink that so public and private partnerships advocacy groups working with foundations in our school district the way we afford this
you know it 's crazy it 's crazy what we 're doing and just remember at very least tacitly this is what we 're teaching children as what they should be doing
i think if we 're going to fix this one of the things we have to do is really change how we have oversight over the national school lunch program instead of the national school lunch program being under the usda i think it should be under cdc if we started to think about
and how we feed our kids as a health initiative
and we started thinking about as lunch
okay finance one hundred and one on this and this i 'm sort of wrapping it up with this finance piece
fast food we spend one hundred billion dollars a year on diet aids we spend fifty billion dollars on vegetables which is why we need all the diet aids we spend two hundred billion dollars
that eight billion comes down to two dollars and forty nine cents that 's what the government allocates for lunch most school districts spend two thirds of that on payroll and overhead that means we spend less than a dollar a day on food for kids in schools most schools eighty to ninety cents in l a it 's fifty six cents
is more we spend more on than we are spending to feed kids for an entire week
in our schools you know what we should be ashamed
we as a country should be ashamed
at that the richest country
in our country it 's the kids that need it the most
who get this really really lousy food it 's the kids who have parents and grandparents and uncles and aunts that can 't even afford to pay for school lunch that gets this food and those are the same kids who are going to be getting sick
those are the same kids who we should be taking care of we can all make a difference that every single one of us whether we have children whether we care about children whether we have nieces or nephews or anything
that we can make a difference whether you sit down and eat a meal with your kids whether you take your kids or grandchildren or nieces and nephews shopping to a farmers market just do tastings with them sit down and care and on the macro level
