so i walked very comfortably to this missionary school that was run by an american missionary and the first thing the american missionary gave me was a candy i had never in my life ever tasted candy so i said to myself with all these hundred other boys
but you kept going and i stayed i don 't know why i stayed but i stayed and all of a sudden i passed the national examination found myself in a very beautiful high school in kenya and i finished high school
and this man told me here go
so i got a scholarship to st lawrence university upstate new york finished that and then after that i went to harvard graduate school finished that and then i worked in dc a little bit i wrote a book for national geographic and taught history u s history
and every time i kept going back home
so one day the scouts came running and told the villagers the enemies are coming only half an hour away they 'll be here so people scrambled took their things and ready to go move out
and that man told me so here you are
i said i 'm going to dedicate myself i 'm leaving america i 'm going to run for office
so last july i moved from america in june ran in july election and won and i came for them
and that 's my goal and right now i have in place for the last nine months
i 'm asking my friends from america to help with bringing nurses or doctors to help us out i 'm trying to improve infrastructure
i 'm using the knowledge i received from the united states and from my community to move them forward i 'm trying to develop homegrown solutions
so my plan right now as i continue with introducing students to different fields some become doctors some lawyers we want to produce a comprehensive group of people students who can come back and help us see a community grow that is in the middle a huge economic recession
so as i continue to be a member of parliament and as i continue listening to all of you talking about botany talking about health talking about democracy talking about new inventions i 'm hoping that one day in my own little community which is twenty six thousand square kilometers maybe five times the size of rhode island with no roads we 'll be able to become a model
to help others develop thank you very much
