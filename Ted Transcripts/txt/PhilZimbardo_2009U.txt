i want to share with you some ideas about the secret power of time in a very short time

let 's tune into the conversation of the principles in adam 's temptation
come on adam don't be so wishy washy take a
one bite adam don't abandon eve i don't know guys
get in trouble okay one bite what the hell
life is temptation it's all about yielding resisting yes no now later impulsive reflective present focus and future focus
within one year and most of them did so without using birth control so much for promises now lets tempt four year olds
my colleague at stanford went back fourteen years later to try to discover what was different about those kids there were enormous differences between kids who resisted and kids who yielded in many ways
the kids who resisted scored two hundred and fifty points higher on the sat that's enormous that's like a whole set of different iq points
didn't get in as much trouble they were better students they were self confident and determined and the key for me today the key for you is they were future focused instead of present
so what is time perspective that's what i'm going to talk about today time perspective is the study of how individuals all of us divide the flow of your human experience into time zones or time categories and you do it automatically and non consciously
what determines any decision you make you make a decision on which you're going to base an action for some people it's only about what is in the immediate situation what other people are doing and what you're feeling
and those people when they make their decisions in that format we're going to call them present oriented because their focus is what is now for others
the present is irrelevant it's always about what is this situation like that i've experienced in the past so that their decisions are based on past memories
is something that influences every decision you make you're totally unaware of namely the extent to which you have one of these biased time
or past negative you can be present hedonistic namely you focus on the joys of life or present fatalist it doesn't matter your life is controlled you can be future oriented setting goals or you can be transcendental future namely life begins after death
so very quickly what is the optimal time profile high on past positive moderately high on future and moderate on present hedonism
is the energy the energy to explore yourself places people sensuality
they sacrifice hobbies and they sacrifice sleep so it affects their health and they live for work achievement and control i'm sure that resonates with some of the tedsters
and it resonated for me i grew up as a poor kid in the south bronx ghetto of sicilian family everyone lived in the past and present i'm here as a future oriented person who went over the top who did all these sacrifices because
teachers intervened and made me future oriented told me don't eat that marshmallow because if you wait you're going to get two of them until i learned to balance out i've added present hedonism i've added
a focus on the past positive so at seventy six years old i am more energetic than ever more productive and i'm happier than i have ever
i just want to say that we are applying this to many world problems changing the drop out rates of school kids combating addictions enhancing teen health
