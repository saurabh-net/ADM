talk today about saving more but not today
how we could really use behavioral finance now you might ask what is behavioral finance
so let 's think about how we manage our money let 's start with mortgages it 's kind of a recent topic at least in the u s
for example investing in the stock market
two years ago three years ago about four years ago markets did well
we were risk takers of course then market stocks seize and we 're like wow these losses they feel emotionally they feel very different from what we actually thought about it when markets were going up
that the people not in this room are spending more than a thousand
so where does it take us we 're not doing a great job managing money
behavioral finance is really a combination of psychology and economics trying to understand the money mistakes people make
and i can keep standing here for the twelve minutes and fifty three seconds that i have left
and make fun of all sorts of ways we manage money and at the end you 're going to ask how can we help people and that 's what i really want to focus on today how do we take an understanding of the money mistakes people make
and then turning the behavioral challenges into behavioral solutions and what i 'm going to talk about today is save more tomorrow i want to address the issue of savings
we have on the screen a representative sample of one hundred americans and we 're going to look at their saving behavior
first thing to notice is half of them do not even have access to a four hundred and one k plan they cannot make savings easy they cannot have money go away from their paycheck into a four hundred and one k plan before they see it before they can touch it
how many people end up saving to a four hundred and one k plan
or save too little we think we have a problem of people saving too much let 's look at that we have one person well actually we 're going to slice him in half because it 's less than one percent
what are we going to do about it that 's what i really want to focus on we have to understand why people are not saving
and then we can hopefully flip the behavioral challenges into behavioral solutions
and then see how powerful it might be so let me divert for a second as we 're going to identify the problems the challenges the behavioral challenges that prevent people from saving i 'm going to divert and talk about bananas and chocolate suppose we had another wonderful ted event next week
and during the break there would be a snack and you could choose bananas or chocolate how many of you think you would like to have bananas during this hypothetical ted event next week who would go for bananas
wonderful i predict scientifically seventy four percent of you will go for bananas well that 's at least what one wonderful study predicted
and then count down the days and see what people ended up eating
the same people that imagined themselves eating the bananas ended up eating chocolates a week later
self control is not a problem in the future it 's only a problem now when the chocolate is next to us
what does it have to do with time and savings this issue of immediate gratification or as some economists call it present bias
we think about saving we know we should be saving we know we 'll do it next year but today let us go and spend christmas is coming we might as well buy a lot of gifts for everyone we know
let me now talk about another behavioral obstacle to saving having to do with inertia but again a little diversion to the topic of organ donation wonderful study comparing different countries we 're going to look at two similar countries germany and austria
and in germany if you would like to donate your organs god forbid something really bad happens to you
when you get your driving license or an i d you check the box saying i would like to donate my organs not many people like checking boxes it takes effort you need to think twelve percent do
to donate your organs or not but when you get your driving license you check the box if you do not want to donate your organ
nobody checks boxes that 's kind of too much effort one percent check the box the rest do nothing doing nothing is very common not many people check boxes
what are the implications to saving lives and having organs available
in germany twelve percent check the box twelve percent are organ donors huge shortage of organs god forbid if you need one in austria again nobody checks the box therefore ninety nine percent of people are organ donors
inertia lack of action what is the default setting if people do nothing if they keep procrastinating if they don 't check the boxes very powerful we 're going to talk about what happens if people are overwhelmed and scared to make their four hundred and one k choices
we hate losing stuff even if it doesn 't mean a lot of risk you would hate to go to the atm take out one hundred dollars and notice that you lost one of those dollar twenty bills it 's very painful even though it doesn 't mean anything those twenty dollars might have been a quick lunch
so this notion of loss aversion
now we talked about inertia and organ donations and checking the box
if people have to check a lot of boxes to join a four hundred and one k plan they 're going to keep procrastinating and not join and last we talked about loss aversion and the monkeys and the apples if people frame mentally saving for retirement as a loss
they 're not going to be saving for retirement
so we 've got these challenges and what richard thaler and i were always fascinated by take behavioral finance make it behavioral finance on steroids or behavioral finance two point zero or behavioral finance in action flip the challenges into solutions
makes it easy it 's an autopilot once you tell me you would like to save more in the future
let 's say every january you 're going to be saving more automatically and it 's going to go away from your paycheck to the four hundred and one k plan before you see it before you touch it before you get the issue of immediate gratification
because i don 't want to just throw numbers in a vacuum i want really to think about the fact that saving four times more
when they save fourteen percent they might be able to maybe have nice dress shoes to walk to the car to drive this is a real difference by now
this is really the tip of the iceberg if you think about
people and mortgages and buying houses and then not being able to pay for it we need to think about that if you 're thinking about
we need to think about that the average actually the record is in singapore the average household spends dollar four thousand a year on
in the retirement area when it comes to what people do with their money after retirement
one last question how many of you feel comfortable that as you 're planning for retirement you have a really solid plan when you 're going to retire when you 're going to claim social security benefits what lifestyle to expect
how much to spend every month so you 're not going to run out of money how many of you feel you have a solid plan for the future when it comes to post retirement decisions one two three four
less than three percent of a very sophisticated audience behavioral finance has a long way there 's a lot of opportunities to make it powerful again
