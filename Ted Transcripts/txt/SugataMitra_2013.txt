i need to tell you a little story
which kind of sets the stage
i tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools where did it come from
and the biggest of the empires on this planet
trying to run the entire planet without computers
without computers without telephones
with data handwritten on pieces of paper and traveling by ships
but the victorians actually did it what they did was
amazing they created a global computer made up of people
it 's still with us today it 's called the bureaucratic administrative machine
in order to have that machine running
you need lots and lots of people they made another machine
they made another machine to produce those people
the school the schools would produce the people
who would then become parts of the bureaucratic administrative machine they must be
they must be identical to each other
they must be able to read
and they must be able to do multiplication division addition and subtraction in their head
they must be so identical that you could pick one up from new zealand
and ship them to canada and he would be instantly functional
the victorians were great engineers
they engineered a system that was so robust
that it 's still with us today continuously producing identical people
for a machine that no longer exists
with that design that produces these identical people it 's wonderfully constructed
it 's just that we don 't need it anymore it 's outdated
what are the kind of jobs that we have today well the clerks are the computers they 're there in thousands in every office
and you have people who guide those computers to do their clerical jobs
those people don 't need to be able to write beautifully by hand
they do need to be able to read
in fact they need to be able to read discerningly
we know that people will work from wherever they want whenever they want in whatever way they want
i used to teach people how to write computer programs in new delhi fourteen years ago
at the same time we also had lots of parents rich people who had computers
i made a hole in the boundary wall of the slum next to my office
they said why have you put it there i said just like that and they said
about eight hours later we found them browsing
and teaching each other how to browse so i said well that 's impossible
because how is it possible they don 't know anything my colleagues said no it 's a simple solution
one of your students must have been passing by showed them how to use the mouse
so i said yeah that 's possible so i repeated the experiment i went three hundred miles out of delhi into a really remote village where the chances of a passing software development engineer
a couple of months found kids playing games on it when they saw me they said we want a faster processor and a better mouse
in an irritated voice they said you 've given us a machine that works only in english so we had to teach ourselves english in order to use it
teach ourselves said so casually
to his left is his student she 's six
and he 's teaching her how to browse
then onto other parts of the country i repeated this over and over again and finally a girl
and finally a girl explaining in marathi
what it is and said there 's a processor inside so i started publishing
i published everywhere i wrote down and measured everything and i said in nine months a group of children left alone with a computer in any language will reach the same standard as an office secretary in the west i 'd seen it happen over and over and over again
but i was curious to know what else would they do if they could do this much i started experimenting with other subjects
among them for example pronunciation
and they needed good pronunciation because that would improve their jobs
i gave them a speech to text engine in a computer and i said keep talking into it until it types what you say
in a very clear english accent
so then people said well how far will it go where does it stop i decided i would destroy my own argument
by creating an absurd proposition
and i said i 'll measure them they 'll get a zero
i 'll spend a couple of months i 'll leave it for a couple of months i 'll go back they 'll get another zero
the children came rushing said what 's all this so i said it 's very topical very important
so i said well what did i expect so i said okay but
so they said we haven 't given up
so a little girl who you see just now she raised her hand and she says to me in broken tamil and english she said well apart from the fact that improper replication absurd but
a twenty two year old girl who was an accountant
and she played with them all the time so i asked this girl can you help them
so she says absolutely not
i didn 't have science in school i have no idea what they 're doing under that tree all day long
i said i 'll tell you what use the method of the grandmother
so she says what 's that i said stand behind them whenever they do anything you just say
well wow i mean how did you do that
she did that for two more months the scores jumped to fifty percent
kallikuppam had caught up with my control school in new delhi a rich private school with a trained biotechnology teacher
when i saw that graph i knew
there is a way to level the playing field
i got the camera angle wrong that one is just amateur stuff but what she was saying as you could make out was about neurons with her hands were like that and she was saying neurons communicate
well we know what they 're like today
what 's learning going to be like we know what it 's like today children pouring over with their mobile phones on the one hand
and then reluctantly going to school to pick up their books with their other hand
what will it be tomorrow
could it be that at the point in time when you need to know something you can find out in two minutes
knowing that 's what distinguishes us from the apes and become homo sapiens
it took us only ten thousand to make knowing obsolete
what an achievement that is but we have to integrate that into our own future
encouragement seems to be the key
if you look at kuppam if you look at all of the experiments that i did it was simply
it was simply saluting learning
there is evidence from neuroscience
the reptilian part of our brain which sits in the center of our brain when it 's threatened it shuts down everything else it shuts down the prefrontal cortex the parts which learn
it shuts all of that down
punishment and examinations are seen as threats we take our children we make them shut their brains down and then we say perform
why did they create a system like that
because it was needed there was an age in the age of empires when you needed those people
who can survive under threat when you 're standing in a trench all alone
but the age of empires is gone what happens to creativity in our age
we need to shift that balance back looking for british grandmothers
i put out notices and papers saying if you are a british grandmother if you have broadband and a web camera can you give me one hour of your time per week for free
i got two hundred in the first two weeks i know more british grandmothers than anyone in the universe
the granny cloud sits on the internet if there 's a child in trouble we beam a gran
she goes on over skype and she sorts things out
i 've seen them do it from a village called diggles
in northwestern england deep inside a village in tamil nadu india six thousand miles away
she does it with only one age old gesture
i think what we need to look at is we need to look at learning
as the product of educational self organization if you allow the educational process to self organize then learning emerges it 's not about making learning happen it 's about letting it happen
the teacher sets the process in motion
and then she stands back in awe and watches as learning happens i think that 's what all this is pointing at
but how will we know how will we come to know
they are basically broadband collaboration and encouragement put together i 've tried this in many many schools it 's been tried all over the world and teachers sort of stand back and say it just happens by itself and i said yeah it happens by itself how did you know that i said
you won 't believe the children who told me and where they 're from
they built the first curriculum but we 've lost sight of those wondrous questions we 've brought it down to
the way you would put it to a nine year old is to say if a meteorite was coming to hit the earth
how would you figure out if it was going to or not
and if he says well what how you say there 's a magic word it 's called the tangent of an angle and leave him alone he 'll figure it out
so here are a couple of images from soles
i 've tried incredible incredible questions
when did the world begin how will it end
to nine year olds this one is about what happens to the air we breathe
this is done by children without the help of any teacher the teacher only raises the question and then stands back and admires the answer
we don 't want to be spare parts for a great human computer do we
so we need to design a future for learning
and i 've got to hang on i 've got to get this wording exactly right
because you know it 's very important my wish is to help design a future of learning by supporting children all over the world to tap into their wonder and their ability to work together help me build this school it will be called the school in the cloud
the way i want to do this
is to build a facility where i can study this
it 's a facility which is practically unmanned there 's only one granny
who manages health and safety the rest of it 's from the cloud the lights are turned on and off by the cloud etc etc everything 's done from the cloud
across all five continents and send me the data then i 'll put it all together move it into the school of clouds
and create the future of learning
and i said to her you know i want to give a computer to everybody every child i don 't know what should i do the future of learning
