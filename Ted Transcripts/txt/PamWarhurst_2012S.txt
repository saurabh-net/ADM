and now it 's more like this
we call it propaganda gardening people 's front gardens
and even in front of the police station
and you know we 're not doing it because we 're bored
because we want to start a revolution
we tried to answer this simple question can you find a unifying language that cuts across age and income and culture that will help people themselves find a new way of living
can we find that language
and then can we replicate those actions
and the answer would appear to be yes
and the language would appear to be food
what we teach our kids in school and what new skills we share amongst ourselves and business what we do with the pound in our pocket and which businesses we choose to support now let 's imagine those plates agitated with community actions around food
if we start one of those community plates spinning that 's really great that really starts to empower people but if we can then spin that community plate with the learning plate and then spin it with the business plate we 've got a real show there we 've got some action theater
we 've not asked anybody 's permission to do this we 're just doing it
so back to the public meeting
two seconds and then the room exploded i have never
ever experienced anything like that in my life
and it 's been the same in every single room in every town that we 've ever told our story people are ready and respond to the story of food they want positive actions they can engage in and in their bones
they know it 's time to take personal responsibility and invest in more kindness to each other and to the environment
and since we had that meeting three and a half years ago
it 's been a heck of a roller coaster
and for those people that don 't want to do either of those things maybe they can cook so we pick them seasonally and then we go on the street or in the pub or in the church or wherever people are living their lives this is about us going to the people and saying
we are all part of the local food jigsaw we are all part of a solution
past our cafes and our small shops through our market
and the kids are on the board
and because the community was really keen on working with the high school the high school is now teaching agriculture
we have turned that into a market garden training center
and that is polytunnels and raised beds and all the things you need to get the soil under your fingers and think maybe there 's a job in this for me in the future and because we were doing that some local academics said you know we could help design a commercial horticulture course for you there 's not one that we know of so they 're doing that and we 're going to launch it later this year
and then we had a chat with the farmers and we said we 're really serious about this but they didn 't actually believe us
so we thought okay what should we do i know if we can create a campaign around one product and show them there is local loyalty to that product maybe they 'll change their mind and see we 're serious so we launched a campaign because it just amuses me called every egg matters
asking for a local todmorden egg and the result of that was some farmers upped the amount of flocks they got of free range birds and then they went on to meat birds and although these are really really small steps that
and we 're just volunteers and it 's only an experiment
but it is joined up and it is inclusive
this is a movement for everyone
it 's been really quite a roller coaster experience but going back to that first question that we asked is it replicable yeah
it most certainly is replicable more than thirty towns in england now are spinning the incredible edible plate
and worldwide we 've got communities across america
and none of this takes more money
and none of this demands a bureaucracy
and there 's some great ideas already in our patch
if we want to inspire the farmers of tomorrow then please let us say to every school
create a sense of purpose around the importance to the environment local food and soils
there are so many things you can do but ultimately this is about something really simple through an organic process
through an increasing recognition of the power of small actions we are starting at last to believe in ourselves again
and to believe in our capacity each and every one of us to build a different
and a kinder future and in my book that 's incredible
