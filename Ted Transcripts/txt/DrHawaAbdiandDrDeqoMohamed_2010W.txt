as you know always in a civil war the ones affected most are the women and children so our patients are women and children and they are in our backyard it 's our home we welcome them that 's the camp that we have in now ninety thousand
people where seventy five percent of them are women and children pat mitchell and this is your hospital
and we have a little storage room where we converted a jail so if you beat your wife you 're going to be there
to help the sick people i admired them and i decided to become a doctor my mother died unfortunately when i was twelve years old then my father allowed me to proceed with my hope
when i saw the people who needed me i was staying with them to help because i could do something for them
now my place is ninety thousand people
