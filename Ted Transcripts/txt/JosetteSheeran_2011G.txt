are fighting every day to survive and can
this red cup comes from rwanda from a child named fabian and i carry this around as a symbol
really of the challenge and also the hope
because one cup of food a day changes fabian 's life completely
about a billion people on earth
or one out of every seven woke up
and didn 't even know how to fill this cup
one out of every seven people first i 'll ask you why should you care why should we care
i rarely find an audience where people can go back very far without that experience some are driven by compassion feel it 's perhaps one of the fundamental acts of humanity as gandhi said
to a hungry man a piece of bread is the face of god
others worry about peace and security stability in the world
we saw the food riots in two thousand and eight after what i call the silent tsunami of hunger swept the globe when food prices doubled overnight
the destabilizing effects of hunger are known throughout human history
one of the most fundamental
acts of civilization is to ensure people can get enough food others
think about malthusian nightmares will we be able to feed
a population that will be nine billion in just a few decades this is not a negotiable thing hunger people have to eat there 's going to be a lot of people this is jobs and opportunity all the way up and down the value chain but i actually came to this issue in a different way
when an image very similar to this came
on the television and this was yet another famine in ethiopia one two years earlier had killed more than a million people but it never struck me as it did that moment because on that image was a woman trying to nurse her baby and she had no milk
and i thought there 's nothing more haunting
than the cry of a child that cannot be returned
and it was at that moment that i just was filled with
we know how to fix hunger a hundred years ago we didn 't
we actually have the technology and systems
and i was just struck
that this is out of place at our time in history these images are out of place well guess what
this is last week in northern kenya yet again
in fact what we know now
is that every ten seconds we lose a child to hunger this is more malaria and tuberculosis combined
malaria and tuberculosis combined and we know
that the issue is not just production of food one of my mentors in life was norman borlaug my hero
but today i 'm going to talk about access to food because actually
this year and last year and during the two thousand and eight food crisis there was enough food on earth for everyone to have two thousand seven hundred kilocalories so why is it
and i also want to talk about what i call our new burden of knowledge in two thousand and eight lancet compiled all the research and put forward the compelling evidence that if a child in its first thousand days from conception
to two years old does not have adequate nutrition the damage is irreversible their brains and bodies will be stunted and here you see a brain scan of two children one who had adequate nutrition another neglected
and who was deeply malnourished and we can see brain volumes up to forty percent less
in these children and in this slide you see the neurons
and the synapses of the brain don 't form and what we know now is this has huge impact on economies which i 'll talk about later but also the earning potential of these children is cut in half
how to fix it very simply
and yet in many places a third of the children
by the time they 're three already are facing a life of hardship due to this
i 'd like to talk about some of the things i 've seen on the front lines of hunger
some of the things i 've learned
in bringing my economic and trade knowledge and my experience in the private sector i 'd like to talk about where the gap of knowledge is well first i 'd like to talk about the oldest nutritional method on earth breastfeeding
you may be surprised to know
that a child could be saved every twenty two seconds if there was breastfeeding in the first six months of life
but in niger for example
less than seven percent of the children are breastfed
for the first six months of life exclusively
in mauritania less than three percent
this is something that can be transformed with knowledge this message this word can come out that this is not an old fashioned way of doing business it 's a brilliant way
of saving your child 's life and so today we focus on not just passing out food but making sure the mothers have enough enrichment
and teaching them about breastfeeding the second thing i 'd like to talk about if you were living in a remote village somewhere your child was limp
and you were in a drought or you were in floods or you were in a situation where there wasn 't adequate diversity of diet what would you do do you think you could go to the store and get a choice of power bars like we can
and pick the right one to match well i find parents out on the front lines very aware their children are going down for the count and i go to those shops if there are any
or out to the fields to see what they can get and they cannot obtain the nutrition
even if they know what they need to do it 's not available and
i 'm very excited about this because one thing we 're working on is transforming the technologies that are very available
in the food industry to be available for traditional crops and this is made with chickpeas dried milk and a host of vitamins matched to exactly what the brain needs it costs seventeen cents for us to produce this as what i call food for humanity
we did this with food technologists in india and pakistan
really about three of them
and these types of technologies i see have the potential to transform the face of hunger and nutrition malnutrition out on the front when disaster strikes
the economy gets blown people lose a job floods war conflict bad governance all of those things there is nothing to fall back on and usually the institutions churches temples other things do not have the resources to provide a safety net
what we have found working with the world bank is that the poor man 's safety net the best investment is school feeding and if you fill the cup with local agriculture from small farmers you have a transformative effect many kids in the world can 't go to school because they have to go beg and find a meal but when that food is there
it 's transformative it costs less than twenty five cents a day to change a kid 's life but what is most amazing is the effect on girls in countries where girls don 't go to school
and you offer a meal to girls in school we see enrollment rates about fifty percent girls and boys
we see a transformation in attendance by girls and there was no argument because it 's incentive
because it 's incentive families need the help
and we find that if we keep girls in school later they 'll stay in school until they 're sixteen and won 't get married if there 's food in school
or if they get an extra ration of food at the end of the week
we know that there 's boom and bust cycles of hunger we know this right now on the horn of africa we 've been through this before so is this a hopeless cause absolutely not
i 'd like to talk about what i call our warehouses for hope cameroon northern cameroon boom and bust cycles of hunger every year for decades food aid coming in
every year when people are starving during the lean
seasons well two years ago
we decided let 's transform the model of fighting hunger and instead of giving out the food aid we put it into food banks and we said listen during the lean season take the food out
you manage the village manages these warehouses and during harvest put it back with interest food interest so add in five percent ten percent more food
for the past two years five hundred of these villages where these are have not needed any food aid they 're self sufficient and the food banks are growing and they 're starting school feeding programs for their children by the people in the village but they 've never had the ability to build even the basic infrastructure or the resources
i love this idea that came from the village level three keys
to unlock that warehouse food is gold there and simple ideas can transform
the face not of small areas of big areas of the world
i 'd like to talk about what i call digital food
food can be there and people can 't buy it well this picture i was in hebron in a small shop this shop where instead of bringing in food we provide digital food
for milk and yogurt and eggs and hummus the dairy industry has gone up thirty percent
the shopkeepers are hiring more people it is a win win win situation that starts the food economy moving
we now deliver food in over thirty countries over cell phones
transforming even the presence of refugees in countries and other ways
perhaps most exciting to me is an idea that bill gates howard buffett and others have supported boldly which is to ask the question what if instead of looking at the hungry as victims and most of them are small farmers who cannot raise enough food
or sell food to even support their own families what if
we view them as the solution as the value chain to fight hunger what if
from the women in africa
who cannot sell any food there 's no roads there 's no warehouses there 's not even a tarp to pick the food up with what if we give the enabling environment for them to provide the food to feed the hungry children
elsewhere and purchasing for progress today is in twenty one countries and guess what
in virtually every case when poor farmers are given a guaranteed market if you say we will buy three hundred metric tons of this we 'll pick it up we 'll make sure it 's stored properly their yields have gone up two three fourfold and they figure it out
because it 's the first guaranteed opportunity they 've had in their life and we 're seeing people transform their lives
today food aid our food aid
the very lives that need the food now you 'd ask
can this be done at scale these are great ideas village level ideas well i 'd like to talk about brazil because i 've taken a journey to brazil over the past couple of years when i read that brazil was defeating hunger faster than any nation on earth right now
and what i 've found is rather than investing their money in food subsidies and other things they invested in a school feeding program and they require that a third of that food come from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity and they 're doing this at huge scale after president lula declared his
goal of ensuring everyone had three meals a day and this
zero hunger program costs five percent of gdp and has lifted
many millions of people out of hunger and poverty it is transforming the face of hunger in brazil and it 's at scale and it 's creating opportunities i 've gone out there i 've met with the small farmers
who have built their livelihoods on the opportunity and platform provided by this now if we look at the economic imperative here this isn 't just about compassion the fact is studies show
that the cost of malnutrition and hunger the cost to society the burden it has to bear is on average six percent and in some countries up to eleven percent of gdp a year and if you look at the thirty six countries with the highest
burden of malnutrition that 's two hundred and sixty billion lost from a productive economy every year
well the world bank estimates it would take about ten billion dollars ten point three
to address malnutrition in those countries you look at the cost benefit analysis and my dream is to take this issue not just from the compassion argument but to the finance ministers of the world and say we cannot afford to not invest
in the access to adequate affordable nutrition for all of humanity
the amazing thing i 've found is nothing can change on a big scale
without the determination of a leader when a leader says not under my watch everything begins to change and the world can come in with enabling environments and opportunities
to do this and the fact that france has put food at the center of the g twenty is really important because food is one issue that cannot be solved person by person nation by nation we have to stand together and we 're seeing nations in africa wfp 's been able to leave thirty nations
i believe we 're living at a time in human history where it 's just simply unacceptable
that children wake up and don 't know where to find a cup of food
not only that transforming hunger is an opportunity
but i think we have to change our mindsets
i am so honored to be here with some of the world 's top innovators and thinkers and i would like you to join with all of humanity to draw a line in the sand and say no more
no more are we going to accept this and we want to tell our grandchildren that there was a terrible time in history
