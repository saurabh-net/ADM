i don't think we're going to make it
a real problem we've got a climate crisis so we went around the table to talk about what we should do
the conversation came to my fifteen year old daughter mary
she said i agree with everything that's been
i'm scared and i'm angry
and then she turned to me and said dad your generation created this problem you'd better fix it all the conversation stopped
all the eyes turned to me
i didn't know what to we've reached that time
we cannot afford to underestimate this problem
we face irreversible and catastrophic consequences
we must act and we must act decisively i've got to tell you for me everything changed that evening and so my partners and i we set off on this mission
to learn more to try to do much more so we mobilized we got on airplanes we went to brazil we went to china and to india
for this climate crisis we assembled a network really of superstars from policy activists to scientists and entrepreneurs and business leaders fifty or so of them and so
i want to tell you about what we've learned in doing that and four lessons i've learned in the last year the first lesson is that companies are really powerful and that matters a lot
this is a story about how wal mart went green and what that means two years ago the ceo lee scott
that green is the next big thing and so wal mart made going green a top priority
they committed that they're going to take their existing stores and reduce their energy consumption by twenty percent and their new stores by thirty percent and do all that in seven years
the three biggest uses of energy in a store are heating and air conditioning then lighting and then refrigeration so look what they did they painted the roofs of all their stores white
they put smart skylights through their stores so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands and third they put the refrigerated goods behind closed doors with led lighting i mean why would you try to refrigerate a whole store
these are really simple smart solutions based on existing technology why does wal mart matter well it's massive
have one of the world 's most amazing supply chains sixty thousand suppliers if wal mart were a country it would be the sixth largest trading partner with china
most important they have a big effect on other companies when wal mart declares it's going to go green and be profitable
it has a powerful impact on other great institutions so let me tell you this when wal mart achieves twenty percent energy reductions that's going to be a very big deal
but i'm afraid it's not enough
we need wal mart and every other company to do the same
the second thing that we learned is that individuals matter and they matter enormously
i've got another wal mart story for you
wal mart has over one hundred and twenty five million u s customers that's a third of the u s population
sixty five million compact fluorescent light bulbs were sold last year
and wal mart has committed they're going to sell another one hundred million light bulbs in the coming year
but the pay off is really enormous one hundred million compact fluorescent light bulbs means that we'll save six hundred million dollars in energy bills and twenty million tons of co two every year
year in and year out
it does seem really hard to get consumers to do the right thing it is stupid that we use two tons of steel glass and plastic to haul our sorry selves to the shopping mall
it's stupid that we put water in plastic bottles in fiji and ship it here
it's hard to change consumer behavior because
you know how much co two you generated to drive here or fly here
i don't know and i should
those of us who care about all this would act better if we knew what
the real costs were but as long as we pretend that co two is free as long as these uses are nearly invisible
how can we expect change i'm really afraid because i think the kinds of changes we can reasonably expect from individuals
are going to be clearly not enough
the third lesson we learned is that policy matters
it really matters in fact policy is paramount
hand he stood up you know bob 's that berkeley techie type who started sybase
well bob said the most important thing we could do right now is to make it clear in sacramento california
that we need a market based system of mandates that's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in california
it's necessary and just as important it's good for the california economy so
thank you i think it's the most important legislation of two thousand and six why
he told us that brazil 's government mandated that every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol and they mandated that
their new vehicles would be flex fuel compatible right they'd run ethanol or ordinary gasoline and so here 's what's happened in brazil they now have twenty nine thousand ethanol pumps
seven hundred in the u s and a paltry two in california and in three years their new car fleet has gone from four percent to eighty five percent flex fuel
compare that to the u s
five percent are flex fuel and you know what
didn't ship to the middle east it's created a million jobs inside that country and it's saved thirty two million tons of co two it's really substantial that's ten percent of the co two emissions across their entire country
but brazil 's only one point three percent of the world 's
in fact i'm afraid all of the best policies we have are not going to be enough the fourth and final lesson we've learned
is about the potential of radical innovation so i want to tell you about a tragic problem and a breakthrough technology every year a million and a half people die of a completely preventable disease that's malaria six thousand people a day
all for want of two dollars worth of medications that we can buy at the corner drugstore well two dollars two dollars
too much for africa so a team of berkeley researchers with fifteen million dollars from the gates foundation is engineering designing a radical new way to make the key ingredient called
to make that drug ten times cheaper
and in doing so they'll save a million lives at least a million lives a year a million lives
their breakthrough technology is synthetic biology this leverages millions of years of evolution by redesigning bugs to make really useful products now what you do is you get inside the microbe you change its metabolic pathways and
now formed a company called amyris and this technology that they're using can be used to make better biofuels
let me skip over that better biofuels are a really big deal that means we can precisely engineer the molecules in the fuel chain
and optimize them along the way so if all goes well they're going to have designer bugs in warm vats that are
and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels i guess that's better living through bugs
alan kay is famous for saying the best way to predict the future is to invent it and of course at kleiner we kind of apologize and say the second best way is to finance it and that's why we're investing
two hundred million dollars in a wide range of really disruptive new technologies for innovation in green technologies and we're encouraging others to do it as well we're talking a lot about this i'm really afraid
we need much much more
you didn't know that there's enough energy in hot rocks under the country to supply america 's energy needs for the next thousand years
that we are not investing more in energy research in this country and i am really afraid that it's absolutely not enough
so in a year 's worth of learning we found a bunch of surprises who would have thought that a mass retailer could make money by going green who would have thought that a database entrepreneur could transform california with legislation who would have thought that the
and who would have thought that all that is not enough
not enough to stabilize the climate not enough to keep the ice in greenland from crashing into the ocean the scientists tell us and they're only guessing that we've got to reduce
and so somehow we're going to have to find the political will to do this all around the world
the wild card in this deck is china to size the problem china 's co two emissions today are three point three gigatons the u s is five point
business as usual means we'll have twenty three gigatons from china by two thousand and fifty that's about as much co two as there is in the whole world
and if it's business as usual we're going out of business when i was in davos china 's mayor of dalian was pressed about their co two strategy and he said the following you know
then he asked why should china sacrifice our growth so that the west can continue to be profligate and stupid
so that all people and all nations
tell you what green technologies going green is bigger than the internet it could be the biggest economic opportunity of the twenty one st century moreover if we succeed
it's going to be the most important transformation for life on the planet since as bill joy says we went from methane to oxygen in the atmosphere now here 's the hard question if the trajectory
of all the world 's companies and individuals and policies and innovation is not going to be enough what are we going to do
everyone here cares about changing the world and has made a difference in that one way or another
so our call to action
my call to you is for you to make going green
you can personally get carbon neutral go to climatecrisis org or carboncalculator com and buy carbon credits you could join other leaders in
mandating lobbying for mandated cap and trade in u s greenhouse gas reductions there's six bills right now in congress let 's get one of
the most important thing you can do i think is to use your personal power and your rolodex to lead your business your institution
going green do it like wal mart get it to go green for its customers and its suppliers and for itself
really think outside the box can you imagine what it would be like if amazon or ebay or google or microsoft or apple really went green and you caused that to happen
i can't wait to see what we tedsters do about this crisis and i really really hope
that we multiply all of our energy all of our talent and all of our influence to solve this problem
if we do i can look forward to the conversation i'm going to have with my daughter i'm really scared
