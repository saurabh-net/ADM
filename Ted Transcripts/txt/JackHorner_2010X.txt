i ask for a show of hands or a clapping
i 'm interested in how many are three to twelve years old
dinosaurs are kind of funny you know
that 's sort of the theme big different and gone
the title of my talk
shape shifting dinosaurs the cause of a premature extinction now i assume that we remember dinosaurs and there 's lots of different shapes lots of different kinds a long time ago
back in the early one thousand nine hundred s museums were out looking for dinosaurs they went out and gathered them up
every museum wanted a little bigger or better one than anybody else
so if the museum in toronto went out and collected
and a better one and that happened for all museums so everyone was out looking for all these bigger and better dinosaurs
where are all the little ones
and they thought about it and they even wrote papers about it
where are the little dinosaurs
go to a museum you 'll see
see how many baby dinosaurs there are
people assumed and this was actually a problem people assumed that
if they had little dinosaurs if they had juvenile dinosaurs they 'd be easy to identify
but all they had were big dinosaurs
and it comes down to a couple of things first off scientists have egos
and scientists like to name dinosaurs
and what happened of course is we ended up with a whole bunch of different dinosaurs
in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five
a light went on in somebody 's head dr peter dodson at the university of pennsylvania actually realized that dinosaurs
grew kind of like birds do
which is different than the way reptiles grow
the cassowary as an example
and it 's kind of cool if you look at the cassowary or any of the birds that have crests on their heads they actually grow to about eighty percent adult size before the crest starts to grow
in what we call ontogeny so allometric cranial ontogeny
one that was eighty percent grown
and you didn 't know that it was going to grow up to a cassowary you would think they were two different animals
so this was a problem and
peter dodson pointed this out using some duck billed dinosaurs
a baby and an adult and make an average of what it should look like if it grew in sort of a linear fashion
it would have a crest about half the size of the adult
taken that taken peter dodson 's work and
gone on with that then we would have a lot less dinosaurs than we have
but scientists have egos they like to name things
now we have a way of actually testing to see whether a dinosaur or any animal is a young one or an older one and that 's by actually cutting into their bones
but cutting into the bones of a dinosaur is hard to do as you can imagine because
they 're very well taken care of
they don 't like it if you come in and want to saw them open and look inside
i have a museum and i collect dinosaurs
and i can saw mine open so that 's what i do
if you cut open a little dinosaur
it 's very spongy inside like a and if you cut into an older dinosaur it 's very massive you can tell it 's mature bone so it 's real easy to tell them apart
there 's this unit of rock called the hell creek formation that produces the last dinosaurs that lived on earth and there are twelve of them that everyone recognizes i mean the twelve primary dinosaurs that went extinct
and so we will evaluate
and that 's sort of what i 've been doing so my students my staff we 've been cutting them open
dinosaur 's skull do you
and the assumption is is that they 're related like cousins or whatever but no one ever considered that they might be more closely related
in other words people looked at them and they saw the differences
and you all know that if you are going to determine whether you 're related to your brother or your sister you can 't do it by looking at differences you can only determine relatedness by looking for similarities so
people were looking at these and they were talking about how different they are
and then stygimoloch another dinosaur from the same age lived at the same time
has spikes sticking out the back of its head it 's got a little tiny dome
and it 's got a bunch of gnarly stuff on its nose
here 's a dinosaur that has spikes sticking out of its head no dome and gnarly stuff on its nose
nobody noticed the gnarly stuff sort of looked alike but they did look at these three and they said
these are three different dinosaurs and dracorex is probably the most primitive of them and the other one is
more primitive than the other it 's unclear to me how they actually sorted these three of them out but if you line them up if you just take those three skulls and just line them up
they line up like this dracorex is the littlest one
that should give me a clue
and look it was spongy inside
really spongy inside i mean it is a juvenile and it 's growing really fast
so it is going to get bigger if you cut open stygimoloch it is doing the same thing the dome that little dome is growing really fast it 's inflating very fast
what 's interesting is the spike on the back of the dracorex was growing very fast as well the spikes on the back of the stygimoloch are actually resorbing which means they 're getting smaller
and its little bumps on the back of its head were also resorbing so
just with these three dinosaurs you can easily as a scientist we can easily hypothesize that it is just a growth series of the same animal
so a colleague of mine at berkley he and i were looking at triceratops and
before the year two thousand now remember triceratops was first found in the one thousand eight hundred s before two thousand no one had ever seen a juvenile triceratops
there 's a triceratops in every museum in the world
but no one had ever collected a juvenile
they 're all over the place
so we have a whole bunch of them at our museum
and then as they grow older the horns grow forward
and that 's pretty cool if you look along the edge of the frill they have these little triangular bones that actually grow big as triangles and then they flatten against the frill pretty much like the
and then because the juveniles are in my collection i cut them open
the adult triceratops was also spongy and this is a skull that is two meters long
but there 's another dinosaur that is found in this formation that looks like a triceratops except it 's bigger and it 's called torosaurus
so one of my graduate students john scannella
the hole starting to form in triceratops and
of course it 's open in torosaurus so he found the transitional ones between triceratops and torosaurus which was pretty cool so now we know that torosaurus
is actually a grownup triceratops
now when we name dinosaurs when we name anything the original name gets to stick and the second name is thrown out so
thrown out so torosaurus is extinct
triceratops if you 've heard the news a lot of the newscasters got it all wrong they thought torosaurus should be kept and triceratops thrown out
we look at the bone histology the bone histology tells us that edmontosaurus is a juvenile or at least a sub adult and the other one is
so we can just keep doing this and the last one is
it must be true they must be different
and sure enough nanotyrannus has juvenile bone and
the bigger one has more mature bone
it looks like it could still get bigger and at the museum of the rockies where we work i have four t rexes so i can cut a whole bunch of them but i didn 't have to cut any of them really because i just lined up their jaws
and it turned out the biggest one had twelve teeth and the next smallest one had thirteen and the next smallest had fourteen
and of course nano has seventeen and we just went out and looked at other people 's collections and we found one that
has sort of fifteen teeth so again
real easy to say that
when it comes down to our
end cretaceous we have seven left
and they 're not happy with
