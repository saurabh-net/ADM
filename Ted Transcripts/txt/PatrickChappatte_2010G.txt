it's lighter than an ipad it's a bit cheaper
you know what they say they print media is dying
who says that well the media but
right you've read about it already
ladies and gentlemen the world has gotten smaller
any computer designers in the room
yeah well you guys are making my life miserable because
track pads used to be round a nice round shape that makes a good cartoon but what are you going to do with a flat track pad those square things
has reached every corner of the world the poorest the remotest places
every village in africa now has a
don't go asking for a frappuccino there
so we are bridging the digital divide the third world is connected we are connected well
us it has empowered you it has empowered me and it has empowered some other guys as well
these last two cartoons i did them live during a conference in
they were not used to that in communist two point zero vietnam so
on the third day i finally understood the guy was actually on duty
so by now there must be a hundred pictures of me smiling with my sketches in the
the internet has changed the world it has
the music industry it has changed the way we consume music for those of you old enough to remember we used to have to go to the store
is free wifi but yeah it has it has liberated us from the office desk
this is your life enjoy in short technology the
in short technology the our
our not like it
even changed our relationship to god
now i shouldn 't get into this religion and political cartoons as you may have heard make a difficult couple ever since that day
two thousand and five when a bunch of cartoonists in denmark drew cartoons that had repercussions all over the world demonstrations fatwa they provoked violence people died in the violence
this was so sickening people died because of cartoons
and then of course they were used by extremists and politicians on the other side they wanted to stir up controversy you know the story
we know that cartoons can be used as weapons
and here we are now
in the united nations half of the world is pushing to penalize the offense to religion they call it the defamation of religion while the other half of the world is fighting back in defense of freedom of speech
the clash of civilizations is here and cartoons are this got me thinking
now talk of a divided place the country was cut in two you had a rebellion in the north the government in the south the capital abidjan and in the middle the french
this looks like a giant hamburger you don't want to be in the
i was there to report on that story
in cartoons i've been doing this for the last fifteen years it's my side job if you want so you see the style is different this is more serious than maybe
i went to places like gaza during the war in two thousand and nine so this is really journalism in cartoons you'll hear more and more about it this is the future of journalism i think
and of course i went to see the rebels in the north those were poor guys fighting for their rights there was an
i went to see the dozo the dozo they are the traditional hunters of west africa people fear them they help the rebellion
they are believed to have magical powers they can disappear
i went to see a dozo chief
he told me about his magical powers he said i can chop your head off right away and bring you back to life i said well maybe we don't have time for this right now
right now another time
back in abidjan i was given a chance
to lead a workshop with local cartoonists there
and i thought yes in a context like this cartoons can really be used as weapons against the other side
the press in ivory coast was bitterly divided it was compared to the media in rwanda before the genocide
so imagine and what can a cartoonist do sometimes editors would tell their cartoonists to draw what they wanted to see and the guy has to feed his family right
pretty simple we brought together cartoonists from all sides
in ivory coast we took them away from their newspaper for three days and i asked them to do a project together tackling the issues
in cartoons yes in cartoons show the positive power of cartoons it's a great tool of communication for bad or for good
and cartoons can cross boundaries as you have seen
is a good way i think to address serious issues
i'm very proud of what they did i mean they didn't agree with each other that was not the point and i didn't ask them to do nice cartoons the first day they were even shouting at each other but they came up with a book looking back
of political crisis in ivory coast
so the idea was there and i've been doing projects like this in two thousand and nine in lebanon
this year in kenya back in january in lebanon it was not a book the idea was to have the same principal a divided country take cartoonists from all sides and let them do something together
so in lebanon we enrolled the newspaper editors and we got them to publish eight cartoonists from all sides all together
on the same page addressing the issue affecting lebanon like religion in politics and everyday life and it worked
for three days almost all the newspapers of beirut published all those cartoonists together anti government pro government christian
muslim of course english speaking
so this was a great project
in kenya what we did
as you have seen in contexts of repression or division again what can a cartoonist do
he has to keep his job
well i believe that in any context anywhere
at least not to do a cartoon that will feed hatred
and that's the message i try to convey to them
all always have the choice in the end not to do the
but we need to support these critical
responsible voices in africa in lebanon in your local newspaper
for dictators all over the world the good news
the good news and activists shut up
