'm here to share my photography or
is it photography because of course
this is a photograph that you can 't take with your camera
yet my interest in photography started as i got my first digital camera at the age of fifteen it mixed with my earlier passion for drawing but it was a bit different
so to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time i felt like anyone could do that so i wanted to create something different something where the process starts when you press the trigger photos like this
both dark and colorful but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism when i say realism i mean photo realism because of course
it 's not something you can capture really but
i always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph
is it something about the light what creates the illusion
what creates the illusion sometimes
what we think looks realistic really so i think the basics are quite simple
here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects
something we all can relate to living in a three dimensional world but combined in a certain way
they can create something that still looks three dimensional like it could exist
but at the same time we know it can 't
so we trick our brains because our brain simply doesn 't accept the fact that it doesn 't really make sense
i think it 's the things that we don 't even think about the things
all around us in our daily lives
but when combining photographs this is really important to consider
because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow so i would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result
as you can see these images aren 't really special but
combined they can create something like this
so the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective secondly photos combined should have the same type of light
and these two images both fulfill these two requirements shot at the same height and in the same type of light
the third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless
make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed so
by matching color contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images
adding photographic defects like depth of field desaturated colors and noise we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image
despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically so
i personally think that it 's easier to actually create a place than to find a place because then you don 't need to compromise with the ideas in your head but it does require a lot of planning
and getting this idea during winter i knew that i had several months to plan it to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically so for example the fish was captured on a fishing trip
it always starts with a sketch
an idea then it 's about combining the different photographs and here
every piece is very well planned and if you do a good job capturing the photos the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic
