years ago my eyes were opened to the dark side of the construction industry in two thousand and six young qatari students took me to go and see the migrant worker camps and since then i've followed the
one point one million of them
mainly indian pakistani sri lankan and nepalese these laborers risk everything to make money for their families back home
they pay a middle man thousands of dollars to be there and when they arrive they find themselves in labor camps with no water no air conditioning and their passports taken away
while it's easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities ninety nine percent of these people are hired by the private sector
and so therefore we are equally if not more accountable
in august two thousand and eight uae public officials noted that forty percent of the country 's one thousand and ninety eight labor camps had violated minimum health and fire safety regulations and last summer
more than ten thousand workers protested for the non payment of wages for the poor quality of food and inadequate housing and then the financial collapse happened
when the contractors had gone bust as they'd been over leveraged like everyone else the difference is everything goes missing documentation
passports and tickets home for these workers currently right now thousands of workers are abandoned there is no way back home and there is no way and no proof of arrival
these are the boom and bust refugees the question is as a building professional as an architect
if you know this is going on as we go to the sights every single week are you complacent or complicit in the human rights violations
so let 's forget your environmental footprint let 's think about your ethical footprint what good is it to build a zero carbon energy efficient complex
when the labor producing this architectural gem is unethical at best now recently i've been told i've been taking the high road but quite frankly on this issue there is no other road
so let 's not forget who is really paying the price of this financial collapse and that as we worry about our next job in the office the next design that we can get to keep our workers
let 's not forget these men who are truly dying to work thank you
