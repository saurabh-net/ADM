march the fifteenth two thousand the b fifteen iceberg broke off the ross ice shelf in the newspaper it said
it was all part of a normal process a little bit further on in the article
it said a loss that would normally take the ice shelf
if we walk into the b fifteen iceberg when we leave here today we 're going to bump into something a thousand feet tall seventy six miles long
seventy six miles long seventeen miles wide
through the lens of normal
is one of the forces that stops us developing real solutions
only ninety days after this arguably the greatest discovery of the last century occurred
it was the sequencing for the first time of the human genome this is the code
that 's in every single one of our fifty trillion cells that makes us who we are
and what we are and if we just take one cell 's worth of this code and unwind it
it 's a meter long
two nanometers thick two nanometers is twenty atoms in thickness and i wondered
what if the answer to some of our biggest problems could be found in the smallest of places where the difference between what is valuable and what is worthless is merely the addition or subtraction of a few atoms
over the essence of energy the electron
so i started to go around the world finding the best and brightest scientists i could at universities whose collective discoveries have the chance to take us there
and we formed a company
to build on their extraordinary ideas six and a half years later a hundred and eighty researchers they have some amazing developments in the lab
such that we can stop
burning up our planet and instead we can generate
all the energy we need right where we are cleanly safely and cheaply
think of the space that we spend most of our time
in winter exactly the opposite is happening we 're trying to heat up the space that we 're in and all that is trying to get out through the window
one of the materials that can do this is a remarkable material
carbon that has changed its form in this incredibly beautiful reaction where graphite is blasted by a vapor
and when the vaporized carbon condenses it condenses back into a different form chickenwire rolled up
but this chickenwire carbon called a carbon nanotube is a hundred thousand times smaller than the width of one of your hairs it 's a thousand times more conductive than copper
one of the things about working at the nanoscale
is things look and act very differently you think of carbon as black carbon at the nanoscale
carbon at the nanoscale is actually transparent
and when it 's in this form if i combine it with a polymer
and affix it to your window
when it 's in its
colored state it will reflect away all heat and light and when it 's in its bleached state it will let all the light and heat through and any combination in between
to change its state by the way takes two volts from a millisecond pulse
until you change its state again as we were working on this incredible discovery at university of florida to visit another scientist
and he was working on a pretty incredible thing
imagine if we didn 't have to rely on artificial lighting to get around at night
it 's a nanomaterial two nanomaterials
the total width of it is six hundred times smaller
than the width of a decimal place
and it takes all the infrared available at night
converts it into an electron an image
which you can see through transparency is key
it 's a film that you can look through
and then i 'm going to turn the lights out
and you can see off a tiny film incredible clarity
as we were working on this it dawned on us
it dawned on us if we combined it
you 've converted energy into an electron
on a plastic surface that you can stick on your window
but because it 's flexible
it can be on any surface whatsoever
we talked about generating and using
we want to talk about storing energy and unfortunately
the best thing we 've got going is something that was developed in france a hundred and fifty years ago the lead acid battery in terms of dollars per what 's stored it 's simply the best knowing that we 're not going to put fifty of these in our basements to store our power we went to a group at university of texas at dallas and we gave them this diagram
it was in actually a diner outside of dallas fort worth airport we said could you build this
and these scientists instead of laughing at us said
hold it until you need it
and then be able to release it and pass it off
being able to do that means
that i can generate energy cleanly efficiently and cheaply right where i am it 's my energy
and if i don 't need it i can convert it back up on the window to energy light
to your place and for that i do not need an electric grid between us
the grid of tomorrow is no grid and energy clean efficient energy
will one day be free
if you do this you get the last puzzle piece which is water
these also require tremendous amounts of energy in fact it 's going to require twice the world 's supply of oil to run the pumps to generate the water
we 're simply not going to do that
but in a world where energy is freed
i 'm glad to be working with incredibly brilliant and kind scientists no kinder than many of the people in the world
but they have a magic look at the world
and i 'm glad to see their discoveries coming out of the lab and into the world
it 's been a long time in coming for me eighteen years ago i saw a photograph
i 've carried this photograph with me every day since then
it 's a picture of a little girl dying of thirst
and whenever i go round to somebody who says you know what you 're working on something that 's too difficult it 'll never happen
you don 't have enough money you don 't have enough time there 's something much more interesting around the corner
this is why we have to solve our problems
and i know the answer as to how
is to be able to get exquisite control
over a building block of nature we solve these problems
