the start of the story where this means guy and that is a ponytail on a passer by
here 's where it happens
this is a cassette tape the girl puts into her cassette tape player she wears it every day it's not considered vintage she just likes certain music to sound a certain way look at her posture it's remarkable that's because she
dances now he the guy takes all of this in figuring honestly geez what are my chances
he could say oh my god or i heart you i'm laughing out loud i want to give you a hug but he comes up with that you know he tells
i 'd like to hand paint your portrait on a coffee mug put a crab inside
on dry land but just panhandle at the ocean he says you look like a mermaid
you walk like a waltz and the girl goes
so the guy replies yeah i know i know i think my heartbeat might be the morse code for inappropriate at least that's how it seems
a junior varsity cheerleader sometimes for swearing awkward silences and very simple rhyme schemes right now
i'm not even really a guy
but i'm still suggesting you and i first soon and then
the southwest corner of fifth and forty two nd at noon tomorrow but i'll stay until you show up ponytail or not hell
i don't know what else to tell you
i got a pencil you can borrow
you can put it in your phone
