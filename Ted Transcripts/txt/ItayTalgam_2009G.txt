i go on the podium you know this little office of the conductor or rather a cubicle an open space cubicle with a lot of space and in front of all that noise you do a very small gesture something like this not very pomp not
very sophisticated this and suddenly out of the chaos order noise becomes music
all those great people here virtuosos they make noise they need me to do that not really if it were that i would just save you the talk and
gesture so you could go out to the world and do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want and you have perfect harmony it doesn't work let 's look at the first
think it's a good example of harmony and then speak a little bit about how it comes about
was that nice so that was a sort of
for the success i mean obviously the orchestra musicians playing beautifully
they don't often even look at the conductor then you have the clapping audience
yeah actually taking part in doing the music you know viennese audiences usually don't interfere with the music
this is the closest to an oriental bellydancing feast that
all the time you know arthur rubinstein the pianist used to say that anywhere in the world people that have the flu they go to the doctor in tel aviv they come to my
regular just to be part of that to become part of the orchestra and that's great you know audiences like you yeah make the event but what about the conductor what can you say the conductor was doing actually
he was happy and i often show this to senior management people get
you come to work how come you're so happy something must be wrong there yeah but he 's spreading happiness and i think the happiness the important thing is this happiness does not come from only his own story and his joy of the music
the joy is about enabling other people 's stories to be heard at the same time you have the story of the orchestra as a professional body you have the story of the audience as a community
yeah you have the stories of the individuals in the orchestra and in the audience and then you have other stories unseen people who build this wonderful concert hall people who made those
very short but you could see it's a completely different figure right he 's awesome he 's so
so clear maybe a little bit over clear can we have a little demonstration would you be my orchestra for a second
and i'll stop you okay ready
more redundant than i already feel so please wait for the conductor now look at me is a vacancy for
so not only the instruction is clear but also the
to a certain point when muti is asked why do you conduct like this he says i 'm responsible responsible in front of him no he doesn't really mean him he means mozart which is from the
for mozart this is going to be the only story to be told it's mozart as i riccardo muti understand it and you know what happened to
three years ago he got a letter signed by all seven hundred employees of la scala musical employees i mean the musicians saying you 're a great conductor we don't want to work with you please resign
why because you don't let us develop you're using us as instruments not as partners and our joy of music etc etc so he had to resign isn't that nice
can you do it with less control or with a different kind of control let 's the
the whole idea is really to let it happen by itself do not interfere but how does it happen
you see him turning pages in the score now either he is senile and doesn't remember his own
music because he wrote the music or he is actually transferring a very strong
message to them saying come on guys you have to play by
so it's not about my story it's not about your story it's only the execution of the written music no interpretation interpretation is the real story of the
so no he doesn't want that that's a different kind of control let 's see another super conductor
what's different did you see the eyes closed did you see the hands did you see this kind of do
concentrate close my eyes come why
no cynicism this is a german orchestra then they look at
what this guy wants and
that they really look at each other and the first players of the orchestra lead the whole ensemble in playing together and when karajan is asked about it he actually says yes the worst damage i can do
is to give them a clear instruction because that would prevent the
the listening to each other that is needed for an orchestra now that's great what about the eyes why are the eyes closed
is a wonderful story about karajan conducting in london and he cues in a flute player like this the guy has no idea what to do
you know you have no authority to change anything it's my music
the real music is only in karajan 's head and you have to guess my mind so you are under tremendous pressure because i don't give you instruction and yet you have to guess my mind so it's a different kind of a very spiritual but yet very firm control
can we do it in another way of course we can let 's go back to the first conductor we've seen
but isn't that controlling in the same way no it's not because he is not telling them what to do when he does this it's not take your stradivarius and like jimi hendrix
smash it on the floor it's not that he says this is the gesture of the music i'm opening a space for you to put in another layer of interpretation that is another story
but how does it really work together if it doesn't give them instructions it's like being on a rollercoaster yeah you're not really given any instructions but the forces of the process itself keep you in place that's what he does
the interesting thing is of course the rollercoaster does not really exist it's not a physical thing it's in the players heads and that's what make them into partners you have the plan in your head you know what to do
though kleiber is not conducting you but here and there and that you know what to do and you become a partner building the rollercoaster yeah with sound
as you actually take the ride this is very exciting for those players they do need to go to a sanatorium for two weeks later
is very tiring yeah but it's the best music making like this but of course it's not only about motivation and giving them a lot of physical energy you also have to be very professional
and look again at this kleiber can we have the next video quickly you'll see what happens when after the concert
when it's needed the authority is there it's very important but authority is not enough to make people there
a kind of a compliment we all like to get it's not feedback the second thing is
not only creates a process but also creates the conditions in the world in which this process takes place
so again the oboe player is completely autonomous and therefore happy and proud of his work and creative and all of that and
the level in which kleiber is in control is in a different level so control is no longer a zero sum game you have this control you have this control and all you put together in partnership brings about the best music
so kleiber is about process kleiber is about conditions in the world but you need to have process and content to create the meaning
lenny bernstein my own personal maestro since he was a great teacher lenny bernstein always started from the meaning look at this
the face of muti at the beginning well he had a wonderful expression but only one did you see lenny 's face you know why
because the meaning of the music is pain and you're playing a painful sound and you look at lenny and he 's suffering but not in a way that you want to stop it's suffering like enjoying himself in a jewish way
more baton now it's about you the player telling the story now it's a reversed thing you're telling the story and you're telling the story and even briefly
you become the storyteller to which the community the whole community listens to and bernstein enables that
now if you are doing all the things we talked about together and maybe some others you can get to this wonderful point of doing without doing
and for the last video i think this is simply the best title my friend peter says if you love something give it away so please
