well hopefully not as awkward as that picture
image is powerful but also image is superficial
i just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds and in this picture i had actually never had a boyfriend in real life i was totally uncomfortable and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand
or the fake tan that i got two days ago for work there 's very little that we can do to transform how we look and how we look though it is superficial and immutable has a huge impact on our lives
so today for me being fearless means being honest and i am on this stage because i am a model i am on this stage because i am a pretty white woman and in my industry we call that a sexy girl
and i 'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me but with an honest twist
so the first question is how do you become a model and i always just say oh i was scouted but that means nothing the real way that i became a model is i won a genetic lottery and i am the recipient of a legacy and maybe you 're wondering what is a legacy well
for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as
but also as tall slender figures and femininity and white skin and this is a legacy that was built for me and it 's a legacy that i 've been cashing out on
and i know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point and maybe there are some fashionistas who are like wait naomi tyra joan smalls liu wen and first i commend you on your model knowledge very impressive
saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the powerball when you grow up
it 's out of your control and it 's awesome and it 's not a career path
i will demonstrate for you now ten years of accumulated model knowledge because unlike cardio thoracic surgeons it can just be distilled right into right now so
if the photographer is right there and the light is right there like a nice hmi and the client says cameron we want a walking shot well then this leg goes first nice and long this arm goes back this arm goes forward the head is at three quarters and you just go back and forth just do that and then you look
the next question people always ask me is do they retouch all the photos and yeah they pretty much retouch all the photos but that is only a small component of what 's happening
this picture is the very first picture that i ever took and it 's also the very first time that i had worn a bikini and i didn 't even have my period yet i know we 're getting personal but i was a young girl this is what i looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier
here 's me on the same day as this shoot my friend got to come with me here 's me at a slumber party a few days before i shot french vogue
here 's me on the soccer team and in v magazine
and here 's me today and i hope what you 're seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me they are constructions and they are constructions by a group of professionals by hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists and all of their assistants and pre production and post production and they build this that 's not me
is the free stuff that i get in real life and that 's what we don 't like to talk about i grew up in cambridge and one time i went into a store and i forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free
when i was a teenager i was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course we got pulled over and all it took was a sorry officer and we were on our way
and i got these free things because of how i look not who i am and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are i live in new york and last year of the one hundred and forty thousand teenagers that were stopped and frisked eighty six percent of them were black and latino and most of them were young men
so the last question people ask me is
you will be so happy and fabulous and when we 're backstage we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that we say it 's really amazing to travel and it 's amazing to get to work with creative inspired passionate people and those things are true but they 're only one half of the story because the thing
that we never say on camera that i have never said on camera is i am insecure
and i 'm insecure because i have to think about what i look like every day
and if you ever are wondering if i have thinner thighs and shinier hair will i be happier you just need to meet a group of models because they have the thinnest thighs and the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes and they 're the most physically insecure women probably on the planet
but mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when i am one of the biggest beneficiaries
but i 'm also happy and honored to be up here and i think that it 's great that i got to come before ten or twenty or thirty years had passed and i 'd had more agency in my career because maybe then i wouldn 't tell the story of how i got my first job or maybe i wouldn 't tell the story of how i paid for college which seems so important right now
