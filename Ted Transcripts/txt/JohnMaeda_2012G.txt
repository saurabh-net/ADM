say that i 'm very glad to be here i understand we have over eighty countries here so that 's a whole new paradigm for me to speak to all of these countries in each country i 'm sure you have this thing called the parent teacher conference do you know about the parent teacher conference
that always stuck with me all my life why didn 't dad say art why wasn 't it okay why it became a question my entire life and that 's all right because being good at math meant he bought me a computer and some of you remember this computer this was my first computer who had an apple ii apple ii users very cool
that computer is a computer that i learned about going to mit my father 's dream and at mit however i learned about the computer at all levels and after i went to art school to get away from computers
and i was influenced by performance art so this is twenty years ago i made a computer out of people it was called the human powered computer experiment
i have a power manager mouse driver memory etc and i built this in kyoto the old capital of japan it 's a room broken in two halves i 've turned the computer on and these assistants are placing a giant floppy disk built out of cardboard and it 's put into the computer
and the floppy disk drive person wears it laughter she finds the first sector on the disk and takes data off the disk and passes it off to of course the bus
wonder about computers and technology in general
and so i 'm going to talk today about four things really the first three things are about how i 've been curious about technology design and art and how they intersect how they overlap and also a topic that i 've taken on since four years ago i became the president of rhode island school of design
leadership and i 'll talk about how i 've looked to combine these four areas into a kind of a synthesis a kind of experiment so starting from technology technology is a wonderful thing when that apple ii came out it really could do nothing it could show text and
after we waited a bit we had these things called images remember when images were first possible with a computer those gorgeous full color images and then after a few years we got cd quality sound it was incredible you could listen to sound on the computer and then
movies via cd rom it was amazing remember that excitement
and then the browser appeared the browser was great but the browser was very primitive very narrow bandwidth text first then images we waited cd quality sound over the net then movies over the internet kind of incredible
as we understand most things and to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine
and i have a small experiment to give you a quick design lesson
designers talk about the relationship between form and content content and form now what does that mean well content is the word up there fear it 's a four letter word it 's a kind of a bad feeling word fear
fear is set in light helvetica so it 's not too stressful and if you set it in ultra light helvetica it 's like oh fear who cares
you take the same ultra light helvetica and make it big and like whoa
free is a great word you can serve it almost any way free bold feels like mandela free it 's like yes i can be free free even light feels kind of like ah i can breathe in free it feels great or even free spread out it 's like ah i can breathe in free so easily
and i can add in a blue gradient and a dove and i have like don draper free laughter so
you see that form content design it works that way
and i 've been curious about how design and technology intersect and i 'm going to show you some old work i never really show anymore to give you a sense of what i used to do so yeah so i made a lot of work in the ninety s this was a square that responds to sound people ask me why i made that
it 's not clear laughter but i thought it 'd be neat for the square
respond to me and my kids were small then and my kids would play with
ten variations this is like spin the
you know it 's like art is supposed to be enigmatic so when you say like i don 't get it like oh that 's great laughter art does that because art is about asking questions questions that may not be answerable
because at risd you have to look at the actual
animal the object to understand its volume to perceive it at risd you 're not allowed to draw from an image and many people ask me john couldn 't you just digitize all this make it all digital wouldn 't it be better and i often say well there 's something good to how things used to be done
there 's something very different about it something we should figure out what is good about how we did it even in this new era and i have a good friend he 's a new media artist named tota hasegawa he 's based in london no actually it 's in tokyo but when he was based in london he had a game with his wife
he would go to antique shops and the game was as such when we look at an antique we want we 'll ask the shopkeeper for the story behind the antique and if it 's a good story we 'll buy it so they 'd go to an antique shop and they 'd look at this cup and they 'd say tell us about this cup and the shopkeeper would say it 's old
he realized it isn 't about old or new it 's about something in between it isn 't about old the dirt new the cloud it 's about what is good a combination of the cloud
and the dirt is where the action is at
you see it in all interesting art today in all interesting businesses today how we combine those two together to make good is very interesting so art makes questions and leadership is something
that is asking a lot of questions we aren 't functioning so easily anymore we aren 't a simple authoritarian regime anymore as an example of authoritarianism i was in russia one time traveling in st petersburg at a national monument and i saw this sign that says do not walk on the grass and i thought
run many systems today but as we know it 's been disrupted it is now a network instead of a perfect tree it 's a heterarchy instead of a hierarchy and that 's kind of awkward
and so today leaders are faced with how to lead differently i believe this is work i did with my colleague becky bermont on creative leadership what can we learn from artists and designers for how to lead
because in many senses a regular leader loves to avoid mistakes
someone who 's creative actually loves to learn from mistakes
and i had a show in london recently where my friends invited me to come to london for four days to sit in a sandbox and i said great and so i sat in a sandbox for four days straight six hours every day six minute appointments with anyone in london
and that was really bad but i would listen to people hear their issues draw in the sand try to figure things out
leaders what we do is we connect improbable connections and hope something will happen and in that room i found so many connections between people across all of london and so
leadership connecting people is the great question today whether you 're in the hierarchy or the heterarchy it 's a wonderful design challenge
and one thing i 've been doing is doing some research on systems that can combine technology and leadership with an art and design perspective let me show you something i haven 't shown anywhere actually
red are areas doing poorly you know how do you as the leader scan connect make things happen
so for instance you might open up a distribution here and find the different subdivisions in there and know that you know someone in eco over here and
these people here are in eco the people you might engage with as ceo people going across the hierarchy
and part of the challenge of the ceo is to find connections across areas and so you might look in r d and here you see one person who crosses the two areas of interest and it 's a person important to engage so you might want to
for instance get a heads up display on how you 're interacting with them how many coffees do you have how often are you calling them emailing them what is the tenor of their email how is it working out
leaders might be able to use these systems to better regulate how they work inside the heterarchy
you can also imagine using technology like from luminoso the guys from cambridge who were looking at deep text analysis
what is the tenor of your communications so these kind of systems i believe are important they 're targeted social media systems around leaders
and i believe that this kind of perspective will only begin to grow as more leaders enter the space of art and design because art and design lets you think like this
find different systems like this and i 've just begun thinking like this so i 'm glad to share that with you so in closing
i want to thank all of you for your attention thanks very much
