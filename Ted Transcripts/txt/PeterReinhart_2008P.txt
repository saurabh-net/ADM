this is a wheat bread a whole wheat bread and it's made with a new technique that i've been playing around with and developing and writing about which for lack of a better name we call the epoxy method and i call it an epoxy method because it's not very appetizing i understand that but
but if you think about epoxy what's epoxy it's two resins that are sort of in and of themselves neither of which can make glue but when you put the two together something happens a bond takes place and you get this very strong powerful
adhesive well in this technique
what i've tried to do is kind of gather all of the knowledge that the bread baking world the artisan bread baking community has been trying to accumulate over the last twenty years or so since we've been engaged in a bread renaissance in america and put it together to come up with
a method that would help to take whole grain breads and let 's face it everyone 's trying to move towards whole grains we finally after forty years of knowing that wholegrain was a
you know how do you make it taste good because whole grain it's easy with white flour to make a good tasting bread white flour is sweet it's mainly starch and starch when you break it down what is starch
thank you sugar yes so a baker and a good baker knows how to pull or draw forth the inherent sugar trapped in the starch with whole grain bread you have other obstacles you've got bran which is
and love for the flavor and ultimately the challenge of the baker the challenge of every culinary student of every chef is to deliver flavor
flavor is king flavor rules i call it the flavor rule flavor rules and and you can get somebody to eat something that's good for them once
but they won 't eat it again if they don't like it right so this is the challenge for this bread we're going to try this at lunch and i'll explain a bit more about it but it's made
not only with two types of pre doughs this attempt again at bringing out flavor is to make a piece of dough the day before
that is not leavened it's just dough that is wet it's hydrated dough we call the soaker that helps to start enzyme activity and enzymes are the secret kind of ingredient in dough
that brings out flavor it starts to release the sugars trapped in the starch that's what enzymes are doing and so if we can release some of those they become accessible to us
in our palate they become accessible to the yeast as food they become accessible to the oven for caramelization to give us a beautiful crust the other
pre dough that we make is fermented our pre ferment and it's made it can be a sourdough starter or what we call a biga or any other kind of
with a little yeast in it and that starts to develop flavor also and on day two we put those two pieces together that's the epoxy
and we're hoping that sort of the enzyme piece of dough becomes the fuel pack for the leavened piece of dough and when we put them together and add the final ingredients we can create a bread that does evoke the full potential of flavor trapped in the
that's the challenge okay so now what we in the journey of wheat let 's go back and look at these twelve stages i'm going to go through them very quickly and then revisit them okay we're going to start with the first stage
which is just a french way of saying get organized everything in its place first stage so in baking we call it scaling weighing out the ingredients stage two is mixing
we take the ingredients and we mix them we have to develop the gluten there's no gluten in flour there's only the potential for gluten here 's another kind of prefiguring of epoxy because we've got glutenin and
neither of which are strong enough to make a good bread but when they get hydrated and they bond to each other they create a stronger molecule a stronger protein we call gluten
and so we in the mixing process have to develop the gluten we have to activate the leaven or the yeast and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly
and there's a short rest period it can be for a few seconds it can be for twenty or thirty minutes we call that resting or benching then we go into final shaping
and then stage nine the fermentation which started at stage three is continuing through all these other stages again developing more flavor the final fermentation takes place in stage nine we call
the sugars in the dough caramelize in the crust they give us that beautiful brown crust only the crust can caramelize it's the only place that gets hot enough inside the proteins this gluten
and gelatinization is yet another oven transformation coagulation caramelization and gelatinization when the starch is thick and they absorb all the moisture that's around them
they they kind of swell and then they burst and they burst and they spill their guts into the bread so basically now we're eating yeast sweats sweat burps and starch guts
again transformed in stage ten in the oven because what went into the oven as dough comes out in stage eleven
as bread and stage eleven we call it cooling because we never really eat the bread right away there's a little carry over baking the proteins have to set up strengthen and firm up
and then we have stage twelve which the textbooks call packaging but my students call eating
and so we're going to be on our own journey today from wheat to eat and in a few minutes we will try this and see if we have succeeded in
it's hard to get to those levels unless you go through the literal in fact dante says you can't understand the three deeper levels unless you first understand
the literal level so that's why we're talking literally about bread but let 's kind of look at these stages again from the standpoint of connections to possibly a deeper level all in my quest for answering the question what is it about bread that's so special
and fulfilling this mission of evoking the full potential of flavor because what happens is bread begins as wheat
or any other grain but what's wheat wheat is a grass that grows in the field and like all grasses at a certain point it puts out seeds
and we harvest those seeds and those are the wheat kernels now in order to harvest it i mean what's harvesting it's just a euphemism for
killing right i mean that's what's harvest we say we harvest the pig you know yes we slaughter you know yes that's life we harvest the wheat
in harvesting it we kill it now wheat is alive and as we harvest it it gives up its seeds
now at least with seeds we have the potential for future life we can plant those in the ground and we save some of those for the next generation but most of those seeds get crushed
and turned into flour and at that point the wheat has suffered the ultimate indignity it's not only been killed but it's been denied any potential for creating future life
so as i said i think bread is a transformational food the first transformation and by the way the definition of transformation for me is a radical change from one thing into something else
radical not subtle not like hot water made cold or cold water turned hot but water boiled off and becoming steam that's a transformation two different things well in this case the first transformation is call that radical
so we've got now this
clay it's like clay and we infuse that clay with an ingredient that we call leaven
in this case it's yeast but yeast is leaven what does leaven
leaven comes from the root word that means enliven
to vivify to bring to life
you see the baker in this moment
has become in a sense sort of the god of his dough you know and his dough well while it's not an intelligent life form is now alive and we know it's alive because in stage three
it grows growth is the proof of life and while it's growing all these literal transformations are taking place enzymes are breaking forth sugars
yeast is eating sugar and turning it into carbon dioxide and alcohol bacteria is in there eating the same sugars turning them into acids in other words personality and character 's being developed in this dough under the watchful gaze of the baker
and the baker 's choices all along the way
determine the outcome of the product
a subtle change in temperature a subtle change in time it's all about a balancing act between time temperature and ingredients that's the art of baking so all these things are determined by the baker and the bread goes through some stages and characters develop and then we divide it
and this one big piece of dough is divided into smaller units and each of those units are given shape by the baker and as they're shaped they're raised again all along proving that they're alive and developing character
and at stage ten we take it to the oven it's still dough nobody eats bread dough a few people do i think but not too many i've met some dough eaters but
it's not the staff of life right bread is the staff of life but dough is what we're working with and we take that dough to the oven
and it goes into the oven as soon as the interior temperature of that dough crosses the threshold of one hundred and forty degrees it passes what we call the thermal death point students love that tdp they think it's the name of a video game
but it's the thermal death point all life ceases there the yeast whose mission it has been up till now to raise the dough to enliven it to vivify it in order to complete its mission which is also to turn this dough into bread
what goes in is dough what comes out is bread or it goes in alive comes out dead
third transformation first transformation alive to dead second transformation dead brought back to life third transformation alive to dead but dough to bread
or another analogy would be a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly
and it's what comes out of the oven that is
what we call the staff of life this is the product that
you know we have a chance to essentially ingest that it nurtures us and we continue to carry on and have opportunities to ponder things like this
so this is what i've learned from bread this is what bread has taught me in my journey and what we're going to attempt to do with this bread here again is
to use in addition to everything we talked about this bread we're going to call spent grain bread because as you know bread making is very similar to beer making beer is basically liquid bread or bread is solid beer
it turned into bread but we've got this bread and what i did here is to try to again evoke even more flavor from this
was we've added into it the spent grain from beer making and if you make this bread you can use any kind of spent grain from any type of beer i like dark spent grain today we're using a light spent grain that's actually from like
some kind of a lager of some sort a light lager or an ale that is wheat and barley that's been toasted in other words the beer maker knows also how to evoke flavor from the grains
by using sprouting and malting and roasting we're going to take some of that and put it into the bread so now we not only have a high fiber bread but now fiber on top of fiber
and so this is again hopefully not only a healthy bread
i kind of break this bread maybe we can share this now a little bit here we'll start a little piece here and i'm going to take a little piece here i think i'd better taste it myself before you have it at lunch i'll leave you
with what i call the baker 's blessing may your
and your bread always rise thank you
