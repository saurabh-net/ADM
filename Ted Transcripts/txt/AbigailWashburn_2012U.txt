and asked me what i was going to do with my life i would have told you
ever thought it would have anything to do with the banjo
beautiful the sound of doc 's voice and the rippling groove of the banjo and after being
totally and completely obsessed with the mammoth richness and history of chinese culture it was like this total relief to hear something so truly american
truly awesome i knew i had to take a banjo with me to china
and i can tell you that i didn 't go to china to become a lawyer in fact i went to nashville
and after a few months i was writing songs and the first song i wrote was in english and the second one was in chinese
and i 've played thousands of shows and i 've collaborated with so many incredible inspirational musicians around the world and i see the power of music i see the power of music to connect
cultures i see it when i stand on a stage in a bluegrass festival in east virginia and i look out at the sea of lawn chairs and i bust out into a song in chinese
and everybody 's eyes just pop wide open like it 's going to
and i bust out into a song in chinese and everybody sings along and they roar with delight at this girl with the hair and the instrument and she 's singing their music
and i see even more importantly the power of music to connect hearts like the time i was in sichuan province and i was singing for kids in relocation schools in the earthquake disaster zone and this little girl comes up to me
big sister wong washburn wong same difference
big sister wong can i sing you a song that my mom sang for me before she was swallowed in the earthquake
and i sat down she sat on my lap she started singing
and the warmth of her body
was a place i could have stayed forever and in that moment we weren 't our american selves we weren 't our chinese selves we were just mortals
sitting together in that light that keeps us here
