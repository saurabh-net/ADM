superconductivity is a quantum state of matter
we are now able to demonstrate to you quantum levitation and quantum locking so
a superconductor is defined by two properties the first is zero electrical resistance and the second is the expulsion of a magnetic field
from the interior of the superconductor
that sounds complicated right but what is electrical resistance so
and they dissipate this energy in the form of heat and you know that effect however inside a superconductor
there are no collisions so there is no energy dissipation it 's quite remarkable
think about it in classical physics there is always some friction some energy loss but not here because it is a quantum effect but that 's not all because
perfect as we all know and sometimes strands of magnetic field remain inside the superconductor now
under proper conditions which we have here these strands of magnetic field can be trapped inside the superconductor
inside the superconductor inside the superconductor
these are not particles but they behave like particles
when we put it inside
dissipate energy which breaks the superconductivity state
so what it actually does it locks these strands which are called fluxons and it locks these fluxons in place and by doing that what it actually does
is locking itself in place why because any movement
of the superconductor will change their place will change their configuration so we get quantum locking and let me show you
how this works i have here a superconductor which i wrapped up so it 'd stay cold long enough
and when i place it on
and it will be locked in this new configuration
like this or move it slightly to the right or to the left so this is quantum locking
you won 't be surprised to hear that if i take this circular magnet
in which the magnetic field is the same all around
the superconductor will be able to freely rotate around the axis of the magnet why because as long as it rotates
the locking is maintained you see i can adjust
and i can rotate the superconductor we have
frictionless motion it is still levitating but can move freely all around so
we have quantum locking and we can levitate it on top of this magnet
three inch disk but that 's not the amazing part yet because there is something i haven 't told you yet
and yeah the amazing part is that this superconductor that you see here
i can extend this circular magnet and make whatever track i want for example i can make
and when i place the superconducting disk on top of this rail it moves freely
and again that 's not all i can adjust its position like this and rotate and it
freely moves in this new position
while it stays here don 't move i will try to
hopefully if i did it correctly it stays suspended
you see it 's quantum locking not levitation
let me tell you a little bit about superconductors now
so we now know that we are able to transfer enormous amount of currents inside superconductors so we can use them
to produce strong magnetic fields such as needed in mri machines particle accelerators and so on
but we can also store energy using superconductors because we have no dissipation and we could also produce power cables to transfer enormous amounts of
let me answer this simple question by giving you an example imagine you would have
a disk similar to the one i have here in my hand three inch diameter with a single difference the superconducting layer instead of being half a micron thin
being two millimeters thin quite thin this two millimeter thin superconducting layer
in my hand amazing thank you
