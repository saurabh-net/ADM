great way to start i think
with my view of simplicity is to
take a look at ted here you are understanding why we're here what's going on with no difficulty at all
the best ai in the planet would find it complex and confusing and my little dog watson would find it simple and understandable but would miss the point
have a great time and of course if you're a speaker like hans rosling
a speaker finds this complex tricky but in hans rosling 's case he had a secret weapon yesterday literally
in his sword swallowing act and i must say i thought of quite a few objects that i might try to swallow today and finally gave up
he just did it and that was
wonderful thing so puck meant
not only are we fools in the pejorative sense but that we're easily fooled in fact what shakespeare was pointing out is we go to the theater in order to be fooled so we're actually looking forward to it
we go to magic shows in order to be fooled and this makes
many things fun but it makes it difficult
to actually get any kind of picture on the world we live in or on ourselves
the problem you have with
to draw is not that you can't move your hand but that the way your brain perceives images is faulty
trying to perceive images into objects rather than seeing what's there and to prove it she says the exact size and shape of these tabletops
is the same and i'm going to prove it to you
she does this with cardboard but since i have an expensive computer here
rotate this little guy around and
now having seen that and i've seen it hundreds of times because i use this in every talk i give i still can't see that they're the same size and shape and i doubt that you can either
measure very very carefully and if you measure very very carefully with a stiff arm
a straight edge you'll see that those two shapes are exactly
same size and the talmud
saw this a long time ago saying we see things not as they are but as we are i certainly would like to know what happened to the person who had that insight
back then if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion
what we call reality is a kind of hallucination happening inside here it's a waking dream
and understanding that that is what we actually exist in
one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history and what that means simple and understandable might not be actually simple or understandable and things we think are complex might be made simple and understandable
somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our flaws we can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel
the way i think of it is we can't learn to see until we admit we're blind
finding ways to see things and
little additional parts for our brain made out of powerful ideas that help us see the world in different ways and
these are in the form of sensory apparatus
most importantly in the ability to change perspective on things
i'll talk about that a little bit it's this change in perspective and what it is we think we're perceiving
that has helped us make more
not taught in any k through twelve curriculum in america that i'm aware of
one of the things that goes from simple to complex is when we do more
and in fact we can keep on doing it for a very long time
but murray gell mann yesterday talked about emergent properties
another name for them could be architecture as a metaphor
for taking the same old material and
non obvious non simple ways of combining it
what murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature of having the descriptions at various levels be rather
similar all goes down to the idea that the elementary particles are both sticky and stand offish
and they're in violent motion
those three things give rise to all the different levels
so when i saw the roslings
in conveying complex ideas simply but then i had a thought of boy maybe it's too simple
and i put some effort in to try and check to see how well these simple portrayals of trends over time actually matched up with
some ideas and investigations from the side and i found that they matched up very well so the roslings have been able to do simplicity
without removing what's important about the data whereas the
film yesterday that we saw of the simulation of the inside of a cell as a former molecular biologist i didn't like that at all
not because it wasn't beautiful or anything but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand about molecular biology and that is why is there
any probability at all of two complex shapes finding each other just the right way so they combine together and be catalyzed
and what we saw yesterday was every reaction was fortuitous they just swooped in the air and bound and something
those molecules are spinning at the rate of about a million revolutions per second
agitating back and forth their size every two nanoseconds
they're completely crowded together they're jammed they're bashing up against each other and if you don't understand that in your mental model of this stuff
what happens inside of a cell seems completely mysterious and fortuitous and i think that's exactly the wrong image for when you're trying to teach science
so another thing that we do is to confuse adult sophistication with the actual understanding of some principle
so a kid who 's fourteen in high school this version of the
direct one one that gives you more of the feeling
of math is something closer to pythagoras own proof which goes like this
so here we have this triangle and if we surround that
c square with three more triangles
and we copy that notice that we can
that is all you have to do
and this kind of proof is the kind of proof
now let 's go to young children
this is a very unusual teacher who
was a kindergarten and first grade teacher but was a natural mathematician so she was like that jazz musician friend you have who never studied music but is a terrific musician she just had a feeling for math and
here are her six year olds and she's got them
making shapes out of a shape
and this teacher did on every project was to have the children act like first it was a creative arts project and then something like science so they'd created these artifacts now she had them look at them
and do this laborious which i thought
for a long time until she explained to me was to slow them down
so they'll think so they're cutting out the
but the whole point of this thing is
them to look at this chart and fill it out
what have you noticed about what you did and so six year old lauren there noticed that the first one took one
and the second one took three more
and the total was four on that one the third one took five more
and the total was nine on that one and then the next one so she saw right away that
the additional tiles that you had to add around the edges was always going to grow by two
so she was very confident about how she made those numbers there and she could see that these were the square numbers up until about six
so that's what lauren did and then the teacher
gillian ishijima had the kids bring all of their projects up to the front of the room and put them on the floor and everybody went batshit
no matter what the shapes were the growth law is the same
and the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd will recognize these two progressions as a first order discrete differential equation and a second order discrete by six year olds
so let 's take a look now
how we might use the computer for some of this
and so the first idea here is just to show you the kind of things that children
do i'm using the software that we're putting on the one hundred dollar laptop
so i'd like to draw a little
and here 's a little behavior car forward
each time i click it car turn if i want to make a little script to do this over and over again i just drag these guys out
goes straight that's a bit of a revelation for nine year olds
a little bit like kissing your sister as far as driving a car so the kids want to do a steering wheel
so they draw a steering wheel we'll
there and to just drop it into the script here and now i can steer the car with the steering wheel
we get a visual pattern of what these nine year olds called acceleration
so how did the children do science to the
to the not
because of course he didn't bother doing the experiment and neither did st thomas aquinas and it was not until galileo actually did it that an adult thought like a child
only four hundred years ago
we get one child like that about every classroom of thirty kids
will actually cut straight to the chase now what if we want to look at this more closely we can take a movie
of what's going on but even if we single stepped this movie it's tricky to see what's going on and so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side or stack them up so when the children see this they say ah acceleration
so what i'm doing is measuring from the bottom of one image to the bottom of the next image about a fifth of a second later
like that and they're getting faster and faster each time and if i stack these guys
then we see the differences the increase in the speed
is constant and they say oh yeah constant acceleration we've done that already and how shall we
and verify that we actually
the ball and run the movie at the same time
very cleverly by running a ball down backwards down the strings of his lute
i pulled out those apples to remind myself to tell you that this is actually this stuff works here
gravity here 's this increase the speed by something increase the ship 's speed if i start the little game here that the kids have done it'll crash the
but if i oppose gravity here we
but in fact if you think of it children are the future we send to the future forget about messages children are the future
this summer we're going to build five million of these one hundred dollar laptops and maybe fifty million next year but we
that means that we once again have a thing where we can put technology out but the mentoring that is required to go from
dollars so this is actually cheap and einstein said
