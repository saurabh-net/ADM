i love trees and i'm very lucky because we live near a wonderful arboretum and
usually i'd go there with my wife and now with my four year old and we'd climb in the trees we'd play hide and seek the second school i was
had big trees too had a fantastic tulip tree i think it was the biggest in the country and it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation around it around the playing
one day i was grabbed by some of my classmates and taken in the bushes i was stripped i was attacked i was abused and this came out of the blue
now the reason i say that because afterwards i was thinking well i went back into the school i felt dirty i felt betrayed felt ashamed
mainly i felt powerless and thirty years later i was sitting in an airplane next to a lady called veronica who came from chile
it was an amazing learning experience because for me human rights have been something
and as you know he 's a great singer but he 's a magnificent hustler
very hard guy to say no to and he was saying you know just after i'd done the biko song we're going to do a tour for amnesty you have to be on it and really that was the first time
been out and started meeting people who 'd watched their family being shot in front of them and had a partner thrown out of an airplane into an ocean and suddenly
this world of human rights arrived in my world and i couldn 't really walk away in quite the same way as before and
so i got involved with this tour which was for amnesty and then in eighty eight i took over bono's job
trying to learn how to hustle i didn't do it as well but we managed to get youssou n 'dour sting tracy chapman and bruce springsteen to go round the world for amnesty and it was an amazing experience
and once again i got an extraordinary education and it was the first time really that i'd met
a lot of these people in the different countries and these human rights stories became very physical
and again i couldn 't really walk away quite so comfortably but the thing that really amazed me that i had no idea was
you could suffer in this way and then have your whole experience your story
buried and forgotten and it seemed that whenever there was a camera
a video or film camera it was a great deal harder to do to bury the story
and reebok set up a foundation after these human rights now tours and
it didn 't really get anywhere and then the rodney king incident happened and people thought ok if you have a camera in the right place at the right time or perhaps the wrong time
who you are then you can actually start doing something and campaigning since given
out in over sixty countries and we campaign with activist groups
and help them tell their story
we had a wonderful story from uganda yesterday this one isn't quite so good and in the north of uganda there are something like one point five million
internally displaced people people who are not refugees in another country but because of the civil war which has been going on for about twenty years
they have nowhere to live and twenty thousand kids have been taken away to become child soldiers
it's lord 's resistance army i believe but the government also doesn't have a clean sheet so if we could run the first video the
the and i
and i the
the the
the the
the me
me i
is not something that always happens on other soil in
my country it was we had been looking at pictures of british soldiers beating up young
got abu ghraib we've got guantanamo bay and i had a driver on my way to and
he told me a story that in the middle of the night four a m
been taken out of his home in queens taken to a place in the midwest
that he was interrogated and tortured
the street four weeks later
because he had the same he was middle eastern and he had the same name as one of the nine eleven pilots and
that may or may not be true i didn't think he was a liar though and i think if we look around the world
as well as the polar ice caps melting human rights which have been fought for for many hundreds of years in some cases are also eroding very fast and that is something that we need to
take a look at and maybe start campaigning
for i mean here too one of our partners has was at van jones and the books not bars project they have managed with their footage to in california to change the
correction systems employed and it's much
no not at all no problem take your time but this
whoever that man is whatever he 's done this is cruel and unusual punishment has been
the brave people who often put their lives at risk around the world with cameras and i'd like to show you just a little more
and we 've also been trying to get computers out to the world so that groups can communicate much more effectively campaign much more effectively but now
we have the wonderful possibility
which is given to us from the mobile phone with the camera in it because that is cheap it's ubiquitous and it's
moving fast all round the world and it's very exciting for us and so the dream is that
we could have a world in which anyone
anything bad happen to them of this sort has a chance of getting their story uploaded being seen
being watched that they really know that they can be heard that there would be a giant website
maybe a little like google earth and you could fly over and find out the realities of what's going for the world 's inhabitants in a way
what this technology is allowing is really that a lot of the problems of the world
have a human face that we can actually see who 's dying of aids or who 's being beaten up for the first time and we can hear their stories
in a way that the blogger culture if we can move that into these sort of fields i think we can really transform
the world in all sorts of ways
could be a new movement growing up reaching for the light
reaching for the light thank you
