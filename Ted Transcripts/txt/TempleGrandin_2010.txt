i'll start out and just talk a little bit about what exactly autism is autism is a very big continuum that goes from very severe the child remains non verbal
all the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers and i actually feel at home here because there is a lot of autism genetics here you wouldn't have any
of traits when does a nerd turn into asperger which is just mild autism i mean einstein and mozart and tesla would all be probably diagnosed as autistic spectrum today
now the thing about the autistic mind is it attends to details okay this is a test where you either have to pick out the big letters or pick out the little letters and the autistic mind picks out the little letters more quickly
and the thing is the normal brain ignores the details well if you're building a bridge details are pretty important because it will fall down if you ignore the details
and one of my big concerns with a lot of policy things today is things are getting too abstract people are getting away from doing hands on stuff
i'm really concerned that a lot of schools have taken out the hands on classes because art and classes like that those are the classes where i excelled okay in my work with
rapid movement contrast in the early seventies when i started i got right down in the chutes to see what cattle were seeing people thought that was crazy
a coat on a fence would make them balk shadows would make them balk a hose on the floor people weren't noticing these things a chain hanging down
and that's shown very very nicely in the movie in fact i loved the movie how they duplicated all my projects that's the geek side my drawings got to star in the movie
and actually it's called temple grandin not thinking in pictures so what is thinking in pictures it's literally movies in your
my mind works like google for images now when i was a young kid i didn't know my thinking was different i thought everybody thought in pictures
like if i say think about a church steeple most people get this sort of generalized generic one now maybe that's not true in this room but it's going to be true
a lot of different places i see only specific pictures they flash up into my memory just like google for pictures and in the movie they've got a great scene in there where the word shoe is said
and sixties shoes pop into my imagination
more fort collins okay how about famous ones and they just kind of come up kind of like this just really quickly like google for pictures
and they come up one at a time and then i think okay well maybe we can have it snow or we can have a thunderstorm and i can hold it there and turn them into videos
now visual thinking was a tremendous asset in my work designing cattle handling facilities
one of the things that i was able to do in my design work is i could actually test run a piece of equipment in my mind
and this is an aerial view of a recreation of one of my projects that was used in the movie that was like just so super cool
and there were a lot of kind of asperger types and autism types working out there on the movie set too but one of the things that really worries me is where is the younger version of those kids going
not ending up in silicon valley where they belong
the things i learned very early on because i wasn't that social is i had to sell my work and not myself
now i had this brain scan done several years ago and i used to joke around about having a gigantic internet trunk line going deep into my visual cortex this is tensor imaging
and my great big internet trunk line is twice as big as the control 's the red lines there are me and the blue lines are the sex and age matched control
and there i got a gigantic one and the control over there the blue one has got a really small
mind you see the autistic mind tends to be a specialist mind good at one thing bad at something else
and where i was bad was algebra and i was never allowed to take geometry or trig gigantic mistake i'm finding a lot of kids who need to skip algebra go right to geometry and
now another kind of mind is the pattern thinker more abstract these are your engineers your computer programmers now this is pattern thinking
that praying mantis is made from a single sheet of paper no scotch tape no cuts and there in the background is the pattern for folding it here are the types of thinking photo realistic visual thinkers like me
pattern thinkers music and math minds some of these often have problems with reading you also will see these kind of problems with with kids that are dyslexic you'll see these different kinds of minds
and i came in half an hour beforehand so i could have it put on and kind of get used to it and they got it bent so it's not
but sensory is an issue some kids are bothered by fluorescent lights others have problems with sound sensitivity you know it's going to be variable
now visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight into the animal mind because think about it an animal is a sensory based thinker not
thinks in pictures thinks in sounds thinks in smells think about how much information there is there on the local fire hydrant he knows who 's been
when they were there are they friend or foe is there anybody he can go mate with there is a ton of information on that fire hydrant
it's all very detailed information and looking at these kind of details gave me a lot of insight
and a man on the ground that is viewed as two totally different things you could have a horse that's been abused by a rider they will be absolutely fine with the veterinarian and with the horse shoer but you can't ride him you have another horse where maybe the horse shoer beat him up
and he'll be terrible for anything on the ground with the veterinarian but a person can ride him cattle are the same way man on a horse
a man on foot they are two different things you see it's a different picture see i want you to think about just how specific this is now
or do i have something wrong with the equipment in other words categorize equipment problem from a people problem i find a lot of people have difficulty doing
now let 's say i figure out it's an equipment problem is it a minor problem with something simple i can fix or is the whole design of the system wrong people have a hard time figuring that out
it would be their airplane tails you know five fatal wrecks in the last twenty years the tail either came off
or steering stuff inside the tail broke in some way it's tails pure and simple and when the pilots walk around the plane guess what they can't see that stuff inside the tail
you know now as i think about that i'm pulling up all of that specific information it's specific so you see my thinking is bottom up
i take all the little pieces and i put the pieces together like a puzzle now here is a horse that was deathly afraid of black cowboy hats
been abused by somebody with a black cowboy hat white cowboy hats that was absolutely fine now
is the world is going to need all of the different kinds of minds to work together we've got to work on developing all these kinds of minds
and one of the things that is driving me really crazy as i travel around and i do autism meetings is i'm seeing a lot of smart geeky nerdy kids
this brings up the whole thing of my science teacher my science teacher is shown absolutely beautifully in the movie i was a goof ball student when i was in high school i just didn't care at all about studying
until i had mister carlock 's science class he who is now doctor carlock in the movie and he got me challenged to figure out an optical illusion room
you know one of the things that i think maybe ted ought to do is tell all the schools about all the great lectures that are on ted and there is all kinds of great stuff on the internet to get these kids
because i'm seeing a lot of these geeky nerdy kids and the teachers out in the midwest and the other parts of the country when you get away from these tech areas they don't know what to do with these kids and they are not going down the right path
you can make a mind to be more of a thinking and cognitive mind or your mind can be wired to be more social
a trade off between thinking and social and then you can get into the point where it's so severe you're going to have a person that's going to be non verbal
in the normal human mind language covers up the visual thinking we share with animals this is the work of doctor bruce miller
and he studied alzheimer 's patients that had frontal temporal lobe dementia and the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain and this artwork came out of somebody who used to install stereos in cars now
doesn't know anything about physics but i think it's very interesting that there was some work done to show that this eddy pattern in this painting followed a statistical model of turbulence which brings up the whole interesting idea of maybe some of this mathematical
and they've taken out the autoshop class and the drafting class and the art class i mean art was my best subject in school we've got to think about all these different kinds of minds
and we've got to absolutely work with these kind of minds because we absolutely are going to need these kind of people in the future
and let 's talk about jobs okay my science teacher got me studying because i was a goof ball that didn't want to study but you know what i was getting work experience i'm seeing too many of these smart kids who haven't learned basic things like how to be on time
and when i was thirteen i had a job at a dressmaker 's shop sewing clothes i did internships in college i was building things and i also had to learn how to do assignments
all i wanted to do was draw pictures of horses when i was little my mother said well let 's do a picture of something else they've got to learn how to do something else let 's say the kid is fixated on
like if a kid loves race cars let 's use race cars for math let 's figure out how long it takes a race car to go a certain distance in other words use that fixation in order to motivate that kid that's one of the things we need to do
what can visual thinkers do when they grow up they can do graphic design all kinds of stuff with computers photography industrial design
the pattern thinkers they're the ones that are going to be your mathematicians your software engineers your computer programmers all of those kinds of jobs and then you've got the word minds they make great journalists
and they also make really really good stage actors because the thing about being autistic is i had to learn social skills like being in a play it's just kind of you just have to learn
and we need to be working with these students and this brings up mentors you know my science teacher was not an accredited teacher
he was a nasa space scientist now some states now are getting it to where if you have a degree in biology or a degree in chemistry you can come into the school and teach biology or chemistry we need to be doing that
is there is a lot of people that may have retired from working in the software industry and they can teach your kid and it doesn't matter if what they teach them is old
mentors are just essential i can not emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me
know you once wrote i like this quote if by some magic autism had been eradicated from the face of the earth then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a
a couple other questions and if any of these feel inappropriate it's okay just to say next question but if there is someone here who has an autistic child or knows an autistic child and feels kind of cut off from them
what advice would you give them
but then you get the smart geeky kids that have a touch of autism and that's where you've got to get them turned on with doing interesting things i got social interaction through shared interest i rode horses with other kids i made model rockets with other kids
electronics lab with other kids and in the sixties it was gluing mirrors onto a rubber membrane on a speaker to make a light show that was like we considered that
unrealistic for them to hope or think that that child loves them as
so most people if you ask them what are they most passionate about they'd say things like my kids or my lover what are you most passionate about
passionate about that the things i do are going to make the world a better place when i have a mother of an autistic child say my kid went to college because of your book or one of your lectures that makes me happy
you know the slaughter plants i've worked with them in the eighties they were absolutely awful i developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants where you just measure outcomes how many cattle fell down how many cattle got poked with the prodder how many cattle are mooing their heads off
and it's very very simple you directly observe a few simple things it's worked really well i get satisfaction out of seeing stuff that makes real change in the real world we need a lot more of that and a lot less abstract stuff
one of the things you said that really astonished me was you said one thing you were passionate about was
the reason i got really excited when i read about that it contains knowledge it's libraries and to me knowledge is something that is extremely valuable thank
