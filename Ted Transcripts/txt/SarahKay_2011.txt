at least she can always find her way to me
and she 's going to learn
okay there 's a few heartbreaks that chocolate can 't fix but that 's
what the rain boots are for because rain will wash away everything if you let it i want her to look at the world through the underside of a glass bottom boat to look through a microscope at the galaxies that exist on the pinpoint of a human mind because
that 's the way my mom taught me that there 'll be days like this there 'll be days like this my momma said when you open your hands to catch
and wind up with only blisters and bruises when you step out of the phone booth and try to fly and the very people you want to save are the ones standing on your cape
when your boots will fill with rain and you 'll be up to your knees in disappointment and those are the very days you have all the more reason to say thank you because there 's nothing more beautiful than the way the ocean refuses to stop kissing the shoreline no matter how many times it 's sent away
you will put the wind in winsome lose some you will put the star in starting over and over and no matter how many land mines erupt in a minute be sure your mind lands on the beauty of this funny place called life and yes on a scale from one to over trusting i am
pretty damn naive but i want her to know that this world is made out of sugar it can crumble so easily but don 't be afraid to stick your tongue out
and taste it baby i 'll tell her remember your momma is a worrier and your poppa is a warrior and you are the girl with small hands and big eyes who never stops asking for more remember that good things come in threes and
so do bad things and always apologize when you 've done something wrong but don 't you ever apologize for the way your eyes refuse to stop shining your voice is small
but don 't ever stop singing and when they finally hand you heartache when they slip war and hatred under your door and offer you handouts on street corners of cynicism and defeat you tell them that they
really ought to meet your mother
okay so here are three things i know to be true i know that
when i was a freshman in high school i was a
a baby i needed to get to know so i decided to give it a try
and mainly exaggerated but the only spoken word poetry that i had seen up until that point was mainly indignant so i thought that that 's what was expected of me
the first time that i performed
the audience of teenagers hooted and hollered their sympathy and when i came off the stage i was shaking i felt this tap on my shoulder and i turned around to see this giant girl in a hoodie sweatshirt emerge from the crowd she was maybe eight feet tall and looked like she could beat me up with one hand but instead she just nodded at me and said hey
i really felt that thanks
at least a decade but somehow the poets at the bowery poetry club didn 't seem bothered by the fourteen year old wandering about if fact they welcomed me
and it was here listening to these poets share their stories that i learned that spoken word poetry didn 't have to be indignant it could be fun or painful or serious or silly the bowery poetry club became my classroom
and my home and the poets who performed encouraged me to share my stories as well never mind the fact that i was fourteen they told me write about being fourteen
so i did and stood amazed every week when these brilliant grown up poets laughed with me and groaned their sympathy and clapped and told me hey i really felt that too
now i can divide my spoken word journey into three steps step one was the moment i said i can i can do this and that was thanks to a girl in a hoodie step two was the moment i said i will
i will continue i love spoken word i will keep coming back week after week and step three began when i realized that i didn 't have to write poems that were indignant if that 's not what i was there were things that were specific to me and the more that i focused on those things
full of everywhere else that i 've been when i got to university i met a fellow poet who shared my belief in the magic of spoken word poetry and actually phil kaye and i coincidentally also share the same last name
to using spoken word poetry as a way to entertain educate and inspire
we stayed full time students but in between we traveled performing and teaching nine year olds to mfa candidates from california to indiana to india to a public high school just up the street from campus and we saw over and over the way that spoken word poetry cracks open locks
but it turns out sometimes poetry can be really scary turns out sometimes you have to trick teenagers into writing poetry so i came up with lists everyone can write lists and the first list that i assign is ten things i know to be
and here 's what happens and here 's what you would discover too if we all started sharing our lists out loud
and most people respond really well to this exercise
but one of my students a freshman named charlotte was not convinced charlotte was very good at writing lists but she refused to write any poems miss she 'd say i 'm just not interesting i don 't have anything interesting to say
so i assigned her list after list and one day i assigned the list ten things i should have learned by now number three on charlotte 's list was i should have learned not to crush on guys three times my age
i know that the number one
rule to being cool is to seem unfazed to never admit that anything scares you or impresses you or excites you somebody once told me it 's like walking through life like this
you protect yourself from all the unexpected miseries or hurt that might show up but i try to walk through life like this and yes that means catching all of those miseries and hurt but it also means that when beautiful amazing things just
fall out of the sky i 'm ready to catch them i use spoken word to help my students rediscover wonder to fight their instincts to be cool and unfazed and instead actively pursue being engaged with what goes on around them so that they can reinterpret and create something from
it it 's not that i think that spoken word poetry is the ideal art form i 'm always trying to find the best way to tell each story i write musicals i make short films alongside my poems but i teach spoken word poetry because it 's accessible
not everyone can read music or owns a camera but everyone can communicate in some way and everyone has stories that the rest of us can learn from
plus spoken word poetry allows for immediate connections it 's not uncommon for people to feel like they 're alone or that nobody understands them but spoken word teaches that if you have the ability to express yourself
is step three infusing the work you 're doing with the specific things that make you you even while those things are always changing because step three never ends
but you don 't get to start on step three until you take step one first i can i travel a lot while i 'm teaching and i don 't always get to watch all of my students reach their step three but i was very lucky with charlotte
i 'm trying to tell stories only i can tell like this story i spent a lot of time thinking about the best way to tell this story and i wondered if the best way was going to be a powerpoint or a short film and where exactly was the beginning or the middle or the end and i wondered whether i 'd get to the end of this talk and finally have figured it all out
i would like to help others rediscover that wonder to want to engage with it to want to learn to want to share what they 've learned what they 've figured out to be true and what they 're still figuring out so i 'd like to close with this poem when they bombed hiroshima
the explosion formed a mini supernova so every living animal human or plant that received direct contact with the rays from that sun was instantly turned to ash
and what was left of the city soon followed the long lasting damage of nuclear radiation caused an entire city and its population to turn into powder
when i was born my mom says i looked around the whole hospital room with a stare that said this i 've done this before she says i have old eyes when my grandpa genji died i was only five years old but i took my mom by the hand and told her don 't worry he 'll come back as a baby and
but in hiroshima some people were wiped clean away leaving only a wristwatch or a diary page so no matter that i have inhibitions to fill all my pockets i keep trying hoping that one day i 'll write a poem i can be proud to let sit in a museum exhibit as the only proof i existed my parents named me sarah
which is a biblical name in the original story god told sarah she could do something impossible and she laughed because the first sarah she didn 't know what to do with impossible and me
well neither do i but i see the impossible every day impossible is trying to connect in this world trying to hold onto others while things are blowing up around you knowing that while you 're speaking they aren 't just waiting for their turn to talk
there 's this piece of wall in hiroshima that was completely burnt black by the radiation but on the front step a person who was sitting there
blocked the rays from hitting the stone the only thing left now is a permanent shadow of positive light after the a bomb specialists said it would take seventy five years for the radiation damaged soil of hiroshima city to ever grow anything again but that spring there were new buds popping up from the earth
when i meet you in that moment i 'm no longer a part of your future i start quickly becoming part of your past but in that instant i get to share your present and you you get to share mine and that is the greatest present of all so if you tell me i can do the impossible
