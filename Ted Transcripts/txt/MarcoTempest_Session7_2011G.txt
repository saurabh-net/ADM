and about three years ago i started an exercise in openness and inclusiveness by reaching out into the open source software community to create new digital tools for magic
tools that could eventually be shared with other artists to start them off further on in the process and to get them to the poetry faster
today i 'd like to show you something which came out of these collaborations it 's an augmented reality projection tracking and mapping system or a digital storytelling tool could we bring down the lights please my take
my take terribly sorry
terribly sorry floor
floor wake up
