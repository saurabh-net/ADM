really a two hour presentation i give to high school students cut down to three minutes and it all started one day on a plane on my way to ted seven years ago and in the seat next to
high school student a teenager and she came from a really poor family and she wanted to make something of her life and she asked me a simple little question she said what leads to success
and i felt really badly because i couldn't give her a good answer so i get off the plane and i come to ted and i think jeez i'm in the middle of a room of successful people so why don't i ask them what helped them succeed and pass it on to kids
so here we are seven years five hundred interviews later and i'm gonna tell you what really leads to success and makes ted sters tick and the first thing is passion
work rupert murdoch said to me it 's all hard work nothing comes easily but i have a lot of fun did he say fun rupert
yes ted sters do have fun working and they work hard i figured they're not workaholics they're workafrolics
david gallo says push yourself physically mentally you've gotta push push push you gotta push through shyness and self doubt goldie hawn says i always had self doubts i wasn't good enough i wasn't smart enough i didn't think i'd make it
now it's not always easy to push yourself and that's why they invented mothers
frank gehry frank gehry said to me my mother pushed
sherwin nuland says it was a privilege to serve as a doctor now a lot of kids tell me they want to be millionaires and the first thing i say to them is ok well you can't serve yourself you gotta serve others something of value because that's the way people really get rich
ideas ted ster bill gates says i had an idea founding the first micro computer software company i'd say it was a pretty good idea
so the big the answer to this question is simple pay four thousand bucks and come to ted
or failing that do the eight things and trust me these are the big eight things that lead to success thank you ted sters for
