to discuss the early development of the airplane
the wright brothers in the beginning of the last century had for the first time managed to make one of those devices fly
they also had taken out numerous patents on essential parts of the airplane they were not the only ones that was common practice in the industry and those who held patents on airplanes were defending them fiercely and suing competitors left and right
this actually wasn 't so great for the development of the aviation industry and this was at a time that in particular the u s government was interested in ramping up
the production of military airplanes so there was a bit of a conflict there the u s government decided to take action and forced those patent holders to make their patents available to share with others to enable
the production of airplanes so
what has this got to do with this
in two thousand and two nelson otwoma a kenyan social scientist discovered he had hiv and needed access to treatment he was told that a cure did not exist aids he heard was lethal
and treatment was not offered this was at a time that treatment actually existed in rich countries
aids had become a chronic disease people in our countries here in europe in north america were living with hiv healthy lives not so for nelson he wasn 't rich enough and not so for his three year old son who he discovered a year later also had hiv
they were facing a different battle
prices for arvs the drugs needed to treat hiv cost about twelve thousand dollars per patient per year the patents on those drugs were held by a number of
western pharmaceutical companies that were not necessarily willing to make those patents available
when you have a patent you can exclude anyone else from making from producing or making low cost versions for example available of those medications clearly this led to patent wars breaking out
dollars per patient per year to three hundred and fifty dollars per patient per year and today that same triple pill cocktail is available for sixty dollars per patient per year and of course
that started to have an enormous effect on the number of people who could afford access to those medicines treatment programs became possible funding became available and the number of people on antiretroviral drugs started to increase very rapidly
today eight million people have access to antiretroviral drugs thirty four million
are infected with hiv never has this number been so high but actually this is good news because what it means is people stop dying people who have access to these drugs stop dying and there 's something else they also stop
passing on the virus this is fairly recent science that has shown that what that means is we have the tools to break the back of this epidemic so what 's the problem
what 's the problem well
things have changed first of all the rules have changed today
all countries are obliged to provide patents for pharmaceuticals that last at least twenty years
this is as a result of the intellectual property rules of the world trade organization so what india did is no longer possible second the practice of patent holding companies have changed
here you see the patent practices before the world trade organization 's rules before ninety five before antiretroviral drugs this is what you see today
and this is in developing countries so what that means is unless we do something deliberate
and unless we do something now we will very soon be faced with another drug price crisis because new drugs are developed new drugs go to market but these medicines are patented in a much wider range of countries
so unless we act unless we do something today
we will soon be faced with what some have termed the treatment time bomb
it isn 't only the number of drugs that are patented there 's something else that can really scare generic manufacturers away this shows you a patent landscape this is the landscape of one medicine
so you can imagine that if you are a generic company about to decide whether to invest in the development of this product unless you know that the licenses to these patents are actually going to be available you will probably choose to do something else again deliberate action is needed so surely if
in two thousand and ten unitaid established the medicines patent pool for hiv
and this is how it works
patent those inventions but make those patents available to the medicines patent pool the medicines patent pool then license those out to whoever needs access to those patents that can be generic manufacturers it can also be not for profit drug development agencies for example
those manufacturers can then sell those medicines at much lower cost
to people who need access to them to treatment programs that need access to them they pay royalties
over the sales to the patent holders so they are remunerated for sharing their intellectual property
there is one key difference with the airplane patent pool the medicines patent pool is a voluntary mechanism
the airplane patent holders were not left a choice whether they 'd license their patents or not they were forced to do so that is something that the medicines patent pool cannot do
it relies on the willingness of pharmaceutical companies to license their patents and make them available for others to use
today nelson otwoma is healthy he has access to antiretroviral drugs his son will soon be fourteen years old nelson is a member of the expert advisory group of the medicines patent pool
and he told me not so long ago ellen
we rely in kenya and in many other countries on the medicines patent pool to make sure that new medicines also become available to us
that new medicines without delay become available to us and this is no longer fantasy already
i 'll give you an example
in august of this year the united states drug agency approved a new four in one aids medication the company gilead that holds the patents has licensed the intellectual property to the medicines patent pool the pool is already working today two months later
this has never been seen before
nelson 's expectations are very high and quite rightly so he and his son will need access to the next generation of antiretrovirals and the next throughout their lifetime so that he
and many others in kenya and other countries can continue to live healthy active lives
now we count on the willingness of drug companies to make that happen we count on those companies that understand that it is in the interest not only in the interest of the global good but also in their own interest to move from conflict to collaboration
and through the medicines patent pool they can make that happen they can also choose not to do that
those that go down that road may end up
in a similar situation the wright brothers ended up with early last century facing forcible measures by government so
