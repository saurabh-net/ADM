so let me begin by urging you particularly you on the youngsters side on this path you 've chosen to go as far as you can the world needs you
badly humanity is now fully into the techno scientific age
there is going to be no turning back
to public health environmental science knowledge in medical science and science overall is doubling every fifteen
to twenty years technology is increasing at a comparable rate between them the two already pervade as most of you here seated realize every dimension of human life so swift is the velocity of the techno scientific revolution
traditional fields of study are going to continue to grow
an explanation of networks of principles and laws that 's why you need not just be training in one specialty but also acquire breadth in other fields related to and even distant from your own initial choice
to understand and use it sanely as a part of the civilization yet to evolve requires a vastly larger population of scientifically trained people
in mathematical skills don 't worry many of the most successful scientists at work today are mathematically semi literate
a metaphor will serve here
including a large portion of those who could be said to be of the first rank are the ones who map the terrain they scout the frontiers they cut the pathways they raise the buildings along the way some may have considered me foolhardy
during forty one years of teaching biology at harvard i watched sadly as bright students turned away from the possibility of a scientific career or even from taking non required courses in science because they were afraid of failure
to become at least semi literate the harder the language
i didn 't take algebra until my freshman year at the university of alabama they didn 't teach it before then i finally got around to calculus as a thirty two year old tenured professor at harvard where i sat uncomfortably in classes with undergraduate
judge opportunity by how few other students and researchers are on hand
this is not to de emphasize the essential requirement of broad training or the value of apprenticing yourself
in ongoing research to programs of high quality it is important also to acquire older mentors within these successful programs and to make friends and colleagues of your age for mutual support but through it all look for a way to break out
to find a field and subject not yet popular we have seen this demonstrated already in the talks preceding mine there is the quickest way advances are likely to occur as measured in discoveries per investigator per year you may have heard the military dictum
march away from the sound of the guns observe from a distance but do not join the fray make a fray of your own
there are thousands of professionally delimited subjects sprinkled through physics and chemistry to biology and medicine and on then into the social sciences where it is possible in short time to acquire the status of an authority
when the subject is still very thinly populated you can with diligence and hard work become the world authority the world needs this kind of expertise and it rewards the kind of people willing to acquire it
and difficult to connect to other bodies of knowledge well if that 's the case good why hard instead of easy the answer deserves to be stated as principle number four
in the attempt to make scientific discoveries every problem is an opportunity and the more difficult the problem the greater will be the importance of its solution now this brings me to a basic categorization in the way scientific discoveries are made scientists pure mathematicians among them
follow one or the other of two pathways first through early discoveries a problem is identified and a solution is sought the problem
conversely for every species or other entity or phenomenon there exist important problems
for the solution of which those particular objects of research are ideally suited find out what they are you 'll find your own way to discover to learn to teach the decades ahead will see dramatic advances in disease prevention
general health the quality of life all of humanity depends on the knowledge and practice
of the medicine and the science behind it you will master you have chosen a calling that will come in steps to give you satisfaction at its conclusion of a life well lived and i thank you for having me here tonight
