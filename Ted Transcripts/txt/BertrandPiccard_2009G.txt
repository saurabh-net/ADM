learned a lot of things about ballooning especially at the end of these balloon flights around the world i did with brian jones
when i took this picture the window was frozen because of the moisture of the night and on the other side there was a rising sun
so you see that on the other side of ice you have the unknown you have the non obvious you have the non seen for the people who don't dare to go through the ice
so many people who prefer to suffer in the ice they know instead of taking the risk of going through the ice to see what there is on the other side
and i think that's one of the main problems of our society we learn maybe not the famous ted audience but so many other people learn
the unknown the doubts the question marks are dangerous and we have to resist to the changes we have to keep everything under control
well the unknown is part of life and in that sense ballooning is a beautiful metaphor because in the balloon like in life
we go very well in unforeseen directions we want to go in a direction but the winds push us in another direction like in life
and as long as we fight horizontally against life against the winds against what's happening to us life is a nightmare
how do we steer a balloon by understanding that the atmosphere is made out of several different layers of wind which all have different direction
so then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory in life or in the balloon we have to change altitude
but how do we do that in ballooning or in life how do we change altitude
how do we go from the metaphor to something more practical that we can really use every day well in a balloon it's easy we have ballast and when we drop the ballast overboard
we climb sand water all the equipment we don't need anymore and i think in life it should be exactly like this you know when people speak about pioneering spirit
very often they believe that pioneers are the ones who have new ideas it's not true the pioneers are not the ones who have new ideas because new ideas are so easy to have we just close our eyes for a minute we all come back with a lot of new ideas
the pioneer is the one who allows himself to throw overboard a lot of ballast habits certainties convictions exclamation marks
paradigms dogmas and when we are able to do that what happens
life is not anymore just one line going in one direction in one dimension no
life is going to be made out of all the possible lines that go in all the possible directions in three
and pioneering spirit will be each time we allow ourselves to explore this vertical axis of course not just like the atmosphere in the balloon but in life itself
this is very practical this can be in politics this can be in spirituality this can be in environment in finance in education of children
i deeply believe that life is a much greater adventure if we manage to do politics
i deeply believe that we can make much more protection of the environment if we get rid if we throw overboard this fundamentalism
that some of the greens have showed in the past and that we can aim for much higher spirituality if we get rid of the religious dogmas
throwing overboard as ballast to change our direction well these basically are things i believed in such a long time but actually i had to go around the world in a balloon to be invited to talk about it
one who calculate the direction of each layer of wind at which altitude in order to help the balloonist but sometime it's very paradoxal when brian jones and i were flying around the world
the weather man asked us one day to fly quite low and very slow and when we calculated we thought we're never going to make it around the world at that speed so we disobeyed we flew much higher and double the speed
and i was so proud to have found that jetstream that i called the weather man and i told him hey guy don't you think we're good pilots up there we fly twice the speed you predicted and he told me don 't do that go down immediately in order to slow down
and i started to argue i said i 'm not going to do that we don't have enough gas to fly so slow and he told me yes but with the low pressure you have on your left if you fly too fast in a couple of hours you will turn left and end up at the north pole
and then he asked me and this is something i will never forget in my life he just asked me you 're the good pilot up there what do you really want you want to go very fast in the wrong direction or slowly in the good direction
and this is why you need weathermen this is why you need people with long term vision and this is precisely what fails
in the political visions we have now in the political governments we are burning as you heard
so much energy not understanding that such an unsustainable way of life can not last for long
so we went down actually we slowed down and we went through moments of fears because we had no idea how the little amount of gas we had in the balloon could allow us to travel forty five thousand kilometers
in the middle of the pacific when you don't have the good winds you can not land you can not go back that's a crisis
that's the moment when you have to wake up from the automatic way of thinking that's the moment when you have to motivate your inner potential
your creativity that's when you throw out all the ballast all the certainties in order to adapt to the new situation
and actually we changed completely our flight plan we changed completely our strategy and after twenty days we landed successfully in egypt
but if i show you this picture it's not to tell you how happy we were it's to show you how much gas was left in the last bottles
we took of with three point seven tons of liquid propane we landed with forty kilos
when i saw that i made a promise to myself i made a promise that the next time i would fly around the world it would be with no fuel
i had no idea how it was possible i just thought it's a dream and i want to do it
and when the capsule of my balloon was introduced officially in the air and space museum in washington together with the airplane of charles lindbergh with apollo eleven with the wright brothers flier with chuck yeager 's sixty one
i had really a thought then i thought well the twentieth century that was brilliant it allowed to do all those things there
but it will not be possible in the future any more it takes too much energy it will cost too much it will be prohibited because we'll have to save our natural resources in a few decades
from now so how can we perpetuate this pioneering spirit
with something that will be independent from fossil energy and this is when the project solar impulse really started to turn in my head
it has been done but rather to improve the quality of life how can we go through the ice of certainty
in order to make the most incredible a possible thing what is today completely impossible
rid of our dependency on fossil energy if you tell to people we want to be independent from fossil energy in our world people will laugh at you except here where crazy people are invited to speak
so the idea is that if we fly around the world in a solar powered airplane using absolutely no fuel
nobody ever could say in the future that it's impossible to do it for cars for heating systems for computers and so on and so on
well solar power airplanes are not new they have flown in the past but without saving capabilities without batteries which means that they have more proven the limits of renewable energies than the potential of
if we want to show the potential we have to fly day and night that means to load the batteries during the flight in order to spend the night on the batteries
and fly the next day again it has been made already on remote controlled little airplane models without pilots but it stays an anecdote because the public couldn't identify to
i think you need a pilot in the plane that can talk to the universities that can talk to students talk to politicians during the flight and really make it a human adventure
that unfortunately four meters wingspan is not enough you need sixty four meter wingspan
because fuel is not easy to replace that's for sure and with two hundred square meters of solar power on our plane
we can produce the same energy than two hundred little lightbulbs that means a christmas tree a big christmas tree
so the question is how can you carry a pilot around the world with an airplane that uses the same amount of energy as a big christmas tree people will tell you it's impossible and that's exactly why we try to do it
we have gone through the stages of simulation design computing preparing the construction of the first prototype that has been achieved after two years of work
propeller engine just the fuselage here it's so light it's not designed by an artist but it could be fifty kilos for the entire fuselage couple of kilos more for the wing spars
this is the complete structure of the airplane and one month ago we have unveiled it
you can not imagine how it is for a team who has been working six years on it to show that it's not only a dream and a vision it's a real airplane
real airplane that we could finally present and what's the goal now the goal is to take
end of this year for the first test but mainly next year spring or summer take off on our own power without additional help without being
to nine thousand meters altitude the same time we load the batteries we run the engines and when we get at the maximum
we arrive at the beginning of the night and there there will be just one goal just one reach the next sunrise before the batteries are empty
and this is exactly the symbol of our world if our airplane is too heavy if the pilot wastes energy
never make it through the night and in our world if we keep on spoiling wasting our energy resources if we keep on building things that consume so much energy that most of the companies now go bankrupt
it's clear that we'll never give the planet to the next generation without a major problem so you see that this airplane is more a symbol i don't think it will transport two hundred people in the next
but when lindbergh crossed the atlantic the payload was also just sufficient for one person and some fuel
and twenty years later there were two hundred people in every airplane crossing the atlantic so we have to start and show the example a little bit like on this picture here this is a painting from
in the museum in holland that i love so much it's a pipe and it's written this is not a pipe this is not an airplane
this is a symbol of what we can achieve when we believe in the impossible when we have a team
when we have pioneering spirit and especially when we understand that all the certainties we have should be thrown overboard
pleases me very much is that in the beginning i thought that we would have to fly around the world with no fuel in order to have our message been understood
and more and more we're invited around the world with andre to talk about that project to talk about the symbol of it invited by politicians invited in
energy forums in order to show that it's not anymore completely stupid to think about getting rid of the dependency on fossil energies
so through speeches like this one today through interviews through meetings our goal is to get as many people possible on the team
success will not come if we just quote unquote fly around the world in a solar powered airplane no
the success will come if enough people are motivated to do exactly the same in their daily life save energy
go to renewables and this is possible you know with the technologies we have today we can save between thirty and fifty percent of the energy of a country in europe
and we can solve half of the rest with renewables it leaves twenty five or thirty percent for oil gas coal nuclear or whatever this is acceptable
this is why all the people who believe in this type of spirit are welcome to be on that team you can just go on solarimpulse com subscribe to
just be informed of what we're doing but much more to get advices to give your comments to spread the word that if it's possible in the air of course it's possible in the
and each time we have some ice in the future we have to know that life will be great and the success will be brilliant
if we dare to overcome our fear of the ice to go through the obstacle to go through the problem in order to see what there is on the other side
so you see this is what we're doing on our side everyone has his goal has his dreams has his visions
the question i leave you with now is which is the ballast you would like to throw overboard
which will be the altitude at which you would like to fly in your life to get to the success that you wish to have to get to the point that really belongs to you
with the potential you have and the one you can really fulfill because the most renewable energy we have well
