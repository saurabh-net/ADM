i live actually sitting here today in mysore we're closer to mala than we are to delhi for example
if you're in it india obviously is the place to be at the moment but if you're a marine biologist maldives is not such a bad place to be and it has been my home these
now when i talk about the northeast monsoon season i'm sure many of you here know exactly what i mean but perhaps some of you are not quite so sure i need to explain a little bit about monsoons
and in the summer india heats up gets very hot hot air rises and air is drawn in off the sea to replace it and
it works is it comes from the southwest it comes off the ocean here and is drawn up towards india so it comes from the southwest it's a southwest monsoon picks up moisture as it crosses the ocean that's what brings the monsoon rain
and then in the winter things cool down high pressure builds over india and the whole system goes into reverse so the wind is now coming from the northeast out of india across the indian ocean this way towards africa
keep that in mind now i'm a marine biologist but i'm actually a bit of an old fashioned naturalist i suppose i'm interested in all sorts of things almost everything that moves including
and i'm actually going to talk this afternoon about dragonflies this is a very beautiful species it's called the oriental scarlet and one thing you need to know about dragonflies one important thing is that they lay their eggs in fresh water they need fresh water to breed
they lay the eggs into fresh water little larvae hatch out in fresh water they feed on other little things they feed on mosquito larvae so they're very important
is a lot of variation but if you have a dragonfly with say a one year life cycle which is quite typical the larva living in the fresh water lives for ten or eleven months
adult which comes after lives for one or two months so it's essentially a freshwater animal it really does need fresh water
or wandering glider and as the name might suggest it is found pretty much around the world it lives throughout the tropics the americas africa asia australia into the pacific
and it wanders far and wide we know that much about it but it really hasn't been studied very much it's a rather mediocre
it seems a bit dull you know it's sort of dull colored and it's fairly common and it occurs everywhere you know why bother but
on diving spent as much of my time as i could in and under the water didn't notice any dragonflies maybe they were there maybe they weren 't didn't notice them
but after some time after some months one day as i was going out and about suddenly i noticed hundreds of dragonflies hundreds of dragonflies something like this these are all this species globe skimmer i didn't know at the time but i know now they're globe skimmers
i was a bit slow i didn't really take too much notice but i asked some maldivian friends and colleagues and yes they come every year and i asked people about them and yes they knew but they didn't know anything where they came from or anything and again i didn't think too much of it
but slowly it began to dawn on me that something rather special was happening because dragonflies need fresh water to breed
it's built entirely of coral reefs and on top of the coral reefs are sand banks average height about that much above sea level so global warming sea level rise it's a real serious issue
under the soil the trees can put their roots into it humans can dig holes and make a well but
bit tricky there is no surface fresh water there are no ponds streams rivers lakes nothing like that so why is it that every year millions of dragonflies millions millions of
those of you who are indian or spent your childhood here let me have a show of hands who of you not yet not yet you're too keen you're too keen no hang on hang on wait for the
those of you who grew up in india do you remember in your childhood dragonflies swarms of dragonflies maybe at school maybe tying little bits of string onto them maybe pulling bits off i'm not asking about that
south asia including the maldives and i got a bit curious about it in the maldives now in india there is plenty of water so dragonflies yeah of course why not
still in southwest monsoon maldives is still in the southwest monsoon but wind is invariably every time is from the west it's going towards india not from india so are these things how are these things getting here are they coming from india against the wind seemed a bit unlikely so
and pretty soon a picture started emerging in bangalore a colleague there sent me information for three years average twenty fourth of september so late september
time of year this is when they first arrive but how long are they around for does that give any clues so i started a very rigorous scientific process i had a rigorous scientific transect
i got on my bicycle and i cycled around the island of mala it's about five kilometers around counting the dragonflies as i go trying not to bump into people as i'm looking in the trees and
here for a very short time october november december that's it and then they tail off there's a few but that's it october november december that is not the northeast monsoon season that's not the southwest season that's the inter monsoon
the time when the monsoon changes now what i said was you get the southwest monsoon going one way and then it changes and you get the northeast monsoon going the other way
and that front in the middle is not vertical it's at an angle so as it comes over towards mala i'm standing in mala underneath the front i can be in the southwest monsoon but the wind above is from the northeast
so the dragonflies are actually coming from india on the northeast monsoon but at an altitude at one thousand to two thousand meters up in the air incredible
these little insects it's the same ones we see out here two inches long five centimeters long flying in their millions four hundred miles across the ocean at two thousand meters up quite incredible
so i was quite pleased with myself i thought wow i've tracked this one i know how they come here
i know how they come here but why do they come here what are millions of dragonflies doing flying out over the ocean every year
all the way across to east africa i know that because i have friends who work on fisheries research vessels who have sent to me reports from boats out in the ocean i know because we have reports from seychelles which fit in as well down here and i know
to go hunting for seasonal rain and they fly south as the monsoon withdraws to the south they come down through karnataka into kerala and then they
but they are incredibly good fliers this particular species it can fly for thousands of kilometers and it just keeps going and the wind the northeast wind swooshes it around and carries it off across the ocean to africa where
the young of this generation they hatched out in india they're looking for somewhere to breed if it rains here they'll breed but most of them are going to carry on and next
out of a long drought just last week the rains broke the short rains broke and it's raining there now
and the dragonflies are there i have reports from my various contacts the dragonflies are here now they're breeding there when those guys they'll lay their eggs now
the sun is overhead maximum heating maximum evaporation maximum clouds maximum rainfall maximum opportunities for reproduction not only that because you have this
drawn towards it to replace the air that's rising so the little fellow that hatches out here he gets up in to the air he is automatically carried to where the rain is falling
lay their eggs next generation they come up automatically carried to where the rain is falling it's now back there they come out it's time to come back
so in four generations one two three four and then back a complete circuit of the indian ocean this is a circuit
about sixteen thousand kilometers sixteen thousand kilometers four generations mind you for a two inch long insect it's quite incredible those of you from north america will be familiar with the monarch butterfly
which up until now has had the longest known insect migration it's only half the length of this one and this crossing here of the ocean is the
only truly regular transoceanic crossing of any insect a quite incredible feat
and i only stumbled on this because i was living in mala in maldives for long enough for it to percolate into my brain that something rather special was going on
china and russia up here in the far east so siberia manchuria and that's where it breeds and if you're a falcon it's quite a nice place to be in the summer but it's a pretty miserable place to be in the winter it 's well you can imagine so
as any sensible bird would do he moves south they move south the whole population moves south but then the being sensible stopped so now they don't stop here or even down here no they turn across here they have a little
and down here and they winter down here incredible this is the most extraordinary migration of any bird of prey a quite incredible migration
and these birds what i've done is i've complied all the records all the available records of these birds put them together and found out they migrate at exactly the same time as the dragonflies
got back to base and they pulled the remains of one of these out flying at night over the indian ocean two thousand four hundred and twenty four meters same height as the dragonflies go so they are using the same winds
and the other thing the other important factor for all these birds all medium sized fellows and this includes the next slide as well which is a bee eater bee eaters eat bees this one has a nice blue cheek it's
blue cheeked bee eater and every one of these birds that makes the crossing from india to east africa eats insects large insects the size of dragonflies thank you
