so here it is you can check i am short i'm french i have a pretty strong french accent so that's going to be clear in a moment
maybe sobering thought and something you all know about and i suspect many of you gave something to the people of haiti this
something else that i believe in the back of your mind you also know is
twenty five thousand children die of entirely preventable causes
and i suspect that many of you probably gave something towards that problem as well but somehow it doesn't happen with the same intensity so why is that
well here is a thought experiment for you
do you believe the people who tell you that aid is not going to help on the contrary it might hurt it might exacerbate corruption dependence etc or maybe you turn to the past after all we have spent billions of
maybe you look at the past and see has it done any good
and sadly we don't know and worst of all we
how do you know what would have happened without the aid maybe it would have been much worse or maybe it would have been better
idea we don't know what the counterfactual is there's only one africa so what do you do to give the aid and hope and pray that something
do you focus on your everyday life and let the earthquake every eight days continue to happen
is if we don't know whether we are doing any good we are not any
every year at least twenty five million children do not get the immunization they should get
so this is what you call a last mile problem the technology is there the infrastructure is there and yet it doesn't happen so you have your million how do you use your million to solve this last mile problem
and here 's another question
nine hundred thousand people every year most of them in sub saharan africa most of them under five in fact that is the leading cause of under five mortality we already know how to
the other half also benefits because the contagion of the disease spread
and yet only a quarter of kids at risk sleep under a net societies should be willing to go out and subsidize the net give them for free or for that matter pay people to use them because of those contagion benefits
not so fast say other people
to give the nets for free to maximize coverage or do you make people pay in order to make sure that they really value
so here is the thing i cannot answer the big question whether aid did any good or not
and in this way you can take the guesswork out of policy making by knowing what works what doesn't work and why
now it's not because the vaccines are not there they are there and they are free and it's not because parents do not care about their kids the same child that is not immunized against measles if they do measles parents will spend thousands of rupees to help them
so you get these empty village sub centers and crowded hospitals so what is the problem well part of the problem surely is that people do not fully understand after all in this country as well all sorts of myths and misconceptions go
to action imagine you are a mother in udaipur district rajasthan you have to walk a few kilometers to get your kids immunized
because a we can make it easy and b we can maybe give people a reason to act
so these are simple ideas but we didn't know so let 's try them
so what we did is we did a randomized controlled trial in one hundred and thirty four villages in
so the blue dots are selected randomly we made it easy i'll tell you in a moment in the red dots we made it easy and gave people a reason to act now the white dots are comparisons nothing changed
so we made it easy by organizing this monthly camp where people can get their kids immunized
and then you make it easy and give a reason to act now
it's never going to convince anybody
to do something that they don't want to do on the other hand if your problem is you tend to postpone then it might give you a reason to act today
should you give them for free or should you ask people to pay for them so the answer hinges on the answer to three simple questions one is if people must pay for a bed net are they going to purchase them
one is if i give bed nets for free are people going to use them and the third one is
do free bed nets discourage future purchase the third one is important because if we think people get used to handouts it might destroy markets to distribute free bed nets
now this is a debate that has generated a lot of emotion and angry rhetoric it's
it turns out it's an easy question we can know the answer to this question we can just run an experiment and many experiments and they all have the same results so i'm just going to talk to you about one and this one that was in kenya
and some people get one hundred percent discount and some people twenty percent discounts and some people get fifty percent discounts etc and now we can see what so how
what you can see is that when people have to pay for their bed nets the coverage rate really falls down a lot
so even with partial subsidy three dollars is still not the full cost of a bed net and now you only have twenty percent of the people with the bed nets you lose the health immunity that's not great
who got the free bed nets one year later were offered the option to purchase a bed net
and people who got the free one were actually more likely to purchase the second one than people who didn't get a free one so people do not get used to handouts they get used to nets maybe we need to give them
nets so you will think that 's great you know how to immunize you know how to give bed nets
to get kids into school for example
were invented in britain before the industrial revolution goods used to go on
so should they have continued to carry the goods on the horse carts on the ground that they would eventually get there
if that had been the case there would have been no industrial revolution
so why shouldn 't we do the same with
in technology we spend so much time experimenting fine tuning getting the absolute cheapest way to do something so why aren't we doing that
how many extra years of education do you get for your hundred dollars now i'm going to show you what we get
and that's not bad for your hundred dollars you get between one and three extra years of education
the most surprising results tell people the benefits of education that's very cheap to do
so for every hundred dollars you spend doing that you get forty extra years of education and
the kids of their worms and for every hundred dollars you get almost thirty extra years of education
so this is not your intuition this is not what people would have gone for and yet these are the programs that work we need that kind of information we need more of it and then we need to guide
so now i started from the big problem and i couldn't answer it and i cut it into smaller questions and i have the answer to these smaller questions and they are good scientific robust answers so
let 's go back to haiti for a moment
in haiti about two hundred thousand people died
but if we were willing to spend ten thousand dollars for every child under five who dies that would be ninety billion per year just
of the problem is that in haiti although the problem is huge somehow we understand it it's
you give your money to doctors without borders you give your money to partners in health and they'll send in the doctors and they'll send in the lumber and they'll helicopter things out and
so first it's mostly invisible second it's huge and third we don't know whether we're doing the right thing there's no silver bullet you cannot helicopter people out of poverty and that's very frustrating we can get started
here 's an example of how this can be powerful deworming worms have a little bit of a problem grabbing the headlines they are not beautiful and don't kill anybody
in two thousand and nine so this evidence is powerful it can prompt action
so we should get started now now it's not going to be easy it's a very slow process you have to keep experimenting and sometimes ideology has to be trumped by practicality and sometimes what works somewhere doesn't work elsewhere so it's a slow process
i'm proposing it's like twentieth century medicine it's a slow deliberative process
and now maybe we can go back to the bigger question
that i started with at the beginning
i cannot tell you whether the aid we have spent in the past has made a difference but can we come back here in thirty years and say
we have done it really prompted a change for the better
and i hope we will thank you
