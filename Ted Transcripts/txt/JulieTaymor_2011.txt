which is a seminal moment in my life
and when i 'm in the turbulent times as we know that i am right now through the crucible and the fire of transformation which is what all of you do actually anybody who creates knows there 's that point where it hasn 't quite
become the phoenix or the burnt char
twenty one twenty two years a long time ago on a fellowship and i found myself after two years there and performing and learning on the island of bali
a rite of passage little did i know that it was mine as well
in the dark there was no electricity just the full moon
down in this empty square
and i thought i was alone in the dark under this tree
and these twenty old men who i 'd seen before
all of a sudden stood up in these full warrior
costumes with the headdress and the spears and no one was in the square and i was hidden in the shadows no one was there and they came out and they did this incredible dance
and they moved their bodies and they came forward and the lights bounced off these costumes and i 've been in theater since i was eleven years old
and i realized that they were performing for god whatever that means
whatever that means but somehow
it didn 't matter about the publicity
a young man with a propane lantern came on hung it up on a tree set up a curtain the village square was
filled with hundreds of people and they put on an opera all night long
human beings needed the light
they needed the light to see
was that you must be true
to what you believe as an artist all the way through but you also
have to be aware that the audience is out there in our lives at this time and they also need the light and it 's this incredible balance
what i would like to do now is to tell you a little bit
about how i work let 's take the lion king you saw many examples of my work up there but it 's one that people know
i start with the notion of the ideograph
i go to the concept of the lion king and i say what is the essence of it what is the abstraction
if i were to reduce this entire story into one image what would it be
the circle the circle it 's so obvious the circle of life
the circle of mufasa 's mask
the circle that when we come to act ii and there 's a drought how do you express drought it 's a circle of silk
the circle of life comes in the wheels
of the gazelles that leap
and you see the mechanics and being a theater person what i know and love about the theater is that when the audience comes in and they suspend their disbelief when you see men walking or women walking with a platter of grass on their heads you know it 's the savanna you don 't question that
i love the apparent truth of theater i love that people are willing to fill in the blanks the audience is willing to say oh
i know that 's not a real sun
you took pieces of sticks you added silk to the bottom you suspended these pieces you let it fall flat on the floor and as it rises with the strings i see that it 's a sun but the beauty of it is that it 's just silk
and sticks and in a way
that is what makes it spiritual
that 's what moves you it 's not the actual literal sunrise that 's coming it 's the art of it
the story is critical and the book and the language the mechanics the methods
that you use is equal to the story itself
and i 'm one who loves high tech and low tech
so i could go from
for instance i 'll show you some spider man later these incredible machines that move people along
so now i 'm going to show you
some clips from the other big project of my life this year
from theater doing the tempest on the stage in a very low budget production many years ago
and i love the play and i also think it 's shakespeare 's last play
and it really lends itself as you can see to cinema
but i 'm just going to give you a little example about how one stages it in theater
and then how one takes that same
idea or story and moves it into cinema
the ideograph that i talked to you about before what is it for the tempest
hang my hat on for this
and it was the sand castle
the idea of nurture versus nature
that we build these civilizations she speaks about it at the end helen mirren 's prospera we build them but
under nature under the grand tempest
these cloud capped towers these gorgeous palaces will fade
and there will leave not a rack behind
so in the theater i started the play it was a black sand rake
white cyc and there was a little girl miranda on the horizon building a drip castle a sand castle
and as she was there on the edge of that stage ran along the top
and started to pour water on the sand castle
and the sand castle started to drip and sink
but before it did the audience saw
the black clad stagehands the medium was apparent it was banal we saw it but as they started to pour the water
the light changed from showing you the black clad stagehands to focusing this rough magic that we do in theater it focused right on the water itself
and all of a sudden the audience 's perspective changes
it becomes something magically large it becomes the rainstorm
now the difference when i went and did it in the cinema i started the actual movie with a close up
of a sand castle a black sand castle and what cinema can do is by using camera
and so i could play with the medium and why i move from one medium to another is to be able to do this now i 'm going to take you to spider man
on the other side gunung batur and there was a dead volcano next to the live volcano i didn 't think i 'd be swallowed by the volcano and i am here
but it 's very easy to climb up is it not you hold on to the roots you put your foot in the little
rocks and climb up there and you get to the top and i was with a good friend who was an actor and we said let 's go up there let 's see if we can come close to the edge of that
live volcano and we climbed up and we got to the very top and we 're on the edge on this precipice roland disappears into the sulfur smoke at the volcano at the other end and i 'm up there alone on this incredible precipice did you hear the lyrics
i 'm on the precipice looking down into a dead volcano to my left
to my right is sheer shale it 's coming off i 'm in thongs and sarongs it was many years ago
and no hiking boots and he 's disappeared this mad french gypsy actor off in the smoke
and i realize i can
i throw away my thongs and i looked at the line straight in front of me
and i got down on all fours like a cat
and i held with my knees to either side of this line in front of me for thirty yards or thirty feet i don 't know the wind was massively blowing and the only way
i 'm in the crucible right now it 's my trial by fire
it 's my company 's trials by fire we survive because our theme song is rise above
boy falls from the sky rise above it 's right there in the palm of both of our hands of all of my company 's hands i have beautiful collaborators and we as creators only get there all together i know you understand
