present to you some of my music and some of my work as a composer presumably because it appeals to my well known and abundant
narcissism laughter and i 'm not kidding i just think we should just say that and move forward
with the role of the composer and so i decided to put that idea boredom as the focus of my presentation to you today
and i 'm going to share my music with you but i hope that i 'm going to do so in a way that tells a story tells a story about how i used boredom as a catalyst for creativity and invention and how boredom actually forced me to change the fundamental question that i was asking in my discipline
and how boredom also in a sense
pushed me towards taking on roles beyond the sort of most traditional narrow definition of a composer what i 'd like to do today is to start with an excerpt of a piece of music at the piano
is it music and i say this rhetorically because of course by just about any standard we would have to concede that this is of course a piece of music but i put this here now because just to set it in your brains for the moment because we 're going to return to this question it 's going to be a kind of a refrain as we go through the presentation
so here we have this piece of music by beethoven and my problem with it is it 's boring i mean you
so this is an engaging enterprise for me and i 've really leaned into that first person pronoun thing there and now my face appears twice so i think we can agree that this is a fundamentally solipsistic enterprise
at least when you play on the keyboard and if you 're not doing things like listening to it after you 've lit it on fire or something like that you know it gets a little bit boring and so pretty soon i go through other instruments they become familiar and eventually i find myself designing and constructing my own instrument and i brought one with me today and i thought i would play a little bit
on it for you so you can hear what it sounds like you gotta have doorstops
the cool thing about it is i 'm the world 's greatest mouseketeer player
anyway but i guess my point is that all of these enterprises are engaging to me in their multiplicity
but as i 've presented them to you today they 're actually solitary
enterprises and so pretty soon i want to commune with other people and so i 'm delighted that in fact i get to compose works for them i get to write sometimes for soloists and i get to work with one person
sometimes full orchestras and i work with a lot of people and this is probably the capacity the role creatively for which i 'm probably best known professionally now some of my scores as a composer look like this
and others look like this and some look like this and i make all of these by hand and it 's really tedious it takes a long long time to make these scores and right now i 'm working on a piece that 's one hundred and eighty pages in length and it 's just a big chunk of my life and i 'm just pulling out
hair i have a lot of it and that 's a good thing i suppose
and so that 's pushed me to do other projects like this one this is an excerpt from a score called the metaphysics of notation the full score is seventy two feet wide it 's a bunch of crazy pictographic notation let 's zoom in on one section of it right here you can see it 's rather detailed
i do all of this with drafting templates with straight edges with french curves and by freehand
and the seventy two feet was actually split into twelve six foot wide panels that were installed around the cantor arts center museum lobby balcony
and it appeared for one year in the museum and during that year it was experienced as visual art most of the week except as you can see in these pictures on fridays from noon til one and only during that time various performers came and interpreted these strange and undefined pictographic glyphs laughter now
this was a really exciting experience for me it was gratifying musically but i think the more important thing is it was exciting because i got to take on another role especially given that it appeared in a museum and that is as visual artist
so one of the things is that i mean some people would say like oh you 're being a dilettante and maybe that 's true i can understand how i mean because i don 't have a pedigree in visual art and i don 't have any training
i can understand the question though but is it music i mean there 's not any traditional notation
i can also understand that sort of implicit criticism in this piece s tog which i made when i was living in copenhagen i took the copenhagen subway map and i renamed all the stations to abstract musical provocations
and the players who are synchronized with stopwatches follow the timetables which are listed in minutes past the hour so this is a case of actually adapting something or maybe stealing something and then turning it into a musical notation
another adaptation would be this piece i took
the idea of the wristwatch and i turned it into a musical score i made my own faces and had a company fabricate them and the players follow these scores they follow the second hands and as they pass over the various symbols the players respond musically
here 's another example from another piece and then its realization so in these two capacities i 've been scavenger in the sense of taking like the subway map right or thief maybe and i 've also been designer in the case of making the wristwatches and once again this is for me interesting
another role that i like to take on is that of the performance artist some of my pieces have these kind of weird theatric elements and i often perform them i want to show you a clip from a piece called echolalia this is actually being performed by brian mcwhorter who is an extraordinary performer let 's watch a little bit of this and please notice the instrumentation
so yeah i get it with like the weird appliances and then the total absence of conventional instruments and this glut of conductors people might you know wonder yeah is this music
but let 's move on to a piece where clearly i 'm behaving myself and that is my concerto for orchestra you 're going to notice a lot of conventional instruments in this
this in fact is not the title of this piece i was a bit mischievous in fact to make it more interesting i put a space right in here and this is the actual title of the piece let 's continue with that same excerpt
but let 's look at one last piece today i 'm going to share with you this is going to be a piece called aphasia and it 's for hand gestures synchronized to sound and this invites yet another role and final one i 'll share with you which is that of the choreographer
and the score for the piece looks like this and it instructs me the performer to
make various hand gestures at very specific times synchronized with an audio tape and that audio tape is made up exclusively of vocal samples i recorded an awesome singer and i took the sound of his voice in my computer and i warped it in countless ways to come up with the soundtrack that you 're about to hear
i 've decided ultimately that this is the wrong question that this is not the important question the important question is is it interesting
and i follow this question not worrying about is it music not worrying about the definition of the thing that i 'm making i allow my creativity
to push me in directions that are simply interesting to me and i don 't worry about the likeness of the result to some notion some paradigm of what music composition is supposed to be and that has actually urged me in a sense to take on a whole bunch of different roles and so what i want you to think about is
to what extent might you change the fundamental question in your discipline and okay i 'm going to put one extra little footnote in here because like i realized i mentioned some psychological defects earlier and we also along the way had a fair amount of
obsessive behavior and there was some delusional behavior and things like that and here i think we could say that this is an argument for
self loathing and a kind of schizophrenia at least in the popular use of the term and i really mean dissociative identity disorder okay laughter anyway despite those perils i would urge you to think about the possibility that you might take on roles in your own work whether they are neighboring or far flung from your professional definition and with that i thank you
