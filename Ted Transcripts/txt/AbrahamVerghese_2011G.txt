within a few minutes she went into cardiac collapse she was resuscitated stabilized whisked over to a cat scan suite right next to the emergency room because they were concerned about blood clots in the lung
and the cat scan revealed no blood clots in the lung
unfortunately it happens all the time
i joke but i only half joke that if you come to one of our hospitals missing a limb no one will believe you till they get a cat scan mri or orthopedic consult
i am not a luddite i teach at stanford i 'm a physician practicing with cutting edge technology but i 'd like to make the case to you in the next seventeen minutes that
when we shortcut the physical exam when we lean towards ordering tests instead of talking to and examining the patient we not only overlook simple diagnoses that can be diagnosed at a treatable early stage but we 're losing much more than that we 're losing a ritual
we 're losing a ritual that i believe is transformative transcendent and is at the heart of the patient physician relationship
this may actually be heresy to say this at ted but i 'd like to introduce you to the most important innovation i think in medicine to come in the next ten years and that is the power of the human hand
to touch to comfort to diagnose and to bring about treatment i 'd like to introduce you first to this person whose image you may or may not recognize this is sir arthur conan doyle since we 're in edinburgh i 'm a big fan of conan doyle you might not know that conan doyle went to medical school here in edinburgh
and his character sherlock holmes was inspired by sir joseph bell joseph bell was an extraordinary teacher by all accounts and conan doyle writing about bell described the following exchange between bell and his students so picture bell sitting in the outpatient department students all around him
patients signing up in the emergency room and being registered and being brought in and a woman comes in with a child and conan doyle describes the following exchange
she says it was good and he says what did you do with the other child she says i left him with my sister at leith
and he says and did you take the shortcut down inverleith row to get here to the infirmary
and bell then goes on to explain to the students he says you see when she said good morning
i picked up her fife accent and the nearest ferry crossing from fife is from burntisland and so she must have taken the ferry over
you notice that the coat she 's carrying is too small for the child who is with her and therefore she started out the journey with two children but dropped one off along the way
you notice the clay on the soles of her feet such red clay is not found within a hundred miles of edinburgh except in the botanical gardens and therefore she took a short
and when bell actually strips the patient begins to examine the patient you can only imagine how much more he would discern and as a teacher of medicine as a student myself i was so inspired by that story
his father used to go down into the basement to tap on the sides of casks of wine to determine how much wine was left and whether to reorder
and so when auenbrugger became a physician he began to do the same thing he began to tap on the chests of his patients on their abdomens and basically everything we know about percussion which you can think of as an ultrasound of its day
organ enlargement fluid around the heart fluid in the lungs abdominal changes all of this he described in this wonderful manuscript inventum novum new invention which would have disappeared into obscurity except for the fact that this physician corvisart a famous french physician
famous only because he was physician to this gentleman corvisart repopularized and reintroduced the work and it was followed a year or two later by laennec discovering the stethoscope
that the barber pole the red and white stripes represents the blood bandages of the barber surgeon and the receptacles on either end represent the pots in which the blood was collected
luke fildes was commissioned to paint this by tate who then established the tate gallery and tate asked fildes to paint a painting of social importance and it 's interesting that fildes picked this topic fildes oldest son philip died at the age of nine on christmas eve
taken by the physician who held vigil at the bedside for two three nights that he decided that he would try and depict the physician in our time almost a tribute to this physician and hence the painting the doctor a very famous painting it 's been on calendars postage stamps in many different countries i 've often wondered
for where he had the patient i 've gotten into some trouble in silicon valley for saying that the patient in the bed has almost become an icon for the real patient who 's in the computer
i 've actually coined a term for that entity in the computer i call it the ipatient the ipatient is getting wonderful care all across america
the real patient often wonders where is everyone when are they going to come by and explain things to me who 's in charge
there 's a real disjunction between the patient 's perception and our own perceptions as physicians of the best medical care i want to show you a picture of what rounds looked like
when i was in training the focus was around the patient we went from bed to bed the attending physician was in charge too often these days rounds look very much like this where the discussion is taking place in a room
far away from the patient the discussion is all about images on the computer data and the one critical piece missing is that of the patient now i 've been influenced in this thinking
by two anecdotes that i want to share with you
one had to do with a friend of mine who had a breast cancer
back in our own town getting her subsequent care with her private oncologist and i pressed her and i asked her why did you
come back and get your care
the cancer center was wonderful it had a
beautiful facility giant atrium valet parking a piano that played itself a concierge that took you around from here to there but
she said but they did not touch my breasts
to her it mattered deeply it was enough
for her to make the decision to get her subsequent care
with her private oncologist who every time she went examined both breasts including the axillary tail examined her axilla carefully examined her cervical region her inguinal region did a thorough exam and to her that spoke of a kind of attentiveness that she needed
i was very influenced by that anecdote i was also influenced by another experience that i had again when i was in texas before i moved to stanford i had a reputation as being interested in patients with chronic fatigue this is not a reputation you would wish on your worst enemy
i say that because these are difficult patients they have often been rejected by their families have had bad experiences with medical care and they come to you fully prepared for you to join the long list of people who 's about to disappoint them
and i learned very early on with my first patient that i could not do justice to this very complicated patient with all the records they were bringing in a new patient visit of forty five minutes there was just no way
and if i tried i 'd disappoint
we know the average american physician interrupts their patient in fourteen seconds and if i ever get to heaven it will be because i held my piece for forty five minutes and did not interrupt my patient
i then scheduled the physical exam for two weeks hence and when the patient came for the physical
i was able to do a thorough physical because i had nothing else to do i like to think that i do a thorough physical exam but because the whole visit was now about the physical i could do an extraordinarily thorough exam
and i remember my very first patient in that series
and when my ritual began
this very voluble patient began to quiet down
and i remember having a very eerie sense that the patient and i
in which i had a role and the patient had a role
i have never been examined like this before
now if that were true it 's a true condemnation of our health care system because they had been seen in other places i then proceeded to tell the patient once the patient was dressed the standard things that the person must have heard in other institutions which is this is not in your head this is real
the good news it 's not cancer it 's not tuberculosis it 's not coccidioidomycosis or some obscure fungal infection the bad news is we don 't know exactly what 's causing this but here 's what you should do here 's what we should do
and i would lay out all
the standard treatment options that the patient had heard elsewhere
and i always felt that if my patient
gave up the quest for the magic doctor the magic treatment and began with me on a course towards wellness it was because i had earned the right to tell them these things by virtue of the examination something of importance had transpired in the exchange
and they immediately said to me well you are describing a classic ritual
and they helped me understand that rituals are all about transformation
we marry for example with great pomp and ceremony and expense to signal our departure from a life of solitude and misery and loneliness to one of eternal bliss
we signal transitions of power with rituals we signal the passage of a life
with rituals rituals are terribly important they 're all about transformation well i would submit to you
and then incredibly on top of that disrobing and allowing touch
i would submit to you that that is a ritual of exceeding importance and if you shortchange that ritual
by not undressing the patient by listening with your stethoscope on top of the nightgown by not doing a complete exam you have bypassed on the opportunity to seal the patient physician relationship
i am a writer and i want to close by reading you a short passage that i wrote that has to do very much with this scene i 'm an infectious disease physician and in the early days of hiv before we had our medications i presided over so many scenes like this
i remember every time i went to a patient 's deathbed whether in the hospital
or at home i remember my sense of failure
i would look at the tongue i would percuss the chest i would listen to the heart
i would feel the abdomen i remember so many
patients their names still vivid on my tongue their faces still so clear i remember so many huge hollowed out haunted eyes staring up at me as i performed this ritual and then the next day i would come and i would do it again
and i wanted to read you this one closing passage about one patient
i recall one patient who was at that point no more than a skeleton encased in shrinking skin unable to speak his mouth crusted with candida that was resistant to the usual medications
when he saw me on what turned out to be his last hours on this earth his hands moved as if in slow motion and as i wondered what he was up to
his stick fingers made their way up to his pajama shirt fumbling with his buttons
i realized that he was wanting to expose his wicker basket chest to me it was an offering an invitation i did not decline
no this ritual was about the one message that physicians have needed to convey to their patients although god knows of late in our hubris we seem to have drifted away we seem to have forgotten
as though with the explosion of knowledge the whole human genome mapped out at our feet we are lulled into inattention forgetting that the ritual is cathartic to the physician necessary for the patient forgetting that the ritual has meaning and a singular message to convey to the patient
and the message which i didn 't fully understand then even as i delivered it and which i understand better now is this i will always always always be there
i will see you through this i will never abandon you
i will be with you through the end thank you very a
