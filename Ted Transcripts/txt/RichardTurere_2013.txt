and this is what they do they kill our livestock
and i felt so bad because it was the only bull we had
my community the maasai we believe that we came from heaven
with all our animals and all the land
so i grew up hating lions so much
so they kill the lions it 's one of the six lions which were killed in nairobi
but i came to realize that
and that 's a small torch from a broken flashlight
so i set up everything
as you can see the solar panel charges the battery and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box i call it a transformer
and that 's how it looks to lions when they come at night
one of them was this grandmother
for scaring other predators like hyenas
because of this invention i was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in kenya
my new school now is coming in
so one year ago i was just a boy in the savanna grassland
i used to hate lions but now because my invention
we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict
i want to make an electric fence ca electric fence rt but i know electric fences are already invented but i want to make mine
