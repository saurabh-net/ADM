year in the united states alone
two thousand and seventy seven zero hundred couples make a legal and spiritual decision to spend the rest of their lives together
he buys a ring she buys a dress
they go shopping for all sorts of things she takes him to arthur murray for ballroom dancing lessons and the big day comes and they 'll stand before god and family and some guy her dad once did business with and they 'll vow that nothing until that far off
is finally able to rest in peace
you know because they can 't hear the snoring anymore
and then they 'll get stupid drunk and smash cake in each others faces and do the macarena and we 'll be there showering them with towels and toasters and drinking their free booze and throwing birdseed at them every single time
even though we know statistically half of them will be divorced within a decade
and debating which way the toilet paper should come off of the roll
i mean look it doesn 't take a double blind placebo controlled study to figure out what makes a marriage not work disrespect
disrespect boredom too much
time on facebook having sex with other people but you can have the exact opposite of all of those things respect excitement
what do the folks who make it all the
solo why should you stop what you 're doing and make it your life 's
well researchers spend billions of your tax dollars trying to figure that out they stalk blissful
couples and they study their every move and mannerism and they try to pinpoint what it is that sets them apart from their miserable neighbors and friends and it turns out the success stories share a few similarities
actually beyond they don 't have sex with other people for instance in the happiest marriages the wife is thinner and better looking than the husband
to marital bliss because women we care a great deal about being thin and good looking whereas men mostly care about sex
ideally with women who are thinner and better looking than they are
she might say wow honey thank you for going out of your way to make me relatively thinner
these are couples who can
find good in any situation yeah
it was devastating when we lost everything in that fire but it 's kind of nice sleeping out here under the stars
and it 's a good thing you 've got all that body fat to keep us warm one of my favorite studies found that the more willing a husband is to do house work the more attractive his wife will find him
because we needed a study to tell us this
but here 's what 's going on here the more attractive
they live happily ever after in other words men you might want to pick it up a notch in the domestic department here 's an interesting one
one study found that people who smile in childhood photographs
are less likely to get a divorce this is an actual study and let me clarify the researchers were not looking at
documented self reports of childhood happiness or even studying old journals the data were based entirely on whether people
looked happy in these early pictures now i don 't know how old all of you are
but when i was a kid your parents took pictures with a special kind of camera that held something called film
so what else can you do to safeguard your marriage
and it 's not just successfully starring in films that 's dangerous it turns out merely watching a romantic comedy causes relationship satisfaction to plummet
maybe it could happen to us but it obviously hasn 't and it probably never will makes our lives seem unbearably grim in comparison and theoretically i suppose
dies in a fiery car crash drinking alcohol it seems
i can 't tell you anymore about that one because i stopped reading it at the headline but here 's a scary one divorce
is contagious that 's right when you have a close couple friend split up it increases your chances of getting a divorce by seventy five
and viagra and eharmony and i 'm thinking they 've done more for my marriage than a lifetime of therapy ever
physically and emotionally we produce happier more stable and more successful kids
we have more sex than our supposedly swinging single friends believe it or not we even live longer which is a pretty compelling argument for marrying someone you like a lot in the first place
now if you 're not currently experiencing the joy of the joint tax return i can 't tell you how to find
a chore loving person of the approximately ideal size and attractiveness who prefers horror movies and doesn 't have a lot of friends hovering on the brink of divorce but i can only encourage you to try because the benefits as i 've pointed out
line is whether you 're in it or you 're searching for it i believe marriage is an institution worth pursuing and protecting so i hope you 'll use the information i 've given you today to weigh your personal strengths against your own risk factors for instance in my marriage
and we do like a cocktail
also my husband does a lot around the house and would happily never see another romantic comedy as long as he lives so i 've got all those things going for me but just in case i plan to work extra hard to not win an oscar anytime soon
and for the good of your relationships i would
