if you take ten thousand people at random nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine have something in common their interests in business lie on or near the earth 's surface
the odd one out is an astronomer and i am one of that strange breed my talk will be in two parts
i'll talk first as an astronomer and then as a worried member of the human race but let 's start off
by remembering that darwin showed how we're the outcome of four billion years of evolution and what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology is to go back before darwin 's simple beginning
to set our earth in a cosmic context and let me just run through a few slides this was the impact that happened last week on a comet if they'd sent a nuke it would have been rather
what actually happened last monday so that's another project for nasa that's mars from the european mars express
and at new year this artist 's impression turned into reality when a parachute landed on titan saturn 's giant moon
if we go beyond our solar system we've learned the stars aren't twinkly points of light
each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it and we can see places where stars are forming like the eagle nebula
we see stars dying in six billion years the sun will look like that and some stars die spectacularly in a supernova explosion leaving remnants like that
scale we see entire galaxies of stars we see entire ecosystems where gas is being recycled and to the cosmologist these galaxies are just
the atoms as it were of the large scale universe this picture shows a patch of sky so small that it would take about one hundred patches like it to cover the full moon in the sky
a small telescope this would look quite blank but you see here hundreds of little faint smudges each is a galaxy
like ours or andromeda which looks so small and faint because its light has taken ten billion light years to get to us
the stars in those galaxies probably don't have planets around them the scant chance of life there that's because there's been no time for the
we believe that all of this emerged from a big bang a hot dense state
but you see as time goes on in giga years at the bottom you will see structures evolve as gravity feeds on small
and we compare simulated universes like that i'll show you a better simulation at the end of my talk with what we actually see in the sky
if my research group had a logo it would be this picture here an ouroboros where you see the micro world on the left
the world of the quantum and on the right the large scale universe of planets stars and galaxies
we know our universes are united though links between left and right the everyday world is determined by atoms how they stick together to make molecules stars are fueled by how the nuclei in those atoms react together
and as we've learned in the last few years galaxies are held together by the gravitational pull of so called dark matter particles in huge swarms far smaller even than atomic nuclei but
we'd like to know the synthesis symbolized at the very top the micro world of the quantum is understood
is to link together cosmos and micro world with a unified theory symbolized as it were gastronomically at the top of that picture
and until we have that synthesis we won 't be able to understand the very beginning of our universe because when our universe was itself the size of an
one idea incidentally and i had this hazard side to say i'm going to speculate from now on is that our big bang was not the only one one idea
is that our three dimensional universe may be embedded in a high dimensional space just as you can imagine
just a millimeter away from ours but we're not aware of it because that millimeter is measured in some fourth spatial dimension and we're imprisoned in our three
and so we believe that there may be a lot more to physical reality than what we've normally called our universe the aftermath of our big
another picture bottom right depicts our universe which on the horizon is not beyond that but even that is just one bubble as it were in some vaster reality
we have to go to many big bangs from one big bang perhaps these many big bangs displaying an immense variety of properties
well let 's go back to this picture there's one challenge symbolized at the top but there's another challenge to science
we clearly have to be large compared to atoms to have layer upon layer of complex structure we clearly have to be small compared to stars and planets otherwise we'd be crushed by gravity and in fact we are midway
it would take as many human bodies to make up the sun as there are atoms in each of us the geometric mean of the mass of a proton and the mass of the sun is fifty kilograms within a factor of two of the mass of each person here well most of you anyway
the science of complexity is probably the greatest challenge of all greater than that of the very small on the left and the very large on the right
and it's this science which is not only enlightening our understanding of the biological world but also
our world faster than ever and more than that it's engendering new kinds of change and i now move on to the second
part of my talk and the book
our final century was mentioned if i was not a self effacing brit i would mention the book myself
and i would add that it's available in paperback and in america it was called our final hour because americans like instant gratification my
in this century not only has science changed the world faster than ever but in new and different ways targeted drugs genetic modification artificial intelligence
bio and cybertechnologies are environmentally benign in that they offer marvelous prospects while nonetheless reducing pressure on energy and resources but they will have a dark side
in our interconnected world novel technology could empower just one fanatic or some weirdo with a mindset of those who now design computer viruses to trigger some kind
indeed catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure error rather than terror and
even a tiny probability of catastrophe is unacceptable when the downside could be of global consequence
in fact some years ago bill joy wrote an article expressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over et cetera i don't go along with all that but it's interesting
had a simple solution it was what he called fine grained relinquishment he wanted to give up the dangerous kind of science and keep the good bits
now that's absurdly naive for two reasons first any scientific discovery has benign consequences as well as dangerous ones
and also when a scientist makes a discovery he or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be and so what this means is that
we have to accept the risks if we are going to enjoy the benefits of science we have to accept that there will be hazards
and i think we have to go back to what happened in the post war era post world war ii when the nuclear scientists who 'd been involved in making the atomic bomb in many cases were concerned
that they should do all they could to alert the world to the dangers and they were inspired not by the young einstein who did the great
work in relativity but by the old einstein the icon of poster and t shirt who failed in his scientific efforts to unify
the physical laws he was premature but he was a moral compass inspiration to scientists who were
he 's ninety six years old and he founded the pugwash movement he persuaded einstein as his last act to sign the famous memorandum of bertrand russell and he sets an example of the concerned scientist
and i think to harness science optimally to choose which doors to open and which to leave closed we need latter day counterparts of people like joseph rothblatt
we need not just campaigning physicists but we need biologists computer experts and environmentalists as well and i think academics and independent entrepreneurs
have a special obligation because they have more freedom than those in government service or company employees subject to commercial pressure i wrote my book our final century as a scientist
the immense future the stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past are now part of common culture
the sun has been shining for four and a half billion years but it'll be another six billion years before its fuel runs out on that schematic picture a sort of timeless picture
and it'll be another six billion before that happens and any remaining life on earth is vaporized
unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there experiencing the sun 's demise but any life and intelligence that exists then
here on earth and probably far beyond so we are still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity of our earth and beyond
a tiny fraction of the year but even in this concertinaed cosmic perspective
our century is very very special the first when humans can change themselves and their home
as i should have shown this earlier it will not be humans who witness the end point of the sun it will be creatures as different from us as we
and i'd like to end with a vignette as it were inspired by this image we've been familiar for forty years
with this image the fragile beauty of land ocean and clouds contrasted with the sterile moonscape on which the astronauts left their footprints
four point five billion year history of our earth what would they have seen over nearly all that immense time earth 's appearance would have changed very gradually
the only abrupt worldwide change would have been major asteroid impacts or volcanic super eruptions apart from those brief traumas nothing happens
the continental land masses drifted around ice cover waxed and waned successions of new species emerged evolved and became extinct
but in just a tiny sliver of the earth 's history the last one millionth part a few thousand years
the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before this signaled the start of agriculture change has accelerated as human populations rose
then other things happened even more abruptly within just fifty years that's one hundredth of one millionth of the earth 's age
some journeyed to the moons and planets a race of advanced extraterrestrials watching our solar system from afar could confidently predict earth 's final doom in another six billion years
what might these hypothetical aliens witness in the next hundred years will some spasm foreclose earth 's future or will the biosphere stabilize
done by the young einstein will continue as long as our civilization but for civilization to survive we'll need the wisdom of the old einstein humane global and farseeing
and whatever happens in this uniquely crucial century will resonate into the remote future
and perhaps far beyond the earth far beyond the earth as depicted here thank you very much
