there was me and my body
but the separation that had already occurred between me and my body was a pretty significant outcome
me was always trying to become something somebody me only existed in the trying my body was often in the way
me was a floating head for years i actually only wore
it was a way of keeping my head attached it was a way of locating myself
i worried that if i took my hat off i wouldn 't be here anymore i actually had a therapist who once said to me eve you 've been coming here for two years and to be honest it never occurred to me that you had a body
all this time i lived in the city because to be honest i was afraid of trees
i never had babies because heads cannot give birth babies actually don 't come out of your mouth
this led to me writing the vagina monologues which led to me obsessively and incessantly talking about vaginas everywhere i could
i did this in front of many strangers one night on stage i actually entered my vagina it was an ecstatic experience it scared me it energized me and then i became a driven person a driven vagina
i began to see my body like a thing a thing that could move fast like a thing that could accomplish other things many things all at once
i began to see my body like an ipad or a car i would drive it and demand things from it it had no limits it was invincible it was to be conquered and mastered like the earth herself
i didn 't heed it no i organized it and i directed it i didn 't have patience for my body i snapped
it into shape i was greedy
i took more than my body had to offer if i was tired i drank more espressos if i was afraid i went to more dangerous places oh sure sure i had moments of appreciation of my body the way an abusive parent can sometimes have a moment of kindness my father was really kind to me on my sixteenth birthday for example
i heard people murmur from time to time that i should love my body so i learned how to do this i was a vegetarian
i was sober i didn 't smoke but all that was just a more sophisticated way to manipulate my body a further disassociation like planting a vegetable field on a freeway
as a result of me talking so much about my vagina many women started to tell me about theirs their stories about their bodies
actually these stories compelled me around the world and i 've been to over sixty countries i heard thousands of stories and i have to tell you there was always this moment where the women shared
with me that particular moment when she separated from her body when she left home
flogged in their burqas left for dead in parking lots acid burned in their kitchens
some women became quiet and disappeared other women became mad driven machines like me in the middle of my traveling i turned forty and i began to hate my body which was actually progress because at least my body existed enough to hate it
well my stomach it was my stomach i hated it was proof that i had not measured up that i was old and not fabulous and not perfect or able to fit into the predetermined corporate image in shape my stomach was proof that i had
but the more i talked about it the more objectified and fragmented my body became it became entertainment it became a new kind of commodity something i was selling
then i went somewhere else
i went outside what i thought i knew i went to the democratic republic of congo
and i heard stories that shattered all the other stories i heard stories that got inside my body
i heard about a little girl
who couldn 't stop peeing on herself because so many grown soldiers had shoved themselves inside her
i heard an eighty year old woman whose legs were broken and pulled out of her sockets and twisted up on her head as the soldiers raped her like that
there are thousands of these stories and many of the women had holes in their bodies holes fistula that were the violation of war holes in the fabric of their souls
these stories saturated my cells and nerves and to be honest i stopped sleeping for three years
all the stories began to bleed together the raping of the earth the pillaging of minerals
none of these were separate anymore from each other or me
militias were raping six month old babies so that countries far away could get then i got cancer
or i found out i had cancer it arrived like a speeding bird smashing into a windowpane
suddenly i had a body
a body that was pricked and poked and punctured a body that was cut
cancer exploded the wall of my disconnection
i suddenly understood that the crisis in my body was the crisis in the world and it wasn 't happening later it was happening now
suddenly my cancer was a cancer that was everywhere the cancer of cruelty the cancer of greed the cancer that gets inside people who live down the streets from chemical
the cancer that is everywhere from our carelessness
in his new and visionary book new self new world the writer philip shepherd says if you are divided from your body
you are also divided from the body of the world which then appears to be other than you or separate from you rather than the living continuum to which you belong
before cancer the world was something other it was as if i was living in a stagnant pool and cancer dynamited the boulder that was separating me from the larger sea
now i am swimming in it
and i hunger for the green fields in the bush outside bukavu and when it rains hard rain i scream and i run in circles
and the fire that burned in me on day three through six of chemo is the fire that is burning in the forests of the world
i know that the abscess that grew around my wound after the operation the sixteen ounces of puss is the contaminated gulf of mexico and there were oil drenched pelicans inside me and dead floating
and the catheters they shoved into me without proper medication made me scream out the way the earth cries out from the drilling
and in the name of connectedness the only thing she wanted before she died was to be brought home by her beloved gulf of mexico
and she died quietly in her favorite place and a few weeks later i was in new orleans and this beautiful spiritual friend told me she wanted to do a healing for me and i was honored and i went to her house and it was morning and the morning new orleans sun was filtering through the curtains
and my friend was preparing this big bowl and i said what is it and she said it 's for you the flowers make it beautiful and the honey makes it sweet and i said but what 's the water part and in the name of connectedness she said oh it 's the gulf of mexico
and as the warm gulf washed over my naked head i realized that it held the best and the worst of us
it was the greed and recklessness that led to the drilling explosion it was all the lies that got told before and after it was the honey in the water that made it sweet it was the oil that made it sick
it was my head that was bald and comfortable now without a hat
it was the sorrow that 's taken so long
it was my mother leaving just at the moment that i was being born
it was the realization that i had come very close to dying in the same way that the earth our mother is barely holding on
in the same way that seventy five percent of the planet are hardly scraping by
in the same way that there is a recipe for survival what i learned is it has to do with attention and resources that everybody
deserves it was advocating friends and a doting sister it was wise doctors and advanced medicine and surgeons who knew what to do with their hands it was underpaid and really loving nurses it was magic healers and aromatic a long time
