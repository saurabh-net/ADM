and why not a toothbrush i don 't try to design the toothbrush i don 't try to say oh that will be a beautiful object or something like that that doesn 't interest me because there is different types of design
for producer to make product more sexy like that they sell more it 's shit it 's obsolete it 's ridiculous i call that the cynical design
is people like me who try to deserve to exist
what will be the effect of the brush in the mouth and to understand what will be the effect of the toothbrush in the mouth i must imagine who owns this mouth what is the life of the owner of this mouth
in what society does this guy live what civilization creates this society
because there is not a human production which exists
some million years after pshoo shoo bloop bloop ah wake up at the end finally that succeeds and life appears we was so
and the fun is the super monkey we are today is at half of the story
yes she said something like that
and today we have no idea of what we shall be in four billion years and this territory is fantastic that is our poetry
that is our beautiful story it 's our romanticism mu ta tion we are mutants and if we don 't deeply understand if we don 't integrate that we are mutants we completely miss the story
but everybody is obliged to participate and to participate for a mutant there is a minimum of exercise a minimum of sport we can say that the first if you want there is so many but one which is very easy to do is the duty of vision
i can explain you i shall try
but perhaps because you walk with the eyes like that you will not see oh there is a hole
and you will fall and you will die dangerous that 's why perhaps you will try the angle of vision
but it 's still very selfish selfish egoiste yes selfish you you survive it 's ok
because after there is another trap if you look like that you look to the past or you look inside if you are very flexible inside yourself it 's called schizophrenia and you are dead also that 's why every morning now because you are a good mutant you will
what else we can say about that why do that it 's because we if we look from far we see
line of evolution this line of evolution is clearly positive
from far this line looks very smooth like that but if you take a lens
it 's nothing because it 's not the right time
we are it 's almost done we have just to finish the story
that is very very important and when you don 't understand really what 's happened you cannot go and fight and work and build and things like that you
in perhaps fifty years sixty years we can finish completely this civilization
done that was our story that passed now you have a duty invent a new story invent a new poetry the only rule is we have not to have any idea about the next story
that 's why i continue
to work even if it 's for toilet brush about something
