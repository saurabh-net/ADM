when i'm on my bike i feel that i the profound beauty of
the profound beauty of and i feel that
with this country 's history young
you can see fellow riders at the end of the picture
looking at me with some concern and here is another picture of them unfortunately i cannot show their faces neither can i
spending time in a correction facility about twenty minutes
these kids once a week every tuesday rain or shine
for the last four years and by now they've become a very big part of my life this story began four years ago and it's surrounded by
so on one of these rides i talked my way
and went to see the
i told the warden that i wanted to start a mountain a correction facility these
we began to talk about it and
see myself going into a state
this being israel the warden somehow of
and my partner in this project
the world of total freedom
these everything you see here is obviously in israel as well as close encounters with all sorts of small creatures
all this splendor the beginning small obstacle every
so we had a lot of this going on i found out that they had a very hard time dealing with frustration
not because they were physically unfit but that's one reason why
not only to be with a
a some rocky terrain
gets caught in one of these
so he crashes down and he gets slightly injured
up and then starting to jump up and down in the air
in the air and
and nothing in my background prepared me to
have to realize that these incidents did not happen in
away from the nearest road
and what you don't see in this picture is that between these
well that's a problem because one way or another you have to get this guy moving because it's getting dark soon and dangerous
took me several such incidents to figure out what i was supposed to
harsh words and threats and they took me nowhere i found out
i found out can possibly
really want to do is go away but that's what he had all his life people walking away from him so what you have to do is and
rest for a few minutes and then we'll go on and i
he spent the last ten years of his life in two places only
the state prison where he spend the last two years before and so
and so was probably
almost every adult along the way
when an adult that he learns to respect stays
a few words about vision when i started this program four years ago i had this original plan was another vision supremely
more important and more readily available
on me in this project that the purpose of these rides should actually be to expose the kids to one thing only
love and respect to other fellow members in your team
most importantly love and respect to yourself
kids i also went through a remarkable transformation now i come from a cutthroat world of science and
with myself was supposed to be perfect
so right now i feel more
and one of these principles is focus before
during the ride you have to focus their attention on something because is
is important life coping strategies
important life coping strategies can really
can really some
some cannot take it anymore
ignore the immediate obstacles and
and look around and see how
upwards that's what perspective is all about time and
you've already conquered steeper mountains before
and that's how they develop self esteem
at the beginning of february it's very cold and you're standing in one of these rainy days and it's drizzling and
and you look up at the sky and through the clouds you see the monastery at the top of the
you say hey alex look at this parking lot where we started it's that
we talked about these special words that we teach them and at the end of
share moments in which those special words of the and made a difference
these discussions can be extremely inspiring in one of them one of the kids once said
when we were riding on
village in ethiopia and went away together with my brother
and he goes on saying and everyone looks at him like a hero probably for the first time
and he says because i also have volunteers riding with me adults
he says and this was just the beginning of
and only now he says i'm beginning to
the moab mountains here in the background that's where joshua descended and so
play key roles in the way i plan my
that were established by holocaust we explore
we explore and we discuss
and we discuss five
and through this tapestry which is the history of this country
what is probably the most important value in education
picture i took last tuesday
and i ride with them tomorrow also in everyone of fifteen years ago
and return to my home country
morocco and russia in israel
