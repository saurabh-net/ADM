i am not a farmer
kids should not have to grow up and look at things like this and as jobs continue to leave my community and energy continues to come in be exported in it 's no wonder that really some people refer to the south bronx as a desert but i 'm
the oldest sixth grader you 'll ever meet so i get up every day with this tremendous amount of enthusiasm that i 'm hoping to share with you all today
and with that note i come to you with this belief that kids should not have to leave their communities to live learn and earn in a better one so i 'm here to tell you a story about me and this wall that i met outside which i 'm now bringing inside and it starts
and i 'm here today hoping that my reach will exceed my grasp and that 's really what this is all about and it starts with incredible kids like this who come early and stay late all of my kids are either iep or ell learners most come with a lot of handicaps
most are homeless and many are in foster care almost all of my kids live below poverty but with those seeds from day one we are growing in my classroom and this is what it looks like in my classroom and you see how attentive these kids are to these seeds and then you notice that those seeds become farms across the bronx that look like this
so i wanted to figure out how i could get this kind of success into something small like this and bring it into my classroom so that handicapped kids could do it kids who didn 't want to be outside could do it and everyone could have access so i called george irwin and what do you know he came to my class and we built an indoor edible wall
and what we do is we partner it with authentic learning experiences private based learning
and lo and behold we gave birth
to the first edible wall in new york city so if you 're hungry get up and eat you can do it right now my kids play cow all the time
and my kids from the poorest congressional district in america became
real led stuff twenty first century technology and what do you know we made twenty first century money and that was
that with sedum that looks like this this is the new green graffiti so you may wonder
really had the skills he needed to build affordable housing for new yorkers right in their own neighborhood and this is what my kids are doing making living wage now if you 're like me you live in a building there are seven guys out of work looking to manage a million dollars i don 't
with interiors like this wow people noticed and notice they did so cnn called and we were delighted to have them come to our farmer 's market and then when rockefeller center said nbc could you put this thing up on the walls we were delighted but this i show you when kids from the poorest congressional district in america
not the jailhouse making them feel a part of
well we met this woman avis richards with the ground up campaign unbelievable through her my kids the most disenfranchised and marginalized were able to roll out one hundred gardens to new york city public schools
that 's triple bottom line okay a year ago today i was invited to the new york academy of medicine i thought this concept of designing a strong and healthy new york made sense especially when the resources were free so thank you all and i love them
and that 's when i realized that the greening of america starts first with the pockets then with the heart and then with the mind so we were onto something and we 're still onto something
and thank god trinity wall street noticed because they gave us the birth of green bronx machine we 're three thousand strong right now and what does it really do it teaches kids to re vision their communities so when they grow up in places like this they can imagine it like this
and again brook park feeds hundreds of people without a food stamp or a fingerprint the poorest congressional district in america the most migratory community
and most importantly when you put big kids together with little kids
or more importantly to local shelters where most of our kids are getting one to two meals a day and we 're stepping it up no air jordans were ever ruined on my farm
black field brown field toxic waste field battlefield we 're proving in the bronx that you can grow anywhere on cement
and we take orders for flowers i 'm putting the bake sale to shame we take orders now i 'm booking for the spring and these were all grown from seeds we 're learning everything and again when you can take kids from backgrounds as diverse as this to do something as special as this we 're really creating a moment now you may ask about these kids
forty percent attendance to ninety three percent attendance all start
martin luther king said that people need to be uplifted with dignity so here in new york i urge you my fellow americans to help us make america great again it 's simple share your passion it 's real easy go see these two videos please one got us invited to the white house one 's a recent incarnation
and most importantly get the biggest bully out of schools this has got to go tomorrow
people you can all do
that keep kids out of stores that look like this
great lunch today let them do culinary things but most importantly just love them nothing works like unconditional love so my good friend kermit said it 's not easy being green it 's not i come from a place where kids can buy thirty five flavors of blunt wrap at any day of the moment where ice cream freezers are filled with slushy malt liquor
okay my dear friend majora carter once told me we have everything to gain and nothing to lose so here
