is actually about discovering new things that pop up on the web because in the last four years we've seen all kinds of memes all kinds of trends get born right on our front page
on their whaling campaign these humpback whales were getting killed they wanted to put an end to it and one of the ways they wanted to do it was to put a tracking chip inside one of these humpback whales
i believe this is a farsi word for immortal i think this means divine power of the ocean in a polynesian language and then there was this mister splashy pants
and this this was special mister pants or splashy to his friends was very popular on the internet in fact someone on reddit thought oh what a great thing we should all vote this up and you know
to seventy percent at the end of voting which is pretty impressive right we won mister splashy pants was chosen hmm just kidding okay so greenpeace actually wasn't that crazy about it because they wanted one of their more thoughtful names to win
so they said no no just kidding we'll give it another week of voting well that got us a little angry so we changed it to fightin splashy
community really and the rest of the internet rather really got behind this facebook groups were getting created facebook applications were getting created the idea was vote your conscience vote for mister splashy pants and people were putting up signs in the real world about this whale
is obvious it's a great name everyone wants to hear their news anchor say mister splashy pants and i think that's what helped drive this but what was cool was
the repercussions now for greenpeace was they created an entire marketing campaign around it they sell mister splashy pants shirts and pins they even created an e card so you could send your friend a dancing splashy
was even more important was the fact that they actually accomplished their mission the japanese government called off their whaling expedition mission accomplished greenpeace was thrilled the whales were happy that's a quote
this wasn't really out of altruism this was just out of interest in doing something cool and this is kind of how the internet works this is that great big secret
and one of the great lessons that greenpeace actually learned was that it's okay to lose control it's okay to take yourself a little less seriously given that even though it's a very serious cause you could ultimately achieve your final goal
and that's the final message that i want to share with all of you that you can do well online but no longer is the message going to be coming from just the top down if you want to succeed you've got to be okay to just lose control thank you
