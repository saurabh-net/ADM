what epidemiology is epidemiology is the science of how we know in the real world if something is good for you or bad for you and it 's best understood through example as the science of those crazy wacky newspaper headlines and these are just some of the examples
cancer so here are some of the things they said cause cancer recently divorce wi fi toiletries and coffee here are some of the things they say prevents cancer crusts red pepper licorice and coffee so already you can see there are contradictions coffee both causes and prevents cancer and as you start to read on you can see that maybe there 's some kind of political valence behind some of this
so for women housework prevents breast cancer but for men shopping could make you impotent
so we know that we need to start unpicking the science behind this and what i hope to show is that
unpicking dodgy claims unpicking the evidence behind dodgy claims isn 't a kind of nasty carping activity it 's socially useful but it 's also an extremely valuable explanatory tool because real science is all about critically appraising the evidence for somebody else 's
so what i 'm going to show you is
in science we don 't care how many letters you have after your name in science we want to know what your reasons are for believing something how do you know that something is good for us or bad for us
every country has somebody like this she is our tv diet guru she has massive five series of prime time television giving out very lavish and
and anybody who 's done school biology remembers that chlorophyll and chloroplasts only make oxygen in sunlight and it 's quite dark in your bowels after you 've eaten spinach
next we need proper science proper evidence so red wine can help prevent breast cancer this is a headline from the daily telegraph in the u k a glass of red wine a day could help prevent breast cancer
so you go and find this paper and what you find is it is a real piece of science it is a description of the changes in one enzyme when you drip a chemical extracted from some red grape skin onto some cancer cells in a dish on a bench in a laboratory somewhere and that 's a really useful thing to describe in a scientific paper
so what we want is studies in real human people and
here 's another example this is from britain 's leading diet and nutritionist in the daily mirror which is our second biggest selling newspaper an australian study in two thousand and one found that olive oil in combination with fruits vegetables and pulses offers measurable protection against skin wrinklings and then they give you advice if you eat olive oil and vegetables you 'll have fewer skin wrinkles and they very helpfully tell you how to go and find the paper
social political and cultural reasons they are less likely to have skin wrinkles that doesn 't mean that it 's the vegetables
and this is the trial of fish oil pills and the claim was fish oil pills improve school performance and behavior in mainstream children and they said we 've done a trial all the previous trials were positive and we know this one 's gonna be too that should always ring alarm bells because if you already know the answer to your trial you shouldn 't be doing one either you 've rigged it by design or you 've got enough data so there 's no need to randomize people anymore
they were taking three thousand children
and then a year later they were going to measure their school exam performance and compare
their school exam performance against what they predicted their exam performance would have been if they hadn 't had the pills
they got older we all develop over time
and of course also there 's the placebo effect
the placebo effect is one of the most fascinating things in the whole of medicine it 's not just about taking a pill and your performance and your pain getting better it 's about our beliefs and expectations it 's about the cultural meaning of a treatment and this has been demonstrated in a whole raft of fascinating studies comparing one kind of
placebo against another so we know for example that two sugar pills a day are a more effective treatment for getting rid of gastric ulcers
we know from three different studies on three different types of pain that a saltwater injection is a more effective treatment for pain
than taking a sugar pill taking a dummy pill that has no medicine in it not because the injection or the pills do anything physically to the body but because an injection feels like a much more dramatic intervention so we know
that our beliefs and expectations can be manipulated which is why we do trials where we control against a placebo where one half of the people get the real treatment and the other half get placebo but that 's not enough
what i 've just shown you are examples of the very simple and straightforward ways that journalists and food supplement pill peddlers and naturopaths can distort evidence for their own purposes what i find really fascinating
is that the pharmaceutical industry uses exactly the same kinds of tricks and devices but slightly more sophisticated versions of them
trials against placebo everybody thinks they know that a trial should be a comparison of your new drug against placebo but actually in a lot of situations that 's wrong because often we already have a very good treatment that is currently available so we don 't want to know that your alternative new treatment is better than nothing we want to know that it 's better than the best currently available treatment that we have
and yet repeatedly you consistently see people doing trials still against placebo and you can get license to bring your drug to market with only data showing that it 's better than nothing which is useless for a doctor like me trying to make a decision
but that 's not the only way you can rig your data you can also rig your data
twenty years ago a new generation of antipsychotic drugs were brought in and the promise was that they would have fewer side effects so people set about doing trials of these new drugs against the old drugs
came off copyright so anybody could make copies everybody wanted to show that their drug was better than risperidone so you see a bunch of trials comparing new antipsychotic drugs against risperidone at eight milligrams a day again not an insane dose not an illegal dose but very much at the high end of normal and so you 're bound to make your new drug look better
and so it 's no surprise that overall industry funded trials are four times more likely to give a positive result than independently sponsored trials
but and it 's a big but
you can use statistics or you can use stories i personally prefer statistics so that 's what i 'm going to do first this is something called funnel plot and a funnel plot is a very clever way of spotting if small negative trials have disappeared have gone missing in action
then as you go further down at the bottom what you can see is over on this side the spurious false negatives and over on this side the spurious false positives
if there is publication bias if small negative trials have gone missing in action you can see it on one of these graphs so you can see here that the small negative trials that should be on the bottom left have disappeared this is a graph demonstrating the presence of publication bias in studies of publication bias and i think that 's the funniest epidemiology joke
that you will ever hear that 's how you can prove it statistically but what about stories well they 're heinous they really are
this is a drug called reboxetine this is a drug that i myself have prescribed to patients and i 'm a very nerdy doctor i hope i try to go out of my way to try and read and understand all the literature i read the trials on this they were all positive they were all well conducted i found no flaw unfortunately it turned out
were withheld from doctors and patients now if you think about it if i tossed a coin a hundred times and i 'm allowed to withhold from you the answers half the times then i can convince you that i have a coin with two heads if we remove half of the data
we can never know what the true effect size of these medicines is and this is not an isolated story around half of all of the trial data on antidepressants has been withheld but it goes way beyond that
the nordic cochrane group were trying to get a hold of the data on that to bring it all together the cochrane groups are an international nonprofit collaboration
that produce systematic reviews of all of the data that has ever been shown and they need to have access to all of the trial data
but the companies withheld that data from them and so did the european medicines agency for three years this is a problem that is currently lacking a solution and to show how big it goes this is a drug called tamiflu which governments around the world have spent billions and billions of dollars on
the infectious diseases cochrane group which are based in italy has been trying to get the full data in a usable form out of the drug companies so that they can make a full decision about whether this drug is effective or not and they 've not been able to get that
information this is undoubtedly the single
biggest ethical problem facing medicine today we cannot make decisions in the absence of all of the information
so it 's a little bit difficult i
i i think that sunlight
i think that sunlight is the best disinfectant
all of these things are happening in plain sight and they 're all protected by a force field of tediousness and i think with all of the problems in science one of the best things that we can do is to lift up the lid finger around in the mechanics and peer in thank you very much
