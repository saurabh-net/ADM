the truth of the matter is otherwise our holy book the koran consists of one hundred and fourteen chapters
the saying of in the name of god the all compassionate the all merciful
or as sir richard burton
not the richard burton who was married to elizabeth taylor
but the sir richard burton who lived a century before that and who was a worldwide traveler and translator of many works of literature translates it in the name of god the compassionating the compassionate
and in a saying of the koran which to muslims is god speaking to humanity
god says to his prophet muhammad whom we believe to be the last of a series of
prophets beginning with adam including noah including moses including abraham including jesus christ and ending with muhammad that we have not sent you o muhammad except as a rahmah except as a source of compassion to humanity
whose mission and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet is to make ourselves as much like the prophet and the prophet in one of his sayings said adorn yourselves with the attributes of god
and because god himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion
in fact the koran says that god decreed upon himself compassion or reigned himself in by compassion therefore our objective and our mission must be to be sources of compassion
activators of compassion actors of compassion and speakers of compassion and doers of compassion that is all well and good
but where do we go wrong and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world for the answer to this we turn to our spiritual path in every religious tradition
there is the outer path
the esoteric path of islam is more popularly known as sufism or tasawwuf in arabic and these doctors or these masters these spiritual masters of the sufi tradition refer to teachings and examples of our prophet
in one of the battles that the prophet waged he told his followers we are returning from the lesser war to the greater war to the greater battle
the sources of human problems have to do with egotism i
the famous sufi master rumi who is very well known to most of you
has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend and he knocks on the door and a voice answers
who 's there it 's me or more grammatically correctly it is i as we might say in english the voice says go away
after many years of training of disciplining of search and struggle he comes back with much greater humility he knocks again on the door
the voice asks who is there he said it is you o heartbreaker the door swings open
and rumi 's stories are metaphors for the spiritual path
in the presence of god there is
no room for more than one
and that is the i of divinity
in a teaching called a hadith qudsi in our tradition god says that my servant or my creature my human creature does not approach me by anything
that is dearer to me than what i have asked them to do
and those of you who are employers know exactly what i mean
you want your employees to do what you ask them to do and if they 've done that then they can do extra but don 't ignore what you 've asked them to do
and god says my servant continues to get nearer to me by doing more of what i 've asked them to do extra credit we might call it until i love him or love her and when i love
my servant god says i become the eyes by which he or she sees
the ears by which he or she walks and the heart
by which he or she understands it is this merging
muslims regard jesus as the master of sufism
when he says i am the spirit and i am the way and when the prophet muhammad said whoever has seen me has seen god
it is because they became so much an instrument
of god they became part of god 's team so that god 's will was manifest through them and they were not acting from their own selves and their own
all we have to do is to get our egos out of the way get our egotism out of the way
i 'm sure probably all of you here or certainly the very vast majority of you have had what you might call a spiritual experience a moment in your lives when for a few seconds a minute perhaps
and at that minute you felt at one with the universe one
and instead like the person in rumi 's story we say oh this is all you this is all you
and this is all us
o creator o the objective the source of our being and the end of our journey
you are also the breaker of our hearts
you are the one whom we should all be towards for whose purpose we live and for whose purpose we shall die and for whose purpose we shall be resurrected again to account
for the koran always urges us
to remember to remind each other because the knowledge of truth
is within every human being
we know it all we have access to it all jung may have called it the subconscious
state of sleep the lesser death
and we see wonderful things we travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it and beyond the limitations of time as we know it
the name of the creator
whose primary name is the compassionating the compassionate
through which you name or access the presence of divinity
and absolute knowledge and wisdom what hindus call satchidananda the language differs
but the objective is the same
reality in different languages there 's only one absolute reality by definition
one absolute being by definition because absolute is by definition single and absolute and singular
and these should also be the primary attributes of what it means to be human
for what defines humanity perhaps biologically is our physiology
but god defines humanity by our spirituality
prostrate not before the human body
but before the human soul why because the soul the human soul embodies a piece of the divine breath
a piece of the divine soul
this is also expressed in biblical vocabulary when we are taught that we were
created in the divine image
what is the imagery of god
the imagery of god is absolute being absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom and absolute compassion
and love and therefore for us to be human
in the greatest sense of what it means to be human in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human means that we too
have to be proper stewards
of the breath of divinity within us
and seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being
the attribute of wisdom of consciousness of awareness
and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings this
is what i understand from my faith tradition
and this is what i understand from my studies of other faith
and this is the common platform
on which we must all stand and when we stand on this platform as such i am convinced
that we can make a wonderful world and i believe personally that we 're on the verge
and that with the presence and help of people like you here we can bring about the prophecy of isaiah
for he foretold of a period when their swords into plowshares
and will not learn war or make war anymore
we have reached a stage in human history that we have no option
control our egos whether it is individual ego personal ego family ego national ego
and let all be for the glorification of the one
