from mother to daughter preacher to congregant teacher to pupil storyteller to audience whether in cave paintings or the latest uses of the internet human beings have always told their histories and truths through parable and fable we are inveterate storytellers and what narrative
and what narrative what history what identity
what moral code are we imparting to our young
cinema is arguably the twentieth century 's most influential art form its artists told stories across national boundaries in as many languages genres and philosophies as one can imagine indeed it is hard to find a subject that film has yet to tackle
during the last decade we 've seen a vast integration of global media now dominated by a culture of the hollywood blockbuster
we are increasingly offered a diet in which sensation not story is king
as a filmmaker it worried me
of where they 've come from and so few narratives of what 's possible
technical access has never been greater cultural
given the access to technology
even a school in a tiny rural hamlet
could project a dvd onto a white
in the first nine months we ran twenty five clubs across the u k with kids in age groups between five and eighteen watching a film uninterrupted for ninety minutes the outcome immediate
it was an education of the most profound and transformative kind
we had the names of a thousand schools that wished to join
technology then meant we had to hire a viewing cinema find and pay for the print and the projectionist but for my father
was so great that he chose to celebrate his half century with his three teenage children and thirty of their friends in order he said
to pass the baton of concern and hope on to the next generation
sixty years after the film was made and thirty years after i first saw it i see young faces tilt up in awe their incredulity matching mine and the speed with which they associate it with slumdog millionaire or the favelas in rio speaks to the enduring nature
in a filmclub season about democracy and government we screened mr smith goes to washington made in one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine the film is older than most of our members grandparents
shortly after mr smith became a filmclub classic there was a week of all night filibustering in the house of lords and it was with great delight that we found young people up and down the country explaining with authority
in choosing hotel rwanda they explored genocide of the most brutal kind
it provoked tears as well as incisive questions about unarmed peace keeping forces and the double dealing of a western society that picks its moral fights with commodities in mind and when schindler 's list demanded that they never forget one child full of the pain of consciousness
otherwise how did hotel rwanda happen
as they watch more films their lives got palpably richer pickpocket started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement
to sir with love ignited its teen audience they celebrated a change in attitude towards non white britons but railed against our restless school system that does not value collective identity unlike
by now these thoughtful opinionated curious young people thought nothing of tackling films of all forms black and white subtitled documentary non narrative fantasy
from twenty five clubs we became hundreds then thousands until we were nearly a quarter of a million kids in seven thousand clubs right across the country
and although the numbers were and continue to be extraordinary what became more extraordinary was how the experience of critical and curious questioning translated into life
some of our kids started talking with their parents others with their teachers or with their friends and those without friends
and jaws became the way in which one young boy was able to articulate the fear he 'd experienced in flight from violence that killed first his father then his mother the latter thrown overboard on a boat journey
they began to see themselves
i was past forty when my father died
he never mentioned that journey my mother 's mother
left europe in a hurry without her husband but with her three year old daughter
after two years in hiding
my grandfather appeared in london he was never right again
and his story was hushed
i had anne frank the great escape shoah triumph of the will
and they became more useful to me
purists may feel that fiction dissipates the quest of real human understanding that film is too crude to tell a complex and detailed history or that filmmakers always serve drama over truth
as one twelve year old said after watching wizard of oz every person should watch this because unless you do you may not know that you too have a heart
we honor reading why not honor watching with the same passion consider citizen kane as valuable as jane austen agree that boyz n the hood like tennyson offers an emotional landscape and a heightened understanding that work together each a piece of memorable art
each a brick in the wall of who we are
and no less helpful to understanding our life and times as shakespeare is in illuminating the world of elizabethan england
what we could not have foreseen was the measurable improvements in behavior confidence and academic achievement once reluctant students now race to school talk to their teachers fight not on the playground but to choose next week 's film
young people who have found self definition
our members defy the binary description of how we so often describe our young
they are like other young people negotiating a world with infinite choice but little culture of how to find meaningful experience
we appeared surprised at the behaviors of those who define themselves by the size of the tick on their shoes yet acquisition has been the narrative we have offered
if we want different values we have to tell a different story
a story that understands that an individual narrative is an essential component of a person 's identity that a collective narrative is an essential component of a cultural identity and without it
it is impossible to imagine yourself as part of a group because when these people
get home after a screening of rear window and raise their gaze to the building next door they have the tools to wonder
