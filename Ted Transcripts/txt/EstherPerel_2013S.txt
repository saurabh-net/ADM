so why does good sex so often fade even for couples who continue to love each other as much as ever
and why does good intimacy not guarantee good sex contrary to popular belief
and why is the forbidden so erotic what is it about transgression that makes desire so potent
and why does sex make babies and babies spell erotic disaster in couples
and its concomitant dilemmas in modern love so i travel the globe and what i 'm noticing is that everywhere where romanticism has entered there seems to be a crisis of desire
a crisis of desire as in owning the wanting desire as an expression of our individuality of our free choice of our preferences of our identity
not because we want fourteen children for which we need to have even more because many of them won 't make it
and not because it is exclusively a woman 's marital duty this is the first time that we want sex over time about pleasure and connection that is rooted in desire so what sustains desire and why is it so difficult
and at the heart of sustaining desire in a committed relationship i think is the reconciliation of two fundamental human needs on the one hand our need for security for predictability for safety for dependability
for reliability for permanence all these anchoring grounding experiences of our lives that we call home
but we also have an equally strong
for journey for travel so reconciling our need for security and our need for adventure into one relationship or what we today like to call a passionate marriage used to be a contradiction in terms
marriage was an economic institution
in which you were given a partnership for life in terms of children and social status and succession
so if there is a verb for me that comes with love it 's to have
we tend to not really want to go back to the places we 've already gone forgone conclusion does not keep our interest in desire we want an other somebody on the other side that we can go visit
that we can go spend some time with that we can go see what goes on in their red light district in desire we want a bridge to cross or in other words i sometimes say fire needs air
desire needs space and when it 's said like that it 's often quite abstract but then i took a question with me and i 've gone to more than twenty countries in the last few years with mating in captivity and i asked people when do you find yourself most drawn to your partner not attracted sexually per se but most drawn
when we are apart when we reunite
basically when i get back in touch with my ability to imagine myself with my partner when my imagination comes back in the picture
and when i can root it in absence and in longing which is a major component of desire but then the second group is even more interesting
i am most drawn to my partner when i see him in the studio when she is onstage when he is in his element when she 's doing something she 's passionate about when i see him at a party and other people are really drawn to him when i see her hold court
basically when i look at my partner radiant and confident probably the biggest turn on across the board
but it 's also not when the other person is that far apart that you no longer see them it 's when i 'm looking at my partner from a comfortable distance where this person that is already so familiar so known is momentarily once again somewhat mysterious somewhat elusive
and in this space between me and the other lies the erotic elan lies that movement toward the other because sometimes as proust says mystery is not about traveling to new places but it 's about looking with new eyes and so when i see my partner on his own or her own
doing something in which they are enveloped
i look at this person and i momentarily get a shift in perception and i stay open to the mysteries that are living right next to me and then more importantly in this description about the other
or myself it 's the same what is most interesting is that there is no neediness in desire nobody needs anybody there is no caretaking in desire
caretaking is mightily loving it 's a powerful anti aphrodisiac i have yet to see somebody who is so turned on by somebody who needs them wanting them is one thing needing them is a shutdown and women have known that forever because anything that will bring up parenthood will usually decrease the erotic charge
for good reasons right and then the third group of answers usually would be when
i 'm surprised when we laugh together as somebody said to me in the office today when he 's in his tux so i said you know it 's either the tux or the cowboy boots
novelty is what parts of you do you bring out what parts of you are just being seen because in some way one could say sex isn 't something you do eh sex is a place you go it 's a space you enter
inside yourself and with another or others so where do you go in sex what parts of you do you connect to
have to take responsibility for everything is it a place where you can express your infantile wishes what comes out there it 's a language it isn 't just a behavior
and it 's the poetic of that language that i 'm interested in which is why i began to explore this concept of erotic intelligence
you know animals have sex it 's the pivot it 's biology it 's the natural instinct we are the only ones who have an erotic life which means that it 's sexuality transformed by the human imagination
we are the only ones who can make love for hours have a blissful time multiple orgasms and touch nobody just because we can imagine it
we can hint at it we don 't even have to do it we can experience that powerful thing called anticipation which is a mortar to desire the ability to imagine it as if it 's happening to experience it as if it 's happening while nothing is happening and everything is happening at the same time
so when i began to think about eroticism i began to think about the poetics of sex and if i look at it as an intelligence then it 's something that you cultivate what are the ingredients imagination playfulness novelty curiosity mystery
and i went through it through a bifurcation by looking actually at trauma
which is the other side and i looked at it looking at the community that i had grown up in which was a community in belgium all holocaust survivors and in my community there were two groups those who didn 't die and those who came back to life
and when i began to listen to the sexlessness of the couples that i work with i sometimes would hear people say i want more sex but generally people want better sex and better is to reconnect with that quality of aliveness of vibrancy of renewal of vitality
of eros of energy that sex used to afford them or that they 've hoped it would afford them
and so i began to ask a different question
i shut myself off when began to be the question i turn off my desires when which is not the same question as what turns me of is and you turn me off when
and people began to say i turn myself off when i feel dead inside when i don 't like my body when i feel old when i haven 't had time for myself when i haven 't had a chance to even check in with you when i don 't perform well at work when i feel low self esteem when i don 't have a sense of self worth when i don 't feel
you know now if you are dead inside the other person can do a lot of things for valentine 's it won 't make a dent there is nobody at the reception desk laughter so i turn myself on when i turn my desires i wake up when
mutuality reciprocity protection worry responsibility for the other are sometimes the very ingredients that stifle desire
favorites of love jealousy possessiveness aggression power dominance naughtiness mischief basically most of us will get turned on at night by the very same things that we will demonstrate against during the day
you know the erotic mind is not very politically correct if everybody was fantasizing on a bed of roses we wouldn 't be having such interesting talks about this but no in our mind up there are a host of things going on that we don 't always know how to bring to the person that we love because
we think love comes with selflessness and in fact desire comes with a certain amount of selfishness in the best sense of the word
the ability to stay connected to one 's self in the presence of another so i want to draw that little image for you because this need to reconcile these two sets of needs
we are born with that our need for connection our need for separateness or our need for security and adventure or our need for togetherness and for autonomy
and if you think about the little kid who sits on your lap and who is cozily nested here and very secure and comfortable and at some point all of us need to go out into the
came back a long time ago and that little child who comes back is the child who will forgo a part of himself in order not to lose the other
i will lose my freedom in order not to lose connection and i will learn to love in a certain way that will become burdened with extra worry and extra responsibility and extra protection and i won 't know how to leave you
in order to go play in order to go experience pleasure in order to discover to enter inside myself translate this into adult language it starts very young it continues into our sex lives
the growing intimacy wasn 't yet so strong that it actually led to the decrease of desire the more connected i became the more responsible i felt the less i was able to let go in your presence the third child doesn 't really come back
so what happens if you want to sustain desire it 's that real dialectic piece on the one hand you want the security
so in this dilemma about reconciling these two sets of fundamental needs
there are a few things that i 've come to understand erotic couples do one they have a lot of sexual privacy they understand that there is an erotic space that belongs to each of them they also understand
that foreplay is not something you do five minutes before the real thing foreplay pretty much starts at the end of the previous orgasm they also understand
