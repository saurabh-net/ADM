then i just love it and i 'll cut some wood and drill some holes and watch the water and maybe i 'll have to walk around and look for washers you have no idea how much time i spend
this is the double raindrop
of all my sculptures it 's the most talkative
it adds together the interference pattern from two raindrops that land near each other instead of expanding circles they 're expanding hexagons
all the sculptures move by mechanical means
a single drop of rain increasing amplitude
the mechanism that drives it has nine motors and about three thousand pulleys
four hundred and forty five strings in a three dimensional weave
transferred to a larger scale
actually a lot larger with a lot of help
fourteen thousand and sixty four bicycle reflectors a twenty day install
connected is a collaboration with choreographer gideon obarzanek strings attached to dancers
this is very early rehearsal footage but the finished work 's on tour and is actually coming through l a in a couple weeks
take your finger and draw this line summer fall
summer fall winter spring
did you know that 's a continuous sheet of cloud that 's dipping in and out of the condensation layer
what if every seemingly isolated object was actually just where the continuous wave of that object poked through into our world
and you might say surely rueben if you took even just the slightest step back the cycles of
hunger and eating waking and sleeping laughing and crying would emerge as pattern
but i would say if i did that
too much would be lost
this tension between the need to look deeper
and the beauty and immediacy of the world where if you even try to look deeper you 've already missed what you 're looking for
this tension is what makes the sculptures move and for me the path between these two extremes
takes the shape of a wave
and does it ever change do you think you 're designing one thing and then when it 's produced it looks like something else
i actually hated it the very moment i turned it on i hated it it was like a really deep down gut reaction and i wanted to throw it out
and i happened to have a friend who was over and he said why don 't you just wait
and i waited and the next day i liked it a bit better the next day i liked it a bit better and now i really love it and so i guess one the gut reactions a little bit wrong sometimes and two it does not look like as expected
