about the african wilderness and protecting the african wilderness and so what we've done is we've focused on
and i know in the light of one would
today we're here to share with you a message that we have learned from a very important and special character this
well our lives have basically been like a super long episode of csi something like twenty eight years
the same tree that we found her mother in and her grandmother and she took us on a journey and revealed something very special to us
eight days old and the minute we found this leopard we realized that we needed to move in and so we basically stayed with this leopard for the next four
getting to know her that individual personality of hers and really coming to know her now i'm destined to spend a lot of time with some unique
very very special individualistic and often seductive female characters
clearly one of them and
this little leopard legadema is another and she changed our lives
well we certainly did spend a lot of time with her in fact more time than even her mother did when her mother would go off hunting we would stay and film and early on
a lightning bolt hit a tree twenty paces away from us it was frightening and it showered us with leaves and a pungent smell and of course we were standing for
well we needn't have worried she came charging out of the thicket straight towards us sat next to us shivering
with her back towards dereck and looking out and actually from that day on she's been comfortable with us
so we felt that that day was the day that she really earned her name we called
which means light from the sky
now we've found these individualisms in all sorts of animals in particular in the cats this particular one is called eetwidomayloh he who greets with fire
and you can just see that about him you know that's his character but only by getting up close to these animals and spending time with them can we actually even reach out and dig out these personal characters that
but through our investigation we have to seek the wildest places in africa and right now this is in the okavango delta in botswana
yes it is swamp we live in the swamp in a tent but i must tell you everyday is exhilarating but also our hearts are in
now one of the big things of course everybody knows that cats hate water and so this was a real revelation for us and we could only find this by pushing ourselves by going where no sane person should go
around we don't always get
we seriously underestimated the depth we got deeper and deeper until it
we drowned our pride i must tell you which was really serious and we seized the
and of course one of the rules that we have in the vehicle is that he who drowns the vehicle gets to swim with the crocodiles
notice also that all of these images here are taken from the top angle by beverly the dry top angle
all the places we get stuck in really have great views and it wasn't a moment and these lions came back towards us and beverly was able to get a great
but we truly do spend day and night trying to capture unique footage and twenty years ago we did a film called eternal enemies
it was amazing because you can see that this lion is doing exactly what his name eetwidomayloh represents he 's focused on this hyena and he is going to get it
but that 's i think what this is all about is that these individuals have these personalities and characters but for us to get them not only do we push ourselves but we live by certain rules of engagement which mean we can't interfere
so as dereck says we have to work through extremes extreme temperatures push ourselves at night sleep deprivation
on the edge through a large part of the time for ten years we tried to
that it was a disturbing night for me
i had tears rolling down my cheeks i was shaking with anxiety
but i knew that to capture something that had never been seen before had never been documented and i do believe you should stay with us
the amazing thing about these moments and this is probably a highlight of our career is that you never know how it's going to end
many people believe in fact that death begins in the eyes not in the heart not in the lungs and that's when people give up hope or when any life form gives up
and you can see the start of it here this elephant against overwhelming odds simply gives up
but by the same token
so just when you think it's all over something else happens some spark gets into
some sort of will to fight that iron will that we all have that this elephant has that conservation has that big cats have everything has that will
to survive to fight to push through that mental barrier and to keep going
and for us in many ways this elephant has become a symbol of inspiration for us a symbol of that hope as we go forward in our
this is about couples working together and so i do need to say that within the vehicle we have quite strict territories beverly and
but when this little cub saw that i had vacated my seat and climbed to the back to get some camera gear she came in like a curious cat to come and
it was phenomenal and we felt grateful that she trusted us to that extent but at the same time we were concerned
that if she created this as a habit and jumped into somebody else's car it might not turn out the same way she might get shot for that
so we knew we had to react quickly and the only way we thought we could without scaring her
were excited i was like watching a graduation ceremony we felt like we were surrogate parents and of course we knew now that she was going to survive
but only when we saw the tiny baby baboon clinging to the mother 's fur did we realize that something very unique was taking place here with
the next couple of hours was very unique
it was absolutely amazing when she picked it up to safety protecting it from the hyena
over the next five hours she took care of it
we realized that we actually don't know everything and that
so she was a little bit but in fact
what we were seeing here was interesting because she is a
wanting to play but she was also a predator needing to kill and yet conflicted in some way because she was also an emerging mother she had this maternal instinct
and of course through the night they lay together they ended up sleeping for hours but i have to tell you everybody always asks what happened to the baby baboon
die and we suspect it was from the freezing
so at this stage i guess we had very very firm ideas on what conservation meant we had to deal with these individual personalities we had to deal with them with respect and celebrate them
and so we with the national geographic formed the big cats initiative to march forward into conservation taking care of the big cats that we loved
and then had an opportunity to look back over the last fifty years to see how well we had all collectively been doing so when beverly and i were born there were four hundred and fifty thousand lions and today there are twenty
and then cheetahs have crashed all the way down to twelve thousand leopards have plummeted from seven hundred thousand down to
fifty thousand now in the extraordinary time that we have worked with legadema which is really over a five year period
ten thousand leopards were legally shot by safari hunters and that's not the only leopards that were being killed through that period
an immense amount of poaching as well and so possibly the same amount it's simply not sustainable we admire them and we fear them
we want to steal their power
it used to be the time where only kings wore a leopard skin but now throughout rituals and ceremonies traditional healers and ministers and of course looking at
that has been skinned it eerily reminds me of a human hand and that's ironic because their fate is in our hands
a burgeoning bone trade south africa just released some lion bones onto the market lion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same and so in
the lion bone industry is going to wipe out all the tigers so we have a real problem here no more so than the lions
the male lions so the twenty thousand lion figure you just saw is actually a red herring because there may be three or four thousand male lions and they all are actually infected with the same disease
because there's a sport there's an activity going on that we're all aware of that we
and you have to know that when a male lion is
into the area and takes over the pride and of course first of all kills all the cubs and possibly some of the females that
so we've estimated that between twenty to thirty lions are killed when one lion is hanging on a wall somewhere in a far off place
so what our investigations have shown is that these lions are essential they're essential to the habitat it they disappear whole ecosystems in africa disappear
an eighty billion dollar a year eco tourism revenue stream into africa so this is not just a concern about lions it's a concern about communities in africa as well
if they disappear all of that goes away but what i'm more concerned about in many ways is that as we de link ourselves from nature as we de link ourselves spiritually from these animals we
so you have to know looking into the eyes of
and leopards right now it is all about critical awareness and so what we are doing in february we're bringing out a film called the last
and the last lion is exactly what is happening right now that is the situation we're in the last
that is if we don't take action and do something these plains will be completely devoid of big cats and then in turn everything else will disappear and simply if we can't protect them we're going to have a job protecting ourselves as well
and in fact that original thing that we spoke about and designed our lives by that conservation was all about respect and celebration
is probably true that's really what it needs we need it we respect and celebrate each other as a man and a woman as a community and as part of this planet
