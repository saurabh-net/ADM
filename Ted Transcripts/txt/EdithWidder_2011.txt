i want to take you on a trip to an alien world
and it 's not a trip that requires
light years of travel but it 's to a place where it 's defined by light
so it 's a little appreciated
that most of the animals in our ocean make light
i 've spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence
i study it because i think understanding it is critical to understanding life in the ocean where most bioluminescence occurs i also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution
but mostly i 'm entranced by it since my my first dive in a deep diving submersible when i went down and turned out the lights and saw the fireworks displays i 've been a bioluminescence junky but i would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words
and they were totally inadequate to the task
i needed some way to share the experience directly and the first time i figured out that way was in this little single person submersible called deep rover
this next video clip you 're going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence
and the first thing you 're going to see is a transect screen that is about a meter across
if we could have the lights down and have it as dark in here as possible so
that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate a single celled alga so why would a single celled alga need to be able to produce light
it 's what 's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and just like the alarm on your car or your house it 's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder thereby either leading to his capture or scaring him away attention it 's phenomenal
there 's other ways you can defend yourself with light for example this shrimp
releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud this blinds or distracts the predator
this little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this
now it may look like a tasty morsel
or a pig 's head with wings
so there 's a lot of animals in the open ocean most of them that make light and we have a pretty good idea for most of them why they use it for finding food for attracting mates for defending against predators but when you get down to the bottom of the ocean that 's where things get really strange and some of these animals
so if you brush up against it any place you brushed against it you get this twinkling blue green light that 's just breathtaking and you see things like this this looks like something out of a dr seuss book just all manner of creatures all over this thing
and these are flytrap anemones now if you poke it it pulls in its tentacles but if you keep poking it it starts to produce light and it actually ends up looking like a galaxy
it produces these strings of light presumably as some form of defense
there are starfish that can make light and there are brittle stars that produce bands of light that dance along their arms
so it can actually hold itself in very strong currents as you see here but if we collect it very gently and we bring it up into the lab and just squeeze it at the base of the stock it produces this light that propagates from stem to the plume changing color as it goes from
so i just want to show you some of the responses we 've elicited from animals in the deep sea so the camera 's black and white it 's not high resolution and what you 're seeing
here is a bait box with a bunch of like the cockroaches of the ocean there are isopods all over it and right in the front is the electronic jellyfish and when it starts flashing it 's just going to be one of the leds that 's flashing very fast
but as soon as it starts to flash and it 's going to look big because it blooms on the camera i want you to look right here there 's something small there that responds
we 're talking to something it looks like a little of string pearls basically in fact three strings of pearls
and then finally i want to show you some responses that we recorded with the world 's first deep sea webcam which we had installed in monterey canyon last year we 've only just begun to analyze all of this data this is going to be a glowing source first
which is like bioluminescent bacteria and it is an optical cue that there 's carrion on the bottom of the ocean so this scavenger comes in
which is a giant sixgill shark and i can 't claim for sure that the optical source brought it in because there 's bait right there but if it had been following the odor plume it would have come in from the other direction and it does actually seem to be trying to eat
and this is a burglar alarm
hey wait a minute there 's supposed to be something else there
and then he goes away for a few seconds to think about it some more and thinks maybe if i come in from a different angle
more than ninety percent ninety nine percent of the living space on our planet is ocean
it 's a magical place
filled with breathtaking light shows and wondrous creatures
alien life forms that you don 't have to travel to another planet to see
but if you do take the plunge
please remember to turn out the lights but i warn you
