all of us have been interested in at one time or another in the romantic mysteries of all those societies that collapsed
such as the classic maya and the yucatan the easter islanders the anasazi fertile crescent society angor wat great zimbabwe and so on
and within the last decade or two archaeologists have shown us that there were environmental problems underlying many of these past collapses
so evidently societies in some areas are more fragile than in other areas how can we understand what makes some societies more fragile than other societies
the problem is obviously one relevant to our situation today because today as well there are some societies that have already collapsed such as somalia and rwanda and the former yugoslavia
there are also societies today that may be close to collapse such as nepal indonesia and columbia what about ourselves what is
we can learn from the past that would help us avoid declining or collapsing in the way that so many
you know right away that they're an idiot this is a complex subject but how can we make sense out of the complexities of this subject
in analyzing societal collapses i've arrived at a five point framework a checklist of things that i go through and try to understand
well in my five point framework the first item on the framework is to look for human impacts on the environment
and deforestation which was a particular problem for them because they required forests to make charcoal to make iron so they ended up an iron age european society virtually unable to make their own
a second item on my checklist is climate change climate can get warmer or colder or dryer or wetter
but a cold climate isn't necessarily fatal because the inuit the eskimos inhabiting greenland at the same time did better rather than worse with cold climates so why didn't the greenland norse as well
the third thing on my checklist is relations with neighboring friendly societies that may prop up a society and if that friendly support is pulled away that may make a society more likely to collapse
norway the fourth item on my checklist is relations with hostile societies
in the case of norse greenland the hostiles were the inuit the eskimos sharing greenland with whom the norse got off to bad relationships
then finally the fifth item on my checklist is the political economic social and cultural factors in the society that make it more or less likely that the society will perceive and solve its environmental problems
in the case of the greenland norse cultural factors that made it difficult for them to solve their problems were their commitments to a christian society investing heavily in cathedrals
being a competitive ranked chiefly society and their scorn for the inuit from whom they refused to learn so that's how the five part framework
five years i've been taking my wife and kids to southwestern montana where i worked as a teenager on the hay harvest and montana
at first sight seems like the most pristine environment in the united states but scratch the surface and montana suffers from serious problems
have caused damage of billions of dollars problems from weeds weed control caused montana nearly two hundred million dollars a year
second item on my checklist climate change yes the climate in montana is getting warmer and drier but montana agriculture depends especially on irrigation from the snow pack
and as the snow is melting for example as the glaciers in glacier national park are disappearing that's bad news for montana irrigation agriculture
third thing on my checklist relations with friendlies that can sustain the society in montana today more than half of the income of montana
is not earned within montana but it's derived from out of state transfer payments from social security investments and so on
last item on my checklist question of how political economic social cultural attitudes play into this montanans have long held values
which today seem to be getting in the way of their solving their own problems long held devotion to logging and to
and for many present societies are there any general conclusions that arise in a way just like tolstoy 's statement about every unhappy marriage being different
that emerge from these comparisons of past societies that did or did not collapse and threatened societies today
one interesting common thread has to do with in many cases the rapidity of collapse after a society reaches its peak
there are many societies that don't wind down gradually but they build up get richer and more powerful and then within a short time within a few decades after their peak they collapse for example the
began to collapse in the early eighties literally a few decades after the maya were building their biggest monuments and maya population was greatest
or again the collapse of the soviet union took place within a couple of decades maybe within a decade of the time when the soviet union was at its greatest power an analogue would be the growth of bacteria in a petri dish
these rapid collapses are especially likely where there's a mismatch between available resources and resource consumption or a mismatch between economic outlays and economic potential in a petri dish bacteria grow
say they double every generation and five generations before the end the petri dish is fifteen sixteen ths empty and then the next generation 's three four ths empty and the next generation half empty
within one generation after the petri dish still being half empty it is full there's no more food and the bacteria have collapsed
so this is a frequent theme that societies collapse very soon after reaching their peak in power what it means to put it mathematically is that if you're concerned about a society today
you should be looking not at the value of the mathematical function the wealth itself but you should be looking at the first derivative and the second derivatives
of the function that's one general theme a second general theme is that there are many
often subtle environmental factors that make some societies more fragile than others and many of those factors are not well understood for example
why is it that in the pacific of those hundreds of pacific islands why did easter island end up as the most devastating case of complete deforestation
it turns out that there were about nine different environmental factors some rather subtle ones that were working against the easter islanders and they involve fallout of volcanic tephra latitude
so some societies for subtle environmental reasons are more fragile than others and then finally another generalization because i'm now teaching a
how could the easter islanders have deforested their environment what did they say when they were cutting down the last palm tree didn't they see what they were doing how could societies not perceive
people will be asking why on earth did these people today in the year two thousand and three not see the obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action
it seems incredible in the past in the future it'll seem incredible what we are doing today and so i've been trying to develop a
set of considerations about why societies fail to solve their problems why they fail to perceive the problems or if they perceive them why they fail to tackle them or if they fail to tackle them why do they fail to succeed in solving them
just mention two generalizations in this area one blueprint for trouble making collapse likely is where there is a conflict of interest between the short term interest of the decision making elites
and the long term interest of the society as a whole especially if the elites are able to insulate themselves from the consequences of their actions
for example among the greenland norse a competitive rank society what the chiefs really wanted is more followers and more sheep and more resources to outcompete the neighboring chiefs
and that led the chiefs to do what's called flogging the land overstocking the land forcing tenant farmers into dependency
and that made the chiefs powerful in the short run but led to the society 's collapse in the
those same issues of conflicts of interest are acute in the united states today especially because the decision makers in the united states
other businesses they are quite correct that these things are good for them in the short term although bad for society in the long term so that's one general conclusion about why societies make bad
when there is a conflict involving strongly held values
good in many circumstances but are poor in other circumstances for example the greenland norse in this difficult environment were held together for four and a half centuries by
shared commitment to religion and by their strong social cohesion but those two things commitment to religion and strong social cohesion
also made it difficult for them to change at the end and to learn from the inuit or today australia one of the things that enabled australia to survive in this remote outpost of european civilization
to change course when then the things that get you in trouble are the things that are also the source of your strength what's going to be the outcome today well all of us
the dozen sorts of ticking time bombs going on in the modern world time bombs that
have fuses of a few decades to all of them not more than fifty years and any one of which can do us in
the time bombs of water of soil of climate change invasive species the photosynthetic ceiling population problems toxics et cetera et cetera list about twelve
and while these time bombs none of them has a fuse beyond fifty years and most of them have fuses of a few decades some of them in some places have much shorter fuses
at the rate at which we're going now the philippines will lose all its accessible loggable forest within five years
things any one of which could do us in and we've got to get them all right because if we solve eleven we fail to solve the twelfth we're in
the fact is that our present course is a non sustainable course which means by definition that it can not be
and the outcome is going to get resolved within a few decades
that means that those of us in this room who are less than fifty or sixty years old will see how these paradoxes are resolved and those of us who are over the age of sixty may not see the resolution but our children and grandchildren certainly will
the resolution is going to achieve either of two forms either we will resolve these non sustainable time fuses in pleasant ways of our own choice by taking remedial action
or else these conflicts are going to get settled in unpleasant ways not of our choice namely by war disease or starvation but what's for sure is that our non sustainable course
will get resolved in one way or another in a few decades in other words since the theme of this session is choices we have a choice
does that mean that we should get pessimistic and overwhelmed i draw the reverse conclusion the big problems facing the world today are not at all
things beyond our control our biggest threat is not an asteroid about to crash into us something we can do nothing about
all the major threats facing us today are problems entirely of our own making and since we made the problems we can also solve the problems
then means that it's entirely in our power to deal with these problems in particular what can all of us do for those of you who are interested in these choices there are lots of things you can do there's a lot that we don't
and that we need to understand and there's a lot that we already do understand but aren't doing and that we need to be doing thank you
