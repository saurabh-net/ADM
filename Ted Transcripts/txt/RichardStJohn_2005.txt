and in the seat next to me was a
high school student a teenager and she came from a really poor family and she wanted to make something of her life and she asked me a simple little question she said what leads to success
and i felt really badly because i couldn 't give her a good answer
so i get off the plane and i come to ted and i think jeez i 'm in the middle of a room of successful people so why don 't i ask them what helped them succeed and pass it on to kids
so here we are seven years five hundred interviews later and i 'm gonna tell you what really leads to success
and makes ted sters tick and the first thing is passion
freeman thomas says i 'm driven by my passion ted sters do it for love they don 't do it for money carol coletta says i would pay someone to do what i do and the interesting thing is if you do it for love the money comes anyway
work rupert murdoch said to me it 's all hard work nothing comes easily but i have a lot of fun did he say fun rupert yes
ted sters do have fun working and they work hard i figured they 're not workaholics they 're workafrolics
goldie hawn says i always had self doubts i wasn 't good enough i wasn 't smart enough i didn 't think i 'd make it
now it 's not always easy to push yourself and that 's why they invented mothers
now a lot of kids tell me they want to be millionaires and the first thing i say to them is ok well you can 't serve yourself you gotta serve others something of value because that 's the way people really get rich
ideas ted ster bill gates says i had an idea founding the first micro computer software company i 'd say it was a pretty good idea
and there 's no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas it 's just doing some very simple things and i give lots of evidence persist
joe kraus says persistence is the number one reason for our success
you gotta persist through failure you gotta persist through crap which of course means criticism rejection assholes and pressure
pay four thousand bucks and come to ted
