it's very very difficult to wrap up to speak at the end of a conference like this
of some of the things that have gone on here and then maybe offer some ideas which we can take away and take forward and work on
that's what i'd like to try and do we came here saying we want to talk about africa the next chapter
but we are talking about africa the next chapter because we are looking at the old and the present chapter that we're looking at and saying it's not such a good thing
the picture i showed you before and this picture of drought death and disease is what we usually see
what we want to look at is africa the next chapter and that's this a healthy smiling beautiful african
and i think it's worth remembering what we've heard through the conference right from the first day where i heard that all the important statistics have been given
about where we are now about how the continent is doing much better and the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on so i'm not going to spend too much time just to
show you refresh your memories that we are here for africa the next chapter because for the first time
there really is a platform to build on we really do have it going right that the continent is growing at rates that people had thought would not happen after
two percent we are now at five percent and it's going to projected six and seven percent even and inflation has come down
twelve or thirteen billion now this is a huge achievement you know we've built up reserves why is that important it's because it shows off our economies shows off our currencies and gives a platform on which
in two thousand and five remittances i just took one country nigeria you know skyrocketing skyrocketing is too dramatic but increasing dramatically
and in many other countries this is happening why is this important because it shows confidence that people are now confident to bring if your people in the diaspora
now why is all this important to have to go really fast it's important that we build this platform that we have the president kikwete and others
of our leaders who are saying look we must do something different because we are confronted with a challenge sixty two percent of our population is below the age of
twenty four what does this mean this means that we have to
on how our youth are going to be engaged in productive endeavor in their lives you have to focus on how to create jobs make sure they don't fall into disease that they get an education but
most of all that they are productively engaged in life and that they are creating the kind of productive environment in our countries that will make things happen
and you know to support this i just recently one of the things i've done since leaving government is to start an opinion research organization in nigeria most of our countries don't even have any opinion research people don't have voice
there is no way you can know what people want one of the things we asked them recently was what's their top issue like in every other country where this has been done jobs
is the top issue i want to leave this up here and come back to it but before i get to this slide
i just wanted to run you through this and to say that for me the next stage of building this platform that now enables us to move
to build this including all those things that we tried to do in nigeria that dele referred to creating our own program to solve problems
like fighting corruption building institutions stabilizing the micro economy so now we have this platform we can build on and it brings us to the
versus private sector aid versus trade etcetera and someone stood up to say
one of the frustrating things is that it's been a simplistic debate
and that's not what the debate should be about we are that's engaging in the wrong debate the issue here is how do we get a partnership that involves government donors
the private sector and ordinary african people taking charge of their own lives how do we combine all this
to move our continent forward to do the things that need doing that i talked about getting young people employed getting the creative juices flowing on this continent much of what
you have seen here so i'm afraid you've been engaging a little bit in the wrong debate we need to bring you back to say what is the combination of all these factors that is going to yield what we want
want to tell you something for me the issue about aid i don't think that africans need to now go
all the way over to the other side and feel bad about aid africa has been giving the other countries aid mo ibrahim said at a debate where
he dreams one day when africa will be giving aid and i said mo you're right
we have no but we've already been doing it the uk and the us could not have been built today without africa
it is all the resources that were taken from africa including human that built these countries
so when they try to give back we shouldn 't be on the defensive the issue is not
that the issue is how are we using what has been given what has been given back how are we using it is it being directed effectively
i want to tell you a little story why i don't mind if we get aid but we use it well from
seven to seventy nigeria fought a war the nigeria biafra war and in the middle of that war i was fourteen years old we spent much of our time with my mother cooking
things were really bad we were down to almost nothing in terms of a meal a day people children were dying of kwashiorkor i'm sure some of you who are not so young
will remember those pictures well i was in the middle of it in the midst of all this my mother fell ill
with a stomach ailment for two or three days we thought she was going to die my father was not there he was in the army so i was the oldest person in the house my sister fell very ill
with malaria she was three years old and i was fifteen and she had such a high fever we tried everything it didn't look like it was going to work
i was scared because i knew her life depended on my getting to this woman we heard there was a woman doctor who was treating people i walked ten kilometers putting one foot in front of the other i got there and i saw huge crowds
i had to crawl in between the legs of these people with my sister strapped on my back find a way to a window and while they were trying to break down the door i climbed in through the window and jumped in
this woman told me it was in the nick of time by the time we jumped into that hall she was barely moving
she gave a shot of her chloroquine what i learned was the chloroquine then gave her some it must have been a re hydration and some other therapies and put us in a corner
in about two to three hours she started to move and then they toweled her down because she started sweating which was a good sign
and then my sister woke up
and about five or six hours later she said we could go home i strapped her on my back i walked the ten kilometers back and it was the shortest walk i ever had i was so happy
or your person involved you don't care where what it's aid you to be alive and
so if we save people from hiv aids if we save them from malaria it means they can form the base of production for our economy
and by the same token as someone said yesterday if we don 't and they die their children will become a burden on the economy so even from an economic
that i say look let 's channel these resources we get into something productive however
we have to use it well what has happened in europe do you all know that spain
it is on the back of this that the whole of southern spain has developed into a services economy did you know that ireland got three billion
is one of the fastest growing economies in the european union today for which many people even from
other parts of the world are going there to find jobs what did they do with the three billion dollars in aid they used it to build an information
they didn't say no you know we're not going to take this today the european union is busy transferring aid my frustration is if they can build infrastructure in spain
which is roads highways other things that they can build i say then why do they refuse to use the same aid to build the same infrastructure in our countries
when we ask them and tell them what we need one of my worries today is that we have many foundations now now we talk about the world bank imf and accountability and all that and the eu we also have
citizens now who have a lot of money some of them in this audience with private foundations and one day these foundations have so much money they will overtake
the official aid that is being given but i fear and i'm very grateful to all of them for what they are trying to do on the continent but i'm also worried i wake up with a gnawing in my belly
because i see a new set of aid entrepreneurs on the continent and they're also going from country to country
and many times trying to find what to do but i'm not really sure that their assistance is also being channeled in the right
and many of them are not really familiar with the continent they are just discovering and many times i don't see africans working with
and many times i get the impression that they are not really even interested in hearing from africans who might know
we on their boards when they make decisions about where to channel money are we there will we make the same mistake that we made before
have our presidents and our leaders everyone is talking about have they ever called these people together and said look your foundation and your foundation you have so much money we are grateful let 's sit down and really tell you
and say to all these people bringing their money sit down and we don't do it because there are so many of us we don't
we've not called the bill gates and the soros and everybody else who is helping
and say sit down let 's have a conference with you as a continent here are our priorities here is where we want you to channel this money each one should not be an entrepreneur going out and finding what is best we're not trying to stop them
to help them help us better and what is disappointing me is that we are not doing this ten years from now
that is coming towards our way how can we get government to combine properly with these private foundations with the international organizations and with our private sector
i firmly believe in that private sector thing too but it cannot do it alone so there might be a few ideas
that could work they said this is about proliferating and sharing ideas so
private sector and the african that we can put together as a partnership so that aid can be a facilitator that is all aid can be
reasons why china is a bit popular with africans now one of the reasons is not only just that you know these people are stupid and china is coming to take resources
will help you build it don't shy away from infrastructure in fact the chinese minister of finance said to me when i asked him what are we doing wrong in nigeria
he said there are two things you need only infrastructure infrastructure infrastructure and discipline you are undisciplined
i repeat it for the continent it's the same we need infrastructure infrastructure and discipline so we can make a catalytic to help us provide some of that
now i realize i'm not saying health and education
provide that as well but i'm saying it's not either or let 's see how aid can be a facilitator in partnership one idea second thing for the private sector
people are afraid to take risks on the continent why can't some of this aid be used as a kind of guarantee mechanisms to enable people
finally because they are both
i don't need to repeat it but there are people women creating jobs and we know studies have shown that when you put resources
in the hand of the woman in fact there's an econometric study the world bank review done in two thousand showing that transfers into the hands of
the household more for the economy and all that so i'm saying that one of the takeaways from here i'm not saying the men are not important obviously if you leave the husbands out
they do they'll come back home and get disgruntled and it will result in difficulties we don't want we don't want men beating their wives because they don't have a job and so on but at
we also i want to push this because the reason is the men automatically they get not automatically but they tend to get more support but i want you to realize that
people creating jobs beatrice gakuba has
two hundred jobs from her flower business in rwanda we have ibukun awosika in nigeria with the furniture the
twenty million she will create another one hundred two hundred more jobs so take away from here is how
who are ready business people who want to expand and create more jobs and lastly what are you going to do to be part of this
of aid government private sector and the african as an individual thank
