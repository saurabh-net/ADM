i am not as nervous as i was five weeks ago five weeks ago i had total hip replacement surgery
big epiphany around the situation so chris invited me to tell you about it but first you need to know two things about me just two things i'm canadian and i'm the youngest of seven kids for anything
for anything i met the surgeon
and he took some free x rays
and i got a good look at them and you know even i could tell my hip was bad and i actually work in marketing so he
the table i'm gonna replace your hip it's about an eighteen month wait
i would not have my new hip for ted two thousand and eight i would still be on my bad hip that was so disappointing so i left his office and i was walking through the hospital and that's when i had my epiphany
had to get herself to the front of the line
yeah can i tell you how un canadian
we do not think that way we don't talk about it ugh it's not even a consideration in fact when we're traveling abroad it's how we identify fellow canadians after you oh no no after you i
to butting any geezer off the list some seventy year old who wanted his new hip so he could be back golfing or gardening no
so by now i was walking the lobby and of course sign
in the window of the hospital 's tiny gift shop
well they signed me up immediately no reference checks none of the usual background stuff no they were desperate for volunteers because the average age of the volunteer
they needed some young blood so next thing you know i had my bright blue volunteer vest i had my photo id and i was fully trained by my eighty nine year old boss i worked alone i'm getting my hip
i'm getting my hip be so great
be so great all
the staff got to know the plucky young volunteer
my next surgeon 's appointment was coincidentally right after a shift at the gift shop so naturally i had my vest and my identification i draped them casually over the chair in the doctor 's office
and you know when he walked in i could just tell that he
i had a surgery date just weeks away
two reasons first of all i am going to take such good care of this new but also
which actually leads me to the biggest epiphany
they do it in a way that benefits society
