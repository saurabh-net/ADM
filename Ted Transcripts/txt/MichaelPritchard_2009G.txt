the water that's been provided for you here at the conference over the past couple of days and i'm sure you'll feel that it's from a safe source but what if it
what if it was from a source like this then statistics would actually say that half of you would now be suffering with diarrhea
talked a lot in the past about statistics and the provision of safe drinking water for all but they just don't seem to get through and i think i've worked out why
because using current thinking the scale of the problem just seems too huge to contemplate solving so we just switch off us and aid agencies
well today i'd like to show you that through thinking differently the problem has been solved
by the way since i've been speaking another thirteen thousand people around the world are suffering now with diarrhea
and four children have just died
i invented lifesaver bottle because i got angry i like most of you was sitting down the day after christmas in two thousand and four
i was watching the devastating news of the asian tsunami as it rolled in playing out on tv the days and weeks that followed people fleeing to the hills being forced to drink contaminated water
face death that really stuck with me then
a few months later hurricane katrina slammed into the side of america okay i thought here 's a first world country
let 's see what they can do day one nothing day two nothing
you know it took five days to get water to the superdome people were shooting each other on the streets for tv sets and water however
after a few failed prototypes i finally came up with this the lifesaver bottle okay now for the science bit before lifesaver the best hand filters were only capable of filtering down to about two hundred nanometers
the smallest bacteria is about two hundred nanometers so a two hundred nanometer bacteria is going to get through
a two hundred nanometer hole the smallest virus on the other hand is about twenty five nanometers getting through
okay i'm going to give you a bit of a demonstration would you like to see that i spent all the time setting this up so i guess i should we're in the fine city of oxford so
but i got to thinking you know if we were in the middle of a flood zone in bangladesh the water wouldn't look like this so i've gone and got some stuff to add into it and this is from my pond
have a smell of that mister cameraman
right we're just going to pour that in there ugh michael pritchard okay we've got some runoff from a sewage plant farm so put that in
put that in there there we go and
some other bits and pieces chuck that in there and i've got a gift here from a friend of mine 's rabbit so we're just
put that in there as well okay now
the lifesaver bottle works really simply
you just scoop the water up today i'm going to use a jug just to show you all let 's get a bit of that okay
okay okay
okay the
the okay
and when it's expired using failsafe technology the system will shut off protecting the user pop the cartridge out pop a new one in it's good for another six thousand liters
so let 's look at the applications traditionally in a crisis what do we do we ship water
then after a few weeks we set up camps and people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water
what happens when twenty thousand people congregate in a camp diseases spread more resources are required the problem just becomes self perpetuating
but by thinking differently and shipping these people can stay put they can make their own sterile drinking water and start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives
now it doesn't require a natural disaster for this to work using
the old thinking of national infrastructure and pipe work is too expensive when you run the numbers on a calculator you run out
so here is the thinking different bit instead of
there and dumps it onto the mountains rivers and streams and where do people live near water all we've go to do is make it sterile
how do we do that well we could use the lifesaver bottle or we could use one of these the same technology in a jerrycan this will process twenty five thousand liters of water
that's good enough for a family of four for three years and how much does it cost about half
so by thinking differently and processing water at the point of use mothers and children
no longer have to walk four hours a day to collect their water they can get it from a source nearby
so with just eight billion dollars we can hit the millennium goal 's target of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water
to put that into context the u k government spends about twelve billion pounds a year on foreign aid
but why stop there with twenty billion dollars everyone can have access to safe drinking water
so the three and a half billion people that suffer every year as a result and the two million kids that die every year
