i'm the weekly tech critic for the new york times i review gadgets and stuff and mostly what good dads should be doing this time of year
is nestling with their kids and decorating the christmas tree what i'm mostly doing this year is going on cable tv and answering the same question what are the tech trends for next year
like didn 't we just go through this last year but i'm going to pick the one that interests me most and that is the completed marriage of the cell phone and the internet you know i found that
volcano on google images not realizing how much it makes me look like the cover of dianetics
but its just a fake out it's a wav file of a dial tone just to reassure you that the world hasn't ended it could be anything it could be salsa music or a comedy routine it doesn't matter
the little box has your phone number so that's really cool you can take it to london or siberia and your next door neighbor can dial your home number and your phone will ring because it's got everything in the box they've got every feature known to man in there
the last three years i mean no self respecting college kid has home phone service anymore this is what college kids are more likely to have it's the most popular voip service in the world it's skype
it's a free program you download for your mac or pc and you make free phone calls anywhere in the world the downside is that you have to wear a headset like a nerd it's not your phone it's your computer
but nonetheless if you're a college kid and you have no money believe me this is better than trying to use your cellphone it's really cute seeing middle aged people like me
try out skype for the first time which is usually when their kid goes away for a semester abroad they don't want to pay the international fees is that you
is that you it's really cute
but i at least it was when i did it i think where voip is really going to get interesting is when they start putting it on cellphones imagine if you had an ordinary cellphone and any time you were in a wireless hotspot
free calls anywhere in the world never pay the cellular company a nickle it 'd be really really cool and yet even though the technology for this has been available
for five years incredibly the number of standard cellphones offered by us carriers with free voip zero
i can't figure out why
i am not paid by t mobile i'm not plugging t mobile the new york times has very rigid policies about that ever since that jayson blair jerk ruined it for all of us
basically the reason you haven't heard about this program is because it was introduced last year on june twenty nine does anyone remember what else happened on june twenty nine last year
it was the iphone the iphone came out that day i'm like can you imagine being the t mobile pr lady you know hi we but
and when you're out of the hotspot you're on the regular cellular network your 'e thinking well how often am i in a hotspot the answer is all the time because they give you
it's a hundred million dollars to put up one of those towers right they don't have that kind of money instead they give each of us a seven dollar and ninety five cent box
like a stealth tower installation program we're putting it in our homes for them anyway they have wi fi phones in europe
but the thing that t mobile did that nobody 's done before is when you're on a call an you move from wi fi into cellular range the call is handed off in mid syllable seamlessly
i'll show you the advanced technologies we use at the new york times to test this gear this is me with a camcorder on a phone going like this
as i walk out of the house from my wi fi hotspot into the cellular network on a call with my wife look at the upper left that's the wi fi signal sound
sound doing right
the bottom line is that the boundaries because of the internet plus cellphone are melting the cool thing about the t mobile phones is that although switching technologies is very advanced and
the call will continue to be free because they don 't they haven't well no wait not so fast it also works the other way
if you start a call on your cellular network and you come home you keep being billed which is why most people with this service get into the habit of saying hey i just got home can i call you right back
now you get it it's also true that if you use one of these phones overseas it doesn't know what internet hotspot
on the internet nobody knows you're a dog right nobody knows you're in pakistan you can make free unlimited calls home to the
i have two cellphones so this going to be very odd made the point
ringer off everyone wants in on the action this is grand central at work it's a oh for
i have your numbers now you will pay
is this really brilliant idea where they give you a new phone number and then at that point one phone number rings all your phones at once your home phone your work phone your cellphone your yacht phone this is the eg
you can say i want these people to be able to call me only during these hours and i want these people to hear this greeting
hi boss i'm out making us both some money leave a message and then your wife calls and hi honey leave me a message very customizable
google bought it and they've been working on it for a year they're supposed to come out with it very shortly in a public method by the way this is something that really bothers me
i'm going to tell you how to avoid that now what you're going to use is google cellular it's totally free there's not even ads if you know how to send a text message you can get the same information for
the last e for savings anyway so lets say you need a drugstore near chicago you type pharmacy chicago or the
in five seconds they will send you back the two closest drugstores complete with name address and phone number
it's already written down so like if you're driving you don't have to do why i was in
and those are just the beginning these are all the different things that you can text to google and they will yeah you're all trying to write this
i want what i want to find what bagels ok google say the business and the city and state dp bagels monterey california
i got the chinese line number two number two
or say details or go back
he 's connecting me he doesn't even tell me the phone number he 's just connecting me directly it's like having a personal valet
one they have ten thousand
who are being paid twenty cents per answer as you can imagine it's college kids and old people
that's who can afford to do that but it's a human being on the line and it's gotten me out of so many tough positions like when 's the last flight out of chicago you know it's just absolutely amazing
another thing that really bothers me about cellphones today this is probably my biggest pet peeve in all of technology when i
call to leave you a message
i get fifteen seconds of instructions from a third grade teacher on ambien
and then it gets worse when i call to retrieve my messages first of all you have eighty seven messages to listen to your messages i
so last year i went to milan italy and i got to speak to an audience of cellular executives from two hundred countries around the world
and i said as a joke as a joke i said i did the math verizon has seventy million customers if you check your voicemail twice a day
that's one hundred million dollars a year i bet you guys are doing this just to run up our airtime aren't you no chuckle they're like this the outrage people
so now i'm going to tell you how to get out of that there are these services that transcribe your voicemail into text and they send it to either your email or as
the audio file at the bottom of the email so you can listen to double check the services are called things like spinvox phonetag this is the one i use callwave a lot of people say how
are they doing this i don't really want people listening in to my calls the executives at these companies told me well we use a proprietary b to b best of breed peer to peer soluti
i think basically it's like these guys in india with headsets you know listening in the reason i think that is that on the first day i tried one of these services i got two voicemail messages one you
i thought i'd see how that goes this is me testing it out
this is micheal hope you're doing well i'm fine here everything 's good hey i was walking along the street and the sky was blue
and your daughter broke her leg at soccer practice i'm going to have a sandwich for lunch
in in room emergency room fifty three w i love my job
i guess that was the
or a potentially bad meeting so you go and you type in your phone number and at the exact minute where you want to be called
and at that moment your phone will ring and you're like i 'm sorry i've got to take this the really beautiful thing is you know when somebody 's sitting next to you sometimes they can sort of
hear a little bit of the caller so they give you a choice of what you want to hear on the other end here 's the girlfriend hey
what's going on dp i'm kinda like giving a talk right now well that's good dp what are you doing i was just wondering what you were up to sorry
so when was the last time you used the photocopier dp it was like three weeks ago well i don't know if you heard you might have heard from lenny but
i think the biggest change when internet met phone was with the iphone not my finest moment in new york times journalism it was when in the fall of two thousand and six i explained why apple would never do a cellphone
i looked like a moron however my logic was good because i don't know if you realize this but until the iphone came along the
you can see what i said about it it's a flawed masterpiece it's got bad things and good things lets all acknowledge that right now but it did change a few things the first thing it changed was that
all those carriers saw that they sold ten million of these things in a year and they said oh my gosh maybe we've been doing it wrong maybe we should let phone designers design the phones
another thing was that it let ten million people for the first time experience being online all the time not using these sixty dollar a month cellular cards for their laptops a
a we had
it's absurd we have power outlets in every room of every building we have running water what's the problem
anyway but this teaches people what it's like you have to go to youtube and type in iphone shuffle this guy did a mock
video of one that's one inch square like the real ipod shuffle it's like it only has one button touch it and it dials a number at random
but the other thing it did is it opened up this idea of an app store it downloads right to the phone and you can use the tilt sensor
to steer this car using this game these programs can use all the components of the iphone the touch screen this is the etch a sketch prgram the theme of eg two thousand and eight you know how you erase it
of course you shake it right of course we shake it to erase like this they have ten thousand of these programs
this is amazing this is midomi a song is running through your head you sing it into the thing do do
done and it will find out the song and play it for you
this is pandora free internet radio not just free internet radio you type in a band or a song name it will immediately play you that song
from a different band with the same
vocals theme and tempo if you like that one or don't like it you do thumbs up and thumbs down over time
it gives you the price and the location and
the most calcified corporate conservative carrier of all
said you can use any phone you want on our network i love the wired headline pigs fly hell freezes over and verizon opens up its network no really
so everything is changing we've entered at new world of innovation where the cellphone becomes your laptop customized the way you want it every
is unique there is software that you can add on can i do one more one minute song
this is a song i did for the new york times website as a music video ladies and gentlemen for seven blissful hours it was the number one video on now
now sound
sound it's got some
it's got some a
a i want to
i want to got
got all the
