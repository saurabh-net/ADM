like all good stories this starts a long long time ago when there was basically nothing
so here is a complete picture of the universe about fourteen odd billion years ago
all energy is concentrated into a single point of energy for some reason it explodes and you begin to get these things so you 're now about fourteen billion years into this and these things expand and expand and expand into these giant galaxies and you get trillions of them
and within these galaxies you get these enormous dust clouds and i want you to pay particular attention to the three little
prongs in the center of this picture if you take a close up of those they look like this
and what you 're looking at is columns of dust where there 's so much dust by the way the scale of this is a trillion vertical miles
and what 's happening is there 's so much dust it comes together and it fuses and ignites a thermonuclear reaction
and so what you 're watching is the birth of stars
these are stars being born out of here when enough stars come out they create a galaxy
this one happens to be a particularly important galaxy because you are here
by the way you 're now about two thirds of the way into this story
and soon thereafter there 's enough material left over that you get a primordial soup
and that creates life and life starts to expand and expand and expand until it goes kaput
now the really strange thing is life goes kaput not once not twice
just to put ourselves and our ancestors in perspective
so within that context there 's two theories of the case as to why we 're all here
the first theory of the case is that 's all she wrote
under that theory we are the be all and end all of all creation and the reason for trillions of galaxies sextillions of planets
is to create something that looks like
and that 's the purpose of the universe and then it flat lines it doesn 't get any better
and if it is and particularly given the fact that we came very close to extinction
there were only about two thousand of our species left
a few more weeks without rain we would have never seen any of these
you have to think about a second theory if the first one isn 't good enough second theory is could we upgrade
so it turns out that we have upgraded we 've upgraded time and again and again and it turns out that we keep discovering upgrades we found this one last year
we found another one last month
and as you 're thinking about this you might also ask the question
so why a single human species
particularly given that we co existed at the same time with at least eight other versions of humanoid at the same time on this planet
so the normal state of affairs is not to have just a homo sapiens the normal state of affairs is to have various versions of humans walking around
and if that is the normal state of affairs
well svante paabo has the answer the difference between humans and neanderthal is zero point zero zero four percent of gene code
that 's how big the difference is one species to another
this explains most contemporary political debates
one of the interesting things is how small these mutations are and where they take place
difference human neanderthal is sperm and testis smell and skin and those are the specific genes
that differ from one to the other
so very small changes can have a big impact
so about ten thousand years ago by the black sea we had one mutation in one gene which led to blue eyes
and when we find these we may find differences
and by the way this is not a debate that we 're ready for because we have really misused the science
in this in the one thousand nine hundred and twenty s we thought there were major differences between people that was partly based on francis galton 's work
he was darwin 's cousin
but the u s the carnegie institute stanford american neurological association took this really far that got exported
that got exported and was really misused
in fact it led to some absolutely horrendous treatment of human beings so since the one thousand nine hundred and forty s we 've been saying there are no differences we 're all identical
we 're going to know at year end if that is true
well it turns out that every male olympic power athelete ever tested carries at least one of these variants
if that is true it leads to some very complicated questions for the london olympics
because you have one and you don 't have one i 'll give you a tenth of a second head start
and it turns out that as we discover these things we human beings
really like to change how we look
today 's corrections deletions augmentations and enhancements are going to seem like child 's play
you already saw the work by tony atala on ted but
this ability to start filling things like inkjet cartridges with cells are allowing us to print
skin organs and a whole series of other body parts and as these technologies go forward
you keep seeing this you keep seeing this you keep seeing things two thousand
human genome sequence and it seems like nothing 's happening until it does
and we may just be in some of these weeks
and as you 're thinking about
where they take skin cells from this mouse put four chemicals on
turn those skin cells into stem cells let the stem cells grow
and create a full copy of that mouse
which is like a skier at the top of a mountain
and those two skiers become two pluripotent stem cells four eight sixteen and then it gets so crowded after sixteen divisions that those cells have to differentiate so they go down one side of the mountain they go down another and as they pick
these become bone and then they pick another road and these become platelets and these become macrophages and these become t cells but it 's really hard once you ski down to get back up
unless of course if you have a ski lift
and what those four chemicals do is they take any cell and take it way back up the mountain so it can become any body part and as you think of that what it means is potentially you can rebuild a full copy of any organism out of any one of its cells
that turns out to be a big deal because now you can take not just mouse cells but you can human skin cells
and turn them into human stem cells
and then what they did in october is they took skin cells turned them into stem cells
here 's a second experiment
if you could photocopy your body
maybe you also want to take your mind and one of the things you saw at ted about a year and a half ago
and you can map the exact pathways when a mouse sees feels touches remembers loves
and then you can take a fiber optic cable
and light up some of the same things and by the way as you do this you can image it in two colors which means you can download this information as binary code directly into a computer
so what 's the bottom line on that well it 's not completely inconceivable that someday you 'll be able to download your own memories
maybe into a new body
and maybe you can upload other people 's memories as well
and this might have just one or two small ethical political moral implications
here 's what it looks like in two thousand
here 's what it looks like in two thousand and two
two thousand and six two thousand and eight
here 's the increase in less than a decade
and we still don 't know why this is happening
people with who are extraordinarily smart people who can remember everything they 've seen in their lives people who 've got synesthesia people who 've got schizophrenia you 've got all kinds of stuff going on out there and we still don 't understand how and why this is happening
there 's beginning to be some evidence that obesity and diet have something to do with gene modifications which may or may not have an impact
on how the brain of an infant works a second option is the sexy geek option these conditions are
these conditions are highly rare
but what 's beginning to happen is because these geeks are all getting together because they are highly qualified for computer programming and it is highly remunerated
as well as other very detail oriented tasks that they are concentrating geographically and finding like minded mates so this is the assortative mating hypothesis of these genes reinforcing one another in these structures
the third is this too much information
various psychological conditions or reactions to this information
or maybe it 's chemicals but when you see an increase of that order of magnitude in a condition either you 're not measuring it right or there 's something going on
very quickly and it may be evolution in real time
i think we 're transitioning into homo evolutis that for better or worse is not just a hominid that 's conscious of his or her environment
it 's a hominid that 's beginning to directly and deliberately control the evolution of its own species of bacteria
of plants of animals and i think that 's such an order of magnitude change that your grandkids or your great grandkids may be a species very different from you thank you very much
