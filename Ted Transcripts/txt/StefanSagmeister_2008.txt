about four years ago talking about the relationship of design and happiness at the very end of it i showed a list
i showed a list under that title
under that title very few things
very few things in addition since but
made a whole number of them into projects since these are inflatable monkeys in every city in scotland everybody always
become a drag later on doing
changing media this is a projection that can see the viewer as the viewer walks by you can't help but actually ripping that spider web apart
i would never have the money to actually pay for the installment or pay for all the billboards or the production of these so there's always a client attached to them
sixty five thousand coat hangers in a street that's lined with fashion stores worrying solves nothing
money does not make me happy appeared first as double page spreads in a magazine the printer lost the file didn't tell us
when the magazine actually when i got the subscription it was twelve following pages it said money does does make me happy and a friend of mine in austria was so
felt so sorry for me that he talked the largest casino owner
in linz into letting us wrap his building so this is the big pedestrian zone in linz and it just says money and if you look down the side street it says does not make me happy
we had a show just came down last week in new york we steamed up the windows permanently
and every hour we had a different designer come in and write these things that they've learned into the steam in the window everybody participated milton glaser
little spot that we filmed there that's to be displayed on the large jumbotrons in singapore
and of course one that's dear to my heart because all of these sentiments some banal some a bit more profound
all originally had come out of my
and i do go often into the diary and check
for a long enough time something about it
very last one is a
this is our roof in new york the roof of the studio this is newsprint plus stencils that lie on the newsprint we let that
around in the sun as you all know newsprint yellows significantly in the sun after a week we took the stencils and the leaves off shipped
to a very sunny spot so on day one the billboard said complaining is silly either act or forget three days later it faded and a week later no more complaining anywhere thank you so much
