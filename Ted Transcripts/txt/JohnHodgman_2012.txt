i 'm going to unpack for you three examples of iconic
design and it makes perfect sense that i should be the one to do it because i have
a bachelor 's degree in literature laughter but i 'm also a famous minor television personality and an avid collector of design within reach catalogs so i pretty much know
everything there is now i 'm sure you recognize this object many of you probably saw it as you were landing your private zeppelins at los angeles international airport over the past couple of days this is known as the theme
building that is its name for reasons that are still very murky and it is perhaps the best example we have in los angeles of ancient extraterrestrial architecture
it was first excavated in one thousand nine hundred and sixty one as they were building lax although scientists believe that it dates back to the year two thousand before common era when it was used as a busy transdimensional space port
by the ancient astronauts who first colonized this planet and raised our species from savagery by giving us the gift of written language and technology
and the gift of revolving restaurants it is thought to have been a replacement for the older space ports located of course at stonehenge and considered to be quite an improvement due to the uncluttered design
it ushered in a new era of streamlined archaically futuristic design called googie which came to be synonymous with the jet age a misnomer after all the ancient astronauts who used it did not travel by jet very often preferring instead to travel by feathered serpent powered by crystal skulls
the juicy salif this is a design by philippe starck who i believe is in the audience at this very moment and you can tell it is a starck design by its precision its playfulness its
innovation and its promise of imminent violence
which would be useful out in the lobby i would say and despite its obvious influence by the ancient astronauts and its space agey ness and tripodism it is not something designed to attach to your brain and suck out your thoughts
it is in fact a citrus juicer and when i say that
you never see it as anything else again it is also not a monument to design it is a monument to design 's utility you can take it home with you unlike the theme building which will stay where it is forever this is affordable and can come home with you
and as such it can sit on your kitchen counter
it can 't go in your drawers trust me i found that out the hard way
and make your kitchen counter into a monument to design one other thing about it if you do have one at home let me tell you one of the features you may not know when you fall asleep it comes alive
and it walks around your house
and goes through your mail and watches you as you sleep
i have no idea i don 't know what that thing is it looks terrible is it a little hot plate i don 't get it
does anyone know chi it 's an iphone iphone oh yes that 's right i remember those i had my whole bathroom tiles redone with those back in the good old days
no i have an iphone of course i do here is my well loved iphone i do so many things on this little device i like to read books on it more than that i like to buy books on it
i use it every day to
measure the weight of an ox for example
every now and then i admit that i complete a phone call on it occasionally
and yet i forget about it all the time this is a design
the gasp inducement that occurred in two thousand and seven when you first touched this thing because it became so quickly pervasive and because of how instantly we adopted these gestures and made it an extension of our life unlike
the theme building this is not alien technology or i should say what it did was it took technology which unlike people in this room to many other people in the world still feels very alien and made it immediately and instantly feel familiar and intimate and unlike the juicy salif it does not threaten
to attach itself to your brain rather it simply attaches itself to your brain
