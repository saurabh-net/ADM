so dancing is one of the most human of activities we delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers you will see later on now ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise
and a high level of skill and probably a level of initial suitability that may well have a genetic component to it now
sadly neurological disorders such as parkinson 's disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability as it is doing to my friend jan stripling who was a virtuoso ballet dancer in his time so great progress and treatment has been made over the years however there are six point three million people worldwide who have the disease
and they have to live with incurable weakness tremor rigidity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease so what we need are objective tools
to detect the disease before it 's too late we need to be able to measure progression objectively and ultimately the only way we 're going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure
patients could do that test themselves right no expensive staff time required takes about dollar three hundred by the way in the neurologist 's clinic to do it so what i want to propose to you as an unconventional way in which we can try to achieve this because you see in one sense at least we are all virtuosos like my friend jan stripling
so here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds
now this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds and we all actually have the genes for it foxp two for example and like ballet it takes an extraordinary level of training i mean just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak
we see all the same symptoms we see vocal tremor weakness and rigidity the speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy after a while and that 's one of the example symptoms of it so these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle in some cases
using voice signals alone so these voice based tests how do they stack up against expert clinical tests we 'll they 're both non invasive
the neurologist 's test is non invasive they both use existing infrastructure you don 't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it
and they 're both accurate okay but in addition voice based tests are non expert that means they can be self administered they 're high speed take about thirty seconds at most they 're ultra low cost and we all know what happens when something becomes ultra low cost
it becomes massively scalable so here are some amazing goals that i think we can deal with now we can reduce logistical difficulties with patients no need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup we can do high frequency monitoring to get objective data
we can perform low cost mass recruitment for clinical trials and we can make population scale screening feasible for the first time we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biomarkers of the disease before it 's too late
so taking the first steps towards this today we 're launching the parkinson 's voice initiative with aculab and patientslikeme we 're aiming to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals we have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet anyone healthy or with parkinson 's can call in
and it 's getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ironing out
