illegal wildlife trade in brazil is one of the major threats against our fauna especially birds
and mainly to supply the pet market with thousands of animals taken from nature every month
these huge cargos with live animals intended to supply the pet market or they seize the animals directly from the people 's houses
and this is how we end up every month with thousands of seized animals and for us to understand what happens with them we're going to follow
in the eyes of many people after the animals are seized they say yay justice has been served
the good guys arrived took the cute mistreated animals from the hands of the evil traffickers and
in brazil they are usually first sent to governmental triage facilities in which most of the cases the conditions are as bad as with the traffickers
in two thousand and two these centers recieved forty five thousand animals of which thirty seven thousand were birds
and the police estimates that we seize five percent of what's being trafficked some lucky ones and among them brad go to serious rehabilitation centers after that
in these places they are cared for they train their flying they learn how to recognize the food they will find in nature and they are able to socialize with others from the same species
but then what the brazil ornithological society so now we're talking only birds
claims that we have too little knowledge about the species in nature therefore it would be too risky to release these animals
both for the released and for the natural populations they also claim that we spend too many resources
but some researchers myself included some ngos and some people from the brazilian government believe there is an alternative
we think that if and when the animals meet certain criteria concerning their health behavior inferred origin
and whatever we know about the natural populations then technically responsible releases are possible both for the well being
and for the conservation of the species and their ecosystems because we will be returning genes for these populations which could be important for them
in facing environmental challenges and also we could be returning potential seed dispersers predators
preys etc all of these were released by us on the top the turtles are just enjoying freedom
the middle this guy nested a couple of weeks after the release and on the bottom my personal favorite
male over there four hours after his release he was together with a wild female
so this is not new people have been doing this around the world but it's still a big issue in brazil we believe we have performed responsible releases we've registered released animals mating in
having chicks so these genes are indeed going back to the populations however this is still a minority for the very lack of knowledge
so i say let 's study more let 's shed light on this issue let 's do whatever we can i'm devoting my career to that and i'm here to urge
each and every one of you to do whatever is in your reach talk to your neighbor teach your children make sure your pet is from a legal breeder
we need to act and act now before these ones are the only ones left thank you very much
