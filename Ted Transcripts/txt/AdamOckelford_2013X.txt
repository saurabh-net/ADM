it 's amazing now because he 's so much bigger than me but when derek was born he could have fitted on the palm of your hand he was born three and a half months premature and really it was a fantastic fight for him to survive
but that was the end of the bad news because when derek came home from the hospital his family decided to employ the redoubtable nanny who was going to look after you derek really for the rest of your childhood
and nanny 's great insight really was to think
here 's a child who can 't see music must be the thing for derek and sure enough she sang or as derek called it warbled to him for his first few years of life and i think it was that excitement with hearing her voice hour after hour every day that
gift here 's a little picture of derek going up now when you were with your nanny
now nanny 's great other insight was to think perhaps we should get derek
something to play and sure enough she dragged this little keyboard out of the loft never thinking really that anything much would come of it but derek your tiny hand must have gone out to that thing and actually bashed it bashed it so hard they thought it was going to break

but the orchestra were wowed as well and the press of the world were fascinated by your ability to play these fantastic pieces
now the question is how do you do it derek and hopefully we can show the audience now how it is you do what you do
some people have perfect pitch for a few white notes in the middle of the piano
that kind of raw ability without the technique and luckily derek you decided that once we did start learning you 'd let me help you learn all the scale fingerings so for example using your thumb under with c major the

you may think thirteen hours is a long time to keep talking but derek does it effortlessly keep up with
