three years ago i got a phone call based on an earlier film i had made with an offer to embed the new hampshire national guard
my idea and literally i woke up in the middle of the night and we've all have those moments i was excited with this phone call
i was thinking i just finished making another film about world war ii vets and i realized i'd gotten to know their stories and i realized this was a once in a lifetime opportunity
to tell a warrior 's story as it unfolded so i went to bed that night pretty excited not sure of all the details but excited
four in the morning but it was closer to midnight woke straight up wide awake as could be and i had this idea what if i could in effect virtually embed
and create a permeable relationship with the soldiers to tell the story from the inside out versus the outside in
so i called back major heilshorn who 's the public affairs officer of the new hampshire national guard and
he knew me so i was like greg he 's like yes
so what that meant was when i went down to fort dix i had to hop out in front of one hundred and eighty guys and tell them of my vision you can imagine the hailstorm of questions i got
the opening one was what the fuck do you know about the national guard
there we went so i'd like to show the clip of the film it's our trailer because i know obviously you guys are busy is
is here life will change
here life will change every single time
every single time 's
's one hundred and fifty
one hundred and fifty there
there now
i'd like to talk to you about is having a conversation about something that is difficult to talk about
and i'd like to relate an experience i had here at ted
i want to tell you a little brief story we were one of the lucky ones to get in the class with the sony cameras and the vista
some other people in the class and it went on and on i mean we were there for an hour talking and it really highlighted something that i would like to ask
you guys to think about and hopefully to help with which is i think a lot of us are very afraid to have conversations about war and about politics and really
was talking and he then turned to constance and said you know i wouldn't have this conversation if she weren't here because i know she has my back
and i want to say i was nervous because i'm used to doing q as i really related to what james was saying yesterday because
behind the camera you know i can answer questions about my movie but for me to come up and talk for eighteen minutes is a really long time so i wanted to say paul i'm happy you're here because i know you have
i didn't save all of them because i didn't realize at the beginning
it would be something that i would want to keep track of but there were three thousand two hundred and eleven emails and imiss and text messages that i was able to
the reason i quantify that is because we really embarked on this as a mutual journey to really get inside of it so i wanted to show you a clip and then i was going tell you a little bit of how it got put together obviously
advised we're leaving taji right now we believe that the
know someone had had thrown a quarter through a guy and it was just like there was no blood coming from the shrapnel wounds everything was cauterized and it was just like there was a void going going through the body
this is the scene north they just removed a burnt body or half a body from here i don't think there was
later heard that iraqi casualties were not to be treated in taji they can work on the post
one of those incompetent medical officers told me to stop treatment i would 've slit his
we want to or not
more violence in iraq twin suicide car bombings killed eight iraqis and wounded dozens
i have lost all faith in the media a hapless joke that i would much rather laugh at than become a
i should really thank god for saving my lucky ass i'll do that then i'm gonna jerk off because these
pages smell like lindz and there won 't be any time for jerking off tomorrow another mission at six
when i said earlier to try and tell a story from the inside out versus the outside in part of what chris said so eloquently in his introduction is this melding it's a new way of trying to make a documentary when i met the guys and
ten of them agreed to take cameras in total twenty one ended up filming five soldiers filmed the entire time there are three featured in the film the way i learned about taji was
steve pink sent me an email and in it attached a photo of that burned body out at the car and the tone from the email was you know it had been a very bad day obviously
and i saw in my im window that mike moriarty was at the base so i pinged mike and i said mike can you please go get that interview with pink because
the thing that very often is missing is in the military what they call hot wash it's that immediate interview after something immediately happens you know and if you let time go by it kind of softens and smooths the edges and for me
i really wanted that so in order to get the intimacy to share that experience with you the guys the two most popular mounts there was a camera on the turret the gun turret and then on the dashboard of the humvee most of the
humvees we ended up mounting two cameras in them so you get to experience that in real time
the news footage i put in there to try to show
you know i think mainstream media tries to do the best they can in the format that they have but the thing that i know you all have heard a lot of times american soldiers saying why don't they talk about the good stuff that we do ok this is a perfect example
they spent their entire day outside the wire trying to save iraqi lives the iraqis who work on the post
so when you may hear soldiers complaining that's what they're talking about you know and i think it's such an amazing gift that they would share this as a way of bridging and
when i talk about that polarity i get at so many different q as and people are really opinionated but it seems like people don't want to hear so much or listen or try to have an exchange and i'm as fiery as the next person but i really think you know
we have to be able to go into scary places where we may you know we think we know but we just have to leave that little bit of openness to such a disconnect
and for me it's trying to bridge that disconnect
the last ones and i've learned over time that those are always the soldiers
they wait until pretty much everybody 's gone
for me one of the most
for those of you who haven't seen the film and it's not a spoiler it's very common there are a lot of civilian accidents where people get in front of humvees and they get killed in this film there is a scene where an iraqi woman is killed
a soldier came up to me and stood you know
close a foot away from me he 's a big guy
and he looked at me and i
in his eyes and he wasn't going to blink
and he said my gunner was throwing candy
and i knew what he was going
the gunner was throwing candy they used to throw candy to the kids
kids got too close very often
and he said i killed a child and i'm a father
i have children i haven't
been able to tell my wife i'm afraid she's going to think i'm a monster
i hugged him of course
and i said you know it 's going to be ok and he said i 'm going to bring her to see your film
when i talk about a disconnect
it's not only for maybe those people who don't know a soldier which there obviously are
you know these days it's not like world war ii where there was a war front and a home front and everybody seemed involved you can go for days here and not feel like
there's a war going on and often i'll hear people say who maybe know that i did this film and they say oh you know i'm against the war but i support the soldiers to ask them well
you go and see anybody do you if you find out
spend some time not necessarily ask questions but see if they want to talk
do you give money to any of the charities you know obviously like dean kamen 's working on that amazing thing but there's charities where you can sponsor computers for wounded soldiers i think i challenge us to say
to operationalize those terms when we say we support someone you know are you a friend to them do you really care and i would just say it's my hope and i would ask you guys to please you know reach out a hand
