and the professional historical linguists
in the u s and in western europe
mostly try to stay away from any long distance relationships
big groupings groupings that go back
a long time longer than the familiar families they don 't like that they think it 's crank i don 't think it 's crank
and there are some brilliant linguists mostly russians who are working on that at santa fe institute and in moscow
and i would love to see where that leads
does it really lead to a single ancestor some twenty twenty five thousand years ago and what if we go back beyond that single ancestor
when there was presumably a competition among many languages how far back does that go how far back does modern language go how many tens of thousands of years does it go back
