this room may appear to be holding six hundred people but there's actually so many more because in each one of us there is a multitude of personalities
primary personalities that have been in conflict and conversation within me since i was a little girl i call them the mystic and the warrior
i was born into a family of politically active intellectual atheists there was this equation in my family that went something like this
if you are intelligent you therefore are not spiritual i was the freak of the family i was this weird little kid who wanted to have deep talks
that might exist beyond the ones that we perceive with our senses i wanted to know if what we human beings see and hear
and think is a full and accurate picture of reality so looking for answers
i went to catholic mass i tagged along with my neighbors i read sartre and socrates and then a wonderful thing happened when i was in high school
gurus from the east started washing up on the shores of america and i said to myself i wanna get me one of them
ever since i've been walking the mystic path
trying to peer beyond what albert einstein called the optical delusion of everyday consciousness
so what did he mean by this i'll show you
take a breath right now
of this clear air in this room
now see this strange underwater coral reef looking thing
it's actually a person 's trachea
and those colored globs are microbes that are actually swimming around in this room right now all around us
if we're blind to this simple biology imagine what we're missing
at the smallest subatomic level right now and at the grandest cosmic levels my years
as a mystic have made me question almost all my assumptions they've made me a proud i don 't know it all
now when the mystic part of me jabbers on and on like this the warrior rolls her eyes she's
worried she says excuse me i'm pissed off and i know a few things and we better get busy about them right now
spent my life as a warrior working for women 's issues working on political campaigns being an activist for the environment
and it can be sort of crazy making housing both the mystic and the warrior in one body i've always been attracted to those rare people who pull that off
devote their lives to humanity with the grit of the warrior and the grace of the mystic
people like martin luther king jr who wrote i can never be what i ought to be until you are
what you ought to be this he wrote is the interrelated structure of reality
then mother teresa another mystic warrior who said the problem with the world is that we draw the circle of our family too small
and nelson mandela who lives by the african concept of ubuntu which means i need you
in order to be me and you need me in order to be you now we all love to trot out these three mystic warriors as if
they were born with the saint gene but we all actually have the same capacity that they do
and we need to do their work now
deeply disturbed by the ways in which all of our cultures are demonizing the other
by the voice we're giving to the most divisive among us listen to these titles of some of the best selling books from both sides of the political divide here in the u s
is a big fat idiot and patriots
arguing with idiots they're supposedly tongue in cheek but they're actually dangerous
now here 's a title that may sound familiar but whose author may surprise you
four and a half years of struggle against lies stupidity and cowardice who wrote that
that was adolf hitler 's first title for mein kampf my struggle the book that launched the nazi party
the worst eras in human history whether in cambodia or germany or rwanda they start like this with negative otherizing and then they morph into violent extremism
this is why i'm launching a new initiative and it's to
all of us myself included to counteract the tendency to
and i realize we're all busy people so don't worry you can do this on a lunch break
i'm calling my initiative take the other to lunch if you are
you can take a democrat to lunch or if you're a democrat think of it as taking a republican to lunch
now if the idea of taking any of these people to lunch makes you lose your appetite
i suggest you start more local because there is no shortage of the other right in your own neighborhood maybe that person who worships at the mosque
or the church or the synagogue down the street or
i took a conservative tea party woman to lunch
now on paper she passed my smoking ears test
she's an activist from the right and i'm an activist from the left
and we used some guidelines to keep our conversation elevated and you can use them too because i know you're all going to take an other to lunch
so first of all decide on a goal to get to know one person
from a group you may have negatively stereotyped
and then before you get together agree on some ground rules my tea party lunchmate and i came up with these
don't persuade defend or interrupt be curious be conversational real and listen
from there we dove in and we used these questions share some of your life experiences with me
what issues deeply concern you and what have you always wanted to ask someone from the other side
my lunch partner and i came away with some really important insights and i'm going to share just one with you i think it has relevance to any
why her side makes such outrageous allegations and lies about my side what she wanted to know
a bunch of elitist morally corrupt terrorist lovers well she was shocked she thought my side beat up on her side way more often
that we called them brainless gun toting racists
and we both marveled at the labels that fit none of the people we actually know
and since we had established some trust we believed in each other 's sincerity
we agreed we'd speak up in our own communities when we witnessed the kind of otherizing talk that can wound and fester into paranoia
and then be used by those on the fringes to incite
by the end of our lunch we acknowledged each other 's openness neither of us had tried to change the
but we also hadn't pretended that our differences were just going to melt away after a lunch
which is the only place where solutions to our most intractable seeming problems will be found
who should you invite to lunch next time you catch yourself in the act of otherizing that will be your clue
and what might happen at your lunch will the heavens open and we are the world play over the restaurant sound system probably not
because ubuntu work is slow and it's difficult it's two people
dropping the pretense of being know it alls
it's two people two warriors
here 's how the great persian poet rumi put it
out beyond ideas of wrong doing and right doing
