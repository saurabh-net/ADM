a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives we don 't bump into every neighbor so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on though we do share the same public spaces so over the past few years i 've tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space
using simple tools like stickers stencils and chalk and these projects came from questions i had like
how much are my neighbors paying for their apartments laughter how can we lend and borrow more things without knocking on each other 's doors at a bad time
how can we share more of our memories of our abandoned buildings and gain a better understanding of our landscape
and how can we share more of our hopes for our vacant storefronts so our communities can reflect our needs
her name was joan and she was a mother to me
and her death was sudden and unexpected
and i thought about death a lot and
and but i struggle
to maintain this perspective in my daily life
i feel like it 's easy to get caught up in the day to day and forget what really matters to you
so with help from old and new friends i turned the side of this abandoned house into a giant chalkboard and stenciled it with a fill in the blank sentence
before i die i want to
so anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk reflect on their lives and share their personal aspirations in public space
before i die i want to be tried for piracy
before i die i want to straddle the international date line
before i die i want to sing for millions
before i die i want to plant a tree
before i die i want to live off the grid
before i die i want to hold her one more time
before i die i want to be someone 's cavalry
before i die i want to be completely myself
thinking about death clarifies your life
