it 's so much more subtle so much more visceral you know what 's visible what 's not and i 'd like to bring that experience to the desktop so i kind of have a
this is bumptop it 's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing so you can bump things they 're all physically
you know manipulable and stuff
when they 're laid out i can pull things to new locations or delete things or just quickly sort a whole pile you know just immediately right
and then it 's all smoothly animated instead of these jarring changes you see in today 's interfaces also if i want to add something to a pile well how do i do that i just toss it
to the pile and it 's added right to the top it 's a kind of nice way
also some of the stuff we can do is for these individual icons we thought i mean how can we play with the idea of an icon and push that further and one of the things i can do is make it bigger if i want to emphasize it and make it more important but what 's really cool is that since there 's a physics simulation running under this it 's actually heavier so the lighter stuff it
so it 's cute but it 's also like a subtle channel of conveying information right this is heavy so it feels more important so it 's kind of cool despite computers everywhere paper really hasn 't disappeared because it has a lot of i think valuable
and you know toss it to the corner
also just like paper around our workspace we 'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later and i can do the same thing here and you know you 'll see post it notes and things like that around people 's offices and i can pull them off when i want to work with them
so one of the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that you know okay well my real desk is really messy i don 't want that mess on my computer so one thing we have for that is like a grid align kind of
so you get that more traditional desktop things are kind of grid aligned more boring but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping and you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop
toss these things around they 're so much more tangible and touchable and you know i can double click on something to take a look at it and i can do all that kind of same stuff i showed you before so i can pile things up i can flip through it
