people don't seem to understand me and i was looking around and i found this wonderful picture
where is art i got productivity i got sports and somehow the idea that one would want to make art for the iphone which
my friends and i are doing now is still not reflected in our understanding of what computers are for so from both directions there is kind of i think a lack of understanding about what it could mean to be an artist who uses the materials of his own day or her own day
a lot of my work is about trying to get away from this this a photograph of the desktop of a student of mine and when i say desktop i don't just mean the actual desk where his mouse has worn away
the surface of the desk if you look carefully you can even see a hint of the apple menu up here in the upper left where the virtual world has literally punched through to the physical so
as joy mountford once said the mouse is probably the narrowest straw you could try to suck all of human expression through and
the thing i'm really trying to do is enabling people to have more rich kinds of interactive experiences how can we get away from the mouse and use our full bodies as a way of exploring aesthetic experiences not necessarily utilitarian ones so
i write software and that's how i do it and a lot of my experiences resemble mirrors in some way because this is in some sense the first way that people discover
their own potential as actors and discover their own agency by saying who is that person in the mirror oh it's actually me and so to give an example
this is a project from last year which is called the interstitial fragment processor and it allows people to explore the negative shapes that they create when they're just going about their everyday business
so as people make shapes with their hands or their heads and so forth or with each other
shapes literally produce sounds and drop out of thin air basically taking what's often this kind of unseen space or this undetected space and making it something real that people then can appreciate and become creative
so again people discover their creative agency in this way and their own personalities come out in totally unique ways so
top yeah so as he says here most people answer without any hesitation so what we're really seeing here is a phenomenon called phonaesthesia which is a kind of synesthesia that all of you have
seventy years on there's been some research where cognitive psychologists have actually sussed out the extent to which you know l m and b are more associated with shapes that look like this and p t and k are perhaps more associated with shapes like this
here we suddenly begin to have a mapping between curvature that we can exploit numerically a relative mapping between curvature and
so it occurred to me what happens if we could run these backwards and thus was born the project called remark which is a collaboration with zachary lieberman and the ars electronica futurelab
and this is an interactive installation which presents the fiction that speech casts visible shadows so the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light
and as you do you see the shadows of your own speech and they sort of fly away out of your head if a computer speech recognition system is
able to recognize what you're saying then it spells it out and if it isn't then it produces a shape which is very phonaesthetically tightly coupled to the sounds you made so let 's bring up a video of that
project we've developed a form of intelligent real time subtitles so these are our live subtitles that are being produced by a computer
that knows the text of the ursonate fortunately jaap does too very well and it is delivering that text at the same time
all the text you're going to see is real time generated by the computer
see the set up where there is a screen with the subtitles so
is someone making them afterwards and then a bunch of people who were like what 's the big deal i see subtitles all the time on television
you know they don't imagine the person in the booth typing it all so in addition to the full body and in addition to the voice another thing that i've been really interested in most recently is the use of the eyes or the gaze in terms of how people relate to each other
a fairly big distance away how these little tiny balls are actually pointing in one way or another to reveal what you're interested in and where your attention is directed so there is a lot of emotional communication that happens there and so i've been
beginning with a variety of different projects to understand how people can relate to machines with their eyes and basically to ask the questions what if
was aware that we were looking at it how could it respond in a way to acknowledge or subvert the fact that we're looking at it and what could it do if it could look back at us
the trace left by the looking of the previous observer looks at the trace left by the looking of previous observer the idea is that it's an image wholly constructed from its own history
of being viewed by different people in an installation so let me just switch over so we can do the live demo so
and you can see here that what it's doing is it's recording my eyes every time i blink and i can
so each person is looking at the looking of everyone else before them and this exists in larger installations where there are thousands and thousands of eyes that people could be staring at as you see who 's looking
at the people looking at the people looking before them so i'll just add a couple more blink blink and you can see just once again how it's sort of finding my eyes and doing its best
so that's this kind of recursive observation system
the last couple pieces i'm going to show are basically in the new realm of robotics for me new for me it's called opto isolator and i'm going to show a video of the older version of it which is just a minute long
in this case the opto isolator is blinking in response to one 's own blinks so it blinks one second after you do this is a device which is intended to reduce
the phenomenon of gaze down to the simplest possible materials just one eye looking at you and eliminating everything else about a face but just to consider gaze in an isolated way as a kind of
and at the same time it attempts to engage in what you might call familiar psycho social gaze behaviors like looking away if you look at it too long because it gets shy or things like that
snout with a googly eye
and inside it's got an eight hundred pound robot arm that i borrowed
to have good friends i'm at carnegie mellon we've got a great robotics institute there i'd like to show you thing called snout which is the idea behind this project is to
the idea is that basically if it's
other name is doubletaker taker of doubles it's always kind of doing a double take what and the idea is basically can it look at you
and make you feel as if like what is it my shoes
something on my hair here we go
there is the skeleton which is actually what it's trying to do
really about trying to create a novel body language for a new creature hollywood does this all the time of course but also have the body language communicate something to the person who is looking at it this language is communicating that it is surprised to see you and it's interested in looking at you
thank you very much that's all i've got for today and i'm really happy to be here thank you so much
