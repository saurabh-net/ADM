but nothing nothing prepared me for what i was to hear on the first of july two thousand and eight i heard the word carcinoma yes breast cancer as i sat dumbstruck in my doctor 's office
i heard other words cancer stage grade until then cancer was the zodiac sign of my friend stage was what i performed on and grades were what i got in school
that day i realized i had an unwelcome uninvited new life partner
i realized then that i who thought i had complete control of my life had control of only three things
wanting to go to a place of healing health and happiness i wanted to go from where i was to where i wanted to be
but to go from where i was to where i wanted to be i needed something i needed an anchor an image a peg to peg this process on so that i could go from there and i found that in my dance
my dance my strength my energy my passion my very life breath
but it wasn 't easy believe me it definitely wasn 't easy how do you keep cheer when you go from beautiful to bald in three days
so i would drag myself into my dance studio body mind and spirit every day into my dance studio and learn everything i learned when i was four all over again reworked relearned regrouped it was excruciatingly painful but i did it difficult
i focused on my mudras on the imagery of my dance on the poetry and the metaphor and the philosophy of the dance itself and slowly i moved out of that miserable state of mind
astride her lion into the battlefield to destroy mahishasur
the passion of my training i brought laser sharp focus into my dance laser sharp focus to such an extent that i danced a few weeks after surgery
i danced through chemo and radiation cycles much to the dismay of my oncologist i danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule
what i had done is i had tuned out of cancer and tuned into my dance
yes cancer has just been one page in my life
my story is a story of overcoming setbacks obstacles and challenges that life throws at you
she was also called simhanandini the one who rode the lion
as i ride out as i ride my own inner strength my own inner resilience armed as i am with what medication can provide and continue treatment as i ride out into the battlefield of cancer asking my rogue cells to behave
i want to be known not as a cancer survivor but as a cancer conqueror i present to you an excerpt of that work simhanandini
