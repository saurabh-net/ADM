thank you very much i have a few pictures and i'll talk a little bit about how i'm able to do what i do all these houses
are built from between seventy and eighty percent recycled material stuff that was headed to the mulcher the landfill the burn pile it was all just gone this is the first house i built
this double front door here with the three light transom that was headed to the landfill have a little turret there and then these buttons on the coribles here
right there those are hickory nuts and these buttons there those are chicken eggs of course first you have breakfast
and then you fill the shell full of bondo and paint it and nail it up and you have an architectural button in just a fraction of the time
then this is a look at the inside you can see the three light transom there with the eyebrow windows certainly an architectural antique
cool stove this is going up into the turret i got that staircase for dollar twenty including delivery to my lot
then looking up in the turret you see there are bulges and pokes and sags and so forth well if that ruins your life
well then you shouldn 't live there this is
a laundry shoot and this right here is a shoe last and those are those cast iron things you see at antique shops so i had one of those so i made some low tech gadgetry there
where you just stomp on the shoe last and then the door flies open you throw your laundry down and then if you're smart enough it goes on a basket on top of the washer if not if goes into the
a bathtub i made made out of scrap two by four here started with a rim there and then glued and nailed it up into a then this
faucet here is piece of osage organge it looks a little phallic but after all it's a
is a house based on a budweiser can it doesn't look like a can of beer but the design take offs are absolutely unmistakable the barely hops design worked up into the eaves then the dentil work comes directly off the can 's red white blue and silver
then these coribles going down underneath the eaves are that little design that comes off the can i just put a can on a copier and kept enlarging it until i got the size i want
on the can it says this is the famous budweiser beer we know of no other beer blah blah blah so we changed that and put this is the famous budweiser house we don't know of any other house and so forth and so on
is a deadbolt it 'd a fence from a nineteen thirties shaper which is a very angry woodworking machine and they gave me the fence but they didn't give me the shaper so we made a deadbolt out of
the shower is intended to simulate a glass of beer we've got bubbles going up there then suds at the top with lumpy tiles where do you get lumpy tiles
well of course you don 't but i get a lot of toilets and so you just dispatch a toilet with a hammer and then you have lumpy tiles and then
the faucet there is a beer tap
then this panel of glass is the same panel of glass that occurs in every middle class front door in america we're getting tired of it it's kind of cliched now so if you put it in the front door
design fails so don't put it in the front door put it somewhere else it's a pretty panel of glass but then if you put it in the front door people say oh you're trying to be like those guys and you didn't make it so don't put it there
then another bathroom upstairs this light up here is the same light that occurs in every middle class foyer in america don't put it in the foyer put it in the shower or
but not in the foyer then somebody gave me a bidet so
this little house here those branches there are made out of bois d 'ark or osage orange and these pictures will keep scrolling as i talk a little bit
in order to do what i do you have to understand what causes waste in the building industry our housing has become a commodity
and i'll talk a little bit about that but the first cause of waste is probably even buried in our dna human beings have a need for maintaining consistency for the
what it means is for every perception we have it needs to tally with the one like it before or we don't have continuity and we become a little bit disoriented so i can show you an object you've never seen before
that's a cellphone but you've never this one before what you're doing is sizing up the pattern of structural features here and then you go through your
that's a cellphone if i took a bit out of it you'd go wait a second
not a cellphone that's one of those new chocolate cellphones
have to start a new category right between cellphones and
never mind that it doesn't affect our lives at all it only rattles that expected pattern and unity of structural features however if we took a small hammer and we added cracks to all the other windows
then we have a pattern because gestalt psychology emphasizes recognition of pattern over parts that comprise a pattern we'll go ooh that's
that serves me every day repetition creates pattern if i have a hundred of these a hundred of those
it doesn't make any difference what these and those are if i can repeat anything i have the possibility of a pattern from hickory nuts and chicken eggs shards of glass branches
he said that cultures tend to swing between one of two perspectives on the one hand we have an apollonian perspective which is very crisp and premeditated and intellectualized and perfect
or hangs a picture is they'll get out a transit and a laser level and a micrometer
okay honey a thousandth of an inch to the left that's where we want the picture right perfect predicated on plum level square and centered the dionysian personality takes the picture and
feature blemish i feature organic process dead center john dewey apollonian mindset creates mountains of waste if something isn't perfect
if it does line up with that premeditated model dumpster oops scratch dumpster oops this oops that landfill landfill landfill the third thing
is arguably the industrial revolution started in the renaissance with the rise of humanism then got a little jump start
that we up to that point had to do my hand so now we have standardized materials well trees don't grow two inches by four inches eight ten and twelve feet tall
we create mountains of waste and they're doing a pretty good job there in the forest working all the byproduct of their industry with osb and particle board and so forth and so on but it does no good
to be responsible at the point of harvest in the forest if consumers are wasting the harvest at the point of consumption and that's what's
well i feature all those warped things because repetition creates pattern and it's from a dionysian perspective the fourth thing
labor is disproportionately more expensive than materials well that's just a myth and here 's a story jim tulles one of the guys i trained
it's time now i got a job for you as a foreman on a framing crew it's time for you to go dan i just don't think i'm ready jim now it's time
so we hired on and he was out there with his tape measure going through the trash heap looking for header material which is the board that goes over
he said you know if you were paying me dollar three hundred an hour i can see how you might say that but right now i'm saving you five dollars a minute do the math
and we force environmental resources to accommodate that so all have in our head the perfect house the american dream which is a house the
it's a chattel mortgage just like furniture just like a car you write the check and instantly it depreciates thirty percent after a year you can't get insurance on everything you have in it only on seventy percent
wired with fourteen gauge wire typically nothing wrong with that unless you ask it to do what twelve gauge wire 's supposed to do and that's what happens it out gasses formaldehyde so much
that there is a federal law in place to warn new mobile home buyers of the formaldehyde atmosphere danger
are we just being numbingly stupid the walls are this thick the whole thing has the structural value of corn
so i thought palm harbor village was over there no no we had a wind last night it's gone now
then when they degrade what do you do with them now all that
that apollonian platonic model is what the building industry is predicated on and there are a number of things that exacerbate that
one is that all the professionals all the tradesmen vendors inspectors engineers architects all think like this
and then it works its way back to the consumer who demands the same model it's a self fulfilling prophesy we can't get out of it then here come the marketeers and the advertisers
we buy stuff we didn't know we needed all we
to do is look at what one company did with carbonated prune juice how disgusting
but you know what they did they hooked a metaphor into it
my oh my that makes it worse and we get sucked into that faster than anything then a man named jean paul sartre wrote a book titled being and nothingness it's a pretty quick read you can snap through it
maybe two years if you read eight hours a day
there he talked about the divided self he said human beings act differently when they know they're alone than when they know somebody else is around so if i'm eating spaghetti and i know i'm alone
i can eat like backhoe i can wipe my mouth on my sleeve napkin on the table chew with my mouth open make little noises scratch wherever i want
but as soon as you walk in i go
bites chew with my mouth closed no scratching now what i'm doing is fulfilling your expectations of how i should live my life
i feel that expectation and so i accommodate it and i'm living my life according to what you expect me to do that happens in the building industry as well
that's why all of our subdivisions look the same sometimes we even have these formalized cultural expectations i'll bet all your shoes match sure enough we all buy into that
gated communities we have a formalized expectation with a home owners association sometimes those guys are nazis my that
continues this model the last thing is gregariousness human beings are a social species we like to hand together in groups
and so you see this in junior high a lot those kids they'll work all summer long kill themselves
so that they can afford one pair of designer jeans so along about september they can stride in and go i 'm important today see
and so that happens in the building industry as well we have confused maslow 's hierarchy of needs just a little bit
on the bottom tier we have basic needs shelter clothing food water
housing has become a commodity and it takes a little bit of nerve to dive into those primal terrifying parts of ourselves
and make our own decisions and not make our housing a commodity but make it something that bubbles up from seminal sources that takes a little bit of nerve and darn it once in a while you fail but
that's okay if failure destroys you then you can't do this i fail
all the time everyday and i've had some whopping failures i
big public humiliating embarrassing failures everybody points and laughs and they say he tried it a fifth time and it still didn't work what a moron early on contractors come by and say dan you're a cute little bunny but and your instinct is
but you don't say that because they're the guys you're targeting and so what we've done
and this isn't just in housing it's in clothing and food and our transportation needs our energy we sprawl just a little bit and
when i get a little bit of press i hear from people all over the world and we may have invented excess but the problem of waste is
we're in trouble and i don't wear ammo belts crisscrossing my chest and a red bandana but we're clearly in trouble
and what we need to do is reconnect with those really primal parts of ourselves
what we need to do is reconnect with who we really are and that's thrilling indeed thank you very much
