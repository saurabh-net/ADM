i did that for two reasons
first of all i wanted to give you a good visual first impression
i 'm used to a stationary mic it 's the sensible shoe of public address i just become skanky
and i 'm already off message
ladies and gentlemen i have devoted the past twenty five years of my life to designing books
upon arrival there in the fall of one thousand nine hundred and eighty six and doing a lot of interviews i found that the only thing i was offered was to be assistant to the art director at alfred a knopf a book publisher now i was stupid but not so stupid that i turned it down
i had absolutely no idea what i was about to become part of
and i was incredibly lucky soon it had occurred to me what my job was my job was to ask this question
but they all have one thing in common they all need to look like something they all need a face
why to give you a first impression of what you are about to get into
a book designer gives form to content
but also manages a very careful balance between the two now the first day of my graphic design training at penn state university
the teacher lanny sommese came into the room and he drew a picture of an apple on the blackboard and wrote the word apple underneath and he said ok lesson one listen up and he covered up the picture and he said you either say this
and then he covered up the word or you show this
but you don 't do this
because this is treating your audience like a moron
the first was katharine hepburn 's memoirs and the second was a biography of marlene dietrich now the hepburn book
was written in a very conversational style it was like she was sitting across a table telling it all to you the dietrich book was an observation by her daughter it was a biography so the hepburn story is words and the dietrich story is pictures and so we did this
luckily for me i live and work in new york city where there are plenty of dinosaurs
i went to the museum of natural history and i checked out the bones and i went to the gift shop and i bought a book and i was particularly taken with this page of the book
and more specifically the lower right hand corner now i took this diagram and i put it in a photostat machine
and i took a piece of tracing paper
explain it to the youngsters
and i just started to
reconstitute the dinosaur i had no idea what i was doing i had no idea where i was going but at some point i stopped when to keep going would seem like i was going too far and what i ended up with
was a graphic representation of us seeing this animal coming into being we 're in the middle of the process and then i just threw some typography on it
very basic stuff slightly suggestive of public park signage
and so off it goes to the author and even back then michael was on the cutting edge
that was a relief to see that pour out of the machine
and i was thrilled we all know it was an amazing movie and it was so interesting to see it go out into the culture and become this phenomenon and to see all the different permutations of it but not too long ago i came upon this on the web
no that is not me
but whoever it is i can 't help but thinking they woke up one day like oh my god that wasn 't there
but if you think about it from my head to my hands to his leg that 's a responsibility
and it 's a responsibility that i don 't take lightly the book designer 's responsibility is threefold to the reader to the publisher and most of all to the author i want you to look at the author 's book and say wow i need to read that
david sedaris is one of my favorite writers and the title essay in this collection is about his trip to a nudist colony and the reason he went is because he had a fear of his body image and he wanted to explore what was underlying that
for me it was simply an excuse to design a book that you could literally take the pants off of
but when you do you don 't get what you expect you get something that goes much deeper than that and david especially loved this design because at book signings which he does a lot of he could take a magic marker and do this
you get the assignment of select a word and make it look like what it says it is so that 's type one hundred and one right very simple stuff
this is going to be the opposite of that i want this book to look like it 's lying to you
then when we went to press the printer put a spot gloss on the ink and it really looked like it was running not long after it came out augusten was waylaid in an airport and he was hiding out in the bookstore spying on who was buying his books
and the guy behind the counter said i know lady they all came in that way
now that 's a good printing job
a book cover is a distillation it is a haiku if you will of the story this particular story by osama tezuka
is his epic life of the buddha and it 's eight volumes in all but the best thing is when it 's on your shelf you get a shelf life of the buddha moving from one age to the next
all of these solutions derive their origins from the text of the book
but once the book designer has read the text then
he has to be an interpreter
and a translator this story was a real puzzle this is what it 's about
they 've been discovered by the sultan
and now we have to open it up to find out what 's going to happen next try experiencing that on a kindle
much is to be gained by ebooks ease convenience portability but something is definitely lost
tradition a sensual experience the comfort of thingy ness a little bit of humanity do you know what john
all those books he never got tired of it now i am all for the ipad but trust me smelling it will get you nowhere
now the apple guys are texting develop odor emission
and the last story i 'm going to talk about is quite a story
but very similar but different and so
we 're talking about parallel planes of existence sort of like a book jacket and the book that it covers so how do we show this
we go back to hepburn and dietrich but now we merge them so we 're talking about different planes different pieces of paper so this is on a semi transparent piece of velum
it 's one part of the form and content when it 's on top
of the paper board which is the opposite it forms this so even if you don 't know anything about this book you are forced to consider a single person straddling two planes of existence
and the object itself invited exploration interaction consideration and touch
this debuted at number two on the new york times best seller list this is unheard of both for us the publisher and the author we 're talking a nine hundred page book that is as weird as it is compelling and featuring a climactic scene in which a horde of tiny people emerge from the mouth of a sleeping girl and cause a german shepherd to explode not exactly jackie
so that 's my story to be continued what does it look like yes it can it does and it will
but for this book designer page turner dog eared place holder
notes in the margins taker ink sniffer
