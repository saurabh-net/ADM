thank thank you
very much that was whistling
well actually i 've been whistling since the age of four about four my dad was always whistling around the house and i just thought that 's part of communication in my family so i whistled along with him and actually till i was thirty four i always annoyed and irritated people with whistling
because to be honest my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior
i whistled alone i whistled in the classroom i whistled on my bike i whistled everywhere and i also whistled at a christmas eve party with my family in law
so rudolph the red nosed reindeer you know it
she didn 't expect me to go there and i would have lost my face i don 't know if that 's correct english but the dutch people here will understand what i mean
she thought he will never go there but actually i did so i went to louisburg north carolina southeast united states and i entered the world of whistling and i also entered the world championship and i won there in two thousand and four
then i couldn 't participate for a few years and in two thousand and eight i entered again in japan tokyo and i won again so what happened now is i 'm standing here in rotterdam in the beautiful city on a big stage and i 'm talking about whistling and actually i earn my money whistling at the moment
so i quit my day job
i try to live my dream well actually it was never my dream but it sounds so good laughter okay i 'm not the only one whistling here you say huh what do you mean well actually you are going to whistle along
this is very promising this is very promising i 'll ask the technicians to start the music and if it 's started i just point where you whistle along and we will see what happens
i 'm so used to that i start it myself okay here it thank
you thank you
