a ten billion dollar industry i'm talking to you about
to tell you the story of these three children
mother was a woman in prostitution a prostituted person she got infected with hiv
and towards the end of her life when she was in the final stages of aids she could not prostitute so she sold four year old pranitha to a
by many many men i don't know many but the indications of that on her body was that her intestine was outside her body
who she is all that we know that hundreds of men had used her brutally anjali 's father a drunkard sold his child
thousands of children as young as three as young as four are sold into sexual slavery but that's not the only purpose that human beings are sold
i work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation and i tell you stories from there my own journey to work with these children
i don't remember the rape part of it so much as
huge outrageous anger two years i was ostracized i was stigmatized
victim and that's what we do to all traffic survivors we as a society we have phds in victimizing a victim
i started looking around me i started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children who are left in sexual slavery like practices
allow them to come in where does their journey begin most
you have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked i had this i s officer 's daughter who is fourteen years old
from home because she wanted to become a heroine who was trafficked i
thousands of stories of very very well to do families and children from well to do families who are getting trafficked these people
these people into it
through everyday torture because the men who come to them are not men who want to make you
to have a family with you these are men who buy you for an hour for a day and use you throw you
that i have rescued i have rescued more than three thousand two hundred girls each of them tell me one one man
taking a cigarette and burning her one man whipping her we are living among those men they're our brothers fathers
to do what she's doing but the extra bonuses that she gets is various infections sexually transmitted infections hiv aids syphilis gonorrhea you name it
and therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation she believes yes this is it this is what my destiny is about
to get raped by one hundred men a day and it's abnormal to live in a shelter it's abnormal to
it's in that context that i work it's in that context that i rescue children i've rescued children as young as three years and
when i rescued them one of the biggest challenges i had was where do i begin because
i had lots of them who were already hiv infected one third of the people i rescue are hiv positive and
and my
for me i was my greatest experience understanding my own self understanding my own pain my own isolation was my greatest teacher
a very big company a workshop in hyderabad making furnitures she earns around twelve thousand rupees she is an illiterate girl trained skilled as and why not computers
and why not computers we
one of the things that these
crossed the barrier of it and therefore they could fight in a male dominated world very easily and not feel very shy about it
we have trained girls as carpenters as masons as security guards as cab drivers and each one of them
in their chosen field gaining
what has been my challenge my
has not been the traffickers who beat me
been beaten up more than fourteen times in my life i can't hear from my right ear i've lost a staff of mine who was murdered while on a rescue
my biggest challenge is society it's you and me
accept these victims as our own friend of mine
it's very fashionable to talk about human trafficking in this fantastic a c hall it's very nice for discussion discourse making films and everything but it is not nice
to bring them to our homes it's not nice to give them employment in our factories our companies it's not
not only as sunitha krishnan i'm here as a voice of the victims and survivors of human trafficking
they need your compassion they need your empathy they need much more than anything else your acceptance
one way that you can respond to the problem and that's what i'm here for asking for your support demanding for your support requesting for your support
can you break your culture of silence can you speak to at least two persons about this story tell them this story
to tell the story to another two persons i'm not asking you all to become
these people too because they are also a part of us they are also part of this
asking you for these children whose faces you see they're no more they died of aids last year i'm asking you to
who deserve all our support i'm asking you this because no child no human being deserves what these children have gone through thank you
