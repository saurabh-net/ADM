so by now my talk is already six thousand words long and i feel like i should stop here
at the same time i probably owe you some explanation about the images that you just saw what i am trying to do as a photographer as an artist is to bring the world of art and science together whether it is an image of a soap bubble
strange liquids that behave in very peculiar ways or paint that is modeled by centrifugal forces i 'm always trying to link those two fields together
if you look at science on one hand
science is a very rational approach to its surroundings whereas art on the other hand is usually an emotional approach to its surroundings
let me demonstrate this based on three projects
the first one has to do with making sound visible now as you may know sound travels in waves so if you have a speaker
now i was thinking how can i make those sound waves visible
so i came up with the following setup i took a speaker i placed a thin foil of plastic on top of that speaker and then i added tiny little crystals on top of that speaker
and now if i would play a sound through that speaker it would cause the crystals to move up and down now this happens very fast in the blink of an eye
so together with lg we captured this motion with a camera that is able to capture more than three thousand frames per second let me show you what this looks like
thank you very much i agree it looks pretty amazing
but i have to tell you a funny story i got an indoor sunburn doing this while shooting in los angeles now in los angeles you could get a decent sunburn just on any of the beaches but i got mine indoors
lots of lights so we had this speaker set up and we had the camera facing it and lots of lights pointing at the speaker and i would set up the speaker put the tiny little crystals on top of that speaker and we would do this over and over again
and it was until midday that i realized that i had a completely red face because of the lights pointing at the speaker
let me now turn to another project which involves less harmful substances
has anyone of you heard of ferrofluid
so if i now put this liquid into a magnetic field it would change its appearance now i 've got a live demonstration over here to show this to you
so i 've got a camera pointing down at this plate and underneath that plate there is a magnet
now i 'm going to add some of that ferrofluid to that magnet
now this looks already quite interesting but let me now add some watercolors to it those are just standard watercolors that you would paint with you wouldn 't paint with syringes but it works just the same
so what happened now is when the watercolor was flowing into the structure
the watercolors do not mix with the ferrofluid that 's because the ferrofluid itself
is hydrophobic that means it doesn 't mix with the water
and at the same time it tries to maintain its position above the magnet and therefore it creates those amazing looking structures of channels and tiny little ponds of colorful water paint so that was the second project let me now turn to the last project which involves the
the national beverage of scotland
i can assure you i was fully conscious while i was taking those pictures
now whiskey contains forty percent of alcohol and alcohol has got some very interesting properties maybe you have experienced some of those properties before but i am talking about the physical properties not the other ones so when i open the bottle
let me demonstrate this over here
and what i have here is an empty glass vessel it 's got nothing in it and now i 'm going to fill it with oxygen and whiskey
now we just wait for a few seconds for the molecules to spread inside the bottle and now let 's set that on fire
so that 's all that happens it goes really fast and it 's not that impressive i could do it again to show it one more time but some would argue that this is a complete waste of the whiskey and that i should rather drink it
so what happened is that the flame traveled through the glass vessel from top to bottom burning the mix of the air molecules and the alcohol so the images that you saw at the beginning
they are actually a flame stopped in time while it is traveling through the bottle and you have to imagine it was flipped around one hundred and eighty degrees so that 's how those images were made
so i have now showed you three projects and you might ask yourself what is it good for what 's the idea behind it is it just a waste of whiskey is it just some strange materials
those three projects they 're based on very simple scientific phenomena such as magnetism the sound waves or over here the physical properties of a substance
and what i 'm trying to do is i 'm trying to use these phenomena and show them in a poetic and unseen way and therefore invite the viewer to pause for a moment and think about all the beauty that is constantly surrounding us thank you very much
