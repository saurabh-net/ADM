tell you that when i was asked to be here i thought to myself that well it's ted and these tedsters are you know as innocent as that name sounds these are the
is the great unveiling and so i thought i'd come up here and unveil my real voice to you although many of you already know that i do speak the queen 's english because i am from queens new york
the theme of this session of course is invention and while i don't have any patents that i'm aware of
you will be meeting a few of my inventions today and i suppose it's fair to say that i am interested in the invention of self or selves
all born into certain circumstances with particular physical traits unique developmental experiences geographical and historical contexts but then what
to what extent do we self construct do we self invent how do we self identify and how mutable is that identity like what if one could be anyone at any time
well my characters like the ones in my shows allow me to play with the spaces between those questions and so i've brought a couple of them with me
and well they're very excited what i should tell you
i should tell you is that they've each prepared their own little ted talks so feel free to think of this as sarah university
good evening everybody thank you so very much for having me here today ah thank you very much my name is loraine levine oh my there's so many of you hi sweetheart okay
anyway i am here because of a young girl sarah jones she's a very nice young black girl
well you know she calls herself black she's really more like a caramel color if you look at her but anyway
she has me here because she puts me in her show what she calls her one woman show and you know what that means of course
that means she takes the credit and then makes us come out here and do all the work but i don't mind frankly i'm kvelling just to be here with all the luminaries you have
there are so many celebrities running around here i saw glenn close i saw earlier i love her and she was getting a yogurt in the google cafe isn't that adorable
so many others you see they're just wonderful it's lovely to know they're concerned you know and oh i saw
goldie hawn oh goldie hawn i love her too she's wonderful yeah you know she's only half jewish did you know that about
yeah but even so a wonderful talent and i you know when i saw her such a wonderful feeling yeah she's lovely but anyway i
by saying just how lucky i feel it's such an eye opening experience to be here you're all so responsible
for this world that we live in today you know i couldn't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl and
made these advancements happen in such a short time you're all so young you know you're parents must be very proud but
i also appreciate the diversity that you have here i noticed it's very multicultural you know when you're standing up here you can see all the different people it's like a rainbow it's okay to say rainbow
yeah i just i can't keep up with whether you can say you know the different things what are you allowed to say or not say i just i don't want to offend anybody
but anyway you know i just think that to be here with all of you accomplished young people literally some of you the architects building our brighter future
it's heartening to me even though quite frankly some of your presentations are horrifying absolutely
it's true it's true you know between the environmental degradation and the crashing of the world markets you're talking about and of course we know it's all because of the all the
i don't know how else to say it to you so i'll just say it my way the ganeyvish tetikeyt coming from the governments and the you know the bankers and the wall street you know it anyway
the point is i'm happy somebody has practical ideas to get us out of this mess so i salute each of you and your stellar achievements
thank you for all that you do and congratulations on being such big makhers that you've become ted meisters so happy continued success congratulations mozel
i just i'm sorry i'm just trying not to be nervous because this is a very wonderful experience for me and everything and i just you know i'm not used to doing public speaking and
to calm down and take a deep breath but then on top of that you know sarah jones told me we only have eighteen minutes so then i'm like should i be nervous you know because maybe it's better and i'm just trying not to panic and freak out so i like
so anyway what i was trying to say is that i really love ted like i love everything about this it's amazing like it's i can't get over this right now
and like people would not believe seriously where i'm from that this even exists you know like even i mean i love like the name the ted i mean i know it's a real person and everything but i'm just saying that
you know i think it's very cool how it's also an acronym you know which is like you know is like very high concept and everything like that i like that and actually
i can relate to the whole like acronym thing and everything because actually i'm a sophomore at college right now at my school actually i was part of co founding an organization which is like a leadership thing you know like you guys you would really like it and everything and
the organization is called da bomb and da bomb not like what you guys can build and everything it's like da bomb it means like dominican it's an acronym dominican american benevolent organization for mothers and babies is
we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise and who also happen to be mothers like me i am a working mother and i also go to school full time
and you know it's like it's so important to have like role models out there i mean i know sometimes our lifestyles are very different whatever but like even at my job like i just got promoted
but i think whether you own your own company or you're just starting out like me like something like this so vital for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning
and if everybody like all people really had access to that it would be a very different world out there as i know you know so i think all people we need that but especially i look at people like me you know like i mean latinos we're about to be the majority two weeks so
we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange
and i just i love you guys i love ted and if you don't mind privately now in the future i'm going to think of ted as an acronym for technology entertainment and dominicans thank you very much
the older lady you just met very very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother 's side it's a long story believe me
to united nations school where i encountered a plethora of new characters including alexandre my french teacher
you know it was beginner french that i am taking with her you know and it was madame bousson you know she was very
it was like you know she was there in the class you know she was kind of typically french you know she was was very chic but she was very filled with ennui you know and yes i
german for three years and it was quite the experience because i was the only black girl in the class even in the un school
you know it was wonderful the teacher herr schtopf he never discriminated never he always always treated each of us you know equally unbearably during the class so there were the teachers
and then there were my friends classmates from everywhere many of whom are still dear friends to this day and they've inspired many characters as well
for example a friend of mine
and i wanted to start by telling you that once sarah jones told me that we will be having the opportunity to come here to ted in california
i was very pleased and frankly relieved because you know i am a human rights advocate and usually my work it takes me to washington d c
and there i must attend these meetings mingling with some tiresome politicians trying to make me feel comfortable by telling how often they are eating the curry in georgetown so you can just imagine right
but i'm thrilled to be joining all of you here i wish we had more time together but that's for another time
and sadly i don't think we'll have time for you to meet everybody i brought but
to behave myself it's my first time
but i do want to introduce you to a couple of folks you may recognize if you saw bridge and tunnel
well thank you good evening my name is pauline ning and
i want to tell you that i'm of course i am a member of the chinese community in new york
when sarah jones asked me to please come to ted i said well you know first i don't know
that you know before two years ago you would not find me in front of an audience of people much less like this because i did not like to give speeches because i feel that as an immigrant i do not have
good english skills for speaking but then i decided just like governor arnold schwartzenegger i try anyway
my daughter my daughter wrote that she told me always start your speech with humor but my background
i want to tell you story only briefly my husband and i we brought our son and daughter here in nineteen eighties
to have the freedom we cannot have in china at that time and we tried to teach our kids to be proud of their tradition but it's very
as immigrant i would speak chinese to them and they would always answer me back in english
they love rock music pop culture american culture but when they got older
when the time comes for them to start think about getting married that's when we expect them to realize a little bit more their own culture
that's where we had some problems my son he says he is not ready to get married and he has a sweetheart
but she is american woman not chinese it's not that it's bad but i told him what 's wrong with a chinese woman
but i think he will change his mind soon so then i decide instead i will concentrate on my daughter
the daughter 's marriage is very special to the mom but first she said she's not interested she only wants to spend time with her friends and then
at college it's like she never came home and she doesn't want me to come and visit so i said what 's wrong in this picture
so i accused my daughter to have like a secret boyfriend but she told me mom you don't have to worry about boys because i don't like them
and i said yes men can be difficult but all women have to get used to that she said no mom i mean i don't like boys i like girls i am
so i always teach my kids to respect american ideas but i told my daughter that this is one exception
is not gay she is just confused by this american problem
but she told me mom it's not american she said she is in love in love with a nice chinese girl
so these are the words i am waiting to hear but from my son not my
i did not know what to do but then over time i have come to understand
this is who she is so even though sometimes it's still
will share with you that it helps me to realize society is more tolerant
so i think maybe ted you impact people 's lives in the ways that maybe even you don't realize
for my daughter 's sake i thank you for your ideas worth spreading thank you
good evening my name is habbi belahal and i would like to first of all thank sarah jones for putting all of the pressure on the only arab who she brought
to be last today i am originally from jordan and i teach comparative literature at queens college
it is not harvard but i feel a bit like a fish out of water but
i am very proud of my students and i see that a few of them did make it here to the conference so you will get the extra credit i
i know that i may not look like the typical denizen as you would say i do like to make the point that
we in global society we are never as different as the appearances may suggest so if you will indulge me i will share
quickly with you a bit of verse which i memorized as a young girl at sixteen years of age so back in the ancient times and
hold your hand i want to hold your hand i want to hold your hand and when i touch you i feel happy inside
it's such a feeling that my love i can't hide i can't hide i can't
because i was at the same time in my life listening to the
on the radio they were very popular so all of that is to say that i like to believe that for every
to one another there is always a lyric connecting ears and hearts across the continents in rhyme
and i pray that this is the way that we will self invent in time that's all thank you very much for the opportunity okay i
here it's been a long time coming and i feel like i'm home and i know i've performed for some of your companies or some of you have seen me elsewhere but this is honestly one of the best audiences i've ever experienced the whole thing is amazing and so don't you all go reinventing yourselves any time soon
