my english in the mornings it is terrible and the afternoon is
and the afternoon is during many years
i made some speeches starting with this more and more
more and more it's a solution
for the problem of climate change but
we have a very pessimistic approach about the cities i'm working in cities for almost forty years
where every mayor is trying to tell me oh his city is so big or
the other mayors say we don't have financial resources would like to say
from the experience i had every city in the can be improved
in less than three years
there's no matter of scale it's not question of scale it's not question of financial resources every problem in a city
has to have its own equation of co responsibility and also
to start i want to introduce some characters
from a book i made for teenagers
the best example of quality of life when you realize
that the casque of the turtle it looks like an urban the casque off the
how sad she's going to be
and that's we're doing in our cities
living here working here having leisure here
he is invited for a party he never wants to leave
are on the tables and still drinking and he drinks a lot
only one or two people and he asks always
and he asks always for more infrastructure
freeways he 's very demanding person
so and on the other hand
friendly bus he carries three hundred people two hundred and seventy five sweden
sweden three hundred brazilians
speaking about the design every city has its own design my city
thousand people in the city itself
it's like two birds kissing themselves
very easy market street van ness and the
and every city has its own design
but to make it happen sometimes you have to propose a scenario and to propose
a design an idea that everyone or the large majority they'll help you to make it happen
an example of living and working together and this is
where we have more density it's where we have more public transport and so this
and so this and it took
twenty five years until another city which is bogota and they did a very good job
not for only your own city every city
besides its normal problems they have
role a very important role
being with the whole humanity
that means mostly two main issues mobility and sustainability are becoming very important for the cities and this is an articulated bus double articulated
and we are very close to my house you can come when you are in curitiba and have a coffee
what in the design that made the difference is the boarding tubes the boarding
gives to the bus the same
i'm trying to say it's like metro nizing the bus
and this is the design of the bus
and you can pay before entering the bus you're boarding
and for handicapped they can use this as a normal
but what i'm trying to say the major contribution on
carbon emissions are from the cars more than fifty percent
when we depend only on
that's why when we're talking about
and also how to teach the children
speak on this later on
our idea of mobility is trying
to make the connections between all the systems we started in eighty three proposing for the city of rio how to connect the subway with the bus
the subway was against of course and twenty
they called us to develop we're developing this idea and you can understand how different it's going to be the image of rio with the system one minute frequency
and it's not shanghai it's not being colored during the day only at night
it will look this way
before you say it's a norman foster design we designed this in
what i'm trying to say
i'm not trying to prove
system of transport is better
to say we have to combine
to combine all the systems never
never if you have a
if you have a any kind of system
never compete in the same
and coming back to the car i always used to say
is like your mother in law
you have to have good relationship with
but she cannot command your life
is your mother in law
the ideas about how to transform
design old quarries and open universities and botanic garden all of it's related to how we teach the children
and the children we teach during six months how to seperate their garbage
and after the children they teach their parents
and now we have seventy percent
since twenty years is the highest rate of separation of garbage in the so teach the children
i would like to say if we want to have a sustainable
we have to work with
but don't forget the cities
because you cannot have empty places during eighteen hours a day
to understand the sectors in the city that could play different roles during the twenty four hours
another issue is a city 's like our family portrait we don't
our family portrait even if we don't like the nose of our because this portrait
and this are the references we have
city this is the main pedestrian mall we did it in seventy two hours
yes you have to be and this are the
and this are the references from
our ethnic contribution this is the italian portal the ukrainian park the polish
the polish we have people from
we have to stop the program forget creativity
starts when you cut a zero
from your budget if you cut two zeros it's much better
and this is the wire opera theater we did it in two months
parks old quarries that they were
sometimes we took this and we and every part
and every part so in a city
you have to work fast
planning takes time and i'm proposing urban acupuncture that means
me with some focal ideas
to help the normal process of planning and this is
this is or
or thirty two meters
thirty two meters i want just to
you can always propose new materials
new sustainable materials but keep in mind
we have to work fast creativity innovation is starting
creativity innovation is starting and we cannot
and we cannot all the
so when you start and we cannot be so prepotent on having all the answers it's important starting and having the contribution
i would like if you can help me the sustainable song
the sustainable song me just two minutes
you know you're going to make the music and too
make this decision a a avoid carbon emission your
it's possible a a you can do it
