now alex walked into her first session wearing jeans and a big slouchy top
and she dropped onto the couch in my office and kicked off her flats and told me she was there to talk about guy problems
now when i heard this i was so relieved my classmate
and as far as i could tell she was right work happened later marriage happened later kids happened later even death happened later twentysomethings like alex and i had nothing but time
but before long my supervisor pushed me to push alex about her love life i pushed back
i said sure she 's dating down
she 's sleeping with a knucklehead but it 's not like she 's going to marry
and then my supervisor said not yet
but she might marry the next one
that 's what psychologists call an aha moment that was the moment i realized thirty is not the new twenty
that was when i realized that this sort of benign neglect was a real problem and it had real consequences not just for alex and her love life but for the careers and the families and the futures of twentysomethings everywhere
there are fifty million twentysomethings in the united states right now we 're talking about fifteen percent of the population
or one hundred percent if you consider that no one 's getting through adulthood without going through their twenty s first
raise your hand if you 're in your twenty s i really want to see some twentysomethings here oh yay y 'all 's awesome if you work with twentysomethings you love a twentysomething you 're losing sleep over twentysomethings i want to see okay awesome twentysomethings really matter
that claiming your twenty s is one of the simplest yet most transformative things you can do for work for love
for your happiness maybe even for the world
this is not my opinion these are the facts
we know that the brain caps off its second and last growth spurt in your twenty s as it rewires itself for adulthood which means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself
and we know that female fertility peaks at age twenty eight and things get tricky after age thirty five
so your twenty s are the time to educate yourself about your body and your options
so when we think about child development we all know that the first five years are a critical period for language and attachment in the brain it 's a time when your ordinary day to day life has an inordinate impact on who you will become
but what we hear less about is that there 's such a thing as adult development and our twenty s are that critical period of adult development
but this isn 't what twentysomethings are hearing newspapers talk about the changing timetable of adulthood
researchers call the twenty s an extended adolescence
leonard bernstein said that to achieve great things you need a plan and not quite enough time
nothing happens you have robbed that person of his urgency and ambition and absolutely nothing
or they say everybody says as long as i get started on a career by the time i 'm thirty i 'll be fine
but then it starts to sound like this
my twenty s are almost over and i have nothing to show for myself
i had a better resume the day after i graduated from college
and then it starts to sound like this
dating in my twenty s was like musical chairs everybody was running around and having fun but then sometime around thirty it was like the music turned off and everybody started sitting down i didn 't want to be the only one left standing up so sometimes i think i married my husband because he was the closest chair to me at thirty
many of these things are incompatible and as research is just starting to show
the post millennial midlife crisis isn 't buying a red sports car it 's realizing you can 't have that career you now want it 's realizing you can 't have that child you now want or you can 't give your child a sibling
too many thirtysomethings and fortysomethings look at themselves and at me sitting across the room and say about their twenty s what was i doing what was i thinking
i want to change what twentysomethings are doing and thinking here 's a story about how that can go it 's a story about a woman named emma
at twenty five emma came to my office because she was in her words having an identity crisis she said she thought she might like to work in art or entertainment but she hadn 't decided yet so she 'd spent the last few years waiting tables instead
because it was cheaper she lived with a boyfriend who displayed his temper more than his ambition
and as hard as her twenty s were her early life had been even harder
she often cried in our sessions but then would collect herself by saying you can 't pick your family but you can pick your friends
well one day emma comes in and she hangs her head in her lap and she sobbed for most of the hour
she 'd just bought a new address book and she 'd spent the morning filling in her many contacts but then she 'd been left staring at that empty blank that comes after the words in case of emergency please call
she was nearly hysterical when she looked at me and said who 's going to be there for me if i get in a car wreck
who 's going to take care of me if i have cancer
now in that moment it took everything i had not to say i will
but what emma needed wasn 't some therapist who really really cared emma needed a better life and i knew this was her chance
i had learned too much since i first worked with alex to just sit there while emma 's defining decade went parading by
so over the next weeks and months i told emma three things that every twentysomething male or female deserves to hear
first i told emma to forget about having an identity crisis and get some identity capital
by get identity capital i mean do something that adds value to who you are
do something that 's an investment in who you might want to be
i didn 't know the future of emma 's career and no one knows the future of work but i do know this
identity capital begets identity capital
so now is the time for that cross country job that internship that startup you want to try
i 'm not discounting twentysomething exploration here but i am discounting exploration that 's not supposed to count
which by the way is not exploration
second i told emma that the urban tribe is overrated best friends are great for giving rides to the airport but twentysomethings who huddle together with like minded peers limit who they know
what they know how they think
how they speak and where they work
that new piece of capital that new person to date almost always comes from outside the inner circle new things come from what are called our weak ties
our friends of friends of friends
half of new jobs are never posted so reaching out to your neighbor 's boss is how you get that un posted job
it 's not cheating it 's the science of how information spreads
i told emma the time to start picking your family is now
now you may be thinking that thirty is actually a better time to settle down than twenty or even twenty five
and i agree with you but grabbing whoever you 're living with or sleeping with when everyone on facebook starts walking down the aisle is not progress
the best time to work on your marriage is before you have one and that means being as intentional with love as you are with work picking your family is about consciously choosing who and what you want
rather than just making it work or killing time with whoever happens to be choosing you
so what happened to emma well we went through that address book and she found an old roommate 's cousin who worked at an art museum in another state that weak tie helped her get a job there that job offer gave her the reason to leave that live in boyfriend
now five years later she 's a special events planner for museums she 's married to a man she mindfully chose she loves her new career she loves her new family and she sent me a card that said now the emergency contact blanks don 't seem big enough bound for somewhere west
right after takeoff a slight change in course is the difference between landing in alaska or fiji likewise at twenty one or twenty five or even twenty nine
one good conversation one good break one good ted talk can have an enormous effect across years and even generations to come
so here 's an idea worth spreading to every twentysomething you know
it 's as simple as what i learned to say to alex it 's what i now have the privilege of saying to twentysomethings like emma
