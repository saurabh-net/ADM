anderson asked me if i could put the last twenty five years of anti poverty campaigning into ten minutes for ted that 's an englishman asking an irishman to be succinct
he said bono wouldn 't that be a good use of your messianic complex so
at least in my head the journey for justice the march against inequality and poverty really began three thousand years ago civilization just getting started on the banks of the nile some slaves jewish shepherds in this instance
smelling of sheep shit i guess proclaimed to the pharaoh sitting high on his throne we your majesty ness
and they say no no that 's what it says here in our holy book
cut to our century same country same pyramids another people spreading the same idea of equality with a different book this time it 's called the facebook
crowds are gathered in tahrir square they turn a social network from virtual to actual and kind of rebooted the twenty first century
not to undersell how messy and ugly the aftermath of the arab spring has been neither to oversell the role of technology but these things have given a sense of what 's possible when the age old model of power the pyramid
gets turned upside down putting the people on top and the pharaohs of today on the bottom as it were it 's also shown us
that something as powerful as information and the sharing of it can challenge inequality because facts
liberty is usually around the corner even for the poorest of the poor facts that can challenge cynicism and the apathy
that leads to inertia facts that tell us what 's working and more importantly what 's not so we can fix it facts that if we hear them and heed them could help us meet the challenge that nelson mandela made
back in two thousand and five
when he asked us to be that great generation that overcomes that most awful offense to humanity extreme poverty
facts that build a powerful momentum so i thought forget the rock opera forget the bombast
my usual tricks the only thing singing today activist the factivist
because what the facts are telling us
is that the long slow journey
humanity 's long slow journey of equality is actually speeding up look at what 's been achieved look at the pictures these data sets print
since the year two thousand since the turn of the millennium there are eight million more aids patients getting life saving antiretroviral drugs malaria there are eight countries in sub saharan africa that have their death rates cut by seventy five percent
for kids under five child mortality kids under five it 's down by two point six five million a year that 's a rate of seven thousand two hundred and fifty six children 's lives saved each day
let 's just stop for a second actually and think about that have you read anything anywhere in the last week
this fantastic news didn 't happen by itself it was fought for it was campaigned for it was innovated for
and this great news gives birth
to even more great news because the historic trend is this
the number of people living in back breaking soul crushing extreme poverty has declined from forty three percent of the world 's population in one thousand nine hundred and ninety to thirty three percent by two thousand and then to twenty one
percent by two thousand and ten give it up for that
the rate is still too high still too many people unnecessarily losing their lives there 's still work to do but it 's heart stopping
it 's mind blowing stuff and if you live
on less than dollar one point two five a day if you live in that kind of poverty
this is not just data
the best for your kids and
this rapid transition is a route out of despair
and into hope and guess what if the trajectory continues look
where the amount of people living on dollar one point two five a day gets to by two thousand and thirty
for number crunchers like us that is the erogenous zone
and it 's fair to say that i am by now sexually aroused
by the collating of data
of extreme poverty as defined by people living on less than dollar one point two five a day adjusted of course for inflation from a one thousand nine hundred and ninety baseline we do love a good baseline
baseline that 's amazing
now i know that some of you think this progress is all in asia or latin america or model countries like brazil and who doesn 't love a brazilian model but look at sub saharan africa
doubled education completion rates and they too
so the pride of lions
is the proof of concept
there are all kinds of benefits to this for a start
you won 't have to listen to an insufferable little jumped up jesus like myself
so why aren 't we jumping up and down about this well
the opportunity is real but so is the jeopardy we can 't get this done until we really accept that we can get this done
and the next one is really beautiful it 's called momentum
and it 's how we can bend the arc of history
down towards zero just doing the things that we know work so inertia versus momentum there is jeopardy
and of course the closer you get it gets harder we know the obstacles that are in our way right now in difficult times in fact today in your capital
in difficult times some who mind the nation 's purse want to cut life saving programs like the global fund but you can do something about that you can tell politicians that these cuts can cost lives right now
today in oslo as it happens oil companies are fighting to keep secret their payments to governments for extracting oil in developing countries you can do something about that too you can join the one campaign and leaders like
mo ibrahim the telecom entrepreneur we 're pushing for laws that make sure that at least some
of the wealth under the ground ends up
in the hands of the people living above it
of all is not a disease it 's corruption but there 's a vaccine for that too it 's called transparency open data sets
something the ted community is really on it
daylight you could call it
transparency and technology is really turbocharging this it 's getting harder to hide if you 're doing bad stuff
so let me tell you about the
all across uganda young people armed with two g phones an sms social network
exposing government corruption and demanding to know what 's in the budget and how their money is being spent this is exciting stuff
you can 't delete this data from your brain but you can delete
the cliched image of supplicant impoverished peoples not taking control of their own lives you can erase that you really can because it 's not true
every place with a rough semblance of governance
might actually be on their way
with this virtuous data based virus the one we call factivism it 's not going to kill you countless lives
i guess we in the one campaign would love you to be contagious spread it share it pass it on by doing so
you will join us and countless others in what i truly believe
is the greatest adventure ever taken the ever
that mandela asked us to be might we answer that
clarion call with science with reason with facts
and dare i say it factivists have feelings too
some of you know him he set up one of the facebook groups behind the tahrir square
in cairo he got thrown in jail for it but i have his words tattooed on my brain
we are going to win
because we don 't understand politics we are going to win because we don 't play their dirty games we are going to win because we don 't have a party political agenda we are going to win because the tears that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts we are going to win because we have dreams
because the power of the people
than the people in power
