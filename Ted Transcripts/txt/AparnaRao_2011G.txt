i 'm going to take you through glimpses of about eight of my projects done in collaboration with danish artist soren pors we call ourselves pors and rao and we live and work in india
the next work is a sound sensitive installation
so we had these panels on three walls of a room and we had over five hundred of these little pygmies hiding behind them so this is how it works this is a video prototype
this is a video installation called the missing person and we were quite intrigued with playing with the notion of invisibility how would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility so we worked with a company that specializes in camera surveillance and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us
so people would walking into the room and they 'd almost ignore it thinking it was some crap laying around
but as soon as they passed by it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion and it would get exhausted and it would collapse every time laughter so this work is a caricature of an upside down man his head is so heavy full of heavy thoughts that it 's sort of fallen into his hat
and his body 's grown out of him almost like a plant well what he does is he moves around in a very drunken fashion on his head in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement and it 's kind of constrained by that circle because if that circle weren 't there and the floor was very even it would start to wander about in the space and there 's no
so this work was a real technical challenge for us and we worked very hard like most of our works over years to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics and it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall
because if we made it in a way that it would topple over then it would damage itself and if it didn 't fall enough
it wouldn 't instill that fatalism or that sense of wanting to go and help it so i 'm going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario it 's much faster that 's my colleague he 's let it go now he 's getting nervous so he 's going to go catch it but he doesn 't need to because it manages to lift itself up on its own
and the idea was to sort of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe into the familiar form of a teddy bear which is very comforting and intimate
and the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky
