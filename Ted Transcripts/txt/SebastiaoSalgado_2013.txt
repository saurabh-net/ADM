i started to have infection everywhere when i made love with my wife i had no sperm that came out of me that you are dying
we destroyed a lot of our forest as you did here in the united states or you did in india everywhere in this planet to build our development we come to a huge contradiction that we destroy around us everything
this farm that had thousands of head of cattle had just a few hundreds
and we didn 't know how to deal with these and leila came up with an incredible idea a crazy idea she said why don 't you put back the rainforest that was here before you say that you were born in paradise let 's build the paradise again
we started to plant hundreds of thousands of trees only local species only native species where we built an ecosystem identical to the one that was destroyed and the life started to come back in an incredible way
and we built a big environmental project to raise money everywhere here in los angeles in the bay area in san francisco it became tax deductible in the united states we raised money in spain in italy a lot in brazil we worked with a lot of companies in brazil that put money into this project the government
and the life started to come and i had a big wish to come back to photography to photograph again
i wished to photograph the other animals to photograph the landscapes to photograph us but us from the beginning the time we lived in equilibrium with nature and i went i started in the beginning of two thousand and four

all the branches of the trees the leaves that come down create a humid area and they take months and months under the water go to the rivers and maintain our source maintain our rivers this is the most important thing when we imagine that we need water for every activity in life
i want to show you now to finish just a few pictures that for me are very important in that direction
we were starting to construct an educational center that became quite a large environmental center in brazil but you see a lot of small spots in this picture
in each point of those spots we had planted a tree there are thousands of trees now i 'll show you the pictures made exactly in the same point two months ago
about two point five million trees
of about two hundred different species in order
we are doing the sequestration of about one hundred thousand tons of carbon with these trees my friends it 's very easy to do
