and tattoos tell you a lot of stories
if i can ask an indiscreet question how many of you have tattoos
all these things you deal with every day turn out to be electronic tattoos

following you watching your credit scores and what you do to yourself and electronic tattoos

into the past of those you love
and then of course there 's narcissus nobody here would ever be accused or be familiar with narcissus
