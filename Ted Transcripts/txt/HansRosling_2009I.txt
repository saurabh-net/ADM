once upon a time at the age of twenty four i was a student at st john 's medical college in bangalore
i was a guest student during one month of a public health course and that changed my mindset forever the course was good
the indian students were better than me
i was a study nerd i loved statistics from a young age and i studied very much in sweden i used to be in the
quarter of all courses i attended but in st john 's i was in the lower quarter and the
to me that personal experience was the first time in my life that the mindset i grew up with was
and i realized that perhaps the western world will not continue to dominate the world forever
i think many of you have the same sort of personal experience it's that realization of someone you meet that really made you change your ideas about the world it's not the statistics although i tried to make
and i will now here onstage try to predict when that
its dominant position as the leading part of the world as it used to be over thousands of years
i will do that by trying to predict precisely at what year the average income
per person in india in china will reach that of the west and i don't mean the whole economy because to grow an economy of india to the size of u k that's a piece of cake with one billion people
but i want to see when will the average pay the money for each person per month in india and china when will that have reached that of u k and the united states but i
that was the year when queen victoria was able for the first time to communicate with president buchanan through the transatlantic telegraphic cable and they were the first to twitter
and i've been able through this wonderful google and internet to find the text of the telegram sent back from president buchanan to queen victoria and it ends like this
this telegraph is a fantastic instrument to diffuse religion civilization liberty and law throughout the world those are nice words but i got sort of curious of what he meant with liberty and liberty for whom
fifty eight was the year when the courageous uprising against the foreign occupation of india was defeated by the british forces
fifty eight in japan was the year when japan had to sign the harris treaty and accept trade on favorable condition for the u s and they were threatened by those black ships there that had been in
tokyo harbor over the last year but japan in contrast to india and china maintained its national sovereignty and let 's see how much difference that can make and i will do that
by bringing these bubbles back to a gapminder graph here where you can see each bubble is a country the size of the bubble here is the population on this axis as i used to have income per person in comparable dollar
and on that axis i have life expectancy the health of people and i also bring an innovation here i have transformed the
we will see you know
down here can you see how it starts to move there but really really natural sovereignty was good for japan and japan is trying to move up there and it's the new century now health is getting better united kingdom united states
but careful now we are approaching the first world war and the first world war you know we'll see a lot of deaths and economical problems here united kingdom is going down and now
comes the spanish flu also and then after the first world war
they continue up still under foreign domination and without sovereignty india and china are down in the corner not much has happened they have grown their population but not much more
seven india finally gained its independence and they could raise the indian flag and become a sovereign nation
we saw the emergence of the modern china in a way which surprised the world and what happened what happens in the after independence you can see that the health started to improve children started to go to school health services were
the great leap forward when china fell down it was central planning by mao tse tung china recovered then they said nevermore stupid central planning
went up here and india was trying to follow and they were catching up indeed and both countries had the better health but still a very low economy
if a cat is white or black as long as it catches mice because
is what the two cats wanted to do and you can see the two cats being here china and india wanting to catch the mices over there you know
and they decided to go not only for health and education but also starting to grow their economy and the market reformer
that the similarity with india and china in many ways are greater than the differences with them and here they march on and will they catch up this is the big question today there they are today
now what does it mean
but on the other hand guizhou one of the poorest inland provinces of china is there and if i split guizhou into urban and rural the rural part of guizhou goes down there
you see these enormous inequity in china in the midst of fast economic growth and if i would also look at india you have another type of inequity actually in india the geographical macrogeographical difference is not so big
uttar pradesh the biggest of the states here is poorer and has a lower health than the rest of india kerala is flying on top there matching united states in health but not in economy
and here maharashtra with mumbai is forging forward now in india the big inequities are within the state rather than between the states
if it is in the same area where you have a growth center relatively close to where poor people are living no there is one more inequity look there united states
oh they broke my frame washington d c
my friends at gapminder wanted me to show this because there is a new leader in washington who is really concerned about the health system and i can understand
see a business opportunity for kerala helping fix the health system in the
and ahead of them is the whole emerging economies of the world which thomas friedman so correctly called the flat world
you can see that in health and education a large part of the world population is putting forward but in africa and other parts as in rural guizhou in china there is still people with low health and very low economy
we have an enormous disparity in the world but most of the world in the middle are pushing forwards very fast now back to my projections when will it catch up i have to go back to very conventional graph
you see china under foreign domination actually lowered their income and came down to the indian level here whereas u k and united states is getting richer and richer
them to be in two thousand and fourteen now the question is when will the catch up take place look at look at the united states can you see the
but the financial bubbles that's the dot com bubble this is
and it seems this is
so they doesn't seem to go this way these countries they seem to go in
more humble growth way you know and people interested in growth are turning their eyes towards asia i can compare to japan this is japan coming up
you see japan did it like that we add japan to it and there is no doubt that fast catch up can take place can you see here what japan did
japan did it like this until full catch up and then they follow with the other high income economies but the real projections
even more difficult to predict about the past i think i'm in a difficult
position here inequalities in china and india i consider really the big obstacle because to bring the entire population into growth and prosperity
is what will create a domestic market what will avoid social instability and which will make use of the entire capacity of the population
so social investments in health education and infrastructure and electricity is really what is needed in india and china
you know the climate we have great international experts within india telling us that the climate is changing and actions has to be taken otherwise china and india would be the countries
most to suffer from climate change and i consider india and china the best partners in the world in a good global climate policy
but they ain't going to pay for what others who have more money have largely created and i can agree on that but what i'm really worried about is war
and will asia be able to handle that new position of being in charge of being the most mighty and the governors of the world so
avoid war because that always pushes human beings backward now if these inequalities climate and war can be avoided get ready for a world
and it will happen precisely the year
two thousand and forty eight in the later part of the summer in july
july two thousand and forty eight is my one hundredth birthday
in the first session of the thirty ninth ted india get your bookings in time
