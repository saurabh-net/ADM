a walking laboratory of social engagement to resonate other people 's feelings thoughts intentions motivations in the act of being with them
as a scientist i always wanted to measure that resonance that sense of the other that happens so quickly in the blink of an eye we intuit other people 's feelings we know the meaning of their actions even before they happen
we 're always in this stance of being the object of somebody else 's subjectivity we do that all the time we just can 't shake it off it 's so important that the very tools that we use to understand ourselves to understand the world around
autism was devastating they had
they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around
so they may be looking at a light in the ceiling or they may be isolated in the corner
or they might be engaged in these repetitive movements in self stimulatory movements that
of thousands of years of evolution you see babies are born in a state of utter fragility without the caregiver they wouldn 't survive so it stands to reason that nature would endow them with these mechanisms of survival they orient to the caregiver
from the first days and weeks of life
babies prefer to hear human sounds rather than just sounds in the well
the social mind the social brain
think about autism as something that
as babies engage with caregivers they soon realize that
in order to get things they want they also learn to follow other people 's gaze because whatever people are looking at is what they are thinking about
and soon enough they start to learn about the meaning of things
this body of meanings but meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction
those are meanings that are acquired as part of their shared experiences with this is a little
fifteen month old little girl
and she has autism and
and she 's quite oblivious to me imagine if i did that to you and i came two inches from your face you 'd do probably two things wouldn 't you you would recoil you would call the police laughter you would do something because it 's literally impossible to penetrate somebody 's physical space
and not get a reaction we do so remember intuitively effortlessly this is our body wisdom it 's not something that is mediated by our language our body just knows that
and we 've known that for a long time and this is not something that happens to humans only
and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you and that is considered to be a signal
so something that in other species are survival
mechanisms without them they wouldn 't basically live we bring into the context of human beings and this is what we need to simply act act socially now she is oblivious to me and i am so close to her and you think maybe she can see you maybe she can hear you well a few minutes later
she goes to the corner of the room and she finds a tiny little piece of candy an m
autism is the most strongly genetic condition of all developmental disorders
and it 's a brain disorder it 's a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born we now know that there is a very broad spectrum of autism there are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled but there are those that are gifted
there are those individuals who don 't talk at all there are those individuals who talk too much there are those individuals that if you observe them in their school
you see them running the periphery fence of the school all day if you let them to those individuals who cannot stop coming to you and trying to engage you repeatedly relentlessly but often in an awkward fashion without that immediate resonance well
this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time
the societal cost of this condition is huge in the u s alone maybe thirty five to eighty billion dollars and you know what most of those funds are associated with adolescents and particularly adults who are severely disabled
individuals who need wrap around services services that are very very intensive
and those services can cost in excess of sixty to eighty thousand dollars a year
those are individuals who did not benefit from early treatment because now we know but it diminishes considerably
and yet the median age of diagnosis in this country is still about five years
and in disadvantaged populations the populations that don 't have access to clinical services rural populations minorities the age of diagnosis is later still which is almost as if i were to tell you that we are condemning those communities to have individuals with autism whose condition is going to be more severe
the science is there but no science is of relevance if it doesn 't
for the family and for the community at large so this is our view of autism
there are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism in fact we believe that there are going to be something between three hundred and six hundred genes associated with autism and genetic anomalies much more than just genes
and we actually have a bit of a question here because if there are so many different causes of autism
how do you go from those liabilities to the actual syndrome because people like myself
when we walk into a playroom we recognize a child as having autism so how do you go from multiple causes to a syndrome that has some homogeneity and the answer is what lies in between which is development and in fact
we are very interested in those first two years of
it 's hard to do that so we had to create the technologies we had to basically step inside a body we had to see the world through her eyes
and so in the past many years we 've been building these new technologies that are based on eye tracking we can see moment by moment what children are engaging with
well this is my colleague warren jones with whom we 've been building these methods these studies for the past twelve years and you see there
what we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory but in order for us to do that
we had to create these very sophisticated measures measures of how people how little babies how newborns engage with the world moment by moment what is important and what is not well
we created those measures and here what you see is what we call a funnel of attention you 're watching a video
those frames are separated by about a second through the eyes of thirty five typically developing two year olds door opening and shutting
and their brains are being specialized in something we took a construct
they start over here they love people 's eyes and it remains quite stable it sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months
now let 's see what 's happening with babies who became autistic
it 's something very different it starts way up here but then it 's a free fall it 's very much like they brought into this world the reflex that orients them to people but it has no traction
by how social those babies are and what we see in the first six months of life
is that those two groups can be segregated very easily and using these kinds of measures and many others what we found out is that our science could in fact identify this condition early on we didn 't have to wait for the behaviors of autism to emerge
if we also did not
an infrastructure for intervention for treatment we need to be able
to work with the families to support the families to manage those first years with them
we need to be able to really go from universal screening to universal access to treatment because those treatments are going to change these children 's and those families lives
one feels really rejuvenated there is a sense that the science that one worked on can actually have those experiences that
really started in my journey in this field i thought at the time that this was an intractable condition no longer
we can do a great deal of things and the idea is not to cure autism that 's not the idea what we want is to make sure
and they can work extremely well in some areas of strength
if you 're working for example in technology and there are those individuals who have always wanted to become
