i was the better at getting and keeping
you were the better at spend and spend
was the better at grubbing and
but who was the better man was the
you were the better with lords and ladies i was the better at pillaging troy i was the
but who was the better man old boy who was i was the better
i was the better you
was the better at procrastination you were the better at quiet debate but who was the better man old but who was the
we come down to it
the most important person in your life if you're lucky enough to know them
my mother was certainly the most important in
eighty six years old she's frail white platinum hair
do they do that why do old ladies go to those hair shops and make those helmets
all the ducks in a row
looks like a much prettier version of margaret thatcher
i wrote this poem for her these are not my beliefs but my mother
has lived by this creed
never look back never look to the
no one is waiting and nothing
never go back never go back never surrender the future you to the
to the to
to and
me stoking the train without a qualm in the world ladies
do it don't do it you think we want you to do it but we don't want you to do it stop it tell them to go to hell
wonderful as they are just leave them alone
to a beautiful lady of a certain age lady lady do not weep
what is gone is gone now sleep turn your pillow doctory your tears count thy sheep
and not thy years nothing good can come of this time rules all my dearest tis but folly to be waging war on one who never lost lady
this is all in vain youth can never come again
we have drunk the summer wine none can make a stitch in time nip and
what is foretold in the womb may not be nor may time
nor may time do i
do i from thy caress
you i could cease to was there one so
lady lady do not weep what is gone is gone against me calm your
against me calm your count thy blessings
has done more for me financially than britain ever has or ever could have done i was born in britain as you have probably guessed
even when on its worst behavior i find myself automatically defending the usa from the sneers of green eyed europhiles playing their greek card to roman you know that now
all empires by definition are bumbling shambolic bullying bureaucratic affairs
certain of the rightness of their cause in infancy as they are corrupted by power in
and gentlemen but it seems to be that the usa 's sins compared to those of many previous empires are of a more moderate
if more pervasive kind let me put this bluntly if americans are so fat stupid and ignorant
my dear friends from birmingham how come they rule the world
hail to the gods of america hail to the gods of america hail to the gods of the dream invictus e pluribus unum
but which of them reigns supreme which is the brahmins of
a sorcerer 's profit on wall street they eye
or is it celebrity status the worship of those we hate or the cult of living forever if
what of the titans of media or hollywood's siren call what of the temples of justice
whose servants enslave us all
what of the brand and the label what of the
and what of the constitution
that bully of last resort hail to the god of america the masses extol
would like to know why i am not a father i who by a miracle have twenty two godchildren
the answer is in this poem which upsets me every time i read it love came to visit me
love came to visit me shy as a fawn but finding me busy with
twenty the torch of resentment was lit my rage at injustice waxed hot as the pits the flux of its lava cleared all in its path comrades and enemies fled from its yet lovers grew wary
yet lovers grew wary once novelty waned
to lie with a bloody man
my powers seemed mighty to me
the fruits of my rivals i shook from the tree by guile and by
and by day i battered and scattered the fools from my and women grew willing
we feasted and reveled and rutted in muck forgetting our peril forgetting to duck forgetting times arrows are and
and finding me busy she
finding me busy she with the dawn
there are i've got far too much money and i have far too much fun in my businesses
so poetry came as a complete shock to me ladies and gentlemen a complete shock i was a little ill
any of my you know whatever so in the end i begged a pack of post it notes off a nurse and from another nurse i begged a pencil
and i didn't know what else to do so i started to write poetry that was in october of two thousand
i'm not an evil man but sometimes i try to put myself in an evil man 's position
i'm not a glorious and fantastic looking woman who men fall down you know when she walks in a room but sometimes i try to put myself in that position not with much success but it's interesting to me i love to write historical verse
i love to think what they thought what it was like because although
it all but human nature doesn't change mate my friends human nature is exactly the same as it was
of the last neanderthal and battered the bastard to death you think we didn't do that
we did we killed every single one of them inch by inch we killed them we hunted them down
for meat rivals for berries we're still doing it
with all of the genius assembled in this room
our natures haven't changed a single iota and they never will even when we've got
and we've put some of our eggs in some other baskets and
i spent eight years running one of the most successful publishing businesses in the world
seven o'clock every night i took me some more girls already corrupted i never did anything to anyone that wasn 't and i took crack cocaine every single night for seven years
the offshoots of crack cocaine is that you keep an erection for about four hours it was absolutely unbelievable
stopped because i thought if i got caught what would happen to my mother
if you're a woman remember that our lady in white
she was listless and soft to the touch
generous mistress whom many loved much shoulder to shoulder night after night we hoarded and sold her our lady in white we
to savor her crystal caress we craved but
we dabbled and babbled denying our thirsts
but always we scrabbled to lie with her
absent we missed her grew haggard and limp toyed with her sister or threatened
came word out of babel the lady returns and
sensing the power that tyranny craves there in that hour she made us her slaves many there were to
my shame the better man
