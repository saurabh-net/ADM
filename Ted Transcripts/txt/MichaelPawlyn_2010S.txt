the nearest we 've come is with aramid fiber and to make that it involves extremes of temperature extremes of pressure and loads of pollution and yet the spider manages to do it at ambient temperature and pressure with raw materials of dead flies and water it does suggest we 've still got a bit to learn
this beetle can detect a forest fire at eighty kilometers away that 's roughly ten thousand times the range of man made fire detectors and what 's more this guy doesn 't need a wire connected all the way back to a power station burning fossil fuels
so these two examples give a sense of what biomimicry can deliver if we could learn to make things and do things the way nature does we could achieve factor ten factor one hundred maybe even factor one thousand savings in resource and energy use
and if we 're to make progress with the sustainability revolution i believe there are three really big changes we need to bring about firstly radical increases in resource efficiency
secondly shifting from a linear wasteful polluting way of using resources to a closed loop model and thirdly changing from a fossil fuel economy to a solar economy and for all three of these i believe biomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we 're going to need
you could look at nature as being like a catalog of products and all of those have benefited from a three point eight billion year research and development period
and given that level of investment it makes sense to use it so i 'm going to talk about some projects that have explored these ideas and let 's start with radical increases in resource efficiency when we were working on the eden project we had to create a very large greenhouse in a site that was not only irregular but it was continually changing because it was still being quarried
studying pollen grains and radiolaria and carbon molecules helped us devise the most efficient structural solution using hexagons and pentagons
the next move was that we wanted to try and maximize the size of those hexagons and to do that we had to find an alternative to glass which is really very limited in terms of its unit sizes
and in nature there are lots of examples of very efficient structures based on pressurized membranes so we started exploring this material called etfe it 's a high strength polymer and what you do is you put it together in three layers you weld it around the edge and then you inflate it
and the great thing about this stuff is you can make it in units of roughly seven times the size of glass and it was only one percent of the weight of double glazing so that was a factor one hundred saving
and what we found is that we got into a positive cycle in which one breakthrough facilitated another so with such large lightweight pillows we had much less steel with less steel we were getting more sunlight in
which meant we didn 't have to put as much extra heat in winter and with less overall weight in the superstructure there were big savings in the foundations
and at the end of the project we worked out that the weight of that superstructure was actually less than the weight of the air inside the building so i think the eden project is a fairly good example of how ideas from biology can lead to radical increases in resource efficiency
delivering the same function but with a fraction of the resource input
and actually there are loads of examples in nature that you could turn to for similar solutions so for instance you could develop super efficient roof structures based on giant amazon water lilies whole buildings inspired by abalone shells super lightweight bridges inspired by plant cells there 's a world of beauty and efficiency to explore here
using nature as a design tool
so now i want to go onto talking about the linear to closed loop idea the way we tend to use resources is we extract them we turn them into short life products and then dispose of them nature works very differently in ecosystems the waste from one organism becomes the nutrient for something else in that system
now the really clever bit is what they did with the cardboard waste and i 'm just going to talk through this animation so they were paid to collect it from the restaurants they then shredded the cardboard and sold it to equestrian centers as horse bedding
when that was soiled they were paid again to collect it they put it into worm recomposting systems which produced a lot of worms which they fed to siberian sturgeon which produced caviar which they sold back to the restaurants
so it transformed a linear process into a closed loop model and it created more value in the process
graham wiles has continued to add more and more elements to this turning waste streams into schemes that create value and just as natural systems tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time there 's a real sense with this project that the number of possibilities just continue increasing
and i know it 's a quirky example but i think the implications of this are quite radical because it suggests that we could actually transform a big problem waste into a massive opportunity and particularly in cities we could look at the whole metabolism of cities and look at those as opportunities and that 's what we 're doing on the next project i 'm going to talk about the mobius project
then we would have an anaerobic digester which could deal with all the biodegradable waste from the local area turn that into heat for the greenhouse and electricity to feed back into the grid we 'd have a water treatment system treating wastewater turning that into fresh water and generating energy from the solids using just plants and micro organisms
we 'd have a fish farm fed with vegetable waste from the kitchen and worms from the compost and supplying fish back to the restaurant and we 'd also have a coffee shop and the waste grains from that could be used as a substrate for growing mushrooms
so you can see that we 're bringing together cycles of food energy and water and waste all within one building
and just for fun we 've proposed this for a roundabout in central london which at the moment is a complete eyesore some of you may recognize this
and with just a little bit of planning we could transform a space dominated by traffic into one that provides open space for people reconnects people with food and transforms waste into closed loop opportunities
so the final project i want to talk about is the sahara forest project which we 're working on at the moment it may come as a surprise to some of you to hear that quite large areas of what are currently desert were actually forested a fairly short time ago so for instance when julius caesar arrived in north africa huge areas of north africa were covered in cedar and cypress forests
and during the evolution of life on the earth it was the colonization of the land by plants that helped create the benign climate we currently enjoy the converse is also true the more vegetation we lose the more that 's likely to exacerbate climate change and lead to further desertification
and this animation this shows photosynthetic activity over the course of a number of years and what you can see is that the boundaries of those deserts shift quite a lot and that raises the question of whether we can intervene at the boundary conditions to halt or maybe even reverse desertification
and if you look at some of the organisms that have evolved to live in deserts there are some amazing examples of adaptations to water scarcity this is the namibian fog basking beetle and it 's evolved a way of harvesting its own fresh water in a desert
the way it does this is it comes out at night crawls to the top of a sand dune and because it 's got a matte black shell is able to radiate heat out to the night sky
and become slightly cooler than its surroundings
so when the moist breeze blows in off the sea you get these droplets of water forming on the beetle 's shell
just before sunrise he tips his shell up the water runs down into his mouth has a good drink goes off and hides for the rest of the day and the ingenuity if you could call it that goes even further because if you look closely at the beetle 's shell there are lots of little bumps on that shell and those bumps are hydrophilic they attract water
so even when there 's only a small amount of moisture in the air it 's able to harvest that very effectively and channel it down to its mouth so amazing example of an adaptation
to a very resource constrained environment and in that sense very relevant to the kind of challenges we 're going to be facing over the next few years next few decades we 're working with the guy who invented the seawater greenhouse this is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions and the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills
and you trickle seawater over that so that wind blows through it picks up a lot of moisture and is cooled in the process so inside it 's cool and humid which means the plants need less water to grow and then at the back of the greenhouse it condenses a lot of that humidity as freshwater in a process that is effectively identical to the beetle
and what they found with the first seawater greenhouse that was built was it was producing slightly more freshwater than it needed for the plants inside so they just started spreading this on the land around
and the combination of that and the elevated humidity had quite a dramatic effect on the local area this photograph was taken on completion day and just one year later it looked like that so it was like a green inkblot spreading out from the building turning barren land back into biologically productive land and in that sense going beyond sustainable design to achieve restorative design
so we were keen to scale this up and apply biomimicry ideas to maximize the benefits
and when you think about nature often you think about it as being all about competition but actually in mature ecosystems you 're just as likely to find examples of symbiotic relationships
so an important biomimicry principle is to find ways of bringing technologies together in symbiotic clusters and the technology that we settled on as an ideal partner for the seawater greenhouse is concentrated solar power which uses solar tracking mirrors to focus the sun 's heat to create electricity and just to give you some sense of the potential of csp
consider that we receive ten thousand times as much energy from the sun every year as we use in energy from all forms ten thousand times so our energy problems are not intractable it 's a challenge to our ingenuity
and the kind of synergies i 'm talking about are firstly both these technologies work very well in hot sunny deserts
csp needs a supply of demineralized freshwater that 's exactly what the seawater greenhouse produces csp produces a lot of waste heat we 'll be able to make use of all that to evaporate more seawater and enhance the restorative benefits
and finally in the shade under the mirrors it 's possible to grow all sorts of crops that would not grow in direct sunlight so this is how this scheme would look the idea is we create this long hedge of greenhouses facing the wind
we 'd have concentrated solar power plants at intervals along the way some of you might be wondering what we would do with all the salts
and with biomimicry if you 've got an underutilized resource you don 't think how am i going to dispose of this you think what can i add to the system to create more value
and it turns out that different things crystallize out at different stages when you evaporate seawater the first thing to crystallize out is calcium carbonate and that builds up on the evaporators and that 's what that image on the left is
gradually getting encrusted with the calcium carbonate so after a while we could take that out use it as a lightweight building block
and if you think about the carbon in that that would have come out of the atmosphere into the sea and then locked away in a building product
the next thing is sodium chloride you can also compress that into a building block as they did here
this is a hotel in bolivia and then after that there are all sorts of compounds and elements that we can extract like phosphates that we need to get back into the desert soils to fertilize them and there 's just about every element of the periodic table in seawater so it should be possible to extract valuable elements like lithium for high performance batteries and
in parts of the arabian gulf
the seawater the salinity is increasing steadily due to the discharge of waste brine from desalination plants and it 's pushing the ecosystem close to collapse now we would be able to make use of all that waste brine we could evaporate it to enhance the restorative benefits and capture the salts
transforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity
really the sahara forest project is a model for how we could create zero carbon food abundant renewable energy in some of the most water stressed parts of the planet as well as reversing desertification in certain areas
so returning to those big challenges that i mentioned at the beginning radical increases in resource efficiency closing loops and a solar economy they 're not just possible they 're critical and i firmly believe that studying the way nature solves problems will provide a lot of the solutions
but perhaps more than anything what this thinking provides is a really positive way of talking about sustainable design
far too much of the talk about the environment uses very negative language
but here it 's about synergies and abundance and optimizing and this is an important point antoine de saint exupery once said if you want to build a flotilla of ships you don 't sit around talking about carpentry no you need to set people 's souls ablaze with visions of exploring distant shores and that 's what we need to do so let 's be positive
