making a whole bunch of money and having a lot of impact to how frank gehry redefined what it meant to be an architect and one of my biggest failures as a marketer in the last few years
record label i started that had a cd called sauce before i can do that i've got to tell you about sliced bread and a guy named otto rohwedder now before sliced bread was invented in the nineteen
i wonder what they said like the greatest invention since the telegraph or something but this guy named otto rohwedder invented sliced bread and he focused like most inventors did
that the success of sliced bread like the success of almost everything we've been talking about at this conference is not always about what
patent is like or what the factory is like it's about can you get your idea to spread or not and i think that the way that you're going to get what you want or cause the change that you want to change to happen
or you're flying hot air balloons i think that all this stuff applies to everybody regardless of what we do
that what we are living in is a century of idea diffusion that people who can spread ideas regardless of what those ideas are
when i talk about it i usually pick business because they make the best pictures that you can put in your presentation and because it's the easiest sort of way to keep score
but i want you to forgive me when i use these examples because i'm talking about anything that you decide to spend your time to do at the heart of spreading ideas is tv and stuff like tv
tv and mass media made it really easy
to spread ideas in a certain way i call it the tv industrial complex the way the tv industrial complex works is you buy some ads interrupt some people
that gets you distribution you use the distribution you get to sell more products you take the profit from that
and that model of and we heard it yesterday if we could only get onto the homepage of google if we could only figure out how to get promoted there if we could only figure out how to grab that
well this tv industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours i mean all of these products succeeded
is they canceled the tv industrial complex that just over the last few years what anybody who markets anything
hydrate it's one hundred and eighty pages
about water right articles about water ads about water imagine
coke japan comes out with a new product every three weeks because they have no idea what's going to work and what's not so you can see
now i had tried to imagine what could possibly be in an animated tv commercial featuring tom arnold that would get you to get in your car drive across town and buy a roast beef sandwich
now this is copernicus and he was right when he was talking to anyone who needs to hear your idea the world revolves around me
me me me me me my favorite person me
i don't want to get email from anybody i want to get
so consumers and i don't just mean people who buy stuff at the safeway i mean people at the defense department who might buy something or people at you know the new yorker who might print your article consumers
don't care about you at all they just don't care part of the reason is they've got way more choices than they used to and
to do is just ignore stuff and my parable here is you're driving down the road look a cow nobody
if the cow was purple isn't that a great special effect i could do that again if you
you'd notice it for a while i mean if all cows were purple you'd get bored with those too the thing that's going to decide what gets talked about what gets done what gets changed what gets purchased what gets built is is it remarkable
and remarkable 's a really cool word because we think it just means neat but it also means worth making a remark about
and that is the essence of where idea diffusion is going that two of the hottest cars in the united states is a fifty five thousand dollar giant car big enough to hold a mini in
full price for both and the only thing they have in common is that they don't have anything in common
every week the number one best selling dvd in america changes it's never the godfather it's never citizen kane it's always some
the rest of us have to figure out how to think that way how to understand that it's not about interrupting people with big full page ads or insisting on meetings with people but it's a totally different sort of process
that determines which ideas spread and which ones don 't this chair they sold a billion dollars worth of aeron chairs by reinventing what it meant to sell a chair they turned a chair from something the purchasing department bought to something that was a status symbol
about where you sat at work this guy lionel poilane the most famous baker in the world he died
a half months ago and he was a hero of mine and a dear friend he lived in paris last year he sold ten million dollars worth of french bread
every loaf baked in a bakery he owned by one baker at a time in a wood fired oven and when lionel started his bakery
the french pooh pooh ed it they didn't want to buy his bread it didn't look like french bread it wasn't what they expected it was neat it was remarkable
and slowly it spread from one person to another person until finally it became the official bread of three star restaurants in paris now he 's in london and he ships by fedex all around the world
what marketers used to do is make average products for average people that's what mass marketing is smooth out the edges
go for the center that's the big market they would ignore the geeks and god forbid the laggards it was all about going for the center
but in a world where the tv industrial complex is broken i don't think that's a strategy we want to use any more i think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people
they're really good at ignoring you but market to these people
because they care these are the people who are obsessed with something and when you talk to them they'll listen because they like listening it's about them
and if you're lucky they'll tell their friends on the rest of the curve and it'll spread it'll spread to the entire curve they have something i call
it's a great japanese word it describes the desire of someone who 's obsessed to say drive across tokyo to try a new ramen noodle place because that's what they do they get obsessed with
to make a product to market an idea to come up with any problem you want to solve that doesn't have a constituency with an otaku is almost impossible
instead you have to find a group that really desperately cares about what it is you have to say talk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends there's a hot sauce otaku but
but people don't because no one 's obsessed with it and thus no one tells their friends krispy kreme has figured this whole thing out krispy kreme has a strategy
and what they do is they enter a city they talk to the people with otaku and then they spread through the city to the people who 've just crossed the street this yoyo right here cost one hundred and twelve dollars but it sleeps for twelve minutes not everybody wants it but they don't care
they want to talk to the people who do and maybe it'll spread these guys make the loudest car stereo in the world
they go ahead and they pick this it's really simple you sell to the people who are listening and maybe just maybe those people tell their friends
so when steve jobs talks to fifty thousand people at his keynote right who are all tuned in from one hundred and thirty countries watching his two hour commercial
that's the only thing keeping his company in business is that those fifty thousand people care desperately enough to watch a two hour commercial and then tell their friends pearl jam ninety
albums released in the last two years every one made a profit how they only sell them on their website
but hospitals are buying it faster than any other model hard candy nail polish doesn't appeal to everybody but to the people who love it they talk about it like crazy can right here
the dutch boy paint company making them a fortune it costs thirty five percent more than regular paint because dutch boy made a can that people talk about because it's remarkable they didn't just slap a new ad on the product they changed what it meant to build
every day two hundred and fifty thousand people go to this site run by two volunteers and i can tell you they are hard graders and
this way by advertising a lot they got this way
being remarkable sometimes a little too remarkable and
this picture frame has a cord going out the back and you plug it into the wall my father has this on his desk and he sees his grandchildren every day
changing constantly and every single person who walks into his office hears the whole story of how this thing ended up on his desk and one person at a time
into a gem oh you like my ring it's my grandmother
to do this what you have to do is figure out what people really want and give it to them a couple of quick rules to wrap up the first one is design is free when you get to scale
and the people who come up with stuff that's remarkable more often than not figure out how to put design to work for them number two
the riskiest thing you can do now is be safe proctor and gamble knows this right the whole model of being proctor and gamble is always about average
very good is boring very good is average it doesn't matter whether you're making a record album or you're an architect or you have a tract on sociology if it's very good it's not going to work because no one 's going to notice it so my
a product that does not need to be in the refrigerated section next to the milk in the refrigerated section sales tripled why milk milk milk milk milk not milk
for the people who were there and looking at that section it was remarkable they didn't triple their sales with advertising they tripled it by doing something remarkable
that is a remarkable piece of art you don't have to like it but a forty foot tall dog made out of bushes in the middle of new york city is remarkable
frank gehry didn't just change a museum he changed an entire city 's economy by designing one building
that people from all over the world went to see now at countless meetings at you know the portland city council or who knows where
they said we need an architect can we get frank gehry because he did something that was at the fringes and my big failure i came out
record album and hopefully a whole bunch of record albums in sacd format this remarkable new format and i marketed it straight to people with twenty thousand dollar stereos people with twenty thousand dollar stereos don't like new music
so what you need to do is
figure out who does care
is a map of soap lake washington as you can see if that's nowhere it's in the middle of it
but they do have a lake and people used to come from miles around to swim in the lake they don't anymore so the founding fathers said we 've got some money to spend what can we build here and like most committees
they were going to build something pretty safe and then an artist came to them this is a true artist 's rendering he wants to build a fifty five foot tall lava lamp in the center of town
