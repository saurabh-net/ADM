thank you very much like the speaker before me i am that's the ted virgin i guess i'm also the first time here and
i have another piece that i'd like to play for you it's called abegg variations by robert schumann a german nineteenth century composer
the name abegg abegg is actually a b e g g and that's the main theme in the melody
that comes from the last name of one of schumann 's female friends
but he wrote that for his wife
now comes the part that
because mister anderson told me that this session is called sync and flow i was wondering what do i know that these geniuses don
so i'll talk about musical composition even though i don't know where to start how do i compose i think yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to compose
what i do first is i make a lot of little musical ideas you can just improvise here at the piano and i choose one of those to become my main theme my main melody like the abegg that you just heard
and once i choose my main theme i have to decide out of all the styles in music what kind of style do i
and this year i composed a romantic style so for inspiration i listened to liszt and tchaikovsky and all the great romantic composers
next i make the structure of the entire piece with my teachers they help me plan out the whole piece and then the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas because then you have to think
and then when the piece takes somewhat of a solified form solidified excuse me solidified form you're supposed to
and another thing that i enjoy doing is drawing drawing because i like to draw you know japanese anime art i think that's a craze among teens right now
and once i realized it there's a parallel between creating music and creating art because for your motive or your
like am i going to use one page am i going to draw it on the computer am i going to use a two page spread like a comic book for more grandiose effect i guess
and then you have to do the initial sketch of the character which is like your structure of a piece and then you add pen and pencil and whatever details that you need that's polishing the drawing
and another thing that both of these have in common is your state of mind because i don't i'm one of those teenagers that are really easily distracted so
i'm trying to do homework
i'm trying to do homework and i don't feel like it i'll try to draw or you know waste my time
and sometimes if you manage to use your time wisely and work on it you'll get something out of it but it doesn't come naturally
what happens is if something magical happens if something natural happens to you you're able to produce all this beautiful stuff instantly
and then that's what i consider flow because that's when everything clicks and you're able to do anything you feel like you're on top of your game and you can do anything you want
i'm not going to play my own composition today because although i did finish it it's way too long instead i'd like to try something called improvisation
i have here seven note cards one with each note of the musical alphabet and i'd like someone to come up here and choose five
come up here and choose five and then i can make it into some sort of melody and i'll improvise it
yes five cards any five cards ok
d and f too familiar
would you mind reading them out in the order that you chose them gh ok
you very much gh you're welcome and what about these
now she chose c g b a e i'm going to try to put that in some sort of order
ok that's nice so i'm going to have a moment to think and i'll try to make something out of it
