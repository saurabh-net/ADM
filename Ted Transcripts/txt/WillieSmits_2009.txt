that evening i came back to the market in the dark and i heard
and sure enough i found a dying orangutan baby on a garbage heap of course the cage was salvaged i took up the little baby massaged her forced her to drink until she finally started breathing normally
this is uce she's now living in the jungle of sungai wain and this is matahari her second son which by the way is also
the second orangutan i rescued dodoy that changed my life quite dramatically and as of today i have almost one thousand babies in my two centers no no no wrong
it's horrible it's a proof of our failing to save them in the wild it's not good this is merely proof of everyone failing to do the right thing having
all the orangutans in all the zoos in the world together just now like victims for every baby six have disappeared from the forest
the deforestation especially for oil palm to provide biofuel for western countries is what's causing these problems and those are the peat swamp forests on twenty meters
the largest accumulation of organic material in the world when you open this for growing oil palms you're creating co two volcanoes
that are emitting so much co two that my country is now the third largest emitter of greenhouse gasses in the world after china and the united states and we don't have any industry at all
only because of this deforestation and these are horrible images i'm not going to talk too long about it but there are so many of the family of uce which are
not so fortunate to live out there in that forest that still have to go through that process and i don't know anymore where to put them so i decided that i had to come up with a solution
but also a solution that will benefit the people that are trying to exploit those forests to get their hands on the last
timber and that are causing in that way the loss of habitat and all those victims so i created the place samboja lestari and the idea was
if i can do this on the worst possible place that i can think of where there is really nothing left no one will have an excuse to say yeah but no
in two thousand and two we had about fifty percent of the people jobless there there was a huge amount of crime people spent so much of their money on health
drinking water there was no agricultural productivity left this was the poorest district in the whole province and
it was a total extinction of wildlife this was like a biological desert when i stood there in the grass it's hot not even the sound of insects just this waving grass
still four years later we have created jobs for about three thousand people the climate has changed i will show you no more flooding no more fires it's no longer
the poorest district and there is a huge development of biodiversity we've got over one thousand species we have one hundred and thirty seven
bird species as of today we have thirty species of reptiles so what happened here we created a huge
economic failure in this forest so basically the whole process of destruction has gone a bit slower than what is happening now with the oil palm
but we saw the same thing we had slash and burn agriculture people cannot afford the fertilizer so they burn the trees and half the minerals available there
the fires become more frequent and after a while you're stuck with an area of land where there is no fertility left there are no trees left
and there is all these animals and all these people happy and there's this economic value so how 's this possible it was quite simple if you look at the steps we bought the land we dealt with the fire
and then only we started doing the reforestation by combining agriculture with forestry only then we set up the infrastructure and management and the
but we made sure that in every step of the way the local people were going to be fully involved so that no outside forces would be able to interfere with that that the people would become the defenders
that forest so we do the people profit planet principles but we do it in addition a sure legal status because if the forest belongs to the state people say it belongs to me it belongs to everyone
and then we apply all these other principles like transparency professional management measurable results
what we did was we formulated recipes how to go from a starting situation where you have nothing
to a target situation you formulate a recipe based upon the factors you can control whether it be the skills or the fertilizer or
choice and then you look at the outputs and you start measuring what comes out now in this recipe you also have the cost you also know how much labor is needed
if you can drop this recipe on the map on a sandy soil on a clay soil on a steep slope on flat soil you put those different recipes if you combine them
out of that comes a business plan comes a work plan and you can optimize it for the amount of labor you have available or for the amount of fertilizer you have and you can do it this is how it
and to shake out the grasses and after eight years they might actually yield some timber that is if you can preserve it in the right way
have a very high risk of losing everything again so we plant it later along the waterways to filter the water provide the raw products just in time for when the timber becomes available so the idea is
how to integrate these flows in space over time and with the limited means you have
so we plant the trees we plant these pineapples and beans and ginger in between to reduce the competition for the trees the crop fertilizer organic material
is useful for the agricultural crops for the people but also helps the trees the farmers have free land the system yields early income the orangutans get healthy food
and we can speed up ecosystem regeneration while even saving some money so beautiful what march april may
we lost five point five million hectares in just a matter of a few months this is because we have ten thousand of those underground fires that you also have in pennsylvania here
in the united states and once the soil gets dried you're in a dry season you get cracks oxygen goes in flames come out and the problem starts all over again
because it was that dark we lost all the crops no children gained weight for over a year they lost twelve iq points it was a disaster for orangutans and people
so these fires are really the first things to work on that was why i put it as a single point up there and you need the local people for that because these grasslands once they start burning
it goes through it like a windstorm and you lose again the last bit of ash and nutrients to the first rainfall going to the sea killing off the coral reefs there
so you have to do it with the local people that is the short term solution but you also need a long term solution so what we did is we created a ring of sugar palms around the area
sugar palms turn out to be fire resistant also flood resistant by the way and they provide a lot of income for local people this is how it looks like
the people have to tap them twice a day just a millimeter slice and the only thing you harvest is sugar water
and you can create so much energy from this because they produce three times more energy per hectare per year
because you can tap them on a daily basis you don't need to harvest or any other of the crops so this is the combination where
we have all this genetic potential in the tropics which is still unexploited and doing it in combination with technology but also your legal side needs to be in very good order so we bought that
and here is where we started our project in the middle of nowhere and if you zoom in a bit you can see that all of this area is divided into strips that go over different types of soil
and we were actually monitoring measuring every single tree in these two thousand hectares five thousand acres
and this forest is quite different what i really did was i just followed nature and nature doesn't know monocultures
but a natural forest has multilayers that means that both in the ground and above the ground it can make better use of the available light it can
store more carbon in the system it can provide more functions but it's more complicated it's not that simple and you have to work with the people
so what we do is also just like nature we grow fast planting trees and underneath that we grow the slower growing primary grain forest trees of a very high diversity that can optimally use that light and then
what is just as important get the right fungi in there that will grow into those leaves bring back the nutrients to the roots of the trees that have just dropped that leaf within twenty four hours and they become like nutrient pumps and you need the bacteria to fix nitrogen and
without those microorganisms you won 't have any performance at all and then we started planting only one thousand trees a day we could have planted many many more but we didn't want to because
we wanted to keep the number of jobs stable we didn't want to lose the people that are going to work in that plantation
and we do a lot of work here we use indicator plants to look what soil types or what vegetables will grow or what trees will grow here
and we have monitored every single one of those trees from space this is what it looks like in real you have this irregular ring around it with strips of one hundred meters wide with sugar palms that can provide
income for six hundred and forty eight families it's only a small part of the area the nursery in here is quite different if you look at the number of tree species we have in europe for instance from the urals up to england you know how many
which makes it work that you can go from this zero situation by planting the vegetables and the trees or directly the trees in the lines in that grass there putting up the buffer zone producing your compost
and then making sure that at every stage of that upgrowing forest there are crops that can be used in the beginning maybe pineapples and beans and corn in the second phase there will be bananas and papayas later on there will be
and chilis and then slowly the trees start taking over bringing in produce from the fruits from the timber from the fuel wood and finally the sugar palm forest takes over and provides the people with permanent income
on the top left underneath those green stripes you see some white dots those are actually individual pineapple plants that you can see from space and in that area we started growing some
trees that you just saw before so this is after one year and this is after two years and
if you look from the tower this is when we start attacking the grass we plant in the seedlings mixed with the bananas the papayas all the crops for the local people but the trees are growing up fast in between as well and three years later one hundred and thirty seven species of birds
we lowered air temperature three to five degrees celsius air humidity is up ten percent cloud cover i'm going to show it to you is up rainfall is up and all these species earn income
this ecolodge that i built here three years before was an empty yellow field
this transponder we operate with the european space agency that gives us the benefit that every satellite that comes over to calibrate itself is taking a picture those pictures we use to analyze how much carbon how the forest is developing
and we can monitor every tree using that satellite images through our corporation but we can use
to provide other regions with recipes and the same technology we actually have it already with google earth if you would use a little bit of
which company is stealing the timber and you could save so much more carbon than with any measure of saving energy here
so this is the samboja lestari area you measure how the trees grow back but you can also measure the biodiversity coming back and biodiversity is an indicator of how much water
can be balanced how many medicines can be kept here and finally i made it into the rain machine because
this forest is now creating its own rain this nearby city of balikpapan has a big problem with water it's eighty percent surrounded by seawater and we have now a lot of intrusion there
now we looked at the clouds above this forest so we looked at the reforestation area semi open area and open area and look at these images
just run them very quickly through in the tropics raindrops are not formed from ice crystals like is the case in the temperate zones you need the trees with
chemicals that come out of the leaves of the trees that initiate the raindrops so you create a cool place where clouds can accumulate and you have the trees to initiate the rain and look
let 's look at the next year and you can see that that trend is continuing where at first we had a small cap of higher rainfall that cap is now widening and getting higher
and if we look at the rainfall pattern above samboja lestari it used to be the driest place but now you see consistently a peak of rain forming there so you can actually
change the climate when there are trade winds of course the effect disappears but afterwards as soon as the wind stabilizes you see again that the rainfall peaks come back above this area
so to say it is hopeless is not the right thing to do because we actually can make that difference if you integrate the various technologies
and it's nice to have the science but it still depends mostly upon the people on your education we have our farmer schools
but the real success of course is our band because if a baby is born we will play so everyone 's our family and you don't make trouble with your family
this is how it looks we have this road going around the area which brings the people electricity and water from our own area we have the zone with the sugar palms and then we have this fence with very thorny palms to keep the orangutans
that we provide with a place to live in the middle and the people apart and inside we have this area for reforestation
as a gene bank to keep all that material alive because for the last twelve years not a single seedling of the tropical hardwood trees has grown up
the climatic triggers have disappeared all the seeds get eaten so now we do the monitoring on the inside from towers satellites ultralights
each of the families that have sold their land now get a piece of land back and it has two nice fences of tropical hardwood trees you have the shade trees planted in year one then you underplanted with the sugar palms and you plant this thorny fence
and after a few years you can remove some of those shade trees the people get that acacia timber which we have preserved with the bamboo peel
but whatever you do in that program it has to be fully supported by the people meaning that you also have to adjust it to the local cultural values
there is no simple one recipe for one place you also have to make sure that it is very difficult to corrupt that it's transparent
like here in samboja lestari we divide that ring in groups of twenty families if one member trespasses the agreement and does cut down trees the other nineteen members have to decide what's going to happen to him
if the group doesn't take action the other thirty three groups have to decide what is going to happen to the group that doesn't comply with those great deals that we are offering them
it is the cooperative they have a democratic culture there so there you can use the local justice system to protect
your system so in summary if you look at it in year one the people can sell their land to get income but they get jobs back in the construction and the reforestation working with the orangutans they can use the waste wood to make handicraft they also get free land
in between the trees where they can grow their crops they can now sell part of those fruits to the
they get all these other benefits environmentally money they get education it's a great deal and everything is based upon that one thing
make sure that forest remains there so if we want to help the orangutans what i actually set out to do
we must make sure that the local people are the ones that benefit now i think the real key to doing it to give a simple answer is integration
if you want to know more
