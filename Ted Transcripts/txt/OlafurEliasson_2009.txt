cue on here which is down there in the snow just last weekend
in the studio we do a lot of experiments i would consider the studio more like a laboratory i have occasional meetings with scientists and
how we do things but why we do things do you mind looking with me at that little cross in the center there so just keep looking don't mind me so you will see a yellow circle and we will do an after image experiment
when the circle goes away you will have another color the complementary color i am saying something and your eyes and your brain are saying something back
since two years now with some stipends from the science ministry in berlin i've been working on these films where we produce the film together
i don't necessarily think the film is so interesting obviously this is not interesting at all in the sense of the narrative but nevertheless what the potential is and just keep looking there what the potential is
is to kind of move the border of who is the author and who is the receiver who is the consumer if you want
and who has responsibility for what one sees i think there is a socializing dimension in kind of moving that border
who decides what reality is this is the tate modern in london the show was in a sense about that it was about a space in which i put
put a mirror in the ceiling and some fog some haze and my idea was to make the space tangible with such a big space the problem is obviously that there is a discrepancy between what your body can
and what happens is that people they start to see themselves in this space so look at this look at the girl of course they have to look through a bloody camera in a museum right that's how museums
how do we configure the relationship between our body and the space how do we reconfigure it how do we know that being in a space makes a difference do you see when i said in the beginning it's about why rather than how
why meant really what consequences does it have when i take a step what does it matter does it matter if i am in the world or not and does it matter whether the kind of actions i take
among other places the green dye is not environmentally dangerous but it obviously looks really rather frightening and it's
on the other side also i think quite beautiful it somehow shows the turbulence in these kind of downtown areas in these different places of the world the green river
i think something that art in a sense was always working with the idea that art can actually evaluate the relationship between
what it means to be in a picture and what it means to be in a space what is the difference the difference between thinking and doing
so these are different experiments with that i won 't go into them iceland lower right corner my favorite place
is an experiment i did for bmw an attempt to make a car it's made out of ice a crystaline stackable principle in the center on the top which i am trying to turn into a concert hall in iceland
a sort of a run track or a walkway on the top of a museum in denmark which is
going around so the movement with your legs will change the color of your horizon and at the hyde park in london with the serpentine gallery a kind of a temporal pavilion where moving was the only way you could see the
this summer in new york there is one thing about falling water which is very much about the time it takes for water to fall it's quite simple and fundamental
how big it is it doesn't really tell you what you're looking at the moment you start to move the mountain starts to move the big mountains far away they move less the small mountains in the foreground they move more
and if you stop again you wonder is that a one hour valley or is that a three hour hike or is that a whole day i'm looking at if you have a waterfall in there right out there at the horizon you look at the waterfall and you go
the water is falling really slowly and you go my god it's really far away and it's a giant waterfall if a waterfall is falling faster it's a smaller waterfall which is closer by because the speed of falling water
has had an interest in somehow playing around with the sense of space you could say that new york wants to seem as big as possible
adding a measurement to that is interesting the falling water suddenly gives you a sense of oh brooklyn is exactly this much the distance between brooklyn and manhattan in this case the
part of a space rather than having a body which is just in front of a picture and ha ha there is a picture and here is i and what does it matter
a sense of consequences so if i have a sense of the space if i feel that the space is tangible if i feel there is time if there is a dimension i could call time
i also feel that i can change the space and suddenly it makes a difference in terms of making space
one could say this is about community collectivity it's about being together how do we create public space what does the word public mean today anyway
so asked in that way i think it raises great things about parliamentary ideas democracy public space being together being
how do we create an idea which is both tolerant to individuality
and also to collectivity without polarizing the two into two different
of course the political agendas in the world has been very obsessed polarizing the two against each other into different very normative ideas i would claim that
and culture and this is why art and culture are so incredibly interesting in the times we're living in now have proven that one can create
a kind of a space which sensitive to both individuality and to collectivity it's very much about this causality consequences it's very much about the way we link
thinking and doing so what is between thinking and doing and right in between thinking and doing i would say there is experience and experience is not just
kind of entertainment in a non committal way experience is about responsibility having an experience is taking part in the world
taking part in the world is really about sharing responsibility so art in that sense i think
