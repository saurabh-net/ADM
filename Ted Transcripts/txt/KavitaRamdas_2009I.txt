not me i am interested in how women are saving us
they 're saving us by redefining and re imagining a future that defies and blurs accepted polarities polarities we 've taken for granted for a long time like the ones between modernity and tradition first world and third world
oppression and opportunity in the midst of the daunting challenges we face as a global community there 's something about this third way raga that is making my heart sing
what intrigues me most is how women are doing this despite a set of paradoxes that are both frustrating and fascinating
why is it that women are on the one hand viciously oppressed by cultural practices and yet at the same time are the preservers of cultures in most societies
when so many women and girls are beaten raped maimed on a daily basis in the name of all kinds of causes honor religion nationality
what allows women to replant trees to rebuild societies to lead radical non violent movements for social change is it different women
much of my life has been a quest to get some answers to these questions it 's taken me across the globe and introduced me to some amazing people in the process i 've gathered a few fragments that help me shed some light on this puzzle
among those who 've helped open my eyes to a third way are a devout muslim in afghanistan
a group of harmonizing lesbians in croatia
and a taboo breaker in liberia i 'm indebted to them as i am to my parents who for some set of misdemeanors in their last life were blessed with three daughters in this one and for reasons equally unclear to me seem to be inordinately proud of the three of us
i was born and raised here in india and i learned from an early age to be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles who would bend down pat us on the head and then say to my parents with no problem at all poor things you only have three daughters but
you 're young you could still try again my sense of outrage
about women 's rights was brought to a boil when i was about eleven my aunt an incredibly articulate and brilliant woman was widowed early
her daughter rani a few years older than me sat in her lap bewildered not knowing what had happened to the confident woman she once knew as her mother
i 'm just the youngest brother there 's nothing i can do this is tradition
could not save his own sister from this suffering
eighteen under the excellent tutelage of my mother i was therefore as you might expect defiantly feminist on the streets chanting hindi hindi we
soon after i returned from beijing i leapt at the chance to work for this wonderful organization
she said to me it is not about the burka she was the most
she said the first thing anyone who is a muslim knows is that the koran requires and strongly supports literacy the prophet wanted every believer to be able to read the koran for themselves had i heard right
was a women 's rights advocate invoking religion
she starts every lecture with a prayer but she 's a single feisty financially independent woman in a country where girls are married off at the age of twelve
she is also immensely pragmatic
this headscarf and these clothes she says give me the freedom to do what i need to do to speak to those whose support and assistance are critical for this work
when i had to open the school in the refugee camp i went to see the imam i told him i 'm a believer and women and children in these terrible conditions need their faith to survive
she smiles slyly he was flattered
he began to come twice a week to my center
because women could not go to the mosque and after he would leave women and girls would stay behind we began with a small literacy class to read the koran then a math class then an english class then computer classes in a few weeks everyone in the refugee camp was in our classes
at a time when to educate women is a dangerous business in afghanistan
she is on the taliban 's hit list i worry about her every time she travels across that country she shrugs when i ask her about safety
turning them into instruments of opposition and opportunity
to be a lesbian a dyke a homosexual in most parts of the world including right here in our country india
is to occupy a place of immense discomfort and extreme prejudice in post conflict societies like croatia where a hyper nationalism and religiosity have created an environment unbearable
for anyone who might be considered a social outcast so enter a group of out dykes
young women who love the old music that once spread across that region from macedonia to bosnia from serbia to slovenia
these folk singers met at college at a gender studies program
many are in their twenty s some are mothers many have struggled to come out to their communities in families whose religious beliefs make it hard to accept that their daughters are not sick just queer
we blend the two i see traditional music like a kind of rebellion in which people can really speak their voice
especially traditional songs from other parts of the former yugoslav republic after the war lots of these songs were lost but they are a part of our childhood and our history and we should not forget them improbably this lgbt singing choir
has demonstrated how women are investing in tradition to create change like alchemists turning discord into harmony their repertoire includes the croatian national anthem
a bosnian love song and serbian duets
and leah adds with a grin kavita we especially are proud of our christmas music because it shows we are open to religious practices even though catholic church hates us lgbt
their concerts draw from their own communities yes but also from an older generation a generation that might be suspicious of homosexuality but is nostalgic for its own music and the past it represents one father who had initially balked at his daughter coming out in such a choir now writes songs for them
in the middle ages troubadours would travel across the land singing their tales and sharing their verses lesbor travels through the balkans like this
singing connecting people divided by religion nationality and language bosnians croats and serbs find a rare shared space of pride in their history and lesbor reminds them that the songs one group often claims as theirs alone really belong to
she worried for their lives one night she had a dream she dreamt she and thousands of other women ended the bloodshed the next morning at church she asked others how they felt
they were all tired of the fighting we need peace and we need our leaders to know we will not rest until there is peace among layma 's friends was a policewoman who was muslim she promised to raise the issue with her community
at the next friday sermon the women who were sitting in the side room of the mosque began to share their distress at the state of affairs what does it matter they said a bullet doesn 't distinguish between a muslim and a christian this small group of women determined to bring an end to the war and they chose to use their traditions to make a point
liberian women usually wear lots of jewelry and colorful clothing
but no for the protest they dressed all in white
no makeup as layma said we wore the white saying we were out for peace they stood on the side of the road on which charles taylor 's motorcade passed every day they stood for weeks first just ten then twenty then fifty then hundreds of women wearing white singing dancing saying they were out for peace
eventually opposing forces in liberia were pushed to hold peace talks in ghana
the peace talks dragged on and on and on layma and her sisters had had enough with their remaining funds they took a small group of women down to the venue of the peace talks and they surrounded the building
you can see the policeman 's face he looks embarrassed he backs away and the next thing you know the police have disappeared layma said to me later
i don 't know if he did it because he believed but he knew we were not going to leave we were not going to leave until the peace accord was signed and the peace accord was signed
when she made her presidential address she acknowledged these brave women of liberia who allowed her to win against a football star that 's soccer for you americans no less
women like sakena and leah and layma have humbled me and changed me and made me realize that i should not be so quick to jump to assumptions of any kind
they 've also saved me from my righteous anger by offering insights into this third way
a filipina activist once said to me how do you cook a rice cake with heat from the bottom and heat from the top the protests the marches the uncompromising position that women 's rights are human rights full stop
that 's the heat from the bottom that 's malcolm x and the suffragists and gay pride parades
but we also need the heat from the top and in most parts of the world that top is still controlled by men so to paraphrase marx women make change but not in circumstances of their own choosing
they have to negotiate they have to subvert tradition that once silenced them in order to give voice to new aspirations and they need allies from their communities
allies like the imam allies like the father who now writes songs for a lesbian group in croatia allies like the policeman who honored a taboo and backed away allies like my father
who couldn 't help his sister but has helped three daughters pursue their dreams
maybe this is because feminism unlike almost every other social movement is not a struggle against a distinct oppressor it 's not the ruling class or the occupiers or the colonizers
it 's against a deeply held set of beliefs and assumptions that we women far too often hold ourselves
and perhaps this is the ultimate gift of feminism
that the personal is in fact the political so that as eleanor roosevelt said once of human rights the same is true of gender equality that it starts in small places close to home on the streets yes but also in negotiations at the kitchen table
and in the marital bed and in relationships between lovers and parents and sisters and friends and
to make change we can wear a sari or a hijab or pants or a boubou and we can be party leaders and presidents and human rights lawyers we can use our tradition to navigate change we can demilitarize societies
and pour resources instead into reservoirs of genuine security
it is in these little stories these individual stories that i see a radical epic being written by women around the world it is in these threads that are being woven into a resilient fabric that will sustain communities that i find hope
