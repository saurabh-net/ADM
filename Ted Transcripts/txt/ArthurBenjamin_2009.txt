i would have a suggestion for him that i think would vastly improve the
and algebra and everything we learn after that is building up towards one subject and at top of that pyramid
it's calculus and i'm here to say that i think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid
the correct summit that all of our students every high school graduate should know should be statistics probability and statistics
don't get me wrong calculus is an important subject it's one of the great products of the human mind the laws of nature are written in the language of calculus
and every student who studies math science engineering economics they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college
but i'm here to say as a professor of mathematics that very few people actually use calculus in a
and should use on daily basis right it's risk it's reward it's randomness it's understanding data if it's
it can be a lot of fun i mean probability and statistics it's the mathematics of games and gambling it's analyzing trends it's predicting the future
look the world has changed from analog to digital and it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change from analog to digital from the more classical continuous
to the more modern discrete mathematics the mathematics of uncertainty of randomness of data and that being probability and statistics
in summary instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus i think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean means and i mean it thank you very much
