you will understand nothing with my type of english it's good for you because you can have a
fantastic people i must tell you i am like that not very
because usually in life i think my job is absolutely useless i mean i
after carolyn and all the
i don't know why i am here but you know the nightmare you can have like you are an impostor you arrive at the opera and they push you you must sing i don't know
so so because i have nothing to show to say
about something else we can start if you want by understanding it's just to start it's not interesting but
how i work when somebody comes to me and ask for what i am known i mean yes lemon squeezer toothpick beautiful toilet seats
one we can call it the cynical design that means the design invented by raymond loewy in the fifties who said what
which is terrible it means the design must be just the weapon for marketing for producer to make product
that the cynical design after there is design it's
there is people like me who try to deserve to exist and who are so
to make this useless job who try to do it in another way and they try i try to
make the object for the object but for the result for the profit for the human being the person who will use it if we take the toothbrush i don't think about the toothbrush i think what
in what society this guy live what civilization creates this society
what animal species creates this civilization when i
anything but when i come back i can understand why i shall not do it because today to not
but to come back where i am at the animal species
there is things to see there is things to see there is the big challenge the big challenge in front of us
because there is not a human production which exists
of what i call the big image the
mutation our life we must remember and we can see that yes
there was this soup called soupe primordiale this first soup bloop bloop
sort of dirty mud no life nothing and that
up at the end finally that succeeds and life appears we was so
so stupid the most stupid bacteria even i think we copy our way to reproduce you know what i mean and something of
after we become a fish after we become a frog after we become a monkey after we become what we are today a super monkey
and the fun is the super monkey we are today is at half of the story
can you imagine from that stupid bacteria to us with a microphone with a computer with an ipod four billion years
and we know and especially carolyn that don't know what and
don't know what and four billion years
yes she said something like that ok that means we are
can you imagine it's very symbolic because the bacteria we was had no idea of what we are today
and today we have no idea of what we shall be in four billion years and this territory is
that is our poetry that is our beautiful story it's our
we are mutants and if we don't deeply understand if we don't integrate that we are mutants we completely miss the story
every generation thinks we are the final one we have a way to look at earth like that you know i am the man
we mutate during four billion years before but now because it's me we stop jacket something like that
i am not sure of that
because that is our intelligence of mutation and things like that there is so many things to do it's so fresh
and here is something nobody is obliged to be a genius
but everybody is obliged to participate and to participate for a mutant there is a minimum of
minimum of sport we can say that the first if you want there is so many but one which is very easy to do is the duty of vision
i can explain you i shall try you walk
but perhaps because you walk with the eyes like that you will not see oh there is a hole and you will fall and you will die dangerous that's why perhaps you will try i can see
and they continue up up up i raise the angle of vision
but it's still very selfish selfish egoiste yes selfish you you survive it's ok
if you raise the level of your eyes a little more you go i see you oh my god you are here how are you i can
i can design for you a new toothbrush new toilet brush something like that i live in society i live in community it's ok
to be in the territory of intelligence we can say from this level
more you will be important for the society the more you will rise the more you will be important for the civilization the more you will rise
to see far and high like that the more you will be important for the story of our mutation that means intelligent people are in this angle that
from this to here that
einstein things like that nobody 's obliged to be a genius it's better but nobody
take care in this training to be a good mutant
trap one trap the vertical because at the vertical of us if you look like that when we don't know
when your brain is not enough big when you don't understand you go ah it's god it's god that's ridiculous that's why jump
come back because after there is another trap if you look like that you look
or you look inside if you are very flexible inside yourself it's called schizophrenia and you
that's why every morning now because you are a good mutant you will raise your angle of view out more of the horizontal you
never forget like that like that
it's very very very important what
what else we can say about that why do that it's because we
we look from far we see
of evolution this line of evolution is clearly positive from far this line looks very smooth like that but if you take a lens
that this line is ack ack ack ack ack like that it's made of light
and shadow we can say light is civilization shadow is barbaria and it's very important to know where we are
because some cycle there is a spot in the cycle and you have not the same duty in the different parts of the cycle that means
we can imagine i don't say it was fantastic but in the eighties there was not too much
like that it was we can imagine that the civilization can become
in this case people like me are acceptable we can say it 's luxurious time we have time to think we have time to
so fast so fast to shadow we fall so fast to barbaria
many many many many face of barbaria because it's not the barbaria we have today it's
we think there is different type of barbaria that's why we must adapt that means
when barbaria is back forget the beautiful chairs forget the beautiful
forget design even i'm sorry to say forget art forget all that there is priority there is
you must go back to politics you must go back to radicalization i'm sorry if that's not very english you must go back to fight to battle that's why today i'm so ashamed to make this job that's why
to try to do it the best possible but i know that even i do it the best possible that's why i'm the best it's nothing because it's not the right time that's why i say that i say that
this scenario of this civilization was about becoming powerful intelligent like this idea we have invented this concept of god we are god now
we are it's almost done we have just to finish the story that is very very important and when you don't understand
really what's happened you cannot go and fight and work and build and things like that you go to the future
back back back back like that and you can fall and it's very dangerous no you
because we have almost finished i'll repeat this story and the beauty of this in perhaps fifty years sixty years we can finish completely this civilization and
to our children the possibility to invent a new story a new poetry a new
people who have been born worked lived and died before us these people who have worked so much
we have now bring beautiful things beautiful gifts we know so many things we can say to our children ok
done that was our story that passed now you have a duty invent a new story
a new poetry the only rule is we have not to have any idea about the next story
we give you white pages invent we give you the best tools the best tools and now do
it that's why i continue to work even if it's for toilet brush
