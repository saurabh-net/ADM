today i want to talk to you about ethnic conflict and civil war these are not normally the most cheerful of topics nor do they generally generate the kind of good news that this conference is about
not only is there at least some good news to be told about fewer such conflicts now than two decades ago but what is perhaps more important is that we also have come to a much better understanding of what can be done
to further reduce the number of ethnic conflicts and civil wars
and the suffering that they inflict three things stand out
in the right ways that is
how all of us can contribute to developing and honing the skills
of local and global leaders to make peace
and to make it last but let 's start at the beginning civil wars have made news headlines for many decades now and ethnic conflicts in particular
been a near constant presence as a major international security
for nearly two decades now the news has been
and the images have been haunting
in georgia after years of stalemate we saw a full scale resurgence of violence in august two thousand and eight
this quickly escalated into a five day war between russia and georgia leaving georgia
a decades long civil war
between the tamil minority and the sinhala majority led to a bloody climax in two thousand and nine
in kyrgyzstan just over the last few weeks unprecedented levels of violence occurred between ethnic kyrgyz and ethnic uzbeks hundreds have been killed
and more than one hundred thousand displaced including many ethnic
who fled to neighboring uzbekistan
in the middle east conflict between israelis and palestinians continues unabated
and it becomes ever more difficult to see how
a possible sustainable solution can be achieved
may have slipped from the news headlines but the killing and displacement there continues as well
and the sheer human misery that it creates is very hard to fathom
and in iraq finally violence is on the rise again
and the country has yet to form a government four months after its last parliamentary elections
but hang on this talk is to be about the good news so are these now the images of the past well
there is a longer term trend that does represent some good news
over the past two decades since the end of the cold war there has been an overall decline in the number of civil wars
since the high in the early nineteen nineties with about fifty such civil wars ongoing we now have thirty percent fewer such conflicts today
the number of people killed in civil wars
is much lower today than it was a decade ago
lowest number of combatant casualties occurred in two thousand and three just twenty thousand killed
despite the up and down since then
the overall trend and this is the important
clearly points downward for the past two decades the news about civilian casualties is also less bad than it used to be
a decade later this figure stands at four thousand
but then eight hundred thousand civilians were slaughtered in a matter of just a few months
this certainly is an accomplishment that must never be surpassed
from hunger or disease for example and they also do not properly account for civilian suffering more generally
rape and ethnic cleansing have become highly effective if often non lethal weapons in civil war to put it differently
for the civilians that suffer the consequences of ethnic conflict and civil war
there is no good war
and there is no bad peace
thus even though every civilian killed maimed raped or tortured is one too many the fact that the number of civilian casualties
is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago is good news
we have fewer conflicts today in which fewer people get killed
and the big question of course is why
in some cases there is a military victory of one side
this is a solution of sorts but rarely is it one that comes without human costs or humanitarian consequences
the defeat of the tamil tigers in sri lanka is perhaps the most recent example of this
but we have seen similar so called military solutions
they are complimented by negotiated settlements or at least cease fire agreements and peacekeepers are deployed but hardly ever do they represent a resounding success
the cease fire on tuesday night
was reached just in time for the genocide
to start on wednesday morning
but let 's look at the good news again
if there's no solution on the battlefield three factors can account for the prevention of ethnic conflict and civil war or for sustainable peace and institutional design
take the example of northern ireland thousands of people killed
thousands of people killed ninety eight saw the
was skillfully mediated by senator george mitchell
he imposed very clear conditions for the participation and negotiations
central among them a commitment to exclusively peaceful means
innovative and allowed all conflict parties to see their core concerns and demands addressed
the agreement combines a power sharing arrangement in northern ireland
with cross border institutions that link belfast and dublin
and thus recognize the so called irish dimension of the conflict
and significantly there's also a clear focus on both
the rights of individuals and the rights of communities
the provisions in the agreement may be complex most importantly
local leaders repeatedly rose to the challenge of compromise
not always fast and not always enthusiastically but rise in the
who ever could have imagined ian paisley and martin mcguinness jointly governing northern ireland as first and deputy first minister
the ending of liberia 's long lasting civil war in two thousand and three illustrates the importance of leadership diplomacy and institutional design
as much as the successful prevention of a full scale civil war in macedonia in two thousand and one or the successful ending
the conflict in aceh in indonesia in two thousand and five
in all three cases local leaders were willing and able to make peace the international community stood ready to help them negotiate and implement an agreement
and the institutions have lived up to the promise that they held on the day they were agreed
focusing on leadership diplomacy and institutional design
also helps explain failures to achieve peace or to make it last
local leaders committed to revisiting them later on
by the second intifada the events of nine eleven and the wars in afghanistan and iraq
the comprehensive peace agreement for sudan signed in two thousand and five turned out to be less comprehensive than envisaged and its provisions may yet bear the seeds of a full scale return to war between north and south
more off than on international diplomacy and institutional failures
account for this in almost equal measure
and generally weak state capacity across all of sudan complete a very depressing picture
the state of affairs in africa 's largest country a final example kosovo
the failure to achieve a negotiated solution for kosovo
and the violence tension and de facto partition that resulted from it have their reasons in many many different factors an international diplomatic
concerns of serbs and albanians alike by the same token
and here we have some good news again
the very fact that there is a high level well resourced international presence in kosovo and the balkans region more generally
and international leaders have a choice
and they can make a difference for the better
as good as a cold peace
but a cold peace is still better than a
good news is also about learning the right
so what then distinguishes the israeli palestinian conflict
from that in northern ireland
the civil war in sudan from than in liberia both successes and failures
in the same way in which ethnic conflict and civil war are not natural but man made disasters
their prevention and settlement does not happen automatically either
leadership needs to be capable
determined and visionary in its commitment to peace leaders need to connect to each other and to their
and they need to bring them along on what is an often and arduous journey into a peaceful future
and apply the right mix of incentives and pressures on leaders and followers it needs to help them reach an equitable compromise
and flexible and well funded implementation conflict parties need to move away from maximum demands and towards a compromise
that recognizes each others needs and they need to think about the substance of their agreement much more than about the labels they want to attach to them
for me personally the most critical lesson of all is this
local commitment to peace is all important
but it is often not enough to prevent or
yet no amount of diplomacy or institutional design
can make up for local failures
we must invest in developing that have the skills
that have the skills leaders in other words
leaders in other words that people will trust
and that they will want to follow
ending civil wars is a process that is fraught with
it often takes a generation to accomplish
but it also requires us today 's generation to take responsibility
and to learn the right lessons about leadership diplomacy and institutional design
