chris asked me to tell again how we found the structure of dna and since you know i follow his orders i'll do it but it slightly bores me and
book so i'll say something
say a little about you know how the discovery was made and why francis and i found it and then i hope maybe i have at least five minutes to say what
makes me tick now in back of me is a picture of me when i was seventeen i was at the university of chicago in my third year
and i was in my third year because the university of chicago let you in after two years of high school so you
get away from high school because i was very small and i was no good in sports or anything like that but i should say that my background my father
raised to be an episcopalian and republican but after one year of college he became an atheist and a democrat and
my mother was irish catholic and but she didn't take religion too seriously and by the age of eleven i was no longer going to sunday mass and
going on birdwatching walks with my father so early on i heard of charles darwin
i guess you know he was the big hero and you know you understand life as it now exists through evolution
and at the university of chicago i was a zoology major and thought i would end up you know if i was bright enough maybe getting a phd from cornell then
paper there was a review of a book called what is life by the great physicist schrodinger and that of course had been a question i wanted to know you know darwin explained life after it got started but what was the essence of life
and schrodinger said the essence was information present in our chromosomes and it had to be present
on a molecule i'd never really thought of molecules before you know chromosomes but this was a molecule and
somehow all the information was probably present in some digital form and there was the big question of how did you copy the information
so that was the book and so from that moment on i wanted to
be a geneticist understand the gene and through that understand life so i had you know a hero at a distance it wasn't a baseball player it was linus pauling
and so i applied to caltech and they turned me down so i
to indiana which was actually as good as caltech in genetics and besides they had a really good basketball team so i had
really quite happy life at indiana and it was at indiana i got the impression that you know the gene was likely to be dna and so when i got my phd i should go
so i first went to copenhagen because i thought well maybe i could become a biochemist but i discovered biochemistry was very boring
it wasn't going anywhere toward you know saying what the gene was it was just nuclear science and oh that's the book little book you can read it in about two hours and but then i went to a meeting in italy and
there was an unexpected speaker who wasn't on the program and he talked about dna and this was maurice wilkins he was trained as a physicist and after the war he wanted to do biophysics and he picked dna because
dna had been determined at the rockefeller institute to possibly be the genetic molecules on the chromosomes
dna was the best bet and he showed this x ray photograph
so i wanted to work with him but he didn't want a former birdwatcher and i ended up in cambridge england so i went to cambridge because
in those days it was the domain of the physicists so the best place for x ray crystallography was at the cavendish laboratory at cambridge and
there i met francis crick i went there without knowing him he was thirty five i was twenty three
within a day we had decided that maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure
solve it like you know in rigorous fashion but build a model an electro model using some coordinates of
you know length all that sort of stuff from x ray photographs but just ask what the molecule how should it fold up
and the reason for doing so at the center of this photograph is linus pauling about six months before he proposed the alpha helical structure for proteins and in doing so he banished the man out on the right
who was the cavendish professor this is a photograph several years later when bragg had cause to smile he certainly wasn't smiling when i got there because he
was comparable with the helix so we built a three stranded model the people from london came up wilkins and this
and so we didn't build any models and francis sort of continued to work on proteins and basically i did nothing and
you know basically reading is a good thing you get facts and we kept telling the people in london that linus pauling 's going to move on to dna if dna is that important linus will know it he'll build a model and then
in fact he'd written the people in london could he see their x ray photograph and they had the wisdom to say no so he didn't have it but there was ones in the literature
fifteen months after i got to cambridge a rumor began to appear from linus pauling 's son who was in cambridge said his father was now working on dna
i was scared because i thought you know we may be scooped i have nothing to do no qualifications for anything and so there
was the paper and he proposed a three stranded structure and i read it and it was just it was
was you know unexpected from the world 's and so it was held together by hydrogen bonds between phosphate groups well
the peak ph that cells have is around seven those hydrogen bonds couldn't exist we rushed over to the chemistry department and said could pauling be right and alex hust said no so
we were happy and you know we were still in the game but we were frightened that somebody at caltech
tell linus that he was wrong and so bragg said build models and a month after we got the pauling manuscript
that they should immediately start building models but wilkins said no rosalind franklin was leaving in about two months and after she left
she really you know in one sense she was a chemist but really she would have been trained she didn't know any organic chemistry or
we weren't the best chemists in the room i went in and showed them a pairing i'd done and jerry donohue he was a chemist he
wrong you've got the hydrogen atoms are in the wrong place i just put them down like they were in the books he said they were wrong
so the next day you know after i thought well he might be right so i changed the locations and then we found the base pairing and francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions and we knew we were right
so it was a pretty you know it all happened in about two hours
from nothing to thing and we knew it was big because you know if you just put a next to t and g next to c you have a
so we saw how genetic information is carried it's the order of the four bases so in a sense it is a sort of digital type information
and you copy it by going from strand separating so you know if it didn't work
you might as well believe it because you didn't have any other scheme
that's not the way most scientists think most scientists are really rather dull they said we won 't think about it until we know it's right
but you know we thought well it's at least ninety five percent right or ninety nine percent right so think about
the next five years there were essentially something like five references to our work in nature none and so we were left by ourselves and trying to do the last
part of the trio how do you what does this genetic information do it was pretty obvious that it provided the information to an rna molecule and then how do you go from
so there's a picture of francis and i before i met the girl so i'm still looking happy
there is what we did when we didn't know where to go forward we formed a club and called it the
physicist he designed the tie he was one of the members the question was how do you go from a four letter code to the twenty letter code
proteins feynman was a member and teller and friends
that's the only no we were only photographed twice and on both occasions you know one of us was missing the tie there's francis up on the upper right
of forced i think because the girl i had boy and so
i didn't really get happy until one thousand nine hundred and sixty because then we found out
and that let marshall nirenberg you know take rna synthetic rna put it in a system
so that's the first cracking of the genetic code and it was all
so there that's what chris wanted me to do it was so what happened since then well at that time
should go back when we found the structure of dna i gave my first talk at cold spring harbor the physicist leo szilard he looked at me and said are you going to patent
but he knew patent law and that we couldn't patent it because you couldn 't no use for and so
a useful molecule and the lawyers didn't enter into the equation until one thousand nine hundred and seventy three twenty years later when boyer and
you know could do useful things and then they learned how to read the letters for the code and boom we 've you know had a biotech industry and
but we were still a long ways from you know answering a question which sort of dominated my childhood which is
how do you nature nurture and so i'll go on i'm
out of time but this is michael wigler a very very clever mathematician turned physicist and he developed a technique which
way ahead of affymetrix and we use their technique and what you can
do is sort of compare dna of normal segs versus cancer and you can see
the top that cancers which are bad show insertions or deletions so the dna is really badly mucked up whereas if you have a chance of surviving the dna isn't so
so we think that this will eventually lead to what we call dna biopsies before you get treated for cancer you should really look at this technique and get a feeling of the face of the enemy it's not
it's only a partial look but it's a i think it's going to be very very useful so we started with breast cancer because there's lots of money for it no government money
and now i have a sort of vested interest i want to do it for prostate cancer so you know you
cancer cells looked at normal cells and made a pretty sort of surprising observation which is all of us have about ten places in our genome where we've lost a gene or gained another one
so we're sort of all imperfect and the question is well
around here you know these little losses or gains might not be too bad but if these deletions or amplifications occurred in the wrong gene maybe
so the first disease he looked at for is autism and
reason we looked at autism is we had the money to do it looking at an individual is about three thousand dollars and the parent of a child with asperger 's disease the high intelligence autism
thing to a conventional company they didn't do it couldn't do it by conventional genetics but just scanning it we began to find genes for autism and you can see here
there are a lot of them so a lot of autistic kids are autistic because they just lost a big piece of dna i mean big piece at the molecular level
we saw one autistic kid about five million bases just missing from one of his chromosomes we haven't yet looked at the parents but the parents probably don't have that loss or they wouldn't be parents
so our autism study is just beginning we got three million dollars i think it will cost at least ten to twenty before
you'd be in a position to help parents who 've had an autistic child or think they may have an autistic child and can we spot the difference so this same technique should probably look at all
it's a wonderful way to find genes and so i'll conclude by saying we've looked at twenty people with schizophrenia
and we thought we'd probably have to look at several hundred before we got the picture but as you can see there's seven out of twenty had a change which was
very high and yet in the controls there were three so what's the meaning of the controls were they crazy also and we didn't know it or you know were they
what we think in schizophrenia is there are genes of predisposure and
whether this is one that predisposes and then there's only a sub segment of the population that's capable of being schizophrenic now we don't have really any evidence of
but i think to give you a hypothesis the best guess
is that if you're left handed you're prone to schizophrenia thirty percent of schizophrenic people are left handed
and schizophrenia has a very funny genetics which means sixty percent of the people are genetically left handed but only half of it showed i don't have the time to say now some people who think they're right handed are genetically left
ok i'm just saying that if you think oh i don't carry a left handed gene so therefore my you know children won 't be at risk of schizophrenia you might so
me an extraordinarily exciting time we ought to be able to find the gene for bipolar there's a relationship and
if i had enough money we'd find them all this year
