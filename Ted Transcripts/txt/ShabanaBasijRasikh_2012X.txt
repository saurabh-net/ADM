i remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house
my father was listening to bbc news on his small gray radio
there was a big smile on his face which was unusual then because the news mostly depressed him the taliban are gone
but i could see that my father was very very happy
you can go to a real school now to a secret school
it was the only way we both could be educated
each day we took a different route
so that no one would suspect where we were going
we would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping
the school was in a house
more than one hundred of us packed in one small living room
it was cozy in winter but extremely hot
from time to time the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because taliban were suspicious
we always wondered what they knew about us
i was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized
where education was prized and daughters were treasured
my grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time
a total maverick from a remote province of afghanistan he insisted that his daughter my mom
but my educated mother became a teacher
receive an education including his daughters despite the taliban
despite the taliban despite the risks
there were times i would get so frustrated by our life
and always being scared and not seeing a future
i would want to quit
your money can be stolen you can be forced to leave your home during a war but the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here
and if we have to sell our blood
to pay your school fees
fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school
and had my family not been so committed to my education i would be one of
he not only brags about my college degree but also that i was the first woman and
and that i am the first woman to drive him through the streets of kabul
my family believes in me
that 's why i cofounded sola
where it 's still risky for girls to go to school
the exciting thing is that i see students at my school
with ambition grabbing at opportunity
and i see their parents
and their fathers who like my own
but ahmed is the father of one of my students
less than a month ago he
and his daughter were on their way from sola to their village
that if he sent his daughter back to school
but i will not ruin my daughter 's
future because of your old and backward ideas
what i 've come to realize about afghanistan
and this is something that is often dismissed in the west that behind most of us who succeed
and who sees that her success is his success
it 's not to say that our mothers aren 't key
in our success in fact they 're often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters
but in the context of a society like in afghanistan
we must have the support of men
under the taliban girls who went to school
numbered in the hundreds remember it was illegal
much beyond the u s troops withdrawal
but when i am back in afghanistan
and their parents who advocate for them who encourage them
to me afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities and every single day
