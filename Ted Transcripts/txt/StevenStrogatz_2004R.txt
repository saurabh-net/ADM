was trying to think how is sync connected to happiness and it occurred to me
for some reason we take pleasure in synchronizing
we like to dance together we like singing together and so if you'll put up with this i would like to
notice by the way that when you applauded that you did it in a typical north american way that is you were raucous and incoherent
you think you could do it i would like to see if this audience would no you haven't practiced as far as i know
now that's what we call emergent behavior
so i didn't expect that but i mean i expected you could synchronize it didn't occur to me you'd increase your frequency it's interesting
so what do we make of that first of all we know that you're all brilliant
this is a room full of intelligent people highly sensitive
some trained musicians out there
is that what enabled you to synchronize so to put the question a little more seriously let 's ask ourselves what are the minimum requirements for what you just did for spontaneous synchronization
do you need for instance to be as smart as you are
do you even need a brain at all
do you need to be alive
that's a spooky thought right inanimate objects that might spontaneously synchronize themselves
it's real in fact i'll try to explain today that sync is maybe one of if not
one of the most perhaps the most pervasive drive in all of nature it extends from the subatomic scale
to the farthest reaches of the cosmos
it's a deep tendency toward order in nature that opposes what we've all been taught about entropy i mean i'm not saying the law of entropy is wrong it's not
but there is a countervailing force in the universe the tendency towards spontaneous order and so that's our theme now to get into that
let me begin with what might have occurred to you immediately when you hear that we're talking about synchrony in nature which is the glorious example
birds that flock together or fish swimming in organized schools so
these are not particularly intelligent creatures and yet as we'll see they exhibit beautiful ballets to
we're so used to choreography giving rise to synchrony these creatures are not choreographed they're choreographing themselves you
a computer model made by ian kuzan a researcher at oxford
that shows how swarms work there are just three simple rules first
second all the individuals have a tendency to line up and third they're all attracted to each other
now fish like to stay close together about a body length apart
birds try to stay about three or four body lengths apart but except for that
the rules are the same for both
all this changes when a predator enters the scene
prey move out in random directions and then the rule of attraction brings them back together again
so there's this constant splitting and reforming
and you see that in nature
keep in mind that although it looks as if
each individual is acting to cooperate what's really going on is a kind of selfish darwinian behavior
each is scattering away at random to try to save its scales or feathers
that is out of the desire to save itself each creature is following these rules and that leads to something that's safe for all of them even though it looks like they're thinking as a group
you might wonder what exactly is the advantage to being in a swarm so you can think of several
as i say if you're in a swarm your odds of being the unlucky one are reduced
as compared to a small
there are many eyes to spot danger and you'll see in
the example with the starlings with the birds when this peregrine hawk is about to attack them that actually waves of panic can propagate
sending messages over great distances you'll see
can be sent over half a kilometer away in a very short time through this mechanism
beautiful the birds are we sort of understand we think
from that computer model what's going on as i say it's just those three simple rules plus the one about watch out for predators there doesn't seem to be anything mystical about this
we don 't however really understand at a mathematical level i'm a mathematician we would like to be able to understand better
i mean i showed you a computer model but a computer is not understanding a computer is in a way just another experiment we would really like to have a deeper insight into how this works and to understand
you know exactly where this organization comes from how do the rules give rise to the patterns there is one case that we have begun to understand better and it's the case of fireflies
if you see fireflies in north america like so many north american sorts of things they tend to be independent operators they ignore each other
they each do their own thing flashing on and off paying no attention to their neighbors but in southeast asia places like thailand or malaysia or borneo
there's a beautiful cooperative behavior that occurs among male fireflies you can see it every night along the river banks the trees mangrove trees are filled with fireflies communicating with light
to reinforce a message to the females
to show you a slow motion of a single firefly so that you can get a sense this is a single frame
second there and then watch this whole river bank and watch how precise the synchrony is on more
can use them as navigating beacons to find their way back to their home rivers
you know a human being 's tendency to see patterns where there are none but i hope you've convinced yourself now with this nighttime video that they really were very well synchronized okay well the issue then is do we need to be alive
to see this kind of spontaneous order and i've already hinted that the answer is no
well you don't have to be a whole creature you can even be just a single cell like take for instance your pacemaker cells in your heart right now they're keeping you alive every beat of your heart
depends on this crucial region the sinoatrial node which has about ten thousand independent cells that would each beep
have an electrical rhythm a voltage up and down to send a signal to the ventricles to pump now your pacemaker is not a single cell it's this democracy of ten thousand cells that all have to fire in unison for the pacemaker to work correctly
i don't want to give you the idea that synchrony is always a good idea if you have epilepsy
there is an instance of billions of brain cells or at least millions discharging in pathological concert
so this tendency towards order is not always a good thing
you don't have to be alive you don't have to be even a single cell if you look for instance at how lasers work that would be a case of atomic synchrony
in a laser what makes laser light so different from the light above my head here is that this light is incoherent many different colors
and different frequencies sort of like the way you clapped initially
but if you were a laser
it would be rhythmic applause it would be all atoms pulsating in unison emitting light of one color one frequency
now comes the very risky part of my talk
which is to demonstrate that inanimate things can synchronize
what i have here are two empty water bottles
all right so i've got a metronome and it's the world 's smallest metronome the
well i shouldn 't advertise anyway so this is the world 's smallest metronome i've set it on the fastest setting and i'm going to now take another one set to the same setting
we can try this first if i just put them on the table together
what i'm hoping is that they might just drift apart because their frequencies aren't perfectly the same
right they did they were in sync for a while but then they drifted apart
well they can communicate through mechanical forces
so i'm going to give them a chance to do that i also want to wind this one up
how can they communicate i'm going to put them on a movable platform
which is the guide to graduate study at cornell okay so
's see if we can get this to work
my wife pointed out to me that it will work better if i put both on at the same time because otherwise the whole thing will tip over
right so there we go
i'm not trying to cheat let me start them out of sync no hard to even do that
right so before any one goes out of sync i'll just put those
now that might seem a bit whimsical but
this pervasiveness of this tendency towards spontaneous order
the millennium bridge was supposed to be the pride of london a beautiful new footbridge erected across the thames first river crossing in over one hundred years in london and an engineering firm
and together they submitted a design based on lord foster 's vision which was he remembered as a kid reading flash gordon comic books
and he said that when flash gordon would come to an abyss he would shoot what today would be a kind of a light saber he would shoot his light saber across the abyss
making a blade of light and then scamper across on this blade of light he said that 's the vision i want to give to london i want a blade of light across the thames
so they built the blade of light
and it's a very thin ribbon of steel
the world 's probably the flattest and thinnest suspension bridge there is
that are out on the side you're used to suspension bridges with big droopy cables on the top these cables were on the side of the bridge like if you took a rubber band and stretched it taut across the thames
and within two days the bridge was closed to the public
so i want to first show you some interviews
with people who were on the bridge on opening day who will describe what happened
yeah it felt unstable and it was very windy
just sideways about how much was it moving was at least six
so at least this much
and then show me what it was like when the bridge started to
right so you had to deliberately push your feet out sideways
they deliberately walking in step or anything like that no they just had to conform to the
all right so that really gives you a hint of what happened think of the bridge
as being like this platform
think of the people as being like metronomes
now you might not be used to thinking of yourself as a metronome but after all we do
walk like i mean we oscillate back and forth as we walk and especially if we start to walk like those people did right they all showed this strange
sort of skating gait that they adopted once the bridge started to move and so let me show you now the footage of the bridge but also after you see the bridge on opening day you'll see an interesting clip of work done by
a bridge engineer at cambridge named allan mcrobie
who figured out what happened on the bridge and who built a bridge simulator to explain exactly what the problem was it was a kind of unintended
right so it was quite small
the most dramatic and shocking footage shows
hundreds of people apparently rocking from side to side in unison
this synchronized movement seemed to be driving the bridge the crowd become synchronized
the simulated bridge is finished
and i can make it wobble
this yes this simulated bridge and this you reckon mimics the action of the real bridge
allan mcrobie is a bridge engineer from cambridge who wrote to me suggesting that a bridge simulator ought to wobble in the same way as the real bridge provided we hung it on pendulums of exactly the right length
walk you have to be careful where you put your feet down don't you because
if you get it wrong it just throws you off your feet
so already the simulator is making me walk in exactly the same way as our witnesses walked on the real bridge
for a more convincing experiment i wanted my own opening day crowd the sound check team their instructions just walk normally it's really intriguing because
they're all having some difficulty walking
actually forced by the movement of the bridge to get into step and therefore to drive it to move
all right well with that from the ministry of silly walks maybe i'd better end i see i've gone over but i hope that you'll go outside and see the world in a new way to see all the amazing synchrony around us thank you
