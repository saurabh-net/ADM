my favorite part of being a dad is the movies i get to watch
i love sharing my favorite movies with my kids and when my daughter was four we got to watch the wizard of oz together it totally dominated her imagination for months her favorite character was glinda of course
children 's fantasy spectacular industrial complex
the monkeys are rather aggressive as are the apple trees but i think if the wizard of oz were made today the wizard would say dorothy you are the
savior of oz that the prophecy foretold
use your magic slippers to defeat the computer generated armies of the wicked witch
that 's not how it happens
another thing that 's really unique about the wizard of oz to me
is that all of the most heroic and wise and even villainous characters are female
now i started to notice this when i actually showed star wars to my daughter which was years later and the situation was different at that point i also had a son
he was only three at the time he was not invited to the screening he was too young for that but he was the second child and the level of supervision had plummeted
and it imprinted on him like a mommy duck does to its duckling
and i don 't think he understands what 's going on but he is sure soaking in it and i wonder what he 's soaking in is he picking up on the themes of courage and perseverance and loyalty
is he picking up on the fact that luke joins an army to overthrow the government is he picking up on the fact that there are only boys in the
by the magic that he was born with
compare this to one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine with the wizard of oz how does dorothy win her movie
by making friends with everybody and being a leader
that 's kind of the world i 'd rather raise my kids in oz right and not the world of dudes fighting
which is where we kind of have to be why is there so much force capital f force in the movies we have for our kids and so little yellow brick road there is a lot of great writing about the impact
did not provide the adequate context that i could have used in navigating the adult world that is co ed
i don 't know what i 'm supposed to do the movies are very very focused on defeating the villain and getting your reward and there 's not a lot of room for other relationships and other journeys
it 's almost as though if you 're a boy you are a dopey animal and if you are a girl you should bring your warrior costume there are plenty of exceptions and i will defend
the disney princesses in front of any you but they do send a message to boys that they are not the boys are not really the target audience they are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls
how to defend against the patriarchy but they are not necessarily showing boys how they 're supposed to defend against the patriarchy there 's no models for them and we also have some terrific women who are writing new stories for our kids
and as three dimensional and delightful as hermione and katniss are these are still war movies
and of course the most successful studio of all time continues to crank out classic after classic every single one of them about
the journey of a boy or a man or two men who are friends or a man and his son or two men who are raising a little girl until as many of you are thinking this year when they finally came out with brave i recommend it to all of you it 's on demand now
it 's very good don 't let that stop you now almost none of these movies pass the bechdel test i don 't know if you 've heard of this it has not yet caught on and caught fire but maybe today we will start a movement alison bechdel is a comic book artist and back in the mid eighty s she
recorded this conversation she 'd had with a friend about assessing the movies that they saw and it 's very simple there 's just three questions you should ask is there more than one character in the movie that is female who has lines
and do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie
and is their conversation about something other than the guy that they both like
it does happen i 've seen it and yet i very rarely see it in the movies that we know and love in fact this week i went to see
and i don 't think it should because a lot of the movie i don 't know if you 've seen it but a lot of the movie takes place in this embassy where men and women are hiding out during the hostage crisis we 've got quite a few scenes of the men having deep angst ridden conversations in this hideout
and the great moment for one of the actresses is to peek through the door and say are you coming to bed honey
that 's hollywood for you so let 's look at the numbers two thousand and eleven of the one hundred most popular movies how many of them do you think actually have female protagonists
eleven it 's not bad it 's not as many percent as the number of women we 've just elected to congress so that 's good but there is a number that is greater than this
that 's going to bring this room down
say that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life
now i don 't think that 's the fault of popular entertainment i don 't think
kids movies have anything to do with that
i don 't even think that music videos or pornography are really directly related to that but something is going wrong
and when i hear that statistic one of the things i think of is that 's a lot of sexual assailants
the story that a male hero 's job is to defeat the villain with violence and then collect the reward which is a woman who has no friends and doesn 't speak
are we soaking up that story you know
as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter
like all of you who are doing the same thing
we find this world and this statistic very alarming and we want to prepare them we have tools at our disposal like girl power
and we hope that that will help but i gotta wonder is girl power going to protect them if at the same time actively or passively we are training our sons to maintain their boy power
i mean i think the netflix queue
is one way that we can do something very important and i 'm talking mainly to the dads here
i think we have got to show our sons a new definition of manhood
turning upside down you 've read about how the new economy is changing the roles of caregiver and wage earner they 're throwing it up in the air so our sons are going to have to find some way of adapting to this some new relationship with each other and i think we really have to show them and model for them how a real man
is someone who trusts his sisters and respects them and wants to be on their team and stands up against the real bad guys
who are the men who want to abuse the women
and i think our job in the netflix queue is to look out for those movies that pass the bechdel test if we can find them and to seek out the heroines who are there
who show real courage who bring people together and to nudge our sons to identify with those heroines
and to say i want to be on their team because they 're going to be on their team
maybe it 's not just the sparkly dress i think these people
with other people to help them reach their potential now they are leaders
i like that kind of quest for my daughter and i like that kind of quest for my son i want more quests like that
i want fewer quests where my son is told go out and fight it alone
and more quests where he sees that it 's his job to join a team
maybe a team led by women to help other people thank you
