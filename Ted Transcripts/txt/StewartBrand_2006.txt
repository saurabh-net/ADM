what we have now is the end of the rise of the west that's over the aggregate numbers are overwhelming so what's really going on well villages of the world are emptying out the question is why
here 's the unromantic truth
and the city air makes you free they said in renaissance germany so some people go to places like shanghai but most go to the squatter cities where aesthetics rule
and these are not really a people oppressed by poverty they're people getting out of poverty as fast as they can they're the dominant builders and to a large extent the dominant designers they have home brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life one sixth of the gdp in india is coming out of mumbai
one sixth of humanity is there it's soon going to be more than that
so here 's the first punch line cities have defused the population bomb here 's the second
that's the news from downtown here it is in perspective thank you
