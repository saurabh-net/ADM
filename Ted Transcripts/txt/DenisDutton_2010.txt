and to talk to you about a subject dear to my heart which is beauty
i do the philosophy of art aesthetics actually for a living
i try to figure out intellectually philosophically psychologically what the experience of beauty
what sensibly can be said about it and how people go off the rails in trying to understand it now this is an extremely complicated subject
in part because the things that we call beautiful are so different i mean just think of the sheer variety a baby 's face berlioz 's harold in italy
movies like the wizard of oz or the plays of a central california landscape
view of mt fuji der rosenkavalier
a stunning match winning goal in a world cup soccer match van gogh 's starry night
a jane austen novel fred astaire dancing across the screen this brief list includes human beings natural landforms works of art and skilled human actions
an account that explains the presence of beauty in everything on this list is not going to be easy i can however give you at least a taste
of what i regard as the most powerful theory of beauty we yet have and we get it not from a philosopher of art not from a postmodern art theorist or a bigwig art critic
this theory comes from an expert on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding
and you know who i mean
of course a lot of people think they already know the proper answer to the question what is beauty
it's in the eye of the beholder it's whatever moves you personally
or as some people especially academics prefer beauty is in the culturally conditioned eye of the beholder
taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures with great ease
or just think about american jazz or american movies they go everywhere
there are many differences among the arts but there are also universal cross cultural aesthetic pleasures and values
how can we explain this universality
the best answer lies in trying to reconstruct a darwinian evolutionary history of our artistic and aesthetic tastes
we need to reverse engineer our present artistic tastes and preferences and explain how they came to be engraved in our minds
by the actions of both our prehistoric largely pleistocene environments where we became fully human but also by the social situations in which we evolved
this reverse engineering can also enlist help from the human record preserved in prehistory i mean fossils cave paintings and so forth
and it should take into account what we know of the aesthetic interests of isolated hunter gatherer bands that survived into the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries
now i personally have no doubt whatsoever
that the experience of beauty with its emotional intensity and pleasure belongs to our evolved human psychology
the experience of beauty is one component in a whole series of darwinian adaptations beauty is an adaptive effect
which we extend and intensify in the creation and enjoyment of works of art and entertainment
as many of you will know evolution operates by two main primary mechanisms the first of these is natural selection that's random mutation and selective retention
along with our basic anatomy and physiology the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails natural selection also explains many basic revulsions
such as the horrid smell of rotting meat or fears such as the fear of snakes or standing close to the edge of a cliff
natural selection also explains pleasures
our liking for sweet fat and proteins which in turn explains a lot of popular foods from ripe fruits through chocolate malts and barbecued ribs
the other great principle of evolution is sexual selection
and it operates very differently
the peacock 's magnificent tail is the most famous example of this it did not evolve for natural survival in fact it goes against natural survival
no the peacock 's tail results from the mating choices made by peahens it's quite a familiar story it's women who actually push history forward
tail was beautiful in the eyes of the peahen he actually used that word
now keeping these ideas firmly in mind
we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution
of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination even obsession in order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction
beauty is nature 's way of acting at a distance so to speak
you can't expect to eat an adaptively beneficial landscape it would hardly do to your baby or your lover
so evolution 's trick is to make them beautiful to have them exert a kind of magnetism to give you the pleasure of simply looking
people in very different cultures all over the world tend to like a particular kind of landscape
a landscape that just happens to be similar to the pleistocene savannas where we evolved this landscape shows up today on calendars
on postcards in the design of golf courses and public parks and in in gold framed pictures that hang in living rooms from new york
it's a kind of hudson river school landscape featuring open spaces of low grasses interspersed with copses of trees
the trees by the way are often preferred if they fork near the ground that is to say if they're trees you could scramble up if you were in a tight fix
the landscape shows the presence of water directly in view or evidence of water in a bluish distance
or a road perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline that extends into the distance
this landscape type is regarded as beautiful even by people in countries that don't have it
the ideal savanna landscape is one of the clearest examples where human beings everywhere find beauty in similar visual experience
but someone might argue that's natural beauty how about artistic beauty
isn't that exhaustively cultural no i don't think it is and once again i'd like to look back to prehistory to say something about
it it is widely assumed that the earliest human artworks are the stupendously skillful cave paintings that we all know from lascaux and
about thirty two thousand years old along with a few small realistic sculptures of women and animals from the same period
but artistic and decorative skills are actually much older than that
the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts are older even than this i have in mind the so called acheulian hand axes
the oldest stone tools are choppers from the olduvai gorge in east africa they go back about two and a half million years
these crude tools were around for thousands of centuries until around one point four million years ago
when homo erectus started shaping single thin stone blades sometimes rounded
but often in what are to our eyes an arresting symmetrical pointed leaf or teardrop form these acheulian hand axes they're named after st acheul in france where finds were made in nineteenth century
have been unearthed in their thousands scattered across asia europe and africa almost everywhere homo erectus and homo ergaster roamed
now the sheer numbers of these hand axes shows that they can't have been made for butchering animals and the plot really thickens when you realize that
unlike other pleistocene tools the hand axes often exhibit no evidence of wear on their delicate blade edges
and some in any event are too big to use for butchery
their symmetry their attractive materials and above all their meticulous workmanship
are simply quite beautiful to our eyes even today
so what were these ancient
what were these artifacts for
the best available answer is that they were literally the earliest known works of art
hand axes mark an evolutionary advance in human history
tools fashioned to function as what darwinians call fitness signals that is to say displays that are performances like the peacock 's tail except that unlike hair and feathers the hand axes are consciously cleverly crafted
fine motor control planning ability conscientiousness and sometimes access to rare materials
you know it's an old line but it has been shown to work
come up to my cave so i can show you my hand axes
except of course what's interesting about this is that we can't be sure how that idea was conveyed because the
this object was made by a hominid ancestor
homo erectus or homo ergaster
between fifty and one hundred thousand years before language
by the end of the hand axe epic homo sapiens as they were then called finally were doubtless finding new ways to amuse and amaze each other
who knows telling jokes storytelling dancing or hairstyling yes hairstyling i insist on that
for us moderns virtuoso technique is used to create imaginary worlds in fiction and in movies to express intense emotions with music painting and dance
but still one fundamental trait of the ancestral personality persists in our aesthetic cravings
the beauty we find in skilled performances from lascaux to the louvre to carnegie hall
human beings have a permanent innate taste for virtuoso displays in the arts
we find beauty in something done well
so the next time you pass a jewelry shop window displaying a beautifully cut teardrop shaped stone don't be so sure it's just your culture telling you that that sparkling jewel is beautiful
your distant ancestors loved that shape and found beauty in the skill needed to make it even before they could put their love into words
beauty in the eye of the beholder no it's deep in our minds it's a gift handed down from the intelligent skills and rich emotional lives of our most ancient ancestors
powerful reaction to images to the expression of emotion in art to the beauty of music to the night sky will be with us and our descendants for as long as the human race exists
