the awesome story it begins about forty years ago when my mom and my dad came to canada
my mom left nairobi kenya my dad left a small village outside of amritsar india and they got here in the late nineteen sixties
they settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of toronto and they settled into a new life
they saw their first dentist they ate their first hamburger and they had their first kids
my sister and i grew up here
we had quiet happy childhoods we had close family good friends a quiet street we grew up taking for granted a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted when they grew up things like
power always on in our houses things like schools across the street and hospitals down the road and popsicles in the backyard
we grew up and we grew older i went to high school
i graduated i moved out of the house i got a job i found a girl i settled down and i realize it sounds like a bad sitcom or a cat stevens song
but life was pretty good life was pretty good two thousand and six was a great year under clear blue skies in july in the wine region of ontario i got married surrounded by one hundred and fifty family and friends
two thousand and seven was
i graduated from school and i went on a road trip with two of my closest friends
's a picture of me and my friend chris on the coast of the pacific ocean we actually saw seals out of our car window and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them and then blocked them with our giant heads
so you can't actually see them but it was breathtaking believe me
not just me first of all the news was so heavy it's still heavy now and it was heavy before that but when you flip open a newspaper when you turned on the tv it was about ice caps melting
going on around the world earthquakes hurricanes and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse and then eventually did
so many of us losing our homes or our jobs or our retirements or our livelihoods
my marriage wasn't going well and we just were growing further and further apart
one day my wife came home from work and summoned the courage through a lot of tears to have a very honest conversation and she said and it was
one of the most painful things i'd ever heard and certainly the most heartbreaking thing i'd ever heard
until only a month later when i heard something even more heartbreaking
my friend chris who i just showed you a picture of had been battling mental illness for some time and for those of you whose lives have been touched by mental illness you know how challenging it can be
i spoke to him on the phone at ten thirty pm on a sunday night we talked about the tv show we watched that evening
and monday morning i found out that he
it was a really heavy time and as these dark clouds were circling me and i was
i said to myself that i really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow
so i came home from work one
and i logged onto the computer and i started up a tiny website called one thousand awesomethings com
i was trying to remind myself of the simple universal little pleasures that we all love but we just don't talk about enough things like waiters and waitresses who bring you free refills without asking being the first table to get called up to the dinner buffet at a wedding
wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer or when cashiers open up a new check out lane at the grocery store and you get to be first in line
and slowly over time i started putting myself in a better mood i mean fifty thousand
blogs are started a day and so my blog was just one of those fifty thousand and nobody read it except for my mom
although i should say that my traffic did skyrocket and go up by one hundred percent when she forwarded it to my dad
i got excited when it started getting tens of hits and then i started getting excited when it started getting dozens and then hundreds
and then thousands and then millions
getting bigger and bigger and bigger and then i got a phone call
you 've just won the best blog in the world award
was like that sounds totally fake it turns out i
on a plane and i ended up walking a red carpet between sarah silverman and jimmy fallon and martha stewart and i went onstage to accept a webby award for best blog and the surprise and
the amazement of that was only overshadowed by my return to toronto when in my inbox ten literary agents were waiting for me to talk about putting this into a book
over the last few years i haven't had that much time to really think but lately i have had the opportunity to take a step back and ask myself
what is it over the last few years that helped me grow my website but also grow myself and i've summarized those things for me personally
three a 's they are attitude
talk about each one briefly so attitude
we're all going to get lumps and we're all going to get bumps none of us can predict the future but we do know one thing about it and that's that it ain't gonna go according to plan
we will all have high highs and big days and proud moments of smiles on graduation stages father daughter dances at weddings and
it's sad and it's not pleasant to talk about but
your husband might leave you your girlfriend could cheat scenes
your mom could get cancer
your dad could get mean and there are times in life when you will be tossed in the well too with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart
one you can swirl and twirl and gloom and doom forever or two you can grieve and then face the future with newly sober eyes
having a great attitude is about choosing option number two and choosing no matter how difficult it is no matter what pain hits you choosing to move forward and move on and take baby steps into the future
the second a is awareness
i love hanging out with three year olds
i love the way that they see the world because they're seeing the world for the first time i love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk i love the way that
stare slack jawed at their first baseball game with wide eyes and a mitt on their hand soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts and the smell of the hotdogs i love the way that they'll spend hours picking dandelions in the backyard and putting them into
having a sense of awareness is just about embracing your inner three year old
they're in there and being aware is just about remembering that
you saw everything you've seen for the first time
so there was a time when it was your first time ever hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work there was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery and smelt the bakery air or the first time you pulled a twenty dollar bill out of your old jacket pocket and said found money the last a is
or rosey grier as people used to call him grew up and grew into a three hundred lb six foot five linebacker in the nfl he 's number seventy six in the picture
here he is pictured with the fearsome foursome these were four guys on the l a rams in the nineteen sixties you did not want to go up against they were tough football players doing what they love which was crushing skulls and separating shoulders on the football
but rosey grier also had another passion in his deeply authentic self he also loved needlepoint
he loved knitting he said that it calmed him down it relaxed him it took away his fear of flying
so much that after he retired from the nfl he started joining clubs and he even put out a
called rosey grier 's needlepoint
if you notice he 's actually needlepointing his own face
what i love about this story is that
so those are the three a 's
for the closing thought i want to take you all the way back to my parents coming to canada
i don't know what it would feel like
coming to a new country when you're in your mid twenties i don't know because i never did it but i would imagine that it would take a great attitude
i would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your surroundings and appreciating the small wonders that you're starting to see in your new world
and i think you'd have to be really authentic you'd have to be really true to yourself in order to get through what you're being exposed to
it's a great story because what happened was he got off the plane at the toronto airport and he was welcomed by a non profit group which i'm sure someone in this room runs
this non profit group had a big welcoming lunch for all the new immigrants to canada
was olives those little white onions there was rolled up turkey cold cuts rolled up ham cold cuts rolled up roast beef cold cuts and little cubes
tarts and there was pies lots and lots of pies
my dad tells the story he says the craziest thing was i'd never seen any of that before except bread
i didn't know what was meat what was vegetarian i was eating
i just couldn't believe how many things you can get here
when i was five years old my dad used to take me grocery shopping and he would
date from morocco he 's like do you know where morocco even a
a and
and then sailed all the way across the atlantic ocean and then put it in another truck and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house so they could sell it to us for twenty five cents
i don't believe that and he 's like i don't believe it either things are amazing there's just so many things to be happy about
when i stop to think about it he 's absolutely right there are so many things to be happy about we are the only species on the only life giving
rock in the entire universe that we've ever seen capable of experiencing so many of these things i mean we're the only ones with
architecture and agriculture we're the only ones with jewelry and democracy we've got airplanes highway lanes
interior design and horoscope signs we've got fashion magazines house party scenes you can watch a horror movie with monsters you can go to a concert and hear guitars jamming we've got books buffets and radio waves wedding brides and rollercoaster
you can sleep in clean sheets you can go to the movies and get good seats you can smell
air walk around with rain hair pop bubble wrap or we got all that
we only got one hundred years to enjoy it
the telemarketer calling you during dinner
every politician in every country every actor in every movie every single person in your family everyone you love everyone in this room and you
so great that we only get such a short time to experience and enjoy all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet
and that moment is right now and those moments are counting down and those moments are always always always fleeting
that's why i believe that if you live your life with a great attitude choosing to move forward and move on whenever life deals you a blow
living with a sense of awareness of the world around you embracing your inner three year old and seeing the tiny joys that make life so sweet and being authentic to yourself being you and being cool with that letting your heart lead you
and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you then i think you'll live a life that is rich and is satisfying and i think you live a life that is truly awesome thank you
