going to speak about a tiny little idea and this is about shifting baseline and because the idea can be explained in one minute i will tell you
so what happens here the second story
i was there in seventy one studying a lagoon in west africa
i was there because i grew up in europe and i wanted later to work in africa
the fish had shrunk to half of their size they were maturing at five centimeters they had been pushed genetically there were still fishes they were still kind of happy and the fish also were
my third little story is that i was an accomplice in the introduction of trawling in southeast asia and these pictures
this is a dead turtle they were not eaten they were thrown away because they were dead and one time we caught a live one it was not drowned yet and then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat this mountain
the new level and we don
you have on the y axis some good thing biodiversity numbers of orca the greenness of your country the water supply
and over time it changes it changes because people do things or naturally every generation
will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extrapolate forward and the difference then they perceive as a loss
but they don 't perceive what happened before
over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the baseline and the question is why do
so you have a situation where people don 't know
if you think of why people were so touched by it never mind the pocahontas story why so touched by the imagery because it evokes something
