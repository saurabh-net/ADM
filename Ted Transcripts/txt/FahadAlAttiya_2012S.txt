welcome to doha i am in charge of making this country 's food secure that is my job for the next two years to design an entire master plan
and then for the next ten years to implement it of course with so many other people
none of the glamour that you see today existed no cities like you see today in doha or dubai or abu dhabi or kuwait or riyadh
it wasn 't that they couldn 't develop cities resources weren 't there to develop them
and you can see that life expectancy was also short most people died around the age of fifty so let 's move to chapter two the oil era one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine that 's when they discovered oil but unfortunately it wasn 't really fully exploited commercially until after the second
who roamed around the desert
looking for water looking for food
trying to take care of their livestock urbanize
you might find this strange but in my family we have different accents
my mother has an accent that is so different to my father
and we 're all a population of about three hundred thousand people in the same country there are about five or six accents in this country as i speak
let 's look at today this is probably the skyline that most of you know about doha so what 's the population today it 's one point seven million people
that is in less than sixty years
the average growth of our economy is about fifteen percent for the past five years lifespan
increased to seventy eight water consumption has increased to four hundred and thirty liters and this is amongst the highest worldwide from having no water whatsoever
to consuming water to the highest degree higher than any other nation i don 't know if this was a reaction to lack of water but
the interesting part is that we continue to grow fifteen percent
every year for the past five years without water now that is historic
not only cities that we 're building but cities with dreams and people who are wishing to be scientists doctors build a nice home bring the architect design my house these people are adamant that this is a livable space when it wasn 't
but of course with the use of technology so brazil has one
thousand seven hundred and eighty two
millimeters per year of precipitation of rain qatar has seventy four and we have that growth rate the question is how how could we survive that we have no water whatsoever simply because of
this gigantic mammoth machine called desalination energy is the key factor here it changed everything it is that thing that we pump out of the ground we burn tons of probably most of you used it coming to doha so that is our lake if you can see it
that is our river that is how you all happen to use and enjoy water this is the best
technology that this region could ever
do you worry much i would say
perhaps if you look at the global facts you will realize of course i have to worry there is growing demand growing population we 've turned seven billion only a few months ago
and so that number also demands food and there 's predictions that we 'll be nine billion by two thousand and fifty
so a country that has no water has to worry about what happens beyond its borders there 's also changing diets by elevating to a higher socio economic level they also change their diet they start eating more meat
this is the situation in qatar for those who don 't know
we only have two days of water reserve we import ninety percent of our food
and we only cultivate less than one percent of our land the limited number of farmers that we have have been pushed out of their farming practices as a result of open market policy and bringing the big competitions etc etc so we also face risks
is there a sustainable solution indeed there is
this slide sums up thousands of pages of technical documents that we 've been working on over the past two years let 's start with the water so we know very well i showed you earlier that we need this energy
so if we 're going to need energy what sort of energy a depletable energy fossil fuel or should we use something else do we have the comparative advantage to use another sort of energy i guess most of you by now realize that we do three hundred days of sun
and so we will use that renewable energy to produce the water that we need and we will probably put one thousand eight hundred megawatts of solar systems to produce three point five million cubic meters of water and that is a lot of water that water will go then to the farmers and the farmers will be able to water their plants
and they will be able then to supply society with food
but in order to sustain the horizontal line because these are the projects these are the systems that we will deliver
is legislation policies regulations without it we can 't do anything so that 's what we are planning to do within two years we should hopefully be done with this plan and taking it to implementation our objective is to be a millennium city rome london
rome london paris damascus cairo
we are only sixty years old but we want to live forever
as a city to live in peace thank you very much
