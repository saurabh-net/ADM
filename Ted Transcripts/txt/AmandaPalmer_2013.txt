so i didn 't always make my living from music for about the five years after graduating from an upstanding liberal arts university this of sadness and longing
we would get this beautiful moment of prolonged eye contact
being allowed in a city street and we would sort of nobody ever sees me
nobody ever sees me and unfair shameful
i had no idea how perfect a real education i was getting for the music business on this box
and for the economists out there you may be interested to know i actually made a pretty predictable income which was shocking to me given i had no regular customers but pretty much sixty bucks on a tuesday ninety bucks on a friday it was consistent
connection with people because i loved it so after all of our shows we would sign autographs and hug fans and hang out and talk to people and we made an art out of asking people to help us
and join us and i would track down local musicians and artists and they would set up outside of our shows and they would pass the hat and then they would come in and join us onstage so we had this rotating smorgasbord of weird random circus guests
and then twitter came along and made things even more magic because i could ask instantly for anything anywhere so i would need a piano to practice on and an hour later i would be at a fan 's house this is in london
people would bring home cooked food to us all over the world backstage and feed us and eat with us this is in seattle fans who worked in museums and stores and any kind of public space would wave their hands if i would decide to do a last minute spontaneous free gig this is a library in auckland
on saturday i tweeted for this crate and
and a nurse from a hospital drove one right at that moment to the cafe i was in and i bought her a smoothie and we sat there talking about nursing and death and i love this kind of random closeness which is lucky because i do a lot of couchsurfing
in mansions where everyone in my crew gets their own room but there 's no wireless and in punk squats everyone on the floor in one room with no toilets but with wireless clearly making it the better option
miami neighborhood and we found out that our couchsurfing host for the night was an eighteen year old girl still living at home and her family were all undocumented immigrants from honduras and that night her whole family
took the couches and she slept together with her mom
so that we could take their beds
and i lay there thinking
these people have so little
to me in her broken english this is this
couchsurfing and crowdsurfing are basically the same thing you 're falling into the audience and you 're trusting each other
i once asked an opening band of mine if they wanted to go out into the crowd and pass the hat to get themselves some extra money something that i did a lot and as usual the band was psyched but there was this one guy in the band who told me he just couldn 't bring himself to go out there it felt too much like begging to stand there and get a job
and meanwhile my band is becoming bigger and bigger we signed with a major label
and i was like twenty five thousand isn 't that a lot they were like no the sales are going down it 's a failure and they walk off
i 'm sorry i burned your cd from a friend
but i read your blog i know you hate your label i just want you to have this money
and this starts happening all the time i become the hat
after my own gigs but i have to physically stand there and take the help from people and unlike the guy in the opening band i 've actually had a lot of practice standing there
on the street so i fought my way off my label and for my next project with my new band the grand theft orchestra i turned to crowdfunding
and i fell into those thousands of connections that i 'd made and i asked my crowd to catch me
and the goal was one hundred thousand dollars my fans backed me at nearly one point two million
which was the biggest music crowdfunding project
how many people it is
and the media asked amanda the music business is tanking and you encourage piracy how did you make all these people pay for music and the real answer is i didn 't make them i asked them
i asked them and through the very
after my kickstarter went big for continuing my crazy crowdsourcing practices specifically for asking musicians
who are fans if they wanted to join us on stage for a few songs in exchange for love and tickets and beer and this was a doctored image that went up of me on a website
and this hurt in a really familiar way and people saying
you 're not allowed anymore to ask for that kind of help really reminded me
of the people in their cars yelling get a job
and they couldn 't see
the exchange that was happening between me and my crowd an exchange that was very fair to us but alien
now let me tell you if you want to experience the visceral feeling of trusting strangers i recommend this
especially if those strangers are drunk german people
this was a ninja master level fan connection because what i was really saying here was
i trust you this much musicians artists
connectors and openers not untouchable stars celebrity is about a lot of people loving you from a distance but the internet and the content that we 're freely able to share on it are taking us back
it 's about a few people loving you up close and about those people
now the online tools to make the exchange as easy and as instinctive as the street they 're getting there
but the perfect tools aren 't going to help us
if we can 't face each other
and give and receive fearlessly but more important
on the internet the way i could on the box
so blogging and tweeting not just about my tour dates and my new video but about our work and our art and our fears and our hangovers
our mistakes and we see each other
and i think when we really
i think people have been obsessed with the wrong question which is how do we make people pay for music
what if we started asking
