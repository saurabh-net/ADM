know this but you are celebrating an anniversary with me i'm not
one year ago today i woke up from a month long coma following a double lung transplant crazy i
six years before that i was starting my career as an opera singer in europe when i was diagnosed idiopathic pulmonary hypertension also known as
it happens when there's a thickening in the pulmonary veins making the right side of the heart work overtime
and causing what i call the reverse grinch effect my heart was three and a half sizes too big
i went to see this specialist and she was top of the field and told me i had to stop singing she said those high notes are going to kill you
have any medical evidence to back up her claim that there was a relationship between operatic arias and pulmonary hypertension
she was absolutely emphatic i was singing my own obituary i was very limited by my condition physically
limited when i sang and as air came up from my lungs through
my vocal cords and passed my lips as sound it was the closest thing i had ever come
to transcendence and just because of someone 's hunch i wasn't going to give it up thankfully i met
who is dry as toast but he and his team at johns hopkins didn't just want me to survive
they wanted me to live a meaningful life this meant making trade offs
i come from colorado it's a mile high and i grew up there with my ten brothers and sisters and two adoring parents
well the altitude exacerbated my symptoms so i moved to baltimore to be near my doctors and enrolled in conservatory nearby
i couldn't walk as much as i used to so i opted for five inch heels and i gave up salt i went vegan and i started taking huge doses also known as viagra
my father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing in alternative or traditional therapies for ph
i had a heart catheterization where they measure this internal arterial pulmonary pressure which is supposed to be between fifteen and twenty
was one hundred and forty six i like to do things big and it meant one
there is a big gun treatment for pulmonary hypertension called flolan and it's not just a
it's a way of life doctors insert a catheter in your chest which is attached to a pump that weighs about four and a half pounds
every day twenty four hours that pump is at your side administering medicine directly to your heart and it's not a particularly
like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich you'll probably end up in the icu if you go through a metal detector you'll probably die if you
a bubble in your medicine because you have to mix it every morning and it stays in there you probably die
if you run out of medicine you definitely die no one wants to go on flolan but when i
it was a godsend within a few days i could walk again
within a few weeks i was performing and in a few months i debuted at the kennedy center the
was a little bit problematic when performing so i'd attach it to my inner thigh with the help of the girdle and
hundreds of elevator rides were spent with me alone stuffing the pump into my spanx hoping the doors wouldn't open unexpectedly
and the tubing coming out of my chest was a nightmare for costume designers i graduated from graduate school in two thousand and six and i got a fellowship to go back to europe
a few days after arriving i met this wonderful old conductor who started casting me in all of these roles and before long i was commuting between budapest milan and florence
this ugly unwanted high maintenance mechanical pet my life was kind of like the happy part in an opera very complicated but in a good
then in february of two thousand and eight my grandfather passed away
he was a big figure in all of our lives and we loved him very much it certainly didn't prepare me for what came next seven weeks later i got
a call from my family my father had been in a catastrophic car accident and he died
at twenty four my death would have been entirely expected but his
well the only way i can articulate how it felt was that it precipitated my medical decline against my
but soon i was showing signs of right heart failure and i had to return to sea level doing so knowing that i probably would never see my home again
i canceled most of my engagements that summer but i had one left in tel aviv so i went after one performance
i could barely drag myself from the stage to the taxicab i sat down and felt the blood rush down from my face and in the heat of the desert i was
freezing cold my fingers started turning blue and i was like what is going on here i heard my heart 's valves snapping
that stuff up fast i would never leave that apartment alive i started mixing and i felt like everything was going to fall out through one hole
but i just kept on going finally with the last bottle in and the last bubble out i attached the pump to the tubing and lay
it would kick in soon enough if it didn 't i'd probably see my father sooner than i anticipated
which is a side effect of the medication and i knew i'd be okay we're not big on fear in my family but i was scared
went back to the states anticipating i'd return to europe but the heart catheterization showed that i wasn't going
anywhere farther that a flight for life from johns hopkins hospital i performed here and there but as my condition deteriorated so did my voice
months after having very challenging surgeries i knew another young man though who had ph who died while waiting for one
i wanted to live i thought stem cells were a good option but they hadn't developed to a point where i could take advantage of them yet
i officially took a break from singing and i went to the cleveland clinic to be reevaluated for the third time in five years for transplant
is a healthy patient it was like in one verbal swoop he had channeled my
on life and medicine and confucius i still didn't want a transplant but in a month
i was back in the hospital with some severely edemic kankles very attractive and it was right heart failure i finally
it was time to take my doctor 's advice it was time for me to go to cleveland and to start the agonizing wait
i was still in the hospital i got a telephone call it was my doctor in cleveland marie
and they had lungs it was a match they were from texas
and everybody was really happy for me but me because despite their problems i
there in hopes that they would meet me and say what we knew might be our final goodbye but organs don't wait and i went into surgery
before i could say goodbye
the last thing i remember was lying on a white blanket telling my surgeon that i needed to see my mother again and to please try and save my voice
fell into this apocalyptic dreamworld during the thirteen and a half hour surgery i flatlined twice
forty quarts of blood were infused into my body and in my surgeon 's twenty year career he said it was among the most difficult
that he 's ever performed
they left my chest open for two weeks you could see my over sized heart beating inside of it i was on a dozen machines that were keeping my alive an infection ravaged my skin i
had hoped my voice would be saved but my doctors knew that the breathing tubes going down my throat might have already destroyed it if they stayed in there was no way i would ever sing again
so my doctor got the ent the top guy at the clinic to come down and give me surgery to move the tubes around my voice box
he said it would kill me so my own surgeon performed the procedure in a last ditch attempt to save my voice though my mom couldn't say goodbye to me before the surgery she didn't leave my side
package it is her one year ago to this very day i woke up
ninety five lbs there were a dozen tubes coming in and out of my body i couldn't walk i couldn't talk i couldn't eat i couldn't move i certainly couldn't sing i couldn't even breathe
when i looked up and i saw my mother i couldn't help
whether by a mack truck or by heart failure or faulty lungs death happens but life isn't really just about avoiding death is it it's about living
and i'm so grateful they did this past summer when i was running and singing and dancing and playing with my nieces
that i couldn't sing and i wanted to tell her and i want to tell you we
to stop letting disease divorce us from our dreams when we do
we will find that patients don't just survive we thrive and some of us might even sing may
