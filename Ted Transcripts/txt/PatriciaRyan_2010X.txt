thinking you think i 've lost my way and somebody 's going to come on the stage in a minute and guide me gently back
i get that all the time in dubai
in that time i have seen a lot of changes cosmetics cooking herbal
how did those students get all that knowledge of course from their grandparents and even their great grandparents
a language dies every fourteen days
now at the same time english is the undisputed global language
from being a mutually beneficial practice to becoming a massive international business that it is today no longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum and no longer the sole domain of mother england it has become a bandwagon for every english speaking nation on earth
and why not after all the best education according to the latest world university rankings is to be found in the universities of the u k and the u
now let me put it this way
and you have to satisfy us first that your english is good enough
now it can be dangerous
to give too much power okay
but that is a self fulfilling prophecy it feeds the english requirement and so it goes on i ask you what happened to translation
if you think about the islamic golden age
there was lots of translation then
now don 't get me wrong i am not against teaching english all you english teachers out there i love it that we have a global language we need one today more than ever but i am against using it as a barrier
do we really want to end up with six hundred languages and the main one being english or chinese
we need more than that where do we draw the line this system equates intelligence
and i want to remind you that the giants upon whose shoulders today 's intelligentsia
did not have to have english they didn 't have to pass an english test case in point
now i get it i understand why people would want to focus on english they want to give their children the best chance in life
and to do that they need a western education
but they couldn 't get the results they wanted they really didn 't know what to do until along came
so bingo problem solved if you can 't think a thought you are stuck

people who have no light whether it 's physical or metaphorical
