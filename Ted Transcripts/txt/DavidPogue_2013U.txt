that 's true in everything risky except technology
for some reason there 's no standard syllabus there 's no basic course they just sort of give you your computer and then kick you out of the nest
you 're supposed to learn this stuff how just by osmosis nobody ever sits down and tells you this is how it works so today i 'm going to tell you ten things that you thought everybody knew but it turns out they don 't
i assume you know that you can hit the tab key to jump from box to box to box but what about the pop up menu where you put in your state
don 't open the pop up menu that 's a terrible waste of calories type the first letter of your state over and over and over so if you want connecticut go c c c if you want texas go t t and you jump right to that thing without even opening the pop up menu
also on the web when the text is too small what you do is hold down the control key and hit plus plus plus you make the text larger with each tap
when you 're typing on your blackberry android iphone don 't bother switching layouts to the punctuation layout to hit the period and then a space and then try to capitalize the next letter just hit the space bar twice the phone puts the period the space and the capital for you
go space space it is totally amazing
also when it comes to cell phones on all phones if you want to redial somebody that you 've dialed before all you have to do is hit the call button and it puts the last phone number into the box for you
and at that point you can hit call again to actually dial it
so you don 't need to go into the recent calls list so if you 're trying to get through to somebody just hit the call button again here 's something that drives me crazy when i call you and leave a message on your voicemail i hear you saying leave a message and then i get these fifteen seconds of frickin instructions like we haven 't had answering machines for forty five years i 'm not bitter
so it turns out there 's a keyboard shortcut that lets you jump directly to the beep like this
so most of you think of google as something that lets you look up a webpage but it is also a dictionary type the word define and then the word you want to know you don 't even have to click anything there 's the definition as you type
it 's also a complete faa database type the name of the airline and the flight it shows you where the flight is the gate the terminal how long till it lands you don 't need an app for that it 's also a unit and currency conversion again you don 't have to click one of the results just type it into the box and there 's your answer while we 're talking about text
when you want to highlight
this is just an example
when you want to highlight a word please don 't waste your life dragging across it with the mouse like a newbie double click the word watch two hundred i go double click it neatly selects just that word also don 't delete what you 've highlighted you can just type over it
this is in every program also you can go double click drag to highlight in one word increments as you drag much more precise again don 't bother deleting just type over it
shutter lag is the time between your pressing the shutter button and the moment the camera actually snaps it 's extremely frustrating on any camera under one thousand dollars
so when that happens this works in keynote powerpoint it works in every program all you do is hit the letter b key b for blackout to black out the slide and make everybody look at you and then when you 're ready to go on you hit b again and if you 're really on a roll you can hit the w key for whiteout
