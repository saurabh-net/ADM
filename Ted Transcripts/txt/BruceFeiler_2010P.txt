i was four years old and my family moved to a new neighborhood in our hometown of savannah georgia and this was the nineteen sixties when actually all the streets in this neighborhood were named after confederate war generals
we lived on robert e lee blvd and when i was five my parents gave me an orange schwinn stingray bicycle
it had a swooping banana seat and those ape hanger handlebars that made the rider look like an
i was hit by a passing sedan
my mangled body flew in one direction my mangled bike flew in the other
bruce i said and promptly passed out
i broke my left femur that day it's the largest bone in your body and spent the next two months in a body cast that went from my chin to the tip of my toe to my right knee and a steel bar went from my right knee to my left ankle
wrote a series of books about my travels including walking the bible i hosted a television show by that name on pbs i was for all the world the walking guy
until in may two thousand and eight a routine visit to my doctor and a routine blood test produced evidence in the form of an alkaline phosphatase number that something might be wrong with my bones
and my doctor on a whim sent me to get a full body bone scan which showed that there was some growth in my left leg
that sent me to an x ray then to an mri and one afternoon i got a call from my doctor
the tumor in your leg is not consistent with a benign tumor i stopped walking and it took my mind a second to convert that
in the same place in my body as the accident thirty eight years earlier it seemed like too much of a coincidence
so that afternoon i went back to my house and my three year old identical twin daughters eden and tybee feiler came running to meet me they'd just turned three and they were into all things pink and purple in fact we called them pinkalicious and purplicious
although i must say our favorite nickname occurred on their birthday april fifteenth when they were born at six fourteen and six forty six on april fifteen
aisles i might not walk down
they wonder who i was i thought would they yearn for my approval my love my voice
few days later i woke with an idea of how i might give them that voice i would reach out to six men from all parts of my life
and ask them to be present in the passages of my daughters lives
i believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives i wrote these men they 'll have loving families and welcoming homes
but they may not have me they may not have their dad
will you help be their dad
in this culture i don't have to tell you that you sort of happy your way through a problem we should focus on the positive my wife as i said she grew up outside of boston she's got a big smile she's got a big personality she's got big hair
although she told me recently i can't say she has big hair because if i say she has big hair people will think she's from texas and it's apparently okay to marry a boy from georgia but not to have hair from texas
i said look in georgia at least we want to know in arkansas they don't even ask what i didn't tell her is if she said yes you could jump you don't need the thirty day waiting period because you don't need the get to know you session at that point
so i wasn't going to tell her about this idea but the next day i couldn't control myself i told her and she loved the idea but she quickly started rejecting my nominees
well i love him but i would never ask him for advice so it turned out that starting a council of dads was a very efficient way to find out what my wife really thought of my friends
so we decided that we needed a set of rules and we came up with a number and the first one was no family only friends we thought our family would already be there
second men only we were trying to fill the dad space in the girls lives and then third sort of a dad for every side we kind of went through my personality and tried to get a dad who represented each different thing
so what happened was i wrote a letter to each of these men and rather than send it i decided to read it to them in person linda my wife joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals i sort of friend married each of these guys
we were in this youth hostel in a castle and i snuck out behind and there was a moat a fence and a field of cows and jeff came up beside me and said so have you ever been cow tipping
so before i had a chance to determine whether this was right or not we had jumped the moat we climbed the fence we were tiptoeing through the dung and approaching some poor dozing cow
so a few weeks after my diagnosis we went up
and then i asked him a question which i ended up asking to all the dads and ended up really encouraging me to write this story down in a book and that was what 's the one piece of advice you would give to my girls
and jeff 's advice was be a traveller not a tourist
get off the bus seek out what's different approach the cow
so it's ten years from now i said and my daughters are about to take their first trip abroad and i'm not here what would you tell them
as he talked he had that glint in his eye that i first saw back in holland the glint that says let 's go cow tipping even though we never did tip the cow even though no one tips the cow
even though cows don't sleep standing up
he said i want to see you back here girls at the end of this experience covered in
two weeks after my diagnosis a biopsy confirmed i had a seven inch osteosarcoma in my left femur six hundred americans a year get an osteosarcoma eighty five percent are under twenty one
twenty years ago doctors would have cut off my leg and hoped and there was a fifteen percent survival rate
room i went through four and a half months of chemo actually i had cisplatin doxorubicin and very high dose methotrexate and then i had a fifteen hour surgery in which my surgeon doctor john healey at memorial sloan kettering hospital in new york
took out my left femur and replaced it with titanium and if you did see the sanjay special you saw these enormous screws that they screwed into my pelvis
then he took my fibula from my calf cut it out and then relocated it to my thigh where it now lives and what he actually did was he de vascularized it
this is a surgery so rare only two human beings have survived
and my reward for surviving it was to go back for four more months of chemo it was as we said in my house a lost year
and i remember a particular one night that when you told that story of i don't know where you are doctor nuland of william sloane coffin it made me think of it
i was in the hospital after i think it was my fourth round of chemo when my numbers went to zero and i had basically no immune system and they put me in an infectious disease ward at the hospital
and anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask and cover all of the extraneous parts of their body and one night i got a call from my mother in law that my daughters at that time three and a half
absence and i hung up the phone
and i put my face in my hands and i screamed this silent scream
and what you said doctor nuland i don't know where you are made me think of this today because the thought that came to my mind was that feeling that i had was like a primal scream
and what was so striking and one of the messages i want to leave you here with today is the experience as i became less and less human
at that moment i was less and less human i was also at the same time maybe the most human i've ever been
and what was so striking about that time was instead of repulsing people i was actually proving to be a magnet for people people were incredibly drawn
my wife and i had kids we thought it would be all hands on deck instead it was everybody running the other way and when i had cancer we thought it 'd be everybody running the other way instead it was all hands on deck
and when people came to me rather than being incredibly turned off by what they saw i was like a living ghost they were incredibly moved to talk about what was going on in their own lives
it is an invitation maybe even a mandate to enter the most vital arenas of human life the most sensitive and the most frightening the ones that we never want to go to
but when we do go there we feel incredibly transformed when we do and this also happened to my girls as they began to see and we thought maybe became an ounce more compassionate
one of the profound things that happened was this act of actually connecting to all these people and it made me think and i'll just note for the record one word that i've only heard once actually was when we were all doing
tony robbins yoga yesterday the one word that has not been mentioned in this seminar actually is the word friend
and no one captures this modern manhood to me more than david black now david is my literary agent he 's about five foot three and a half
on a good day standing fully upright in cowboy boots and on kind of the manly male front he answers the phone i can say this i guess because you've done it here he answers the phone yo motherfucker
he gives boring speeches about obscure bottles of wine and on his fiftieth birthday he bought a convertible sports car although like a lot of men he 's impatient he bought it on his forty
but like a lot of modern men he hugs he bakes he leaves work early to coach little league someone asked me if he cried when i asked him to be in the council of dads i was like david cries when you invite him to take a walk
he said i don't see the wall and i'm telling you the same don't see the wall you may encounter one from time to time but you've got to find a way to get over it around it or through it but whatever you do don't succumb to it don't give in to the wall
my home is not far from the brooklyn bridge and during the year and a half i was on crutches it became a sort of symbol to me
so one day near the end of my journey i said come on girls let 's take a walk across the brooklyn bridge we set out on crutches i was on crutches my wife was next to me my girls were doing these rockstar poses up ahead
because walking was one of the first things i lost i spent most of that year thinking about this most elemental of human acts
as my physical therapist likes to say every step is a tragedy waiting to happen you nearly fall with one leg then you catch yourself with the other
and the biggest consequence of walking on crutches as i did for a year and a half is that you walk slower
you hurry you get where you're going but you get there alone
you go slow you get where you're going but you get there with this community you built along the way
at the risk of admission i was never nicer than the year i was on crutches
two hundred years ago a new type of pedestrian appeared in paris he was called a flaneur one who wanders the arcades
and it was the custom of those flaneurs to show they were men of leisure by taking turtles for walks and letting the reptile set the pace
and i just love this ode to slow moving and it's become my own motto for my girls take a walk with a turtle behold the world in
and every seven sets of seven years the land gets an extra year of rest during which time all families are reunited and people surrounded with the ones they love
year is called the jubilee year and it's the origin of that term
and though i'm shy of fifty it captures my own experience my lost year was my jubilee year
by laying fallow i planted the seeds for a healthier future and was reunited with the ones i love
the one year anniversary of my journey i went to see my surgeon doctor john healey and by the way healey great name for a doctor
he 's the president of the international society of limb salvage which is the least euphemistic term i've ever heard
and i said doctor healey if my daughters come to you one day and say what should i
i would tell them what i know and that is everybody dies but not everybody lives
as i looked at this list to me it was sort of like a psalm book of living i realized we may have done it for our girls but it really changed us
and that is the secret of the council of dads is that my wife and i did this in an attempt to help our daughters but it really changed us
so i stand here today
as you see now walking without crutches or
and last week i had my eighteen month scans
say can never find a solution for scan xiety
as i was going there i was wondering what would i say depending on what happened here
heard about our story and very quickly in a span of three weeks put the full resources of twenty three andme and we announced an initiative in july to get to decode the genome of
anybody a living person with a heart tissue bone sarcoma and she told me last night in the three months since we've done it we've gotten three hundred people who 've contributed to this program
and the epidemiologists here will tell you that's half the number of people who get the disease in one year in the united states so if you go to twenty three andme or if you go to councilofdads com you can click on a link and we encourage anybody
been talking about by leaving you with this message
and take a long slow walk
