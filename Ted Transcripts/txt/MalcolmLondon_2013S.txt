seven forty five a m
the decency to honor their names
lockers left open like teenage boys mouths when teenage girls wear clothes that covers their insecurities but exposes everything else
masculinity mimicked by men who grew up with no fathers camouflage worn by bullies who are dangerously armed but need hugs teachers paid less than what it costs them to be here oceans of adolescents come here to receive lessons
but never learn to swim part like the red sea when the bell rings this
social lines are barbed wire
trained at a young age to capitalize letters taught now that capitalism raises you but you have to step on someone else to get there this is a training ground
the need for degrees has left so many people frozen homework is stressful
but i believe they 're succeeding at what they 're built to do to train you to keep you on track to track down an american dream that has failed so many of us
