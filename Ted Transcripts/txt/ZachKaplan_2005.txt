over the last three years we found over two hundred of these things and so we looked back into our library and selected six we thought would be most surprising for ted
of these six the first one that we 're going to talk about is in the black envelope you 're holding it comes from a company in japan called geltech now go ahead and open it up
be sure and take the two pieces apart
what 's unexpected about this is that it 's soft
but it 's also a strong magnet zach and i have always been fascinated observing unexpected things like this we spent a long time thinking about why this is and it 's just recently that we realized
as you 're seeing this gel magnet for the first time if you assume that all magnets had to be hard then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding of the way magnets could work
so a first idea is to use
imagine taking the same material but putting it on the bottom of a sneaker you know this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door in your closet and you could literally stick
your shoes up instead of using a shelf
and you could see it in his face roman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder
these things just get him really excited and so we 're looking at these concepts
and as we thought about it more we realized that it let you fill in all the details
about the experience just as if you saw it on tv
so for ted we decided to take our favorite idea for the gel magnet and work with roman and his team at the directors bureau
so i just want to quickly explain how this would work
this is the magnetically levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial the gel that you 're holding would be lining the bottom of the board now this is important for two reasons one the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that if it were to hit the rider in the head
it wouldn 't injure him in addition you can see from the diagram on the right the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet so this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you 're going down the force of the water rushing down in addition to that repulsion force would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market
it 's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system
but something unexpected happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube so we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you
now you see the magnet fell really slowly
to hold any position in between
in our brainstorms we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal so at the end of the game you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag
we decided to go out onto the streets of chicago and ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this
we need you to stand right in front of the ted sign
so describe to the audience
the temperature of your shirt go ahead
it 's odorless it 's colorless
it 's so safe you could drink this stuff
what 's the significance of this dry liquid early versions of the fluid were actually used on a cray supercomputer
now the unexpected thing about this is that zach could stand up on stage and drench a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern that we 'd damage the electronics that we 'd get him wet that we 'd hurt the books or the computers
it works because it 's non conductive so you can see here you can immerse a whole circuit board in this and it wouldn 't cause any damage you can circulate it to draw the heat away but today it 's most widely used in office buildings in the sprinkler system as a fire suppression fluid again it 's perfectly safe for people it puts out the fires doesn 't hurt anything
but our favorite idea for this was using it in a basketball game so during halftime it could rain down on the players cool everyone down and in a matter of minutes it would dry wouldn 't hurt the court
one of their r d engineers was working on a way to make plastic stiffer
so you see there it didn 't bounce back
now think about your interactions with aluminum foil shape retaining is common in metal you bend a piece of aluminum foil and it holds its place contrast that with a plastic garbage can and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back
taking it a little further if you wove those strips together kind of like a little basket you could make a shape retaining sheet and then you could embed it in a cloth so you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table so that way on a windy day it wouldn 't blow away
for our next technology it 's hard to observe the unexpected property by itself because it 's an ink so we 've prepared a video to show it applied to paper
now to think about the potential for this
think of all the places ink is supplied on business cards on the back of cereal boxes board games any place you use ink you could change the way you interact with it
this could totally change the way that you interface with paper
you see the dark line on the side and the top as you turn the pages of the book the book can actually detect what page you 're on based on the curvature of the pages
in addition if you were to fold in one of the corners then you could program the book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes
don 't let milk spoil your morning
beyond just detecting spoiled food it 's really where the significance of it lies
his company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene and he kind of comically explained that time after time what the firemen would say is they would rush to the scene of the crime they would look around if there were no dead policemen it was ok to go
so a patient can come in and actually blow into their device
by detecting the odor of particular bacteria or viruses or even lung cancer
the dots will change and they can use software to analyze the results this can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients
currently they 're using a method of trial and error but this could tell you precisely what disease you have
prior to seeing this we would have assumed a ten foot pole couldn 't fit in your pocket something as inexpensive as ink couldn 't sense the way paper is being bent every one of these things and we 're constantly trying to find more
one of the items in it was the hydrophobic sand the sand that doesn 't get wet he said that he was playing with it with his son and you know his son was mesmerized because he would dunk it in the water he would take it out and it was bone dry
after hearing that story that really summed it up for me
thank you very much ks thank you
