i have a story a story that i would like to share with you and it's an african story it is a story of hope resilience and
there was hollywood then came bollywood today
in two thousand and six alone almost two thousand films were made in nigeria now try to imagine
forty fifty films wrapped distributed every week in the streets of lagos nigeria and west africa some estimates put
the value of this industry at two hundred and fifty million dollars it has created thousands if not tens of thousands of jobs
and it's expanding but keep in mind that this was a grassroots movement
this is something that happened without foreign investment without government aid and actually it happened
against all odds in one of the most difficult moments in nigerian economy is fifteen years old
and so maybe you're thinking now why how an italian filmmaker based in boston is so interested in this story
and so i think i have to tell you just a few words a few things about my personal life because
think there is a connection my grandfather lived most of his life and is buried in zambia my father
even though i left when i was only three years old i really felt that africa was this big part of my life and it really was a place where
to walk i think i uttered the first words and my family bought their first home so
when we came back to italy and one of the things that i remember the most is my family having this hard time to share stories
it seemed that for our neighbors and friends africa was either this exotic place this imaginary land that probably exists only in their imagination
or the place of horror famine and so we were always caught in this
and i remember really this desire to talk about africa as a place where we lived and people live and go about their lives and have dreams like we all have so when i
read in a newspaper in the business page the story of nollywood i really felt this is an incredible opportunity
to tell a story that goes against all these preconceived notions here i can tell a story of africans making movies like i do and actually i felt this was an inspiration for me i
have the good fortune of being a filmmaker in residence at the center of digital imaging arts at boston university and we really look how digital technology is changing and how young
and not only had the support i found two wonderful partners in crime in this adventure aimee corrigan a very talented and young photographer and robert caputo a friend and a mentor who
a veteran of national geographic and told me you know franco in twenty five years of covering africa i don't know if i have come across a story that is so full of hope and so so
we went to lagos in october two thousand and five and we went to lagos to meet bond emeruwa a wonderful talented film director who is with us tonight
the plan was to give you a portrait of nollywood of this incredible film industry
following bond in his quest to make an action movie that deals with the issue of corruption called checkpoint police corruption
and he had nine days to make it we thought this was a good story in the meantime we had to cover
and we talked to a lot of filmmakers but i don't want to create too many expectations i would like to show you six minutes
and these are six minutes they really prepared for the ted audience there are several themes from the documentary but they are re edited and made for you ok so i guess it's a world you
you just ten thousand dollars
doing films for the masses we're not doing films for the elite and the people in their glass houses they can afford to watch their robocop and
those who work in it is a kind of subsistence filmmaking
i think it's the most viable vehicle right now to
trying to explain to people it's not about the quality at the moment the quality is coming i mean there are those films that people are making for quality
but the first thing you have to remember about this society is that africa still has people that live on one dollar a day and these are the people that really watch and intrigue it's the
we have been so deep into the foreign movies it's all about the foreign movies but we can do something too we can do something something that when the world see it they say wow this
you can now walk the street and see a role model it a s not just what you see in picture you see the person live you see how he talks you see how
you really good you know it a s not just what you see in the picture it is not what you hear you know from the western press
i was so fascinated you know with those cowboy movies but then when i discovered the situation in my country at that time there was so much corruption
for a young man to really make it out here you got to think of some negative things and all that or some kind of vices and i didn't want that you know and i discovered that
be successful in life as an actor without doing crime without cheating nobody without telling no lies just me and god given talent
when they do the movies they have all these things in place but here we improvise
you see the gun there but you
so now you're about to see how we do our own movies here with or without
many things to say so little time so many themes in this story
i just can't tell you there a s one thing i want to tell you i spent
you know several weeks with all these actors producers and the problems they have to go through
for you know a westerner a filmmaker who works in america or in europe but always with a smile always with an enthusiasm that is incredible
werner herzog the german filmmaker said i need to make movies like you need oxygen and i think they a re breathing the nigerian filmmakers really really are doing what they like and so
it's a very very important thing for them and for their audiences a woman told me when i see a nollywood film i can relax i really i can breathe better
i really think that the digital non linear editing has slashed you know the cost now is a fraction of what it used to be
have to tell to the nigerian filmmakers they understood it they embraced the technology and they run with it and they a re successful
i hope that the nollywood phenomenon will go both ways i hope it will inspire other african nations to embrace the technology look at the nigerian model make their film create jobs
job so i really think it a s a lesson that we're actually learning from them and there's one thing one small challenge that i have for you and
should make us reflect on the importance of storytelling and i think this is really the theme of this session try to imagine
a world where the only goal is food
and a shelter but no stories no stories around the campfire no legends no fairytales nothing no novels
that the key to a healthy society is a thriving community of storytellers and i think that
the nigerian filmmakers really have proved this i would like you to hear their voices just few moments it a s not
an added sequence just some voices from
we have diverse cultures diverse cultures there are so many that in the natal lifetimes i don't see us exhausting the stories we have
my job ends here and the nollywood filmmakers really have now to work and i really hope
that there will be many many collaborations where we teach each other things and i really hope that this will happen thank you very much
censor board has censored one thousand six hundred films alone and we know that there are more so it a s safe to say that there are two thousand films so imagine forty five films per week
there are challenges there are challenges there is a glut of film the quality has to be raised they need to go to the next level but i a m optimistic
this is very important maybe you know for you to try to imagine this these are films that are distributed directly in markets
they are bought in video shops they can be rented for pennies ca on what format fs oh the format thank you for the question yes it's vcds it's a cd
more compressed image they started with vhs they actually didn't wait for you know the latest technology they started in ninety two ninety four
there are fifty seven million vcrs in nigeria that play you know vhs and these vcds it's a cd basically it's a compact
and i have to say this really proves that storytelling it's a commodity it's a staple there is no life without stories
