thought we'd just talk a little bit
i wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distinctive athlete
those of you who have seen the picture in the little bio it might have given it away i'm a double amputee
i was born without fibulas in both legs i was amputated at age one and i've been running like hell
students out of the nation every year to get involved in international affairs and so i won a full ride to georgetown
and i've been there for four years love it
aimee got there she decided that she 's kind of curious about track and field so she decided to call someone and start asking about it so why don't you tell
and i'd never competed on a disabled level you know i'd always competed against other able bodied athletes that's all i'd ever known in fact i'd never even met another amputee until i was seventeen and i heard
you know that they do these track meets with all disabled runners and i figured oh i don't know about this but before i judge it let me go see what it's all about so i booked myself a flight to boston in ninety five
for me panting and heaving and i had these legs that were made of like a wood and plastic compound this
this and
know what i was expecting but you know when i saw a man who was missing an entire leg go up to the high jump hop on one leg to the high jump and clear it at six feet two inches dan o 'brien jumped five eleven in ninety six in atlanta
i mean if it just gives you a comparison of these are you know truly accomplished athletes without qualifying that word athlete and so i decided to give this a shot and
don't have any skill or finesse going down that track you were all over the place we all saw how hard you were working and
so i decided to call the track coach at georgetown and i thank god i didn't know just how huge this man is in the track and field world he 's coached
and you know the man 's office is lined from floor to ceiling with all
ran one race and i
well we should meet first before we decide anything you know he 's thinking what am i getting myself into so i met
these posters and magazine covers of people he 's coached and we sat and we got talking and it turned out to be a great partnership because he'd never coached a disabled athlete so therefore he had no
on this trip so he started giving me four days a week of his lunch break his free time
that i would come up to the track and train with him so that's how i met frank
that was fall of ninety five and then by the winter rolling around he said you know you're good enough you can run on our women 's track team here and i said no come
why don't you tell them like on your way to the olympics but a couple of memorable events happened at georgetown why don't you just tell
well you know i'd won everything as far as the disabled meets everything i competed in
better than you and i went out there and made it to the big east which was sort of the championship race
and really really hot and it's the first i had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio and
i didn't realize at that time that you know the amount of sweating that i would be doing in the sock it actually acted like a lubricant and i'd be
kind of pistoning in the socket and at about eighty five meters of my one hundred meters sprint in all my glory i
came out of my leg like i almost came out of it in front of like five thousand people
i i mean just mortified and because i was signed up for the two hundred a
there's no way i'm going two hundred meters and he just sat there
and you know my pleas fell on deaf ears thank god because he was like you know the man 's from brooklyn he 's a big i
i the
two years you've been running am no a year cheryl a year and why don't you tell them what happened right before you go run your race am okay well
atlanta the paralympics just for a little bit of clarification are the olympics for people with physical
here we are like a week after the olympics and down at atlanta and i'm just blown away by the fact that you know
a year ago i got out on a gravel track and couldn't run fifty meters and so here i am never lost i set new records at the u s nationals the olympic trials that may
and was just you know sure that i was coming home with the gold i was also the only
planar foot so we can't get off on the springboard i said well i just did it no one told me that so it's funny i'm three inches within the world record
and kept on from that point you know so i'm signed up in the long jump signed up no i made it for the long jump and the one hundred meter
and i'm sure of it you know i made the front page of my hometown paper that i delivered for six years you know it was like this is my time for
i was the first person in the world on these legs i was the guinea pig and
what kind of you know who 'm i running against here oh aimee we'll have to get back to you on that one i wanted to find out times don 't worry you 're you know you're doing great this is twenty minutes before my
looking the next lane lane two is twelve point eight lane three is twelve point five
which one of these is not like the other
five golds when i skied and everything i came in first and georgetown you know that was great i was losing but it was the best training because this was atlanta
oh my god my whole family you know got in a van and drove down here from pennsylvania and you know i was the only female u s sprinter so you know they call us out and
you have one minute and when i was putting my blocks in
my last card to play here is at least you know if i'm not going to beat these girls i'm going to
the rocky iv sensation of me versus germany and you know everyone else estonia and poland was in this heat and you know the gun went off and
you know finishing last and you know fighting back tears of frustration and
i became a collegiate athlete you know i became an olympic athlete and it made me really think about how you know the achievement was getting there i mean the fact that i set my sight just a year and three months before that
know and their patience you know to deal with me and that was like this collective glory that there was you know fifty people behind me that
had joined in this incredible experience of going to atlanta so i mean it 's i apply this sort of philosophy now to everything i do about like this
you know sitting back and realizing the progression like how far you've come at this day to this goal
it's important to focus on a goal i think but you know also recognize the progression on the way there and how you've grown as a person you know that's the achievement i think that's the
these are my cosmetic legs actually and they're absolutely beautiful
to come up and see them there are hair follicles on them and i can paint my toenails and
ewing who played for georgetown in the eighties comes back every summer and i had incessant fun making fun of him in the training room because he'd come in with he
as i did anyway okay now these are my sprinting legs made of carbon graphite i said
i said got
different height am in these cheryl in these am i don't know i don't think
really stand on these legs she has to be moving silicon sock
and so i run on these and
i stand in these legs my hamstring and my glutes are contracted as i would be had i had feet and were standing on the ball of my feet
it's a company in san diego called flex foot and i was a guinea pig and as i hope to continue to be in every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out
but actually these like i said are still the actual prototype i need to get some new ones because the last
so these are the sprint legs and i can put my other
your mobility or you know even fashion i mean i love the fact that i can go in anywhere and pick out what i want and the shoes i want the skirts i want
i'm hoping to try to bring these over here and make them accessible to a lot of people
they're also silicon this is like a really basic basic prosthetic limb under here it's like a barbie
i mean it's just stuck in this position so i have to wear a two inch heel and i mean it's really it
you can see it but like it really is there's veins on the feet and then my heel 's like pink you know and my achilles tendon that moves a little bit and it's really an amazing sort
a year and two weeks ago and this is just a silicon piece of skin i mean what happened was two years ago this man in belgium was saying you know god if i can go to madame tussauds wax museum and see
we ha luckily the hotel was terrific they got
these legs are great i'm doing i'm actually going back in a couple of weeks to get some improvements i want to get legs like these made for
