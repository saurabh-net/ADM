the future of life and where the unraveling of our biology and bring up the lights a little bit i don't have any slides i'm just going to talk about where that's likely to carry us
and you know i saw all the visons of the first couple of sessions it almost made me feel a little bit guilty about having an uplifting talk about the future
felt wrong to do that in some way and yet i don't really think it is because when it comes down to it it's this larger trajectory that is really what is going to remain what people in the future are going to remember about this period
i want to talk to you a little bit about why the visions of jeremy rivkins
who would like to ban these sorts of technologies or of the bill joys who would like to relinquish them are actually
to follow those paths would be such a tragedy for us i'm focusing on biology
the biological sciences the reason i'm doing that is because those are going to be the areas that are the most significant
the reason for that is really very simple it's because we're flesh and blood we're biological creatures and what we can do with our biology is going to shape our future
and that of our children and that of their children whether we gain control over aging whether we learn to protect ourselves from alzheimer 's
and heart disease and cancer i think that shakespeare really put it very nicely and i'm actually going to use his words in the same order that he did
he said and so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe and then from hour to hour we rot and
and thereby hangs a tale life is short you know and we need to think about planning a little bit
we're all going to eventually even in the developed world have to lose everything that we love when you're beginning to rot a little bit
all of the videos crammed into your head all of the extensions that extend your various powers
are going to being to seem a little secondary and you know i'm getting a little bit gray so is ray kurzweil so
this is where it's really central to our lives now i know there's been a whole lot of hype about our power to control biology you just have to look at the human genome project
it wasn't two years ago that everybody was talking about we've found the holy grail of biology we're deciphering the code of codes we're reading the book of life
you know it's two thousand and three and there is no hal and there no odyssey to our own moon much less the moons of jupiter and we're still picking up pieces of the challenger
so it's not surprising that some people would wonder whether maybe thirty or forty years from now we'll look back at this instant in time
and all of the sort of talk about the human genome project and what all this is going to mean to us well it will really mean precious little
and i just want to say that that is absolutely not going to be the case because when we talk about our genetics and our biology
and modifying and altering and adjusting these things we're talking about changing ourselves and this is very critical stuff
if you have any doubts about how technology affects our lives you just have to go to any major city this is not the stomping ground
of our pleisticine ancestors what's happening is we're taking this technology it's becoming more precise more potent and
we're turning it back upon ourselves before it's all done we are going to alter ourselves every bit as much as we have changed the world around us
it's going to happen a lot sooner than people imagine on the way there it's going to
to be a human being the larger context of this is that are two unprecedented
it's changing our lives in so many ways and it will continue to do that what the essence of that is is that we're taking the sand at our feet the inert silicon at our feet and we're
a level of complexity into it that rivals that of life itself and may even surpass it as an outgrowth of that as a child of that revolution is the revolution in biology
the genomics revolution proteomics metabolomics all of these omics that sound so terrific on grants and on business plans
what we're doing is we are seizing control of our evolutionary future i mean we're essentially using technology to just jam evolution into fast forward it's not at all clear where it's going to take us
but in five to ten years we're going to start see some very profound changes the most immediate changes that we'll see are things like in medicine
going to be a big shift towards preventative medicine as we start to be able to identify all of the risk factors that we have as individuals
but who is going to pay for all this and how are we going to understand all this complex information that is going to be
the it challenge of the next generation is communicating all this information there's pharmacogenomics a combination of pharmacology and genetics
that's going to have amazing impacts and it's going to be used for diet as well and nutritional supplements and such but it's going to have a big impact because
have niche drugs and we aren't going to be able to support the kinds of expenses that we have to create blockbuster drugs today the approval process is going to fall apart actually it's too slow
it's too risk averse and it is really not suited for the future that we're moving into another thing is we're just going to have to deal with this knowledge it's really wonderful when we hear
oh ninety nine point nine percent of the letters in the code are the same we're all identical to each other isn't it wonderful
and look around you and know that what we really care about is that little bit of difference we look the same to a visitor from another planet maybe but not to each other
because we compete with each other all time and we're going to have to come to grips with the fact that there are differences between us as individuals that we will know about and between
of humans as well to deny that that's the case is not a very good start on that a generation or so away
like aging what if we could unravel aging and understand it begin to retard the process or even reverse it it would change absolutely everything
and it's obvious to anyone that if we can do this we absolutely will do this whatever the consequences are
the second is modifying our emotions i mean ritalin viagra
things of that sort prozac you know this is just clumsy little baby steps what if you could take a little
that if it doesn't have any overt side effects probably not and if you don 't who are you going to be why do you do what you do we're sort of circumventing
the idea that we're going to chose our children 's genes as we begin to understand what genes say about who we are
that's the focus of my book redesigning humans where i talk about the kinds of choices we'll make and the challenges it's going to present to society there are three obvious ways of doing this the first is cloning it didn't happen
it's a total media circus it will happen in five to ten years and when it does it's not going to be that big a deal the birth of a delayed identical twin is not
going to shake western civilization but there are more important things that are already occurring embryo screening
you take a six to eight cell embryo you tease out one of the cells you run a genetic test on that cell and depending on the results of that test
you either implant that embryo or you discard it it's already done to avoid rare diseases today and pretty soon it's going to be possible to avoid
used by those who have infertility problems and are already doing in vitro fertilization to the wealthy who want to protect their children to just about everybody else
and in that process that's going to morph from being just for diseases to being for lesser vulnerabilities like risk of manic depression or something
to picking personalities temperaments traits these sorts of things of course there is going to be genetic engineering directly going in it's a little bit further away but not that far away
going in and altering the genes in the first cell in an embryo
the way i suspect it will happen is using artificial chromosomes and extra chromosomes so we go from forty six to forty seven or forty eight and one that is not heritable because who would want to pass on to their children the archaic
and it won 't be done but when something is feasible in thousands of laboratories all over the world which is going to be the case with these technologies
when there are large numbers of people who see them as beneficial which is already the case and when they're almost impossible to police it's not a question of if this is going to
it's when and where and how it's going to happen humanity is going to go down this path
in a big way the second is we're human that's what we do we try to use our technology to improve our lives in one way or another
to imagine that we're not going to use these technologies when they become available is as much a denial of who we are as to imagine that we'll use these technologies and not fret and worry about it
deal the lines are going to blur and they already are between therapy and enhancement between treatment and prevention between need and desire that's really the central one i believe
we need to make wise decisions about how to use these technologies so sure we need to debate these things and i think it's wonderful that we do
but we shouldn 't kid ourselves and think that we're going to reach a consensus about these things that is simply not going to happen
they touch us too deeply and they depend too much upon history upon philosophy upon religion upon culture upon politics
some people are going to see this as an abomination as the worst thing as just awful other people are going to say this is great this is the flowering of human endeavor
the one thing though that is really dangerous about these sorts of technologies is that it's easy to become
seduced by them and to focus too much on all the high technology possibilities that exist and to lose touch
with the basic rhythms of our biology and our health there are too many people that think that high technology medicine is going to keep them save them
from overeating from eating a lot of fast foods from not getting any exercise it's not going to happen in the
midst of all this amazing technology and all these things that are occurring it's really interesting because there is sort of a counter revolution that is going on a resurgence of interest
remedies from the past in nutraceuticals in all of these sorts of things that some people in the pharmaceutical industry particularly like to brand as non science
but this whole effort is generated is driven by it as well because that is how we're gathering all this information and linking it and integrating it together
a lot in this rich biota that is going to serve us well and that's where about half of our drugs come so we shouldn 't dismiss this because it's an enormous opportunity
to use these sorts of results or these random lose trials from the last thousand years about what has impacts on our health
and to use our advanced technologies to pull out what is beneficial from this sea of noise basically in fact this isn't just abstract
i just formed a biotechnology company that is using this sort of an approach to develop theraputics for alzheimer 's and other diseases of aging
you look forward i mean future humans far before the end of this millennium in a few hundred years they are going to look back at this moment
and from the beginning of today 's sessions you'd think that they're going to see this as this horrible difficult painful period that we struggled through and i don't think that's what is going to happen they're going to do like everybody does
about all that stuff and they are actually going to romanticize this moment in time they are going to think about it as this glorious instant
when we laid down the very foundations of their lives of their society of their future
it's a little bit like a birth where there is this bloody awful mess happens and
what comes out of it new life actually as was pointed out earlier we forget about all the struggle there was in getting there so to me
it's clear that one of the foundations of that future is going to be the reworking of our biology it's going to come gradually at first it's going to pick up speed we're going to make lots of errors
that's the way these things work to me it's an incredible privilege to be alive
now and to be able to witness this thing it is something that is a unique instant in the history of all of life it will always be remembered
and what's extraordinary is that we're not just observing this we are the architects of this i think that we should be proud of
what is so difficult and challenging is that we are also the objects of these changes it's our health it's our lives it's our future it's our children
and that is why they are so very troubling to so many people who would pull back in fear
i think that our choice in the choice of life is not whether we're going to go down this path we are definitely
it's how we hold it in our hearts it's how we look at it i think thucidites really spoke to us very clearly in four hundred and thirty b c he put it nicely again i'll use the words in the same order he did
the bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of what is before them
both glory and danger alike and yet notwithstanding they go out and they meet it thank you
