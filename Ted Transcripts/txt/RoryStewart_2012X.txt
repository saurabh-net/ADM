and he sits down and the teacher says
what does your father do
and little billy says my father plays the piano in an opium den
so the teacher rings up the parents and says very shocking story
from little billy today just heard that he claimed that you play the piano in an opium den
and the father says i 'm very sorry yes it 's true
i lied but how can i tell an eight year old boy
that his father is a politician
a snake a monkey and an iguana and through all of this i feel strongly
that something is going wrong four hundred years of maturing democracy
colleagues in parliament who seem to me as individuals reasonably impressive an increasingly educated energetic informed population
and yet a deep deep sense of disappointment
my colleagues in parliament include in my new intake
family doctors businesspeople professors distinguished economists historians writers
army officers ranging from colonels down to regimental sergeant majors
all of them however including myself as we walk underneath
those strange stone gargoyles just down the road feel that we 've become less than the sum of our parts
feel as though we have become
it 's a problem across the developing world and in middle income countries too in jamaica for example
a dismal depressing landscape of burnt and half abandoned buildings
ten years ago however the promise of democracy seemed to be extraordinary
george w bush stood up in his state of the union address in two thousand and three and said that democracy was the force
that would beat most of the ills of the world he said because democratic governments respect their own people and respect their neighbors freedom will bring peace
distinguished academics at the same time argued that democracies had this incredible range of side benefits they would bring prosperity security overcome sectarian violence ensure that states would never again harbor terrorists since then what 's happened
well what we 've seen is the creation in places like iraq and afghanistan
what we find in afghanistan is a judiciary that is weak and corrupt a very limited civil society which is largely ineffective
a media which is beginning to get onto its feet but a government that 's deeply unpopular
and security that is shocking security that 's terrible
in lots of sub saharan africa
again you can see democracy and elections are compatible with corrupt governments with states that are unstable and dangerous and when i have conversations with people i remember having a conversation for example in iraq with a community that asked me
whether the riot we were seeing in front of us this was a huge mob ransacking a provincial council building was a sign of the new democracy the same i felt
was true in almost every single one of the middle and developing countries that i went to and to some extent the same is true of us
well what is the answer to this is the answer to just give up on the idea of democracy
we were imposing anything other than a democratic system anything else would run contrary to our values it would run contrary to the wishes of the people on the ground it would run contrary to our interests
i remember in iraq for example
so in iraq in two thousand and three the decision was made let 's not have elections for two years let 's invest in voter education let 's invest in democratization
the result was that i found stuck outside my office a huge crowd of people this is actually a photograph taken in libya but i saw the same scene in iraq of people
standing outside screaming for the elections and when i went out and said
what is wrong with the people that we have chosen
there is a sunni sheikh there 's a shiite sheikh there 's the seven leaders of the seven major tribes there 's a christian there 's a sabian there are female representatives there 's every political party in this council
what 's wrong with the people that we chose the answer came
the problem isn 't the people that you chose the problem is that you chose them
i have not met in afghanistan in even the most remote community anybody who does not want a say in who governs them
most remote community i have never met a villager who does not want a vote
so we need to acknowledge that despite the dubious statistics despite the fact that eighty four percent of people in britain feel politics is broken
despite the fact that when i was in iraq we did an opinion poll in two thousand and three and asked people what political systems they preferred and the answer came back that
seven percent wanted the united states
five percent wanted france three percent wanted britain and nearly forty percent wanted dubai which is after all not a democratic state at all but a relatively prosperous minor monarchy democracy is a thing of value for which we should be fighting
but in order to do so we need to get away from instrumental arguments we need to get away from saying
why should we get away from those arguments because they 're very dangerous if we set about saying for example torture is wrong
because it doesn 't extract good information
or we say you need women 's rights because it stimulates economic growth by doubling the size of the work force you leave yourself open to the position where the government of north korea can turn around and say well actually we 're having a lot of success extracting good information with our torture at the moment
the point about democracy is not instrumental it 's not about the things that it brings the point about democracy is not that it delivers legitimate effective prosperous
rule of law it 's not that it guarantees peace with itself or with its neighbors
the point about democracy is intrinsic democracy matters because it reflects an idea of equality and an idea of liberty it reflects an idea of dignity
the dignity of the individual the idea that each individual should have an equal vote an equal say in the formation of their government
but if we 're really to make democracy vigorous again
after i speak to you today i 'm going on a radio program called any questions and the thing you will have noticed about politicians on these kinds of radio programs is that they never ever say that they don 't know the answer to a question it doesn 't matter what it is
we need to stop that to stop pretending to be omniscient beings politicians also need to learn occasionally to say that certain things that voters want certain things that voters have been promised may be things that we cannot deliver
or perhaps that we feel we should not deliver
and the second thing we should do is understand
the genius of our societies
our societies have never been so educated have never been so energized have never been so healthy have never known so much cared so much or wanted to do so much and it is a genius of the local
one of the reasons why we 're moving away from banqueting halls such as the one in which we stand banqueting halls with extraordinary images on the ceiling of kings enthroned
the entire drama played out here on this space where the king of england had his head lopped off why we 've moved from spaces like this thrones like that towards the town hall is we 're moving more and more towards the energies of our people and we need to tap that
that can mean different things in different countries in britain
it could mean looking to the french
learning from the french getting directly elected mayors in place in a french commune system
but for any of these things to work
the honesty in language the local democracy it 's not just a question of what politicians do it 's a question of what the citizens do for politicians to be honest the public needs to allow them to be honest
and the media which mediates between the politicians and the public needs to allow those politicians to be honest if local democracy is to flourish it is about the active and informed engagement of every citizen in other words
if democracy is to be rebuilt
is to become again vigorous and vibrant
it is necessary not just
