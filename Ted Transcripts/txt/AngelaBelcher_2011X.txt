and a lot of people might use structures like abalone shells like chalk
i 've been fascinated by how nature makes materials and there 's a lot of sequence to how they do such an exquisite job part of it is that these materials are macroscopic in structure but they 're formed at the nanoscale they 're formed at the nanoscale and they use
proteins that are coded by the genetic level that allow them to build these really exquisite structures
so something i think is very fascinating is what if you could give life to non living structures like batteries and like solar cells what if they had some of the same capabilities that an abalone shell did in terms of being able to build really exquisite structures at room temperature
and room pressure using non toxic chemicals and adding no toxic materials back into the environment so that 's the vision that
and so going back to this abalone shell besides being nano structured one thing that 's fascinating is when a male and a female abalone get together they pass on the genetic information that says this is how to build an exquisite material here 's how to do it at room temperature and pressure using non toxic materials
same with diatoms which are shown right here which are glasseous structures every time the diatoms replicate they give the genetic information that says here 's how to build
but anyone who 's ever had or knows small children knows they 're incredibly complex organisms
important to me also when we think about future technologies we start with the beginning of earth basically it took a billion years to have
and so that 's what i would like be able to do convince biology to work with the rest of the periodic table now if you look at
magnets used for navigation what all these have in common is these materials are structured at the nanoscale and they have a dna sequence that codes for a protein sequence that gives them the blueprint to be able to build these really wonderful structures
now going back to the abalone shell the abalone makes this shell by having these proteins these proteins are very negatively charged and they can pull calcium out
in order to do it and so an interesting idea is what if you could take any material that you wanted or any element on the periodic table and find its corresponding dna sequence then code it for a corresponding protein sequence to build a structure but not build an abalone shell build something that through nature it has never had the opportunity to work with yet
and so here 's the periodic table and i absolutely love the periodic table every year for the incoming freshman class at mit i have a periodic table made that says welcome to mit now you 're in your element and you flip it over and it 's the amino acids
how do i give president obama a periodic table what if he says oh i already have one or i 've already memorized it laughter and so he came to visit my lab and looked around it was a great visit and then afterward i said
well it has a simple dna structure that you can go in and cut and paste additional dna sequences into it and by doing that it allows the virus to express random protein sequences and this is pretty easy biotechnology and you could basically do this a billion times
and so you can go in and have a billion different viruses that are all genetically identical but they differ from each other based on their
and so the other thing that 's beautiful about biology is that biology gives you really exquisite structures with nice link scales and these viruses are long and skinny
and we can get them to express the ability to grow something like semiconductors or materials for batteries now this is a high powered battery that we grew in my lab we engineered a virus to pick up carbon nanotubes so one part of the virus grabs a carbon nanotube
but it 's basically you can pull one out of a billion you can make lots of amplifications to it basically you make an amplification in the lab and then you get it to self assemble into a structure like a battery
and you get an energy transfer across the virus
and then we give it a second gene to grow an inorganic material that can be used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen that can be used for clean fuels and i brought an example with me of that today my students promised me it would work
these are virus assembled nanowires when you shine light on them you can see them bubbling in this case you 're seeing oxygen bubbles come out and basically by controlling the genes you can control multiple materials to improve your device performance
the last example are solar cells you can also do this with solar cells we 've been able to engineer viruses to pick up carbon nanotubes and then grow titanium dioxide around them and use as a way of getting electrons through the device
interesting things to be learned about how nature makes materials and taking it the next step to see if you can
