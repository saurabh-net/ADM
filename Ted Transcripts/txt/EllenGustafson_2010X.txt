and i'm totally obsessed with food but i didn't start out obsessed with food i started out obsessed with global security policy because i lived in new york during nine eleven and it was obviously a very relevant thing
and i got from global security policy to food because i realized when i'm hungry i'm really pissed off and i'm assuming the rest of the world is
it looks pretty much like the areas of the world that are hungry are also the areas of the world that are pretty insecure so i took a job at the united nations world food programme as a way to try to address
these security issues through food security issues and while i was there i came across what i think is the most brilliant of their programs it's called school feeding and it's a really simple idea to sort of get in the middle of cycle of poverty and hunger that continues for a lot of people around the world and stop it
of school meals for one kid it's so simple and we thought you know okay it costs between twenty and fifty bucks to provide school feeding for a year we could sell these bags and raise a ton of money and a ton of awareness for the world food programme but of course
you know at the u n sometimes things move slowly and they basically said no and we thought god this is such a good idea and it's going to raise so much money so we said screw it we'll just start our own company
which we did three years ago so that was kind of my first dream was to start this company called feed and here 's a screenshot of our website we did this bag
for haiti and we launched it just a month after the earthquake to provide school meals for kids in haiti so feed 's doing great we've so far provided fifty five million meals to kids around the world
i really love it and the thing that's a little strange about international hunger and talking about international issues is that most people kind of want to know what are you doing in america what are you doing for america 's
in the last thirty years unfortunately obesity 's not only an american problem it's actually been spreading all around the world and mainly through our kind of food systems that
the numbers are pretty crazy there's a billion people obese or overweight and a billion people hungry so those seem like two bifurcated problems but i
and agriculture is where food comes from well
are produced lead to the foods that we eat well the foods that are produced are more or less corn soy and wheat and as you can see that's three quarters of the food that we're eating for the most part processed foods and fast foods
fallen precipitously as hunger has risen so somehow we're not making the connect between exporting a good agricultural system that will help feed people all around the world
who is farming them that's what i was wondering and so i went and stood on a big grain bin in the mid west and that really didn't help me understand farming but i think i took a really cool picture and when i spend time
in general and their farms are also large
in the rest of the world are actually quite skinny and that's because they're starving most hungry people in the world are subsistence farmers and most of those people are women
what is farmed ends up as what we eat and in america a lot of what we eat has led to obesity and has led to a real change in sort of what our diet is in the last thirty years
it's crazy a fifth of kids under two drinks soda hello you don't put soda in bottles but people do because it's so cheap
system around the world and when you look at the data of least developed countries especially in cities which are growing really rapidly people are eating american processed foods
and in one generation they're going from hunger and all of the detrimental health effects of hunger to obesity and things like diabetes and heart disease in one generation so the problematic food system is affecting both hunger and obesity not
but this is a global food system where there's a billion people hungry and billion people obese
that's the only way to look at it and instead of taking these two things as bifurcated problems that are really separate it's really important to look at them as one system
the farm crisis in america and the change in how we've addressed agriculture internationally so there's a lot of reasons to take this thirty year time period as sort of the creation of this new food system
i'm not the only one who 's obsessed with this whole thirty year thing the icons like michael pollan and jamie oliver in his ted prize wish both addressed
in my lifetime a lot of what's happened in the world and being a person obsessed with food a lot of this has really changed so my second dream is that i think we can look to the next thirty years as a time to change the food system again
and we know what's happened in the past so if we start now and we look at technologies and improvements to the food system long term we might be able to recreated the food system so when i give my next talk and i'm sixty years old i'll be able to say that it's been a success
so i'm announcing today the start of a new organization or a new fund within the feed foundation called the thirty project and the thirty project is really focused on these long term ideas for food system change
and i think by aligning international advocates that are addressing hunger and domestic advocates that are addressing obesity we might actually look for long term solutions that will make the food system better for everyone
we all tend to think that these systems are quite different and people argue whether or not organic can feed the world but if we take a thirty year view there's more hope in collaborative ideas
so i'm hoping that by connecting really disparate organizations like the one campaign and slow food which don't seem right now to have much in common we can talk about
some ideas i've had is like look the reality is kids in the south bronx need apples and carrots and so do kids in botswana and how are we going to get those kids those nutritious foods
will be incredibly important to address things like climate change and how we use petrochemical fertilizers and you know these are really relevant topics that are
thinking about processed foods in a new way where we actually price the negative externalities like petrochemicals and like fertilizer runoff into the price of a bag of chips well if that bag of chips then becomes inherently more expensive than an apple
then maybe it's time for a different sense of personal responsibility in food choice because the choices are actually choices instead of three quarters of the products being made from corn soy and wheat
the thirty project org is launched and i've gathered a coalition of a few organizations to start and it'll be growing over the next few months but i really hope that you will all think of ways that you can look long term at things like the food system and make change
