in the mid seventy s there were not great opportunities for a bioengineer like me
and it was only taken up in two thousand thanks to the interest and the enthusiasm of the guinness family well this time we focused on trying to reconstruct the way the hall of the five hundred was before the remodeling and the so called sala grande which was built in one thousand four
well we also learned that vasari who was commissioned to remodel the hall of the five hundred between one thousand five hundred and sixty and one thousand five hundred and seventy four by the grand duke cosimo i of the medici family we have at least two instances when he saved masterpieces specifically
by placing a brick wall in front of it and leaving a small air gap one that we see here masaccio the church of santa maria novella in florence
so we just said well maybe visari has done something like that in the case of this great work of art by leonardo since he was a great admirer of leonardo da vinci and so we built some very sophisticated radio antennas just for probing both walls and searching for an air gap
and we did find many on the right panel of the east wall an air gap and that 's where we believe the battle of anghiari or at least the part that we know has been painted which is called the fight for the standard should be located well from there
unfortunately in two thousand and four the project came to a halt many political reasons so i decided to go back to my alma mater
and at the university of california san diego and i proposed to open up a research center for engineering sciences for cultural heritage
and in two thousand and seven we created cisa three as a research center for cultural heritage specifically art architecture and archaeology so students started to flow in and we started to build technologies because that 's basically what we also needed in order to move forward and go and do fieldwork
we came back in the hall of the five hundred in two thousand and eleven and this time with a great group of students
and my colleague professor falko kuester who is now the director at cisa three and we came back just since we knew already where to look for to find out if there was still something left
of what it turns out to be a reddish color black color and there is some beige fragments that later on
we ran a much more sophisticated exams xrf x ray diffraction
this great masterpiece he was
named the number one artist influence at the time i
see here the face of the madonna of the chair that when just shining a uv light on it you suddenly see another different lady
you see the unicorn a lot has been said and written about the unicorn but if you take an x ray of the unicorn it becomes a puppy dog
and laughter no problem but unfortunately continuing with the scientific examination of this painting came out that rafael did not paint the unicorn did not paint the puppy dog actually left the painting unfinished so all this writing about the exotic symbol of the unicorn
take this example otto marseus nice painting which is still life at the pitti gallery
and just have an infrared camera peering through and luckily for art historians it just was confirmed that there is a signature of otto marseus it even says when it was made and also the location so that was a good result sometimes it 's not that good
and so again authenticity and science could go together and change the way not attributions being made but at least lay the ground for a more objective or i should rather say less subjective attribution as it is done today
and just peering through this brown layer of this masterpiece to reveal what could have been underneath
well this happens to be the most important painting we have in italy by leonardo da vinci and look at the wonderful images of faces that nobody has seen for five centuries
look at these portraits they 're magnificent you see leonardo at work you see the geniality of his creation right directly on the ground layer of the
finding i should rather say an elephant laughter because of this elephant over seventy new images came out never seen for centuries
this was an epiphany we came to understand and to prove that the brown coating that we see today was not done by leonardo da vinci which left us only the other drawing that for five centuries we were not able to see so thanks only to technology
well the tablet well we thought well
so let 's say that we go to a museum with a tablet
and we just aim the camera of the tablet to
and we see the elephant
and there are a lot of figures showing up
well we believe again that this should be the beginning the very first step to do real conservation and allowing us to really explore and to understand everything related to the state of our conservation the technique materials and also if when we should restore
well our vision is to rediscover the spirit of the renaissance create a new discipline where engineering
for cultural heritage is actually a symbol of blending art and science together we definitely need a new breed of engineers that will go out and do this kind of work and rediscover for us these values these cultural values that we badly need especially today
and if you want to summarize in one just single word well this is what we 're trying to do we 're trying to give a future to our past in order
