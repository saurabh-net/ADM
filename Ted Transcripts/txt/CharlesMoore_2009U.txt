trash you know we had to be taught to renounce the powerful conservation ethic we developed during the great depression and world war
after the war we needed to direct our enormous production capacity toward creation of products for peacetime
life magazine helped in this effort by announcing the introduction of throwaways that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes
now melting point has a lot to do with this plastic is not purified by the re melting process like glass and metal it begins to melt below the boiling point of water and does not drive off oily contaminants for which it is a sponge
to the sea here is the accumulation at biona creek next to the airport and here is the flotsam near california state university long beach and the de sal plant we visited yesterday
in spite of deposit fees much of this trash leading out to the sea will be plastic beverage bottles we use two million of them in the united states every five minutes
here imaged by ted presenter chris jordan who artfully documents mass consumption and zooms in for more detail
here is a remote island repository for bottles off the coast of baja california
san roque is an uninhabited bird rookery off baja 's sparsely populated central coast notice that the bottles here have caps on them
are produced in separate factories from a different plastic polypropylene they will float in seawater but unfortunately do not get recycled under the bottle bills
after ten years a lot of the japanese caps are in what we call the eastern garbage patch while ours litter the philippines
after twenty years we see emerging the debris accumulation zone of the north pacific gyre it so happens that millions of albatross nesting on kure and midway atolls
in the northwest hawaiian islands national monument forage here and scavenge whatever they can find for regurgitation to their chicks a four month old laysan albatross chick died with this in its stomach
hundreds of thousands of the goose sized chicks are dying with stomachs full of bottle caps and other rubbish like cigarette lighters
but mostly bottle caps sadly their parents mistake bottle caps for food tossing about in the ocean surface
the retainer rings for the caps also have consequences for aquatic animals this is mae west still alive at a zookeeper 's home in new orleans
i wanted to see what my home town of long beach was contributing to the problem so on coastal clean up day in two thousand and five i went to the long beach peninsula
at the east end of our long beach we cleaned up the swaths of beach shown i offered five cents each for bottle caps i got plenty of takers
here are the one thousand one hundred bottle caps they collected i thought i would spend twenty bucks that day i ended up spending nearly sixty i separated them by color
and put them on display the next earth day at cabrillo marine aquarium in san pedro governor schwarzenegger and his wife maria stopped by to discuss the display in spite of my girly man hat
i showed him and maria a zooplankton trawl from the gyre north of hawaii with more plastic than plankton here 's what our trawl samples from the plastic soup
our ocean has become look like trawling a zooplankton net on the surface for a mile produces samples like this
now when the debris washes up on the beaches of hawaii it looks like this
and this particular beach is kailua beach the beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving to washington now how do we analyze samples like this one that contain more plastic than plankton
we sort the plastic fragments into different size classes from five millimeters to one third of a millimeter small bits of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutants up to a million times their levels in the surrounding seawater
we wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean at the base of the food chain was ingesting these poison pills we did hundreds of necropsies
and over a third had polluted plastic fragments in their stomachs the record holder only two and a half inches long had eighty four pieces in its tiny stomach
now you can buy certified organic produce but no fish monger on earth
can sell you a certified organic wild caught fish this is the legacy we are leaving to future generations
the throwaway society cannot be contained it has gone global we simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff we have to throw it away together again
levels are increasing the amount of packaging is increasing the throwaway concept of living is proliferating and it's showing up in the ocean
he offers no hope of cleaning it up straining the ocean for plastic would be beyond the budget of any country and it might kill
