become a polar specialist photographing specializing in the polar regions began when i was four years old when my family moved from southern canada to northern baffin island up by greenland there we lived with
all of my time was spent outside with the inuit playing the snow and the ice were my sandbox and the inuit were my teachers and that 's where i became
truly obsessed with this polar realm and i knew someday that i was going to do something that had to do with trying to
share news about it and protect it
i sat there on the river for two months without seeing one i thought my career 's over i proposed this stupid story to national geographic what in the heck was i thinking so i had two months to sit there and figure out different ways of what i was going to do in my next life after i was a photographer because they were going to fire me because national geographic is a magazine they remind us all the time they publish pictures not excuses
bear through the forest he went through this old growth forest and sat up beside this four hundred year old culturally modified tree and went to sleep and i actually got to sleep within three feet of him just in the forest and photograph him so i 'm very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross section of my work that i 've done on the polar regions please enjoy
and what does that mean after a while of reading this in the news it just becomes news you glaze over with it and what i 'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this
and i want people to understand and get the concept that if we lose ice we stand to lose an entire ecosystem projections are that we could lose polar bears they could become extinct in the next fifty to one hundred years
and there 's no better sexier more beautiful charismatic megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on
polar bears are amazing hunters this was a bear i sat with for a while on the shores there was no ice around but this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it and this bear
grabbed it swam back and ate it
and he was so full he was so happy and so fat eating this seal that as i approached him about twenty feet away to get this picture his only defense was to keep eating more seal and as he ate he was so full he probably had about two hundred lbs of meat in his belly and as he ate inside one side of his mouth he was regurgitating out
the other side of his mouth so as long as these bears have any bit of ice they will survive
we 're finding more and more dead bears in the arctic when i worked on polar bears as a biologist twenty years ago we never found dead bears
ice here 's a mother and her two year old cub were traveling
on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere and they 're riding on this big piece of glacier ice which is great for them they 're safe at this point they 're not going to die of hypothermia they 're going to get to land but unfortunately ninety five percent of the glaciers in the arctic are also
these ringed seals these are the fatsicles of the arctic these little fat dumplings one hundred and fifty pound bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear and they 're not like the harbor seals that you have here these ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected
and here we are diving in the beaufort sea the visibility 's six hundred ft we 're on our safety lines the ice is moving all over the place i wish i could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive but
what 's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi year ice that big chunk of ice up in the corner in that one single piece of ice you have three hundred species of microorganisms
and in the spring when the sun returns to the ice it forms the phytoplankton grows under that ice and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed and then you get the zoo plankton feeding on all that life so really what the ice does is it acts like a garden it acts like the soil in a garden it 's an inverted garden losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden
here 's me in my office i hope you appreciate yours this is
and so i 'm just so happy that the dive is over i get to hand my camera to my assistant and i 'm looking up at him and i 'm going woo woo woo which means take my camera and he thinks i 'm saying take my picture so we had this little communication breakdown
i dropped down in this ice hole just through that hole that you just saw and i looked up under the underside of the ice and i was dizzy i thought i had vertigo i got very nervous no rope no safety line the whole world is moving around me and i thought i 'm in trouble but what happened is that the entire underside was full of these billions of
feeding on the underside of the ice giving birth and living out their entire life cycle this is the foundation of the whole food chain in the arctic right here and when you have low productivity in this in ice the productivity in copepods go down
this is a bowhead whale
supposedly science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now
this very whale right here could be over two hundred and fifty years old this whale could have been born around the start of the industrial revolution it could have survived one hundred and fifty years of whaling and now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the north because of the lives that we 're leading in the
on all the copepods and amphipods alright my favorite part
when i 'm on my deathbed
i 'm going to remember one story more than any other even though that spirit bear moment was powerful i don 't think i 'll ever have another experience like i did with these leopard seals
a scientist was taken down and drowned and she was being consumed by a leopard seal and people were like we knew they were vicious we knew they were and so people love to form their opinions and that 's when i got a story idea i want to go to antarctica get in the water with as many leopard seals as i possibly can and give them a fair shake find out if they really are these vicious
animals or if they 're misunderstood so this is that story
oh and they also happen to eat happy feet
floating in these icy waters and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon the boat starts to sink they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked all the leopard seal was doing it 's just biting a balloon it just sees this big balloon in the ocean it doesn 't have hands it 's going to take a little bite the boat pops and off they go
after five days of crossing the drake passage we have finally arrived
and so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin came under the boat the zodiac starting hitting the hull of the boat and we 're trying to not fall in the water and we sit down and that 's when goran said to me this is a good seal ya it 's time for you to get in the water
and i looked at goran and i said to him forget that but i think i probably used a different word starting with the letter f
such dry mouth and my legs were just trembling i couldn 't feel my legs i put my flippers on i could barely part my lips i put my snorkel in my mouth
and i rolled over the side of the zodiac into the water and this was the first thing she did she came
all i had to work with at that point but i just started to shoot these pictures so she did this threat display for a few minutes and then the most amazing thing happened she totally relaxed
she went off she got a penguin she stopped about ten feet away from me and she sat there with this penguin the penguin 's flapping and she let 's it go the penguin swims toward me takes off she grabs another one she does this over and over and it dawned on me that she 's trying to feed me a penguin why else would she release these penguins at me
and after she did this four or five times she swam by me
with this dejected look on her face you don 't want to be too anthropomorphic but i swear that she looked at me like this useless predator 's going to starve in my ocean
and so that didn 't work so then she 'd get another penguin and try this ballet like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this laughter and she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me this went on for four days this just didn 't happen a couple of times
and she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like are you for real because she can 't believe i can 't eat this penguin because in her world you 're either breeding or you 're eating and i 'm not breeding so
penguins and on the last day with this female where i thought i had pushed her too far i got nervous because she came up to me she rolled over on her back and she did this deep guttural jackhammer sound this gokgokgokgok and i thought she 's about
it 's a story that lives
we 've got to get the story out now thank you very much
