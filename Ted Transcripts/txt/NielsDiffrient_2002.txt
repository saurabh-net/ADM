and was always flown by a guy who looked like cary grant he had high leather boots jodhpurs an old leather jacket
a wonderful helmet and those marvelous goggles and inevitably a white scarf
to flow in the wind he 'd always walk up to his airplane in a kind of
everything about flying in those years which was you have to stop and think for a moment was probably the most advanced technological thing going on at the time so as a youngster i tried to get close to this
by drawing airplanes constantly drawing airplanes it 's the way i got a part of this romance and of course in a way when i say romance
i mean in part the aesthetics of that whole situation i think the word is the holistic experience revolving around a product the product
was that airplane but it built a romance even the parts of the airplane had french names ze fuselage
fantasy airplanes i wanted to build airplanes so i built
model airplanes and i found that in doing the model airplanes the appearance drawings
were not enough you couldn 't transfer those to the model itself if you wanted it to fly you had to learn the discipline of flying up without crashing
and in so doing i could produce a model that would fly stay in the air and it had once it was in the air some of this romance that i was in love with
well the act of drawing airplanes led me to when i had the opportunity to choose a course in school led me to sign up for aeronautical engineering and when i was sitting in classes
i had to learn mathematics and mechanics and all this sort of thing i 'd wile away my time drawing airplanes in the class
one day a young man looked over my shoulder he said you draw very well you should be in the art department and i said why and he said well for one thing there are more girls there was temporarily shifted
design some architecture eventually hired myself out as a designer and for the following twenty five years living in italy living in america i doled out a piece of this romance to anybody who 'd pay for it
this sense this aesthetic feeling for the experience revolving around
a designed object and it exists any of you who rode the automobiles was it yesterday at the track you know the romance revolving around those high performance cars
well in twenty five years i was mostly putting out
pieces of this romance and not getting a lot back in because design on call doesn 't always connect you with a circumstance in which you can produce things of this nature so after twenty five years i began to feel as though i was running dry and i quit
and i quit and i started up
a very small operation went from forty people to one
in an effort to rediscover my innocence i wanted to get back where the romance was and i couldn 't choose airplanes because they had gotten sort of unromantic at that point even though i 'd done a lot of airplane work
and i chose chairs specifically because i knew something about them i 'd designed a lot of chairs over the years for tractors and trucks and submarines all kinds of things
but not office chairs so i started doing that
and i found that there were ways to duplicate
the same approach that i used to use on the airplane
only this time instead of the product being shaped by the wind it was shaped
with the body and what the body needs wants indicates it needs and that 's the way ultimately after some ups and downs i ended up designing the chair i 'm going to show you i should say one more thing when i was doing those model airplanes
i did everything i conceived the kind of airplane i basically engineered it i built it and i flew it and that 's the way i work now
and i felt the one thing they don 't need is a chair that interferes with their main reason for sitting there
so i took the approach that the chair should do as much for them as humanly possible or as mechanistically possible so that they didn 't have to fuss with it
so my idea was that instead of sitting down and reaching for a lot of controls
that you would sit on the chair and it would automatically balance your weight against the force required to recline
now that may not mean a lot
to some of you but you know most good chairs do recline because it 's beneficial to open up this
joint between your legs and your upper body for better breathing and better flow
so that if you sit down on my chair
deals with your weight and
transfers the amount of force required to recline
in a way that you don 't have to look for something to adjust
i 'll tell you right up front this is a trade off
there are drawbacks to this one is you can 't accommodate everybody there are some very light people some extremely heavy people maybe people with a lot of bulk up top they begin to fall off the end of your chart
the compromise i felt was in my favor because most people
properly approached from the standpoint of how much of an aid they could be
to your work life but i felt it was too much to ask to have to adjust each individual armrest in order to get it where you wanted
so i spent a long time i said i worked eight or nine years on it and each of these things went along sort of in parallel but incrementally were a problem of their own
i worked a long time on figuring out how to move the arms over a much greater arc that is up and down
and make them a lot easier so that you didn 't have to
use a button and so after many trials many failures we came up with a very simple arrangement in which we could just move one arm or the other and they go up easily and stop where you want
you can put them down essentially out of the way no arms at all or you can pull them up where you want them and this was another thing that
i felt while not nearly as romantic as cary grant
nevertheless begins to grab a little bit of
aesthetic operation aesthetic performance into a product
reclining was a very important factor and the more you can recline
but you transfer weight off your tailbones
would everybody put their hand under their bottom and feel their tailbone
and that 's a lot of load just relieving your arms with armrests
takes twenty percent of that load off now that if your spine is not held in a good position will help bend your spine the wrong way and so on so to unload
great weight if that indeed exists
you can recline when you recline you take away a lot of that load off your bottom end and transfer it to your back
you have to use muscle force to hold your head there so that 's where a headrest comes in now headrest is a challenge because you want it to
i 've got five inches of adjustment here
and you need it in a different position when you 're upright then when you 're reclined so i knew that had to be solved and had to be automatic so if you watch this chair as i recline
we stole the idea from bicycle seats and put gel in the cushions and in the armrests to absorb point load
while you 're sitting in it you can adjust it down for the five footer
or you can adjust it
for the six foot six guy all within the scope
