have you ever wondered how such a situation can be turned around have you ever looked at the arab uprisings and thought how could we have predicted that or how could we have better prepared for that well my personal story
my personal journey what brings me to the ted stage here today
is a demonstration of exactly what 's been happening in muslim majority countries over the course of the last decades at least and beyond
i want to share some of that story with you but also some of my ideas around change and the role of social movements in creating change in muslim majority societies
so let me begin by first of all giving a very very brief history of time if i may indulge
in medieval societies there were defined allegiances an identity was defined primarily by religion and then we moved on into an era in the nineteenth century with the rise of a european nation state where identities and allegiances were defined by ethnicity
so identity was primarily defined by ethnicity and the nation state reflected that in the age of globalization we moved on
i call it the era of citizenship where people could be from multi racial multi ethnic backgrounds but all be equal as citizens in a state you could be american italian you could be american irish you could be british pakistani
but i believe now that we 're moving into a new age and that age the new york times dubbed recently as the age of behavior
how i define the age of behavior is a period of transnational allegiances where identity is defined more so by ideas and narratives and these ideas and narratives that bump people across borders are increasingly beginning to affect the way in which people behave now this is not all necessarily good news
because it 's also my belief that hatred
has gone global just as much
up until the last six months the people who have been capitalizing most on the age of behavior and the transnational allegiances using
digital activism and other sorts of borderless technologies those who 've been benefiting from this have been extremists
and that 's something which i 'd like to elaborate on
if we look at the phenomenon of far right fascists
one thing they 've been very good at
one thing that they 've actually been exceeding in is communicating across borders using technologies to organize themselves to propagate their message
and to create truly global phenomena now i should know
because for thirteen years of my life i was involved in an extreme islamist organization
and i was actually a potent force in spreading ideas across borders and i witnessed the rise of islamist extremism as distinct from islam the faith
and the way in which it influenced my co religionists across the world and my story my personal story is truly evidence for the age of behavior that i 'm attempting to elaborate upon here i was by the way i 'm an essex lad born and raised in essex in the u k anyone who 's from england knows the
reputation we have from essex
having been born in essex at the age of sixteen
i joined an organization at the age of seventeen i was recruiting people from cambridge university to this organization at the age of nineteen i was on the national leadership of this organization in the u k
by the age of twenty four i found myself convicted in prison in egypt
being blacklisted from three countries in the world for attempting to overthrow their governments
being subjected to torture in egyptian jails and sentenced to five years as a prisoner of conscience
now that journey and what took me from essex all the way across the world by the way we were laughing at democratic activists
we felt they were from the age of yesteryear we felt that they were out of date i learned how to use email
from the extremist organization that i used
i learned how to effectively communicate across borders without being detected eventually i was detected of course in egypt
but the way in which i learned to use technology to my advantage was because i was within an extremist organization that was forced to think beyond the confines of the nation state the age of behavior where ideas and narratives were increasingly defining behavior and identity and allegiances
so as i said we looked to the status quo and ridiculed it and it 's not just islamist extremists that did this but even if you look across the mood music in europe of late far right fascism is also on the rise a form of anti islam
rhetoric is also on the rise and it 's transnational and the consequences that this is having
is that it 's affecting the political climate across europe
what 's actually happening is that what were previously localized parochialisms individual or groupings of extremists who were isolated from one another have become interconnected
in a globalized way and have thus become or are becoming mainstream
because the internet and connection technologies are connecting them across the world
if you look at the rise of far right fascism across europe of late you will see some things that are happening that are influencing domestic politics yet the phenomenon is transnational in certain countries mosque minarets are being banned in others headscarves are being banned in others kosher and halal meat are being banned as we speak
and on the flip side
we have transnational islamist extremists doing the same thing across their own societies and so they are pockets of parochialism that are being connected in a way that makes them feel like they are mainstream now that never would have been possible before they would have felt isolated
until these sorts of technologies came around and connected them in a way that made them feel part of a larger phenomenon
well i believe they 're getting left far behind and i 'll give you
an example here at this stage if any of you remembers the christmas day bomb plot
was represented by his father the head of the nigerian bank warning the cia
the old mentality with a capital o as represented by the nation state
not yet fully into the age of behavior not recognizing the power of transnational social movements got left behind and the christmas day bomber almost succeeded in attacking the united states of america
again with the example of the far right that we find
so why are they succeeding and why are democracy aspirants falling behind
if i asked you to think of the ideas of al qaeda that 's something that comes to your mind immediately if i ask you to think of their narratives the west being at war with islam the need to defend islam against the west these narratives they come to your mind immediately incidentally the difference between ideas and narratives the idea is the cause
so the ideas and the narratives of al qaeda come to your mind immediately if i ask you to think of their symbols and their leaders they come to your mind immediately one of their leaders was killed in pakistan recently
so these symbols and these leaders come to your mind immediately
and i ask you to think of
the symbols and the leaders for democracy in pakistan today you 'll be hard pressed to think beyond
the assassination of benazir bhutto which means by definition that particular leader no longer exists one of the problems we 're facing is in my view that there are no globalized youth led
grassroots social movements advocating for democratic culture across muslim majority societies there is no equivalent of the al qaeda without the terrorism for democracy across muslim majority societies there are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols advocating the democratic culture on the ground
so that begs the next question
and i believe that 's for four reasons i believe number one it 's complacency because those who aspire to democratic culture the second i believe
the second i believe is political correctness
but actually going out to propagate that view is associated with either neoconservativism or with islamist extremism to go around saying that i believe democratic culture
is the best that we 've arrived at as a form of political organizing
is associated with extremism and the third
ask people to vote for them as the democratic party but then the other parties ask them to vote for them as the military party wanting to rule by military dictatorship and then you have a third party saying vote for us we 'll establish a theocracy so democracy has become
merely one political choice among many other forms of political choices available in those societies
and what happens as a result of this is when those parties are elected
and inevitably they fail or inevitably they make political mistakes democracy takes the blame for their political mistakes
and then people say we 've tried democracy it doesn 't really work let 's bring the military back again
and the fourth reason i believe is what i 've labeled here on the slide as the ideology of resistance what i mean by that is if the world superpower today was a communist
it would be much easier for democracy activists to use democracy activism as a form of resistance against colonialism than it is today with the world superpower being america occupying certain lands
when talking about those reasons let 's break down certain preconceptions is it just about grievances is it just about
the majority of those who join extremist organizations are highly educated
statistically they are educated on average above the education levels of western society
anecdotally we can demonstrate that if poverty was the only factor well bin laden is from one of the richest families in saudi arabia
international aid and development has been going on for years
but extremism in those societies in many of those societies has been on the rise and what i believe is missing
is genuine grassroots activism on the ground in addition to international aid in addition to education in addition to health not exclusive to these things but in addition to them is propagating a genuine demand for democracy on the ground and this is where i believe neoconservatism had it upside down
neoconservatism had the philosophy that you go in with a supply led approach to impose democratic values from the top down
whereas islamists and far right organizations for decades have been building demand for their ideology on the grassroots
they 've been building civilizational demand for their values on the grassroots and we 've been seeing those societies slowly transition
and what 's needed is a genuine transnational
youth led movement that works to actively advocate for the democratic culture which is necessarily more than just elections
but without freedom of speech you can 't have free and fair elections without human rights you don 't have the protection granted to you to campaign
without freedom of belief you don 't have the right to join organizations so what 's needed is those organizations on the ground advocating for the democratic culture itself
to create the demand on the ground for this culture
alongside other choices such as military rule and theocracy
whereas if we start building this demand on the ground on a civilizational level rather than merely on a political level a level above politics
movements that are not political parties but are rather creating this civilizational demand for this democratic culture what we 'll have in the end is this ideal that you see on the slide here the ideal that people should vote in an existing democracy not for a democracy
but to get to that stage where democracy builds the fabric of society and the political choices within that fabric but are certainly not theocratic and military dictatorship
now to conclude how does that happen well
egypt is a good starting point the arab uprisings have demonstrated that this is already beginning but what happened in the arab uprisings and what happened in egypt was particularly cathartic for me
what happened there was a political coalition gathered together for a political goal and that was to remove the leader
we need to move one step beyond that now we need to see how we can help those societies move from political coalitions loosely based political coalitions to civilizational coalitions that are working for the ideals and narratives of the democratic culture on the ground because it 's not enough to remove a leader or ruler or dictator
that doesn 't guarantee that what comes next will be a society built on democratic values
but generally the trends that start in egypt have historically spread across the mena region the middle east and north africa region
so when arab socialism started in egypt it spread across the region in the eighty s and ninety s when islamism started in the region it spread across the mena region as a whole and the aspiration that we have at the moment as young arabs are proving today and instantly rebranding themselves
as being prepared to die for more than just terrorism
is that there is a chance that democratic culture can start in the region and spread across to the rest of the countries that are surrounding that but that will require helping these societies transition from having merely political coalitions to building genuinely grassroots based social movements
that advocate for the democratic culture and we 've made a start for that in pakistan with a movement called khudi
where we are working on the ground to encourage the youth to create genuine buy in for the democratic culture and it 's with that thought that i 'll end and my time is up and thank you for your time
