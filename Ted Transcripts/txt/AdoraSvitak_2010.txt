now i want to start with a question when was the last time you were called childish for kids like me being called childish can be a frequent occurrence
we are called childish which really bothers me after all take a look at these events imperialism and colonization
world wars george w bush ask yourself who 's responsible what have kids
frank touched millions with her powerful account of the holocaust ruby bridges helped end segregation in the united states and most recently charlie simpson
to raise one hundred and twenty thousand pounds for haiti on his little bike so as you can see evidenced by such examples age has absolutely nothing to do with it
the traits the word childish addresses are seen so often in adults that we should abolish this age discriminatory word when it comes to criticizing behavior associated with irresponsibility
say that certain types of irrational thinking
exactly what the world needs maybe you've had grand plans before but stopped yourself thinking that's impossible or that costs too much or that won 't benefit me
for better or worse we kids aren't hampered as much when it comes to thinking about reasons why not to do things kids can be full of inspiring aspirations and hopeful thinking
like my wish that no one went hungry or that everything were free kind of utopia how many of you still dream like that and believe in the possibilities
on the other hand we kids still dream about perfection and that's a good thing because in order to make anything a reality you have to dream about it first
in many ways our audacity to imagine helps push the boundaries of possibility for instance the museum of glass in tacoma washington my home state yoohoo washington
our inherent wisdom doesn't have to be insiders knowledge kids already do a lot of learning from adults
teachers and students and i like this analogy it shouldn 't just be a teacher at the head of the classroom telling students do this do that the students should teach their teachers
learning between grown ups and kids should be reciprocal the reality unfortunately is a little different and it has a lot to do with trust or a lack of it
don't trust someone you place restrictions on them right if i doubt my older sister 's ability to pay back the ten percent interest i established on her last loan i'm going to withhold her ability to get more money from me until she pays it back
true story by the way
to have a prevalently restrictive attitude towards kids from every don 't do that don 't do this in the school handbook to restrictions on school internet use
as history points out regimes become oppressive when they're fearful about keeping control and although adults may not be quite at the level of totalitarian regimes
kids have no or very little say in making the rules when really the attitude should be reciprocal meaning that the adult population should learn and take into account the wishes of the younger population
now what's even worse than restriction is that adults often underestimate kids abilities we love challenges but when expectations are low trust me we will sink to them
to write from the age of four and when i was six my mom bought me my own laptop equipped with microsoft word thank you bill gates and thank you ma
i wrote over three hundred short stories on that little laptop and i wanted to get published
many publishers were not quite so encouraging one large children 's publisher ironically saying that they didn't work with children
and from there on it's gone to speaking at hundreds of schools keynoting to thousands of educators and finally today speaking to you i appreciate your attention today because to show that you truly care you listen but
just like you really the goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult but rather better adults than you have been which may be a little challenging considering your guys credentials
no matter your position of place in life it is imperative to create opportunities for children so that we can grow up to blow you away
because we are the leaders of tomorrow which means we're going to be taking care of you when you're old and senile no just kidding
really we are going to be the next generation the ones who will bring this world forward and in case you don't think that this really has meaning for you
now the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas kids need opportunities to lead and succeed
