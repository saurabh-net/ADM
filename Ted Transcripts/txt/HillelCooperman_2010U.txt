so these are the dark ages and the dark ages are the time between when you put away the lego for the last time as a kid and you decide as an adult that it is okay to play with
started out with my then four year old oh should buy the kid some lego that stuff 's cool walked into the lego store bought him this
it's totally appropriate for a four year old
i think the box says let 's see here eight to twelve on it i turn to my wife and said
who are we buying this for she's like oh us i'm like okay all right that's cool pretty soon it got a little bit out of control
the dining room looked like this you walk there and it hurts
so we took a room downstairs in the basement that had been used as sort of an abu ghraib annex
torture very funny wow you guys are great and we put down those little floor tiles and then i went onto ebay and bought one hundred and fifty pounds of lego
is insane my daughter the day we got it i was tucking her in and
i said honey you're my treasure and she said no the lego is we're lego rich
it's just nuts whatever so then you realize there are these conventions and you go to one of these conventions and some dude built the titanic and you're like holy shit he had to come in like a
a semi with this thing and then built this this is the smith tower in seattle just beautiful and there's a dude selling these aftermarket
for lego because lego the danish no they're not into guns but the americans oh we'll make some guns for lego no problem and
you're like whoa this is a really nerdy crowd and i mean like this is a nerdy crowd but that's like a couple of levels above furries
the nerds here they get laid except for the lady with the condoms in her pocket and you said to yourself at some point am i
of this group like am i into this and i was just like yeah i guess i am i'm coming out i'm kind of into this stuff and
and then some of the designs that people do they actually sell in the store the lego guys don't give you any royalties strangely but some user made this and then it sold and it's pretty amazing actually
then you notice that if that lego provided cad program isn't enough there's an entire open source third party independent
lego cad program that lets you do three d modeling and three d rendering and make in fact movies
out of lego three d films of which there are thousands on youtube and some of them sort of mimicking famous films and some totally original
content just beautiful and people recreating all sorts of things i have to take a moment i love the guy who 's like running
with his clasps his hooks okay anyway
i don't mean he made lego that looked like a slot machine i mean he made a slot machine out of lego the insides were lego there's people getting drunk building lego and you've got to finish the thing before you puke there's a whole gray market
for lego thousands of home based businesses and some people will fund their entire lego habit by selling the little guys but then you have no guys in your ships and then just some examples this stuff really is sculpture
this is amazing what you can do and don't kid yourself some architectural details incredible organic shapes and just again nature out of again little blocks
this is my house and this is my house i was afraid a car was going to come smash it as i was taking a picture for you guys anyway i'm out of time
just very quickly we'll just see if i can do this quick because there aren't enough ted logos around here
