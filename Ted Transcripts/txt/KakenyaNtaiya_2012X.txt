i did everything that i needed to do to become a perfect wife
i went to school not because the maasais women or girls were going to school
why did she say that my father worked as a policeman in the city he came home once a year we didn 't see him for sometimes even two years and whenever he came home
and he went and drank with his friends in the bars because my mother was a woman she was not allowed to own any property and by default everything in my family anyway belongs to my father so he had the right and if my mother ever questioned him he beat
i had a dream i wanted to become a teacher
so i wanted to become a teacher
in our tradition there is a ceremony that girls have to undergo to become women and it 's a rite of passage to womanhood
well my dream of becoming a teacher will not
i talked to my father i did something that most girls have never done i told my father i will only go through this ceremony if you let me go back to school
i did the ceremony happened it 's a whole week long of excitement it 's a ceremony people are enjoying it and the day before the actual ceremony happens we were dancing having excitement and
they were all in a circle
and as we danced and danced and we approached this circle of women men women children everybody was there there was a woman sitting in the middle of it and this woman was waiting to hold us i was
as i opened my leg another woman came
and this woman was carrying a knife and as she carried the knife she walked toward me and she held the clitoris and she cut it off as you can imagine i bled i bled after bleeding for a while i fainted thereafter
it 's something that so many girls i 'm lucky i never died but many die it 's practiced it 's no anesthesia it 's a rusty old knife and it was difficult
i was lucky because one also my mom did something that most
women don 't do three days later after everybody has left the home my mom went and brought a nurse we were taken care of
three weeks later i was healed and i was back in high school
i was so determined to be a teacher now
so that i could make a difference in my family it was quite attractive
i told him well i want to go to where you
but i needed the support of the village and here again
when the men heard and the people heard that a woman had gotten an opportunity to go to school they said what a lost opportunity this should have been given to a boy we can 't do this so i went back and i had to go back to the tradition there 's a belief among our people that
can you support me to go to america
i promised him that i would be the best girl i will
to get an education i arrived in america as you can imagine what did i find
i was in a land of plenty
after i graduated from here i worked at the u n i went back to school to get my graduate work the constant cry of these girls was in my face i had to do something as i went back
and the reason they wanted the school for girls is because when a girl is raped when she 's walking to school
the mother is blamed for that if she got pregnant
before she got married the mother is blamed for that and she 's punished she 's beaten they said we wanted to put our girls in a safe place
as we moved and i went to talk to the fathers the fathers of course you can imagine what they said we want a school for boys and i said
and i looked at her i remember that day
as a new dawn is happening in my school a new beginning is happening as we speak right now one hundred and twenty five girls will never be mutilated one hundred twenty five girls
will not be married when they 're twelve years old one hundred twenty five girls are creating and achieving their dreams
very optimistic you are somebody who is so passionate you are somebody who wants to see a better world you are somebody who wants to see that war ends no poverty you are somebody who wants to make a difference you are somebody who wants to make our tomorrow better
that if you do that and i do that the maasais the boys
