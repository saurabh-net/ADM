idea is a very very small idea
can unlock billions of big ideas
that are at the moment dormant inside us and my little idea that will do that is sleep
this is a room of sleep deprived women and
two and half years ago i fainted from exhaustion i hit my head on my desk i broke my cheek bone i got five stitches on my right eye and i began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep
and in the course of that i studied i met with medical doctors scientists and i'm here to tell you
that the way to a more productive more inspired more joyful life is getting enough sleep
and we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution this new feminist issue we are literally going to sleep our way to the top
men sleep deprivation has become a
i was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before and i felt like saying to him but i didn't say it i felt like saying you know what if you had gotten five this dinner would have been a lot more
there is now a kind of sleep deprivation one upmanship especially here
you try to make a breakfast date and you say how about eight o 'clock they're likely to tell you eight o'clock is too late for me but that's okay i can get a game of tennis in and do a few
far too many icebergs hitting our titanics in fact i have a feeling that if lehman brothers was lehman brothers and sisters they might still be
while all the brothers were busy just being hyper connected twenty four seven
maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg because she would have woken up from a seven and a half or eight hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture
so as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment what is good for us on a personal level what's going to bring more joy gratitude
effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world so i to shut your eyes
and discover the great ideas that lie inside us to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep thank you
