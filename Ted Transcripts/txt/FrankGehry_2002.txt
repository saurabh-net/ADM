i listened to this scientist this morning and doctor mullis was talking about his experiments and i realized that i almost became a scientist
when i was fourteen my parents bought me a chemistry set and i decided to make water
so i made a hydrogen generator
and i made an oxygen generator and i had the two pipes leading into a beaker and i threw a
i'd like to start again just start this session again the gentleman to my left is the very famous perhaps overly famous frank gehry
it is astonishing for an artist for an architect
to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time i mean you have become whether you can giggle at it because it's funny you know it's a strange thought but your building is an icon you can draw a little picture of that building it can be used in ads
and you've had not rock star status but celebrity status in doing what you wanted to do for most of your life and i know the road was extremely difficult
and it didn't seem that your sell outs
whatever they were were very big you kept moving ahead in a life
dependent on working for somebody
but that's an interesting thing for a creative person a lot of us work for people we're in the hands of other people
that and that makes your win doubly big triply big it's not quite a question but you can comment on it it's a big issue well i've always just
i've never really gone out looking for work i always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head and
when i started out i thought that architecture was a service business and that you had to please the clients and stuff and i realized when i'd come in to the meetings with these
corrugated metal and chain link stuff and people would just look at me like i'd just landed from mars
but i couldn't do anything else that was my response to the people and the time and it was responding to
clients that i had that didn't have very much money so they couldn't afford very much i think it was circumstantial until i got to my house where the client was my wife
i built a house around it and
's building this huge concrete place and it was late in the evening we'd had a lot to drink we were standing out in the desert all alone and he said
thinking about my house he said did it ever occur to you if you built stuff more permanent somewhere in two thousand years somebody 's going to like it
so i thought yes that's probably a good idea luckily i started to get some
where do we go now back to everything 's so temporary i don't see it the way you characterized i ever did and
i get the sweats i go in and start working i'm not sure where i'm going if i knew where i was going i wouldn't do it when i can predict or plan it i
do it i discard it so i approach it with the same trepidation obviously over time i have a lot more confidence
that it's going to be ok i do
the project is with i think a healthy insecurity and like the playwright said the other day i could relate to him you're not sure when
embarrassed by it i felt an embarrassment how could i have done that how could i have made shapes like that or done stuff like that it's taken several years to
now look at it detached and say as you walk around the corner and a piece of it works with the road and the street and it appears to have a relationship
and explained it all to me and i thought he was nuts and i didn't think he knew what he was doing and he pulled it off so i think he 's icarus and phoenix all in one guy
and he gets up there and then he comes back up
still talking about it september eleven
generated some interest in moving it over to ground zero and i'm totally against
when will that be finished fg that will be finished in two thousand and three september october and i'm hoping kyu and
herbie and yo yo and all those guys come play with us at that place
luckily today most of the people i'm working with are people i really like richard koshalek is probably one of the main reasons that disney hall came to me he 's been a cheerleader
for quite a long time there aren't many people around that are really involved with architecture as clients you know if you think about the world and even just in this audience most of us
are involved with buildings nothing that you would call architecture right and so to find one
a guy like that you hang on to him you know he 's become the head of art center and
a building by craig ellwood there i knew craig and respected him and they want to add to it and it's hard to add to a building like that was intuitive
grew up and lived in portugal and is probably considered the portuguese main guy in architecture i visited with him a few years ago and he showed me his early work and his early work
had a resemblance to my early work when i came out of college i started to try to do things contextually in southern california and you got into
the logic of spanish colonial tile roofs and things like that i tried to understand that language as a beginning as a place to jump off
and there was so much of it being done by spec builders and it was trivialized so much that it
wasn't i just stopped i mean charlie moore did a bunch of it but it didn't feel good to me
siza on the other hand continued in portugal where the real stuff was and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language and
i always felt that he should come to southern california and do a building i tried to
a couple of jobs and they didn't pan out and i like the idea of collaboration with
people like that because it pushes you
done it with claes oldenburg and with richard serra who doesn't think architecture is art did you see that thing
he say fg he calls architecture plumbing
anyway the siza thing it's a richer experience it must be like that for kyu doing things with musicians it's similar to that i would imagine where you
it's like jazz you improvise you work together you play off each other you make
something they make something and i think it's a way of for me it's a way of trying to understand the city and what might happen in the city
near the current campus anyway he 's that kind of patron it's not his money of course
i don't know what's the schedule
the opening i'll invite you no but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting because it creates chaos right everybody doing their thing
makes a very chaotic environment and if you can figure out how to work off each other i mean it's not that
you can get a bunch of people who respect each other 's work and play off each other you might be able to create models for how to build sections of the city
without resorting to the one architect like the rockefeller center model which is kind of from another era
i found the most remarkable thing my preconception of bilbao
was in its context to the city that was the surprise of going across the river going on the highway around it
but you know richard most architects when they present their work most of the people we know you get up and you talk about your work and it's almost like you
tell everybody you're a good guy by saying look
i'm worried about the context i'm worried about the city i'm worried about my client i worry about budget that i'm on time blah blah blah and all that stuff and it's like
not going to get much work if it leaks bilbao did not leak i was so
they were there three days and it rained every day and they kept walking around i noticed they were looking under things
and they wanted to know where the buckets were hidden you know people put buckets out i was clean there wasn't a bloody leak in the place it was just fantastic
but you've got to yeah well up until then every building so this
had a fame his fame was built on that in l a for a while
wright story when the woman called and said mister wright i'm sitting on the couch and the water 's pouring in on my head and he said madam move your chair
so some years later i was doing a building a little house on the beach for norton simon and his secretary who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady called me and said
but my point is that
and i call it the then what ok you solved all the problems you did all the stuff you made nice you loved your clients you loved the city you're a good guy you're a good person
and then what what do you bring to it and i think that's what i've always been interested in is that which is a personal kind of expression
bilbao i think shows that you can have that kind of personal expression and still touch all the bases
that are necessary of fitting into the city that's what reminded me of it and i think that's the issue you know it's the then what that most clients who hire architects most
aren't hiring architects for that they're hiring them to get it done get it on budget you know
at a certain point a number of years ago people when
michael graves was a fashion before
i did a teapot and nobody bought it
people wanted a michael graves building is that a curse that people want a bilbao building
i've gotten called since bilbao opened which is now four five years i don't know both krens and i have been called
with i don't know at least one hundred opportunities china brazil
other parts of spain to come in and do the bilbao effect and i've met with some of these people usually i say no right away
but some of them come with pedigree and they sound well intentioned and they get you for at least
one or two meetings in one case i flew all the way to malaga with a team because the thing was signed with seals and various
you know very official seals from the city and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port and i asked them what kind of building it was when you get here we'll explain
so four of us went and they took us they put us up in a great hotel and we were looking over the
and then they took us in a boat out in the water and showed us all these sights in the harbor
each one was more beautiful that the other and then
going to have lunch with the mayor and we were going to have dinner with the most important people in malaga and just before going to lunch with the mayor
we went to the harbor commissioner it was a table as long as this carpet and the harbor commissioner was here and i was here and my guys and
we sat down and we had a drink of water and everybody was quiet and the guy looked at me and said now what can i do for you mister gehry
oh my god fg so i got up
i said to my team let 's get out of here we stood up we walked out they followed the guy that dragged us there followed us and he said you mean you're not going to have lunch with the mayor i said nope you 're not going to have dinner at all
they just brought us there to hustle this group you know to create a project and we get a lot of that
luckily i'm old enough that you know i can complain i can't travel
i don't have my own plane
are you going to talk about me or you
i want to get a standing ovation like
