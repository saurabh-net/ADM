and i think that 's some of the fear that we see about jobs disappearing from artificial intelligence and robots that we 're overestimating the technology in the short term but i am worried
whether we 're going to get the technology we need in the long term because the demographics are really going to leave us with lots of jobs that need doing and that we our society is going to have to be built on the shoulders of steel of robots in the future so i 'm scared we won 't have enough robots
but fear of losing jobs to technology has been around for a long time back in one thousand nine hundred and fifty seven there was a spencer tracy katharine hepburn movie so you know how it ended up spencer tracy brought a computer a mainframe computer of one thousand nine hundred and fifty seven in to help the librarians the librarians in the company would do things like answer for the executives
by the way the wages for librarians went up faster than the wages for other jobs in the u s over that same time period because librarians became partners of computers computers became tools and they got more tools that they could use and become more effective during that time
same thing happened in offices back in the old days people used spreadsheets spreadsheets were spread sheets of paper and they calculated by hand
but here was an interesting thing that came along with the revolution around one thousand nine hundred and eighty of p c s the spreadsheet programs were tuned for office workers not to replace office workers but it respected office workers as being capable of being programmers
so office workers became programmers of spreadsheets it increased their capabilities
they no longer had to do the mundane computations but they could do something much more
now today we 're starting to see robots in our lives on the left there is the packbot from irobot when soldiers came across roadside bombs in iraq and afghanistan instead of putting on a bomb suit and going out and poking with a stick as they used to do up until about two thousand and two they now send the robot out so the robot takes over the dangerous jobs
on the right are some tugs from a company called aethon in pittsburgh these are in hundreds of hospitals across the u s and they take the dirty sheets
down to the laundry they take the dirty dishes back to the kitchen they bring the medicines up from the pharmacy and it frees up the nurses and the nurse 's aides from doing that mundane work of just mechanically pushing stuff around to spend more time with patients in fact robots have become sort of ubiquitous in our lives in many ways
but i think when it comes to factory robots people are sort of afraid because factory robots are dangerous to be around
in order to program them you have to understand six dimensional vectors and quaternions and ordinary people can 't interact with them and i think it 's the sort of technology that 's gone wrong it 's displaced the worker from the technology
and then it 'll go back reach for another object the interesting thing is baxter has some basic common sense
by the way what 's going on with the eyes the eyes are on the screen there the eyes look ahead where the robot 's going to move so a person that 's interacting with the robot understands where it 's going to reach and isn 't surprised by its motions
here chris took the object out of its hand and baxter didn 't go and try to put it down it went back and realized it had to get another one it 's got a little bit of basic common sense
but i think the most interesting thing about baxter is the user interface and so chris is going to come and grab the other arm now
and when he grabs an arm it goes into zero force gravity compensated mode and graphics come up on the screen you can see some icons on the left of the screen there for what was about its right arm he 's going to put something in its hand he 's going to bring it over here press a button and let go of that thing in the hand
the object from it just moves it around and the robot figures out that was an area search he didn 't have to select that from a menu and now he 's going to go off and train the visual appearance of that object while we continue talking
so as we continue here i want to tell you about what this is like in factories these robots we 're shipping every day they go to factories around the country this is mildred mildred 's a factory worker in connecticut she 's worked on the line for over twenty years one hour after she saw her first industrial robot she had programmed it to do some tasks in the factory
she decided she really liked robots and it was doing the simple repetitive tasks that she had had to do beforehand
now she 's got the robot doing it when we first went out to talk to people in factories about how we could get robots to interact with them better one of the questions we asked them was do you want your children to work in a factory the universal answer was no i want a better job than that for my children
and as a result of that mildred is very typical of today 's factory workers in the u s they 're older and they 're getting older and older there aren 't many young people coming into factory work and as their tasks become more onerous on them
we need to give them tools that they can collaborate with so that they can be part of the solution so that they can continue to work and we can continue to produce in the u s
and so our vision is that mildred who 's the line worker becomes mildred the robot trainer she lifts her game like the office workers of the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s lifted their game of what they could do
we 're not giving them tools that they have to go and study for years and years in order to use they 're tools that they can just learn how to operate in a few minutes there 's two great forces that are both volitional but inevitable that 's climate change and demographics demographics is really going to change our world
this is the percentage of adults who are working age and it 's gone down slightly over the last forty years but over the next forty years it 's going to change dramatically even in china the percentage of adults who are working age drops dramatically and turned up the other way the people who are retirement age goes up
very very fast as the baby boomers get to retirement age that means there will be more people with fewer social security dollars competing for services but more than that
as we get older we get more frail and we can 't do all the tasks we used to do
and older that 's happening statistically right now
and as the number of people who are older above retirement age and getting older as they increase there will be less people to take care of them and i think we 're really going to have to have robots to help us and i don 't mean robots in terms of companions i mean robots doing the things
that we normally do for ourselves but get harder as we get older getting the groceries in from the car up the stairs into the kitchen
or even as we get very much older driving our cars to go visit people and i think robotics gives people a chance to have dignity as they get older by having control of the robotic solution so they don 't have to rely on people that are getting scarcer to help them
spending more time with robots like baxter and working with robots like baxter in our daily lives and that we will
here baxter it 's good
