a couple of years ago i was turning sixty and i don 't like being sixty
of what little i had done with my life it wasn 't the resume of breaking this record here it was more like who had i become how had i spent my valuable time how could this have gone by like lightning and i couldn 't
all the time i had spent beating myself up for losing my marriage and not stopping the sexual abuse when i was a kid and career moves and this and this and this
just why why didn 't i do it better why why why and then my mother died at eighty two and so i starting thinking not only am i not happy with the past
now i 'm getting choked with i 've only got twenty two years left
what am i going to do with this short amount of time that 's just fleeting and i 'm not in the present whatsoever and i decided the remedy to all this malaise was going to be
for me to chase an elevated dream an extreme dream something that would require
and unwavering passion something that would make me be my best self in every aspect of my life every minute of every day because the dream was so big that i couldn 't get
there without that kind of behavior and that kind of conviction and i decided
it was an old dream that was lingering
that was from so many years ago three decades ago
the only sort of world class swim i had tried and failed at back in my twenty s was going from cuba to florida it was deep in my imagination
no one 's ever done it without a shark cage it 's daunting it 's more than a hundred miles across a difficult passage of ocean it 's probably at my speed at my age for anybody 's speed at anybody 's age going to take sixty maybe seventy hours of continuous swimming never getting out on the boat
and i started to train i hadn 't swum for thirty one years not a stroke
and i had kept in good shape but swimming 's a whole different animal as a matter of fact this picture is supposed to be me
during training it 's a smiling face and when you 're training for this sport you are not smiling
any time during this sport
as i said i respect other sports and i compare this sport sometimes to cycling and to mountain climbing and other of the expedition type events but this is a sensory deprivation a physical duress
and when i started in with the eight hours and the ten hours and the twelve hours and the fourteen hours and the fifteen hours and the twenty four hour swims
i knew i had it because i was making it through these and when i said i 'm going to go out and do a fifteen hour swim and we 're coming into the dock after a long day and it 's now night and we come in and it 's fourteen hours and fifty eight minutes and i can touch the dock and we 're done the trainer says
but honestly i sort of led i was the team leader and to get the government permissions you read in the paper you think it 's easy to get into cuba everyday try going in with an armada like we had of fifty people and five boats and cnn
it 's going to the east and you 'd like to go north
it 's tricky and there 's dehydration and there 's hypothermia and there are sharks
and i asked myself do you have it are your shoulders ready and they were they were prepared no stone left unturned was the mind ready you know
you save the french for last
and i had songs i had a playlist in my head not through headphones in my own head of sixty five songs and i couldn 't wait to get into the dark in the middle of the night because that 's when neil young comes out
but no for some reason i couldn 't wait to get into the dark of the night and be singing
before i started i finished stephen hawking 's the grand design
and i couldn 't wait to trip the mind fantastic about the fiftieth hour i was going to start thinking about
in both time and space and there 's nothing like swimming for fifty hours in the ocean that gets you thinking about things like this
i couldn 't wait to prove the athlete i am
that nobody else in the world can do this swim and i knew i could do it and when i jumped into that water i yelled in my mother 's french
this was it this was our time and i reminded myself a couple hours in you know the sport is sort of a microcosm of life itself
first of all you 're going to hit obstacles and
even though you 're feeling great at any one moment don 't take it for granted be ready because there 's going to be pain there 's going to be suffering it 's not going to feel this good all the way across
no two hours in wham never in my life i knew there were portuguese men o war all kinds of moon jellies all kinds of things but the box jellyfish from the southern oceans is not supposed to be in these waters and i was on
fire excruciating excruciating pain i don 't know if you can still see the red line here
and up the arm evidently a piece this big of tentacle has a hundred
thousand little barbs on it and each barb is not just stinging your skin it 's sending a venom the most venomous animal that lives in the ocean is the box jellyfish
and every one of those barbs is sending that venom into this central nervous system so first i feel like boiling hot
fire fire fire fire help me somebody help me and the next thing is paralysis i feel it in the back and then i feel it in the chest up here
he 's twenty nine years old very well built lean he 's six foot five weighs two hundred and sixty five lbs and he is down and he is crying and he 's yelling to my trainer who 's trying to help me and he 's saying
bonnie i think i 'm going to die my breath
and they started again with the epinephrine and the prednisone and with the oxygen and with everything they had on board and i got
back in and i swam through that night and into the next day and at forty one hours this body couldn 't make it
the devastation of those stings had taken the respiratory system down so that i couldn 't make the progress i wanted and the dream was crushed
and how odd is this intelligent person who put this together and got all these world experts together and i knew about the jellyfish but i was sort of cavalier a lot of athletes have this you know sort of
invincibility they should worry about me
i don 't worry about them i 'll just swim right through them we 've got benadryl on board if i get stung i 'll just grin and bear it well there was no grin and bearing this as a matter of fact the best advice i got was from an elementary school class in the caribbean
and i was telling these kids one hundred and twenty of them they were all in the school on the gymnasium floor
who really believe in what they believe in and so they wear bombs and i said well it 's odd that you 've learned of this as a noble kind of pursuit but yeah i know those guys he said
that 's what you need you need like a school of fish that would swim in front of you like this and so i started
swim in a bathing suit like normal and no joke this is it it came from the shark divers i finished the swim like this
i was swimming with this thing on
that 's how scared of the jellyfish i was
so now what do i do
i wouldn 't mind if every one of you came up on this stage tonight and told us how you 've gotten over the big disappointments of your lives because we 've all had them haven 't we we 've all had a heartache and so my journey now is to find some sort of grace in the face of this defeat
and i can look at the journey not just the destination i can feel proud i can stand here in front of you tonight and say i was courageous
to not suffer regrets anymore i got there with that goal when you live that way when you live with that kind of passion there 's no time there 's no time for regrets you 're just moving forward and i want to live every day of the rest of my life that way swim or no swim but the difference in accepting this particular defeat is that sometimes if cancer has won
if there 's death and we have no choice then grace and acceptance are necessary but that ocean 's still there this hope is still alive
and i don 't want to be the crazy woman who does it for years and years and years and tries and fails and tries and fails and tries and fails but i can swim from cuba to florida and i will swim from cuba to florida
he said did you know you 're going to die the same place you were born new york city and it 's going to be in january of thirty five
i said nope i didn 't know and now i 'm going to live to eighty five i have three more years than i thought
and so i ask myself i 'm starting to ask myself now even before this extreme dream gets achieved for me i 'm asking myself and maybe i can ask you tonight too
she says so what is it what is it you 're doing with this one wild and precious life of yours
