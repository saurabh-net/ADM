those trying to have good careers are going to fail
because really good jobs are now disappearing
there are great jobs and great careers and then there are the high workload high stress bloodsucking soul destroying kinds of jobs and practically nothing in between so the people looking for good jobs are going to fail i 'm going to talk about those looking for great jobs
great careers and why you 're going to why you 're going to fail first reason is
that no matter how many times people tell you if you want a great career you have to pursue your passion you have to pursue
you still look at it and decide not to do it i 'm not quite sure why you decide not to do it
you 're too lazy to do it it 's too hard you 're afraid if you look for your passion and don 't find it you 'll feel like you 're an idiot so then you make excuses about why you 're not going to look for your passion and they are excuses ladies and gentlemen we 're going to go through a whole long list
well great careers are really and truly for most people just a matter of luck so i 'm going to stand around i 'm going to try to be lucky and if i 'm lucky i 'll have a great career if not i 'll have a good career but a good career is an impossibility so that 's not going to work
then your other excuse is yes there are special people who pursue their passions but they are geniuses they are steven j i 'm not a genius when i was five i thought i was a genius but my professors have beaten that idea out of my head long since is damning yourself
with the faintest of praise and then of course another excuse well i would do this i would do this but but well after all
i 'm not weird everybody knows that people who pursue their passions are somewhat obsessive
people don 't have passion
that that 's going to give you a great career when all the evidence is to the contrary so let 's assume let 's deal with those of you who are trying to find your passion you actually understand that you really had better do it never mind the excuses you 're trying to find your passion
and you 're so happy
and what what are you trying to tell me that you well i have an interest i say do you have passion i have an interest you say your interest is compared to what well i 'm interested in this
and what about the rest of humanity 's activities i 'm not interested in them you 've looked at them all have you no not exactly
passion is your greatest love
passion is the thing that will
help you create the highest expression of your talent passion interest it 's not the same thing are you really going to go to your sweetie and say marry me
and that 's what passion is i have a friend proposed to his sweetie he was an economically rational person
he said to his sweetie let us marry
let us merge our interests
i was on a german exchange program then laughter i love you more than all right she left
after he got over his surprise at being you know turned down he concluded he 'd had a narrow escape from marrying an irrational person although he did make a note to himself that the next time he proposed it was perhaps
all of the women he had auditioned for the part
do you know what will happen at the end of your long life
your friends and family will be gathered in the cemetery and there beside your gravesite will be a tombstone and inscribed on that tombstone it will say here lies a distinguished engineer who invented velcro but what
but what that tombstone
should have said in an alternative lifetime what it should have said if it was your highest expression of talent was here lies the last nobel laureate in physics
who formulated the grand unified field theory and demonstrated the practicality of warp drive
one was a missed opportunity but then there are some of you
because because you 're not going to do it
because you will have invented a new excuse any excuse to fail to take action and this excuse i 've heard so many times yes i would pursue a great career
human relationships more than accomplishment i want to be a great friend i want to be a great spouse i want to be a great parent and i will not sacrifice them on the altar of great accomplishment
what do you want me to say now do you really want me to say now tell you really i swear i don 't kick children and
children and use them as a shield you know what will happen someday you you ideal parent you
the kid will come to you someday and say i know what i want to be
i know what i 'm going to do with my life you are so happy it 's the conversation a parent wants to hear because your kid 's good in math and you know you 're going to like what comes next says your kid i have decided i want to be a magician i want to perform magic tricks on the stage
and what do you say you say
you say umm that 's risky kid might fail kid don 't make a lot of money at that kid you know i don 't know kid you should think about that again kid you 're so good at math why don 't you and the kid interrupts you and says but it is my dream
it is my dream to do this
or are you going to tell him this i had a dream once kid but then you were born
there was something you could have said to your kid when he or she said i have a dream you could have said looked the kid in the face and said
why will you seek refuge in human relationships as your excuse not to find and pursue your passion you know why
in your heart of hearts you know why and i 'm being deadly serious you know why you would get all warm and fuzzy and wrap yourself up in human relationships it is because you
ridiculous you 're afraid to try you 're afraid you may fail
great friend great spouse great parent great career is that not a package is that not who you are
how can you be one without the other but you 're afraid
and that 's why you 're not going to have a great career
that most evocative of all english words unless but the unless word is also attached to that other most terrifying phrase if only
if you ever have that thought ricocheting in your brain
it will hurt a lot end of the day
