and it's been my passion as a photographer for national geographic i've portrayed it for many
five years ago i went on a personal journey i wanted to visualize the story of life
it's the hardest thing i've ever attempted and there have been plenty of times when i felt like backing out but there were also revelations
and one of those i'd like to share with you today i went down to a remote lagoon in australia
before the sky turned blue there's stromatolites down there the first living things to capture photosynthesis
and it's the only place they still occur today going down there was like entering a time capsule and i came out with a different sense of myself in time
hope it's a story that has some resonance for our time it's a story about you and me
nature and science and with that said i'd like to invite you for a short brief journey of life through time
matter condenses into spheres over time
fire gave way earth emerged
this was an alien planet and
is the key to life
frozen form it is a latent
it arises around cracks in living structures
grew as light and oxygen increased
life hardened and became defensive it learned to move
it learned to move and began to see
and began to see the first
vision was refined in horseshoe crabs
among the first to leave
still do what they've done for
their enemies long gone scorpions follow prey out of slugs became snails
slugs became snails fish tried amphibian
fish tried amphibian frogs adapted to deserts
as a co op fungi married algae clinging to forms of ferns followed
forms of ferns followed that foreshadowed seeds
land life turned a corner
jaws formed first teeth came later
time for life to break away from
dragons that arose are still among arose and
arose and like
birds witnessed the emergence of plants began to diversify
plants began to diversify turning into trees
a lily turned into a grass tree and in
that ancient continent broke up sparking new
sparking new fungi
co evolution entwined insects and are
so are these hawks trapped sometimes
sometimes an asteroid hits
an asteroid hits world went down
world went down but there were witnesses
but there were witnesses when the skies cleared
when the skies cleared new world
a world fit for mammals getting faster and faster
growing big was another answer size always comes
size always comes some mammals
some mammals are many ways
a horse runs in asia
evolves stilt legs in brazil primates emerge
from jungles as tarsiers first becoming lemurs
becoming lemurs forests dried
forests dried water traces
water traces fades as
fades as their
their you all
