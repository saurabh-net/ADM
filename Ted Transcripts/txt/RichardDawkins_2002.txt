that splendid music the coming in music the elephant march from aida is the music i've chosen for my funeral
you can see why it's triumphal i will
i won 't feel anything but if i could i would feel triumphal at having lived at all and at having lived on this splendid planet and having been given the opportunity to understand something about why i was here
in the first place before not being here can you understand my quaint english accent
like everybody else i was
the beauty of the things they showed the only slight jarring note was when jeffrey katzenberg said of the mustang the most splendid creatures that god put on this earth
now of course we know that he didn't really mean that but in this country at the moment you
i'm a biologist and the central theorem of our subject the theory of design darwin 's theory of evolution by natural selection
in professional circles everywhere it's of course universally accepted in non professional circles outside america it's largely ignored
in non professional circles within america it arouses so much hostility that it's fair to say that american biologists are in a state of war
the war is so worrying at present with court cases coming up in one state after another that i felt i had to say something about it if you want to know
what i have to say about darwinism itself i'm afraid you're going to have to look at my books which you won 't find in the
or id don't be fooled there's nothing new about id it's just creationism under another name rechristened i choose the word advisedly
for tactical political reasons the arguments of so called id theorists are the same old arguments that had been refuted again and again since darwin down to the present day
is an effective evolution lobby coordinating the fight on behalf of science and i try to do all i can to help them
you can understand why creationists lacking any coherent scientific argument for their case fall back
on the popular phobia against atheism teach your children evolution in biology class
and they'll soon move on to drugs grand larceny and sexual pre version
in fact of course educated theologians from the pope down are firm in their support of evolution this book finding darwin 's god by kenneth miller
one of the most effective attacks on intelligent design that i know and it's all the more effective because it's written by a devout christian people like kenneth miller could be called a godsend to the evolution lobby
because they expose the lie that evolutionism is as a matter of fact tantamount to atheism people like me on the other hand
rock the boat but here i want to say something nice about creationists it's not a thing i often do so listen carefully
i think they're right about one thing i think they're right that evolution is fundamentally hostile to religion i've already said that many individual evolutionists like the pope
also religious but i think they're deluding themselves i believe a true understanding of darwinism is deeply corrosive to
now it may sound as though i'm about to preach atheism and i want to reassure that that's not what i'm going to do
in an audience as sophisticated as that as this one that would be preaching to the choir no what i want to urge upon you
instead what i want to urge upon you is militant atheism
if i wanted to if i was a person who were interested in preserving religious faith i would be very afraid of the positive power
of evolutionary science and any science generally but evolution in particular to inspire and enthrall precisely because it is atheistic
difficult problem for any theory of biological design is to explain the massive statistical improbability of living things
and that's before we even start on the other things he 's expected to do like forgive sins bless marriages listen to
nothing but simplicity essentially it does it by providing a smooth ramp of gradual step by step increment
but here i only want to make the point that the elegance of darwinism is corrosive to religion precisely because it is so elegant so parsimonious so powerful so economically powerful
it has the sinewy economy of a beautiful suspension bridge the god theory is not just a bad theory it turns out to be in principle incapable of doing the job required of it
so returning to tactics and the evolution lobby i want to argue that rocking the boat may be just the right thing to do
my approach to attacking creationism is unlike the evolution lobby my approach to attacking creationism is to attack religion as a whole
at this point i need to acknowledge the remarkable taboo against speaking ill of religion and i'm going to do so in the words of the late douglas adams
he begins this speech which was tape recorded in cambridge shortly before he died he begins by explaining how science works through the testing of hypotheses that are framed to be vulnerable to disproof and then he goes on i
religion doesn't seem to work like that it has certain ideas at the heart of it which we call sacred or holy what it means is
here is an idea or a notion that you're not allowed to say anything bad about you're just not why not because you're not
why should it be that it's perfectly legitimate to support the republicans or democrats this model of economics versus that macintosh instead of windows
but to have an opinion about how the universe began about who created the universe no that's holy so we're used to not challenging
yet when you look at it rationally there is no reason why those ideas shouldn 't be as open to debate as any other except that we've agreed somehow between us that they shouldn 't be and that's the end of the quote from douglas
in my view not only is science corrosive to religion religion
is corrosive to science it teaches people to be satisfied with trivial supernatural non explanations
and blinds them to the wonderful real explanations that we have within our grasp
it teaches them to accept authority revelation and faith instead of always insisting on evidence
there's douglas adams magnificent picture from his book last chance to see now there's a typical scientific journal the quarterly review of biology and i'm going to put together
as guest editor a special issue on the question did an asteroid kill the dinosaurs and the first paper
is a standard scientific paper presenting evidence iridium layer at the k t boundary potassium argon dated crater in
the president of the royal society has been vouchsafed a strong inner conviction
that an asteroid killed the
it has been privately revealed to professor huxtane
that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs
professor hawkins has promulgated an official dogma binding on all
that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs that's inconceivable of course
no i don't know that atheists should be considered citizens nor should they be considered patriots this is one nation under god
bush 's bigotry was not an isolated mistake blurted out in the heat of the moment and later retracted he stood by it in the face of repeated calls
for clarification or withdrawal he really meant it more to the point he knew it posed no threat to his election quite the
under god what would thomas jefferson have said incidentally
i'm not usually very proud of being british but you can't help making the comparison
in practice what is an atheist an atheist is just somebody who feels about yahweh the way any decent christian feels about thor or
or the golden calf as has been said before we are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in some of us just go one god
however we define atheism it's surely the kind of academic belief that a person is entitled to hold without being vilified as an unpatriotic unelectable non citizen
and that all stems from the perception of atheists as some kind of weird way out minority
natalie angier wrote a rather sad piece in the new yorker saying how lonely she felt as an atheist she clearly feels in a beleaguered minority
but actually how do american atheists stack up numerically the latest survey makes surprisingly encouraging reading
with two point eight million muslims at one point one million and hindus buddhists and all other religions put together the second largest group of nearly thirty million is the one described as non religious or secular
you can't help wondering why vote seeking politicians are so proverbially overawed by the power of for example the jewish lobby
the state of israel seems to owe its very existence to the american jewish vote while at the same time consigning the non
to political oblivion this secular non religious vote if properly mobilized is nine times as numerous as the jewish vote
why does this far more substantial minority not make a move to exercise its political muscle well so much for quantity
how about quality is there any correlation positive or negative between intelligence and tendency to be religious
that is the higher one 's intelligence or educational level the less one is likely to be religious well i haven't seen the original forty two studies and i can't comment on
that meta anaysis but i would like to see more studies done along those lines and i know that there are if i could put a little plug here there are people in this audience
easily capable of financing a massive research survey to settle the question and i put the suggestion up for what it's worth
but let me know show you some data that have been properly published and analyzed on one special group namely top scientists
among this select group belief in a personal god dropped to a shattering seven percent
about twenty percent are agnostic and the rest could fairly be called atheists similar figures obtained for belief in personal immortality among biological scientists the figures are even
five point five percent only believe in god physical scientists it's seven point five percent
i've not seen corresponding figures for elite scholars in other fields such history or philosophy but i'd be surprised if they were different
so we've reached a truly remarkable situation a grotesque mismatch between the american intelligentsia and the american electorate a philosophical opinion about the nature of the universe
which is held by the vast majority of top american scientists and probably the majority of the intelligentsia generally is so abhorrent to the american electorate that no candidate for popular election dare affirm it
in public if i'm right this means that high office in the greatest country in the world is barred to the very people best qualified to hold it
the intelligentsia unless they are prepared to lie about their beliefs to put it bluntly american political opportunities are heavily loaded against those who are simultaneously intelligent and honest
not a citizen of this country so i hope it won 't be thought unbecoming if i suggest that something needs to be done
we need a consciousness raising coming out campaign for american atheists
this could be similar to the campaign organized by homosexuals a few years ago although heaven forbid that we should stoop to public outing of people against their will
in most cases people who out themselves will help to destroy the myth that there is something wrong with atheists on the contrary they'll demonstrate that atheists are often the kinds of people that could serve as decent role models for your children
the kinds of people an advertising agent could use to recommend a product the kinds of people who are sitting in this room
could be non linearities threshold effects when a critical mass has been attained there's an abrupt acceleration in recruitment and again it will need money
i suspect that the word atheist itself contains or remains a stumbling block
far out of proportion to what it actually means and a stumbling block to people who otherwise might be happy to out
themselves so what other words might be used to smooth the path oil the wheels
sugar the pill darwin himself preferred agnostic and not only
out of loyalty to his friend huxley who coined the term
darwin said i have never been an atheist in the same sense as denying the existence of a god i think that generally an agnostic would be the most correct description of my state of mind
he even became uncharacteristically tetchy with edward aveling aveling was a militant atheist who
failed to persuade darwin to accept the dedication of his book on atheism incidentally giving rise to a fascinating myth that karl marx tried to dedicate das kapital
to darwin which he didn 't it was actually edward aveling what happened was that aveling 's mistress was marx 's daughter
and when both darwin and marx were dead marx 's papers became muddled up with aveling 's papers and a letter from darwin saying my
but why should you be so aggressive darwin thought that atheism might be well and good for the intelligentsia but that ordinary people were not quote ripe for it
but in any case that was more than one hundred years ago you think we might have grown up since then now
a friend an intelligent lapsed jew who incidentally observed the sabbath for reasons of cultural solidarity describes himself as a tooth fairy agnostic
he won 't call himself an atheist because it 's in principle impossible to prove a negative but agnostic on its own might suggest that god 's existence was therefore on equal terms of likelihood
as his non existence so my friend is strictly agnostic about the tooth fairy but it isn't very likely is it like god hence the phrase tooth fairy agnostic
that doesn't mean you treat the likelihood of its existence as on all fours with its non existence the list of things which we strictly have to be agnostic about
the onus is on you to say why the onus is not on the rest of us to say why not we who are atheists are also a fairiests and
but we don't bother to say so
this is why my friend uses tooth fairy agnostic as a label for what most people would call atheist nonetheless if we want to attract deep down atheists to come out publicly
we're going to have find something better to stick on our banner than tooth fairy or teapot agnostic so how about humanist
this has the advantage of a worldwide network of well organized associations and journals and things already in place my problem with it only is its apparent anthropocentrism
one of the things we've learned from darwin is that the human species is only one among millions of cousins some close some distant
there are other possibilities like naturalist but that also has problems of confusion because darwin would have thought naturalist
he was of course and i suppose there might be others who would confuse it with nudism
such people might be those belonging to the british lynch mob which last year attacked a pediatrician in mistake for
i think the best of the available alternatives for atheist is simply non theist it lacks the strong connotation that there's definitely no god and it could therefore easily be embraced by teapot or tooth fairy agnostics it's
completely compatible with the god of the physicists when people like when atheists like stephen hawking and albert einstein
use the word god they use it of course as a metaphorical shorthand for that deep mysterious part of physics which we don't yet understand
non theist will do for all that yet unlike atheist it doesn't have the same phobic hysterical
responses but i think actually the alternative is to grasp the nettle of the word atheism itself precisely because it is a taboo word carrying frissons of hysterical phobia
critical mass may be harder to achieve with the word atheist than with the word non theist or some other non confrontational word
but if we did achieve it with that dread word atheist itself the political impact would be even greater
now i said that if i were religious i'd be very afraid of evolution i'd go further i would fear science in general if properly understood and this is because the scientific worldview
is so much more exciting more poetic more filled with sheer wonder than anything in the poverty stricken arsenals of the religious imagination
as carl sagan another recently dead hero put it how is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded this is better than we thought
the universe is much bigger than our prophet said grander more subtle more elegant instead they say no no no my god is a little god and i want him to stay that way
a religion old or new that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and
hardly tapped by the conventional faiths now this is an elite audience and i would therefore expect about ten percent of you to be religious
many of you probably subscribe to our polite cultural belief that we should respect religion
but i also suspect that a fair number of those secretly despise religion as much as i do
if you're one of them and of course many of you may not be but if you are one of them i'm asking you to stop being polite come out and say
by foundations such as the templeton foundation and the discovery institute we need an anti templeton to step forward
if my books sold as well as stephen hawking 's books instead of only as well as richard dawkins books i'd do it myself
let 's all stop being so damned respectful thank you very much
