i was here four years ago and i remember at the time that the talks weren't put online i think they were given to tedsters in a box a box set of dvds which they put on their shelves where they are now
and actually chris called me a week after i'd given my talk and he said we 're going to start putting them online can we put yours online and i said sure
and four years later as i said it's been seen by four well it's been downloaded four million times
could multiply that by twenty or something to get the number of people who 've seen it and as chris says there is a hunger
so this whole event has been an elaborate build up
to me doing another one for you so here
spoke at the ted conference i spoke at four years ago and talked about the climate crisis and i referenced that at the end of my last talk so i want to pick up from there because i only had eighteen minutes frankly
but i believe there's a second climate crisis which is as severe which has the same origins and
we have to deal with with the same urgency and i mean by this and you may say by the way look i'm good i have one climate crisis i don't really need the second one
but this is a crisis of not natural resources though i believe that's true but a crisis of human resources
i believe fundamentally as many speakers have said during the past few days that we make very poor use of our talents
don't think they're really good at anything actually i kind of divide the world into two groups now jeremy bentham the great utilitarian philosopher well i do
i meet all kinds of people who don't enjoy what they do they simply go through their lives getting on with it
they get no great pleasure from what they do they endure it rather than enjoy it and wait for the weekend
but i also meet people who love what they do and couldn't imagine doing anything else if you said to them don 't do this anymore they'd wonder what you were talking about because it isn't what they do
it's not true of enough people in fact on the contrary i think it's certainly a minority of people and i think there are many
every education system in the world is being reformed at the moment and it's not enough reform is no use anymore because that's simply improving a broken model
what we need and the word 's been used many times during the course of the past few days is not evolution but a revolution in education this has to be transformed into something else
one of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education innovation is hard
the great problem for reform or transformation is the tyranny of common sense
things that people think well it can't be done any other way because that's the way it's done i came across a great quote recently from abraham lincoln who i thought you'd be pleased to have quoted at this point
we suppress it you know this is our policy so but he said this
the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present the occasion is piled high with difficulty
and we must rise with the occasion i love that not rise to it rise with it
as our case is new so we must think anew and act anew
we must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country i love that word disenthrall
to meet the circumstances of this century but to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries but our minds are still hypnotized by them and we have to disenthrall ourselves of some of them
now doing this is easier said than done it's very hard to know by the way what it is you take for granted and the reason is that you take it for granted
any people here under the age of twenty five great now those over twenty five could you put your hands up if you're wearing a wristwatch
now that's a great deal of us isn't it ask a room full of teenagers the same thing teenagers do not wear wristwatches i don't mean they can't or they're not allowed to they just often choose not to
and the reason is you see that we were brought up in a pre digital culture those of us over twenty five and so for us if you want to know the time you have to wear something to tell it
kids now live in a world which is digitized and the time for them is everywhere they see no reason to do this and by the way you don't need to do it either it's just that you've always done it a single function device
a single function device is that and i
it tells the date as well it
you see there are things we're enthralled to in education let me give you a couple of examples one of them is the idea of linearity
that it starts here and you go through a track and if you do everything right you will end up set for the rest of your life
we create our lives symbiotically as we explore our talents in relation to the circumstances they help to create for us but you know we have become obsessed with this linear narrative and probably the pinnacle for education is getting into college
maybe they go later not right away and i was up in san francisco a while ago doing a book signing there was this guy buying a book he was in his thirties and i said what do you do and he said i 'm a
i wanted to be a fireman and he said when i got to the senior year of school my teachers didn't take it seriously this one teacher didn't take it seriously he said i was throwing my life away if that's all i chose to do with it
he said he was in a car
and i pulled him out gave him cpr and i saved his wife 's life as well
you know to me human communities depend upon a diversity of talent not a singular conception of ability and at the heart of our
at the heart of the challenge is to reconstitute our sense of ability and of intelligence this linearity thing is a problem
when i arrived in l a about nine years ago i came across a policy statement very well intentioned which said college begins in kindergarten no it
it doesn 't if we had time i could go into this but we don
a friend of mine once said you know a three year old is not half a six year old three
but as we just heard in this last session there's such competition now to get to kindergarten to get to the right kindergarten that people are being interviewed for it at three
kids sitting in front of unimpressed panels you know with their resumes
flipping through and saying well this is it
been around for thirty six months and this is achieved nothing commit
this is something jamie oliver talked about the other day you know there are two models of quality assurance in catering one is fast food where everything
the other are things like zagat and michelin restaurants where everything is not standardized they're customized to local circumstances and we have sold ourselves into a fast food model of education
and it's impoverishing our spirit and our energies as much as fast food is depleting our physical bodies
i think we have to recognize a couple of things here one is that human talent is tremendously diverse people have very different aptitudes i worked out recently that i was given
as a kid at about the same time eric clapton got his first guitar
you know it worked out for eric that's all i'm saying
it did not for me i could not get this thing to work
no matter how often or how hard i blew into it it just
it's not only about that it's about passion often people are good at things they don't really care for it's about passion and what excites
our spirit and our energy and if you're doing the thing that you love to do that you're good at time takes a different course entirely
my wife 's just finished writing a novel and i think it's a great book but she disappears for hours on end you know this if you're doing something you love
and the reason so many people are opting out of education is because it doesn't feed their spirit it doesn't feed their energy or their passion so i think we have to change metaphors
we have to go from what is essentially an industrial model of education a manufacturing model which is based on linearity and conformity and batching people we have to move to a model that is based more on principles of agriculture
we have to recognize that human flourishing is not a mechanical process it's an organic process
and you cannot predict the outcome of human development all you can do like a farmer is create the conditions under which they will begin to flourish
so when we look at reforming education and transforming it it isn't like cloning a system there are great ones like kipps it's a great system there are many
it's not about scaling a new solution it's about creating a movement in education in which people develop their own solutions but with external support based on a personalized curriculum
in this room there are people who represent extraordinary resources in business in multimedia in the internet these technologies
because it's vital not just to ourselves but to the future of our children but we have to change from the industrial model to
an agricultural model where each school can be flourishing tomorrow that's where children experience life or at home if that's where they choose to be educated with their families or their friends
a lot of talk about dreams over the course of this few days and i wanted to just very quickly i was very struck by natalie merchant 's songs last night recovering old poems
i wanted to read you a quick very short poem from w b yeats who 's someone you may know he wrote this to his love
i the heavens embroidered cloths enwrought with gold and silver light
blue and the dim and the dark cloths of night and light and the
i would spread the cloths under your feet
being poor have only my dreams
i have spread my dreams under your feet
our children spread their dreams beneath our feet and we should tread softly
