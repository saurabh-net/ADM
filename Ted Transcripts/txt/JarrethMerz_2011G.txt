and raised in ghana west africa
but then by the end of the decade the country had fallen back into political instability and mismanagement my first military coup
we the children had gathered at a friend 's house it was a dimly lit shack
and tied to the pole
the firing squad aimed fired the general was dead now this was being broadcast live and shortly after
we left the country and we returned to switzerland
now europe came as a shock to me and i think i started feeling the need to shed my skin in order to fit in i wanted to blend in like a chameleon i think it was a tactic of survival and it worked or so i believed
so here i was in two thousand and eight wondering where i was in my life
and i felt i was being typecast as an actor
i was always playing the exotic african i was playing the violent african
the african terrorist and i was thinking how many terrorists could i possibly play before turning into one myself the african in me
and fortunately i decided in two thousand and eight to return to ghana after twenty eight years of absence i wanted to document on film the two thousand and eight presidential elections and there i started by searching for the footprints in my childhood
and i realized that when i 'd left the country free and fair elections in a democratic environment were a dream
like i was looking for my identity was what was happening in ghana a metaphor for what was happening in me
even though we had been trying very hard now in one thousand nine hundred and fifty seven ghana was the first sub saharan country to gain its independence
in the late fifty s ghana and singapore had the same gdp i mean today singapore is a first world country and ghana is not
but maybe it was time
to prove to myself yes it 's important to understand the past it is
important to look at it in a different light but maybe we should look at the strengths in our own culture
and build on those foundations in the present
so here i was december seventh two thousand and eight
the polling stations opened to the voters at seven zero am
but voters eager to take their own political fate into their hands
were starting to line up at four zero am in the morning and they had traveled from near they had traveled from far because they wanted to make their voices heard and i asked one of the voters i said whom are you going to vote for and he said i 'm sorry i can 't tell you
he said that his vote was in his heart and i understood this was their election
and they weren 't going to let anyone take it away from them
now the first round of the voting didn 't bring forth a clear winner so nobody had achieved the absolute majority so voting went into a second round three weeks later the candidates were back on the road they were campaigning the rhetoric of the candidates of course changed the heat was on and then
the cliche came to haunt us
of ballot boxes being stolen
inflated results started coming in
and my heart sank because i thought here we are again here is another proof
that the african is not capable of governing himself
and not only that i am documenting it documenting my own cultural shortcomings
so when the echo of the gunshots had lingered
it was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob and i didn 't believe what i was hearing they were chanting we want peace
we want peace we want peace
and i realized it had to come from the people
the sounds of the voices were harmonious
it could be by the will of the masses who were now urgently pressing with all their heart and all their will for peace now here 's an interesting
the values the golden light of democracy
that we are the shining example of how it 's done
but when it comes down to it
in which the u s election stalled in the two thousand presidential elections bush versus gore but instead of the unwillingness of the candidates to allow the system to proceed and the people to decide ghana honored democracy
declared with the consent of the parties to run an unprecedented
gave up power and made way for ghana to move into a new democratic cycle i mean at the absolute time for the absolute need of democracy they did not abuse their power
the belief in true democracy
and in the people runs deep proving that the african is capable of governing himself
now the uphill battle for ghana and for africa is not over
but i have proof that the other side of democracy exists and that we must not take it for granted
now i have learned that my place is not just in the west or in africa and i 'm still searching for my identity
to look at people differently and to look at myself differently born in switzerland
