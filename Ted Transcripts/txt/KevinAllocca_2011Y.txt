but now web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world 's culture any one of you could be famous on the internet by next saturday but there are over forty eight hours of video uploaded to youtube every minute
and of that only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment so how does it happen
three things tastemakers communities of participation and unexpectedness all right let 's go
last summer but he didn 't actually set out to make a viral video bear he just wanted to share a rainbow because that 's what you do when your name is yosemite mountain bear
so what happened here jimmy kimmel actually
rebecca black 's friday is one of the most popular videos of the year it 's been seen nearly two hundred million times this year this is a chart of what it looked like and similar to double rainbow it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere
and if you 're wondering about those other spikes those are also fridays
but what about this day this one particular friday
well tosh zero picked it up a lot of blogs starting writing about michael j nelson from mystery science theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on twitter but what 's important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience accelerating the process
and so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it and now there are ten thousand parodies of friday on youtube
even in the first seven days there was one parody for every other day of the week
so nyan cat is a looped animation with looped music it 's this just like this it 's been viewed nearly fifty million times this year
and if you think that that is weird you should know that there is a three hour version of this that 's been viewed four million times
were watching other cats watch this video
but what 's important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this techie geeky internet culture there were remixes
an entire remix community sprouted up that brought it from
being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of because we don 't just enjoy now we participate
in a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have when a friend of mine told me that i needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle fines in new york city i admit i wasn 't very interested
these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defines the popularity i mean as mentioned earlier one of the biggest stars in the world right now justin bieber got his start on youtube no one has to green light your idea
and we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture and these are not characteristics of old media and they 're barely true of the media of today but they will define the entertainment
