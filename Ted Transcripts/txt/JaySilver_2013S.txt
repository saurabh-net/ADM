and you know it had a profound effect on me it sounds silly but i thought okay the way the world works can be changed and it can be changed by me in these small ways and my relationship to especially human made objects which someone else said they work like this well i can say they work a different way a little bit
and so about twenty years later i didn 't realize the full effect of this but i went to costa rica
and i stayed with these guaymi natives there
and they could pull leaves off of trees and make shingles out of them and they could make beds out of trees and they could i watched this woman for three days i was there she was peeling this palm frond apart these little threads off of it and she 'd roll the threads together
and make little thicker threads like strings and she would weave the strings together
and as the materiality of this exact very bag formed before my eyes over those three days the materiality of the way the world works of reality kind of started to unravel in my mind because i realized that this bag
and these clothes and the trampoline you have at home and the pencil sharpener
everything you have is made out of either a tree or a rock or something we dug out of the ground and did some process to maybe a more complicated one but still everything was made that way and so i had to start studying who is it that 's making these decisions who 's making these things how did they make them what stops us from making them because this is how reality is created
so i started right away i was at mit media lab and i was studying the maker movement and makers and creativity and i started in nature because i saw these guaymis doing it in nature and there just seems to be less barriers so i went
to vermont to not back to school camp where there 's unschoolers who are just kind of hanging out and willing to try anything so i said let 's go into the woods near this stream
and just put stuff together you know make something i don 't care geometrical shapes just grab some junk from around you we won 't bring anything with us and like within minutes this is very easy for adults and teens to do here 's a triangle that was being formed underneath a flowing stream and the shape of an oak leaf being made by other small oak leaves being put together
a leaf tied to a stick with a blade of grass the materiality and fleshiness and meat of the mushroom being explored by how it can hold up different objects being stuck into it and after about forty five minutes you get really intricate projects like leaves sorted by hue so you get a color fade and put in a circle like a wreath
and the creator of this he said this is fire i call this fire and someone asked him how do you get those sticks to stay on that tree and he 's like i don 't know
especially when it comes to the human made human built world we think we already know how something works so we can 't imagine how it could work we know how it 's supposed to work so we can 't suppose all the things that could be possible
so kids don 't have as hard of a time with this and i saw in my own son i gave him this book
and so he 's like okay i 'll just mess around with this this is no different than the sticks are to the teens in the forest just going to try to put them in shapes and push on them and stuff and before long he 's kind of got this mechanism where you can almost launch and catapult objects around and he enlists us in helping him
so that they can see the world as malleable so they see themselves as agents of change in their everyday lives
because the most advanced scientists are really just kind of pushing the way the world itself works pushing what matter can do the most advanced artists are just pushing the medium and any sufficiently complicated task whether you 're a cook or a carpenter or you 're raising a child anything that 's complicated
comes up with problems that aren 't solved in the middle of it and you can 't do a good job getting it done unless you can say okay well we 're just going to have to refigure this i don 't care that pencils are supposed to be for writing i 'm going to use them a different way so let me show you a little demo
this is a little piano circuit right in here and this is an ordinary paintbrush that i smashed it together with beeping and so with some ketchup
and you can lay out wire on the page too and get electrical current to run
and the electricity runs through your body too and then you can take the little piano circuit off the pencil you can make one of these brushes just on the fly all you do is connect to the bristles and the bristles are wet so they conduct and
and you can even hook to the trees anything in the world is either conductive or not conductive and you can use those together so laughter i took this to those same teens because those teens are really awesome and they 'll try things that i won 't try i don 't even have access
to a facial piercing if i wanted to and this young woman she made what she called a hula looper and as the hula hoop traveled around her body
she has a circuit taped to her shirt right there you can see her pointing to it in the picture and every time the hula hoop would smush against her body it would connect two little pieces of copper tape and it would make a sound and the next sound and it would loop the same sounds over and over again
i ran these workshops everywhere in taiwan at an art museum this twelve year old girl made a mushroom organ out of some mushrooms that were from taiwan and some electrical tape and hot glue and professional designers were making artifacts with this thing strapped onto it and big companies like
intel or smaller design firms like ideo or startups like bump were inviting me to give workshops just to practice this idea of smashing electronics and everyday objects together and then we came up with this idea
to not just use electronics but let 's just smash computers with everyday objects and see how that goes over and so i just want to do a quick demo so this is the makey makey circuit and i 'm just going to set it up from the beginning in front of you
and now it 's on by usb and i 'll just hook up the forward arrow you guys are facing that way so i 'll hook it to this one
and i 'll just hook up a little ground wire to it and now if i touch this piece of pizza the slides that i showed you before should go forward and now if i hook up this wire just by connecting it to the left arrow i 'm kind of programming it by where i hook it up
now i have a left arrow and a right arrow so i should be able to go forwards and backwards and forwards and backwards
awesome and so we 're like we gotta put a video out about this because no one really believed that this was important or meaningful
except me and like one other guy so we made a video to prove that there 's lots of stuff you can do you can kind of sketch with play doh and just google for game controllers
but you can totally cut your toes so yeah just be careful
you know the happiness project where the experts are setting up the piano stairs and how cool that is well i think it 's cool but we should be doing that stuff ourselves
it shouldn 't be a set of experts engineering the way the world works we should all be participating in changing the way the world works together aluminum foil everybody has a cat get a bowl of water this is just photo booth on your mac os hover the mouse over the take a photo button and you 've got a little cat photo booth and so we needed hundreds of people to buy this if hundreds
and we actually sent this guy materials we 're like we 're sponsoring you man you 're like a pro maker
okay just wait for this one
and dads and daughters are completing circuits in special ways
and then this brother look at this diagram see where it says sister i love when people put
if you 're drawing a technical diagram put a human in it and this kid is so sweet he made this trampoline slideshow adventure for his sister so that on her birthday she could be the star of the show jumping on the trampoline to advance the slides and this guy rounded up his dogs and he made a dog piano and this is fun
and what could be more useful than feeling alive and fun but it 's also very serious because all this accessibility stuff started coming up where people can 't use computers necessarily like this dad who wrote us his son has cerebral palsy and he can 't use a normal keyboard
and so his dad couldn 't necessarily afford to buy all these custom controllers and so with the makey makey he planned to make these gloves to allow him to navigate the web
and a huge eruption of discussion around
accessibility came and we 're really excited about that we didn 't plan for that at all and then all these
professional musicians started using it like at coachella just this weekend jurassic five was using this onstage
and this d j is just from brooklyn right around here and he put this up last month and i love the carrot on the turntable
most people cannot play them that way laughter and when this started
and as you start to mess around this way i think that in some small ways you do start to see the landscape of your everyday life a little bit more like something you could express yourself with and a little bit more like you could participate in designing the future of the way the world works and so next time you 're on an escalator and
and each kind of like a mosaic coming up and creating this world in their backyards and in their kitchens
and that 's the world i really want to live in thank you
