alternate visions of how to create a digitally inclusive society
that 's what we 're after and we do this because we actually believe
that silicon technology today is mostly about a culture of excess it 's about the fastest and the most efficient and the most dazzling gadget you can have
can hardly reach the most basic of this technology to even address fundamental needs in life
including health care education and all these kinds of very fundamental issues
so before i start i want to talk about a little anecdote a little story about a man i met
he has this little ten square meter store where so much is being done it 's incredible because i couldn 't believe my eyes when i once just happened to bump into him basically what he does is he has all these services for micro payments and booking tickets and all kinds of basic things that you would
go online for but he does it for people offline and connects to the digital world
with a few of his employees where they can fix almost anything
any cell phone any gadget you can bring them they can fix it and it 's pretty incredible because i took my iphone there
and he was like yeah do you want an upgrade
rewrite the circuitry re flash the firmware do whatever you want to with the phone and they can fix anything so quickly you can hand over a phone
this morning and you can go pick it up after lunch
and it was quite incredible but then we were wondering whether this is a local phenomenon or is truly global
and over time we started understanding and systematically researching what this tinkering ecosystem is about because that is something that 's happening not just in one street corner
it 's even happening in africa like for example in cape town we did extensive research on this even here in doha i found this little nook where you can get alarm clocks and watches fixed
it 's this entire ecosystem
of low cost parts and supplies that are produced all over the world literally and then
redistributed to basically service this industry and you can even buy salvaged parts basically you don 't have to necessarily buy brand new things you have condemned computers that are stripped apart and you can buy salvaged components and things that you can reassemble in a new configuration
but what does this new
sort of approach give us that 's the real question because this is something that 's been there part of every society that 's deprived of enough resources but there 's an interesting paradigm there 's the traditional crafts and then there 's the technology crafts we call it the technology crafts because these are emerging
they 're not something that 's been established it 's not
something that 's institutionalized it 's not taught in universities it 's taught by word of mouth and it 's an informal education system around
the main thing is a fix it locally culture which is fantastic because it means that your product or your service doesn 't have
other kinds of extendable ideas into really simple devices in small digital shops
across the planet in most developing countries
schools in very remote parts of india
so there is this amazing concept called the one teacher school which is basically a single teacher who is a multitasker who teaches this amazing little social setting it 's an informal school but it 's really about holistic education
the only thing that they don 't have is access to resources they don 't even have a textbook sometimes and they don 't even have a proper curriculum
so we said what can we do to empower this teacher
to do more how to access the digital world instead of being the sole guardian of information be a facilitator to all this information
so we said what are the steps required to empower the teacher how do you make this teacher into a digital gateway and how do you design an inexpensive multimedia platform
that can be constructed locally and serviced locally
so we walked around we went and scavenged the nearby markets and we tried to understand
what can we pick up that will make this happen
the flashlight gives us this really intense bright l e d
and the lunch box is a nice little package in which you can put everything inside
and a bunch of mini speakers to sort of amplify the sound large enough believe me those little classrooms systematically field tested
because in the field testing we learned some important lessons
luminosity was an issue when you have too much bright sunlight outside
often the roofs are broken so you don 't have enough
darkness in the classroom to do these things
and the other key thing that we did was make this box run off a usb key because we realized that even though there was gprs and all that
it was much more efficient to send the data on a little usb key by surface mail it might take a few days to get there but at least it gets there in high definition
education this kind of a technique or metrology can actually be applied to other kinds of areas and i 'm going to tell you one more little story
it 's about this little device called a medi meter it 's basically a little health care screening tool that we developed inform people to basically
how to lead a better life but also
but the problem with that is that we realized after a bunch of research
but what happens at the public health care system is this
and too many people who overload the system
simply because there 's not enough doctors and facilities for the population that 's being referred so everything from a common cold to a serious case of malaria gets almost the same level of attention
and there 's no priorities
so we said come on there 's got to be a better way of doing this for sure
so we said what can we do with the asha worker that 'll allow this asha worker to become an interesting filter but not just a filter a really well thought through referral system
that allows load balancing of the network
patients to different sources of health care based on the severity or the criticalness of those situations
so the real key question was how do we empower this woman
how do we empower her with simple tools
that 's not diagnostic but more screening in nature so she at least knows how to advise the patients better
and that 'll make such a huge difference on the system because
the amount of waiting time
and the amount of distances that people need to travel often sometimes seven to fifteen kilometers sometimes by foot to get a simple health check done
is very very detrimental in the sense that it really dissuades people from getting access to health care
so if there was something that she could do
that would be amazing so what we did was that we converted this device into a medical device i want to demo this actually because it 's a very simple process
bruno do you want to join us
so that was a very simple three step screening process that could basically change the equation of how public health care works
so essentially the three things that are required to make this conversion from this guy
basically something that you can scavenge for very low cost
and that 's what is all required with a little bit of local tinkering talent to convert the device into something else
but most importantly what we are trying to do right now is we are trying to scale this up because there are over two hundred and fifty thousand asha workers on the ground who are these amazing foot soldiers and if we can give
at least a fraction of them the access to these things it just changes the way the economics of public health care works and it changes the way systems actually function not just
on a systematic planning level but also in a very grassroots bottom up level
so that 's it and we hope to do this in a big way thank you
