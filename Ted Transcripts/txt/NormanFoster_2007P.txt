as an architect you design for
with an awareness of the which is essentially
which is essentially unknown
the green agenda is probably
the most important agenda and issue of the day
and i'd like to share some
over the last forty years we celebrate our fortieth anniversary this year and to explore and to touch on some
said in the past many many years ago before anybody even invented the concept of a green agenda
that it wasn't about fashion it was about survival
all the projects which have
in some way been inspired by that agenda are about
the places and the spaces which determine the quality of life i
rarely actually quote anything so i'm going to try and find a piece of paper if i
can which somebody at the end of last year ventured the
guy called thomas friedman who wrote in the herald tribune
about two thousand and six he said
i think the most important thing to happen in two thousand and six was that living and thinking green hit main street
we reached a tipping point this year
living acting designing investing and manufacturing green
came to be understood by a critical mass of citizens entrepreneurs and officials as the most patriotic capitalistic geo political and competitive thing they could do hence my motto green is the new
red white and blue and i asked myself in a way looking back when did that
awareness of the planet and its fragility
for the first time man could look back at planet earth and in a way it was
before the kind of collapse of the communist system i was privileged to meet a lot of cosmonauts in space city and other places in russia and interestingly as i think back
they were the first true environmentalists they were filled with a kind of pioneering passion
fired about the problems of the aral sea and
period it was in a way a number of things were happening buckminster fuller
was the kind of green guru again a word that had not been coined he was a design scientist if you like a poet but he foresaw all the things that are happening now
it was at that time an awareness fired by
bucky 's prophecies his concerns
as a citizen as a kind of citizen of the planet that influenced my thinking and what we were doing at that time and it's
this probably coincided with the time when you had the planet earth 's sourcebook and you had the hippy movement and there are some of those qualities in this drawing which seeks to sum up
the recommendations and all the components are there which are now in common parlance in our vocabulary you know thirty odd years later
wind energy recycling biomass solar cells
in parallel at that time there was a very kind of exclusive design club people who were really
design conscious were inspired by the work of dieter rams and the objects that he would create for the company called braun this is going back the mid fifties sixties and
everything would be miniaturized and technology would make an incredible style access to
to amenities it was very very difficult to imagine that everything that we see in this image would be very very stylishly packaged
and that and more besides would be in the palm of your hand and i think that that digital revolution now is coming to the point
as the virtual world which brings so many people together here finally connects with the physical world there is the
reality that that has become humanized so that digital world has all the friendliness all the immediacy the orientation
of the analog world probably summed up in a way by the stylish or alternative available here as we generously had
gifted at lunchtime the maxin which is a further kind of development and again inspired by the incredible sort of sensual feel a very very beautiful object so something which in
was very exclusive has now become interestingly quite inclusive and the reference to the ipod as iconic and in a way evocative of performance delivery
hybrid energy conscious vehicle which rivals the ipod as an iconic product and i think it's very tempting to
in a way seduce ourselves and as architects or anybody involved with the design process that the answer to our problems lies with buildings buildings are important but
component of a much bigger picture in other words as i might seek to demonstrate if you could achieve the impossible the equivalent of perpetual motion you could design a carbon free house for example
that would be the answer unfortunately it's not the answer it's only the beginning of the problem you cannot separate the buildings out from the infrastructure of cites and the mobility of transit for example
if in that bucky inspired phrase we draw back and we look at planet earth and we take a kind of typical industrialized society
then the energy consumed would be split between the buildings forty four percent transport thirty four percent and industry
but again that only shows part of the picture if you looked at the buildings together with the associated transport in other words the transport of people which is twenty six percent
then seventy percent of the energy consumption is influenced by the way that our cites and infrastructure work together
so the problems of sustainability cannot be separated from the nature of the cities of which the buildings are
for example if you take and you make a comparison between a recent kind of
what i'll call simplistically a north american city and detroit is not a bad example it is very car dependent
the city goes out in annular rings consuming more and more green space and more and more roads and more and more energy in the transport of people between the city center
which again the city center as it becomes deprived of the living and just becomes commercial again becomes dead if you compared detroit
with a city of a northern european example and munich is not a bad example of that
with the greater dependence on walking and cycling then a city which is
really only twice as dense is only using one tenth of the energy in other words you take these comparable examples and the energy leap is enormous
basically if you wanted to generalize you can demonstrate
that as the density increases along the bottom there that the
energy consumed reduces dramatically of course you can't separate this out from issues like social diversity mass transit
the ability to be able to walk a convenient distance the quality of civic spaces but again you can see detroit in yellow
the top extraordinary consumption down below copenhagen and copenhagen although it's a dense city is not dense compared
with the really dense cities and in the year two thousand a rather interesting thing happened
you had for the first time mega cities five million or more which were occurring in the developing world
and now out of typically forty six cities thirty three of those mega cities are in the developing world
so you have to ask yourself the environmental impact of for example china or india if you take china and you just take beijing you can see on that traffic system
and the pollution associated with the consumption of energy as the
at the price of the bicycles in other words
if you put onto the roads as is currently happening one thousand new cars every day
statistically it's the biggest booming auto market in the world and the half a billion
urbanization is extraordinary accelerated pace so if we think of the transition in
of the movement from the land to the cities which took two hundred years then that same process is happening in twenty years in other words it is accelerating by a factor of ten
and quite interestingly over something like a sixty year period we're seeing
the doubling in life expectancy over that period where the urbanization has trebled
if i pull back from that global picture and i look at the implication over a similar period of time in terms of the technology which as a tool is a tool for designers and i cite
our own experience as a company and i just illustrate that by a small selection of projects
how do you measure that change of technology how does it affect the design of buildings and particularly how can it lead
to the creation of buildings which consume less energy create less pollution and are more socially responsible
that story in terms of buildings started in the late sixties early seventies the one example i take is a corporate headquarters for a company called willis and faber in a small market town in
the northeast of england commuting distance with london and here the first thing you can see is that this
building the roof is a very warm kind of overcoat blanket a kind of insulating garden which is also
about the celebration of public space in other words for this community they have this garden in the sky so
the humanistic ideal is very very strong in all this work encapsulated perhaps by one of my early sketches here where you can see greenery you can see sunlight
you have a connection with nature and nature is part of the generator the driver for this building and symbolically the colors of the interior are green and yellow
in two thousand and one this building received an award and the award was about a celebration for a building which had been in use over a long period of time and
the people who 'd created it came back the project managers the company chairmen then and they were saying you know the architects norman was always going on about designing for the future and you know it didn't seem to cost us any more so
we humored him we kept him happy
the image at the top what it doesn't if you look at it in detail really what it's just saying is you can wire this building
to build new buildings for the new technology
we were fortunate because in a way our building was future proofed it anticipated change even though those changes were not known round about that
design period leading up to this building
i did a sketch which we pulled out of the archive recently and i was saying and i wrote
but we don't have the time and we really don't have the immediate expertise at a technical level in other words we didn't have the technology
to do what would be really interesting on that building and that would be to create a kind of three dimensional bubble a really interesting overcoat that would
as a green building is very much a pioneering building and if i fast forward in time what is interesting is that the technology is now available and celebratory the
library of the free university which opened last year
is an example of that and again
the transition from one of the many thousands of sketches and computer images to the reality and a combination of devices here the kind of heavy mass concrete of these book stacks
and the way in which that is enclosed by this skin which enables the building
to be ventilated to consume dramatically less energy and where it's really working with the forces of nature and what is interesting is that this is
hugely popular by the people who use it again coming back to that thing about the lifestyle and
in a way the ecological agenda is very much at one with the spirit so it's not a kind of
sacrifice quite the reverse i think it's a great it's a celebration and you can measure
the performance in terms of energy consumption of that building against a typical library
if i show another aspect of that technology then in a completely different context this apartment building in the alps in switzerland
because of the technology the computing ability the ability to prefabricate make high performance components out of timber
very much at the cutting edge and just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology the ability to plot points in the
and to transmit to transfer that information now
into the factory so if you cross the border just across the border a small factory
in germany and here you can see the guy with his computer screen and those points in space are communicated
and on the left are the cutting machines which then in the factory enable those individual pieces to be fabricated
plus or minus very very few millimeters to be slotted together on site and then interestingly
building to then be clad in the oldest technology which is the kind of hand cut shingles
one quarter of a million of them applied by hand as the final finish and again
the way in which that works as a building for those of us who can enjoy the spaces to live and visit there if
i made the leap into these new technologies then how did we
what happened before that i mean you know what was life like before the mobile phone the things that you take for granted
well obviously the building still happened i mean this is a glimpse of the interior of our hong kong bank
in the absence of computers you have to physically model so for example we would put models under an artificial sky
for wind tunnels we would literally
put them in a wind tunnel
and the many kilometers of cable and so on and the turning point was probably in our terms when we had
the first computer and that was at the time that we sought to redesign
reinvent the airport this is terminal four at heathrow typical of any terminal big heavy roof blocking out the sunlight lots of machinery big pipes whirring machinery
and stanstead the green alternative which uses natural light is a friendly place you know where you are you can relate to the outside and for a large part of its cycle
not needing electric light electric light which in turn creates more heat which creates more cooling loads and so on and at that particular point in time
this was one of the few solitary computers and that's a little image of the tree of stanstead
and if you looked very closely you'd see that people were drawing with pencils and they were pushing you know big rulers and triangles it's not that long ago seventeen years
and here we are now every week we have
the equivalent of eighty four million disks
which record our archival information on past current and future projects that reaches twenty one kilometers into the sky this is the view you would get if you looked down on that
but meanwhile as you know wonderful protagonists like al gore are noting the inexorable rise in temperature
that interestingly those buildings which are celebratory and very very relevant to this place our reichstag project
which has a very familiar agenda i'm sure as a public place where we sought to
in a way through a process of advocacy
between society and politicians public space
and maybe its hidden agenda an energy manifesto something that would be free
completely free of fuel as we know it so it would be totally renewable and again the humanistic sketch the translation into the public space but this very very much a part of the ecology but here
not having to model it for real obviously wind tunnel had a place but the ability now with the computer to explore to plan
to see how that would work in terms of the forces of nature natural ventilation to be able to model the chamber below and to look at biomass a combination of biomass aquifers oil
process that quite interestingly was developed in eastern germany at the time of its dependence on the soviet bloc so really retranslating that technology and developing something
which was so clean it was virtually pollution free you can measure it again you can compare how that building in terms of its emission in tons of carbon dioxide per year at the time that we took that project over seven thousand
what it would have been with natural gas and finally with the vegetable oil four hundred and fifty tons i mean a ninety four percent reduction virtually clean
we can see the same processes at work in terms of the commerce bank its dependence on natural ventilation the way that you can model those gardens the way they spiral around
but again very much about the lifestyle the quality something that would be more enjoyable as a place to work and again we can measure the reduction in terms of energy consumption
there is an evolution here between the projects and swiss re again develops that a little bit further the project in the city in london
and this sequence shows the buildup of that model but what it shows first which i think is quite interesting
is that here you see the circle you see the public space around it what are the other ways of putting the same amount of space on the site if for example you
seek to do a building which
goes right to the edge of the pavement
it's the same amount of space
and finally you profile this
you cut grooves into it the grooves become the kind of green lungs which give views which give light ventilation
make the building fresher and you enclose that with something that also is central to its appearance which is a mesh of triangulated structures again
in a long connection evocative of some of those works of buckminster fuller and the way in which triangulation can increase performance and also give that building its sense of identity
and here if we look at a detail of the way that the building opens up and breathes into those atria the way in which now with a computer
we can model the forces we can see the high pressure the low pressure the way in which the building behaves rather like an aircraft wing
so it also has the ability all the time regardless of the direction of the wind to be able to make the building fresh and efficient and
and i'm just going to give two images out of a kind of company research project it's been well known that the dead sea is dying
the level is dropping rather like the aral sea and the dead sea is obviously much lower than the
oceans and seas around it so there has been a project which rescues the dead sea by creating a pipeline a pipe
sometimes above the surface sometimes buried that will redress that and will feed from the gulf of aqaba into the dead sea
and our translation of that using a lot of the thinking built up over the forty years is to say what if that instead of being just a pipe
what if it is a lifeline what if it is the equivalent depending on where you are of the grand canal
in terms of tourists habitation desalination agriculture in other words water is the lifeblood
and if you just go back to the previous image and you look at this area of volatility and hostility that
a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture could have the affect of bringing all those warring factions together
whether that communication is the virtual world or it is the physical world then it's absolutely central to society and how do we make more legible
in this growing world especially in some of the places that i'm talking about china for example which in the next ten years will create four hundred new
what form do they take how do you make them more friendly at that scale hong kong i refer to as a kind of
analog experience in a digital age because you always have a point of reference so what happens when we take that and you expand
into the chinese society and what is interesting
is that that produces in a way perhaps the ultimate mega building it is physically the largest project on the planet at the moment two hundred and fifty
plus the new un built terminal five and the challenge here is a building that will be green
that is compact despite its size and is about the human experience of travel is about
coming back to that starting point is very very much about the lifestyle and
perhaps these in the end as celebratory spaces as hubert was talking over lunch as we sort of engaged in conversation talked about this talked about cities
was saying absolutely correctly these are the new cathedrals and
in a way one aspect of this conversation
was triggered on new year 's eve when i was talking about the agenda in china
agenda in china in terms of its
green ambitions and aspirations and i was voicing the thought that it just crossed my mind that new year 's eve a sort of symbolic
turning point as we move from two thousand and six to two thousand and seven that maybe you know the future was
the most powerful innovative sort of nation the way in which somebody like kennedy inspirationally could say we put a man on the moon you know who is going to say that
we cracked this thing of the dependence on fossil fuels with all that being held to ransom by rogue regimes and so on and that's a concerted platform it's more than one device you know it's renewable
and i voiced the thought that maybe at the turn of the year i thought that the inspiration was more likely to come from those other larger countries out there the chinas the indias the asian pacific tigers thank you very much
