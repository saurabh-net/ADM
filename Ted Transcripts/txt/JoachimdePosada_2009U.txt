i'm here because i have a very important message i think we have found the most important factor for success and it was found
close to here stanford psychology professor took kids that were four years old and put them in a room all by themselves and he would tell the child a four year old kid johnny
you will get another one so you will have
to tell a four year old kid to wait fifteen minutes for something that they like is equivalent to telling us we 'll bring you what happened when
the professor left the room three ate the marshmallow
five seconds ten seconds forty seconds fifty seconds two minutes four minutes eight minutes some lasted fourteen and
what's interesting is that one out of three would look at the marshmallow and go like this
they would walk around they would play with their skirts and pants that child already at four understood the most important principle for success
which is the ability to delay gratification
self discipline the most important factor for success fifteen years later fourteen or fifteen years later follow
what did they find they went to look for these kids who were now eighteen and nineteen and they found that one hundred percent of the children that had not eaten the marshmallow were successful
they had good grades they were doing wonderful they were happy they had their plans they had good relationships with the teachers students they were doing fine a great percentage of the kids that ate the marshmallow
i had a question in my mind would hispanic kids react the same way as the american kids so i went to colombia and i reproduced the experiment and it was very funny i used four five and six years old kids and to think that
she ate it so we know she'll be successful but we have to watch her she should not go into banking for example or work at a cash register but she will be successful
if the sales person says wait a second let me ask you a few questions to see if this is a good choice then you sell a lot more so this has applications in all walks of life
i end with the koreans did this you know what this is so good that we want a marshmallow book for children we did one for children and now it is all over korea they are teaching these kids
