and i lead a research team we investigate materials and technologies that have unexpected properties
over the last three years we found over two hundred of these things and so we looked back into our library and selected six we thought would be most surprising for ted
of these six the first one that we're going to talk about is in the black envelope you're holding it comes from a company in japan called geltech now go
be sure and take the two pieces apart
when we see something unexpected it changes our understanding of the way things work as you're seeing this gel magnet for the first time if you assume that all magnets had to be hard then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding of the way magnets could work
now it's important to understand what the unexpected properties are but to really think about the implications of what this makes possible we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world
so first idea is to use it on cabinet doors if you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material if a cabinet slams shut it wouldn't make a loud noise and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed
this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door in your closet and you could literally stick
shoes up instead of using as shelf for me
i really love this idea
come to my apartment and see my closet i'm sure you'd figure out why it's a
it was like six months ago that keith and i were out in la and we were at starbucks having coffee with roman coppola he works on mostly music videos and commercials with his company the directors bureau
but like as we were talking roman told us that he 's kind of an inventor on the side and we were showing him the same gel magnet that you're holding in your hand and you know we shared the same ideas
and you could see it in his face roman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder he opens it up and keith and i look in
just like whoa this guy 's good because like the way that he presented the concept his approach was totally different than ours he sold it to you
as if it was for sale right now when we were going in the car back to the airport we were thinking like why was this so powerful
so for ted we decided to take our favorite idea for the gel magnet and work with roman and his team at the directors bureau to create a commercial for a product from the future the
we showed the concept to a few people before this and they asked us when it's coming out so i just wanted to let you know it's not actually coming out just the
so now when we dream up these concepts it's important for us to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint so i just want to quickly explain how this would work
in addition you can see from the diagram on the right the under part of the slide would be an electromagnet so this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you're going down
the force of the water rushing down in addition to that repulsion force would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market it's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system when you
get to the very bottom
so i'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is a metal it's not a magnetic material
i'm not going to get into the physics of it
but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet 's falling the greater the stopping force
next technology is actually a ten foot pole and i have it right here in my pocket
now as we were talking to the vendor to try to learn about how you could apply these or how they're being applied currently he was telling us that in the military
they use this one so soldiers can keep it on their chests very concealed and then when they're out on the field erect it as an antenna to clearly send signals back to the base
so we decided to go out onto the streets of chicago and ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this
my ceiling fans with that and i get the spider webs off my house i do it that way
i'd make my very own walking stick i would create a ladder to use to get up on top of
that when you went deep sea diving you could catch the fish really fast and then roll it back up and you could swim easier
now for our next technology we're going to do a little demonstration and so we need a volunteer from the audience you sir come on up
we need you to stand right in front of the ted sign and hold onto this
and hold onto this now
right so now if you'll see here
so describe to the audience
now the reason it's cold is that's it's not actually water loaded into these squirt guns it's a dry liquid developed by three m it's perfectly clear it's odorless it's colorless
it's so safe you could drink this
it feels cold is because it evaporates twenty five times faster than water coming up
coming up a big
the significance of this dry liquid early versions of the fluid were actually used on a cray supercomputer
now the unexpected thing about this is that zach could stand up on stage and drench a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern that we'd damage the electronics that we'd get him wet that we'd hurt the books or the computers
it works because it's non conductive so you can see here you can immerse a whole circuit board in this and it wouldn't cause any damage you can circulate it to draw the heat away
our next technology comes to us from a company in japan called sekisui chemical
one of their r d engineers was working on a way to make plastic stiffer
while he was doing this he noticed an unexpected thing we have a video to show you
you see there it didn't bounce back
this was an unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing it's technically called shape retaining property now think about your interactions with aluminum foil
shape retaining is common in metal you bend a piece of aluminum foil and it holds its place and contrast that with like a plastic garbage can and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back
for example you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist but doesn't use a
taking it a little further if you wove those strips together kind of like a little basket you could make a shape retaining sheet and then you could embed it in a cloth so you could make a picnic table that wraps around the table so that way on a windy day it wouldn't blow away
as this paper is bending the resistance of the ink changes so with simple electronics you can detect how much the page is being bent
now to think about the potential for this
think of all the places ink is supplied on business cards on the back of cereal boxes board games any place you use ink you could change the way you interact with it
so my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book this could totally change the way that you interface with paper you see the dark line on the side and the top as you turn the pages of the book the book can actually detect what page you're on based on the curvature of the pages
in addition if you were to fold in one of the corners then you could program the book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes
for our last technology we worked again with roman and his team at the directors bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works
oh yeah it smells good
now the way it works there's a matrix of color dyes
these dyes change color in response to odors so the smell of vanilla that might change the four on the left brown and the one on the right yellow
so that this matrix can produce thousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells but like in the milk commercial if you know what odor you want to detect then they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor
right it was that started a conversation with professor suslick and myself and he was explaining to me the things that this is making possible beyond just detecting spoiled food is really where the significance of it lies
his company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene and
i mean this is a true story they're using policemen as canaries
but more seriously they determined that you could develop a device that can smell better than the humans and say if it's safe or the firemen
in addition he 's spun off a company from the university called chemsensing where they're working on medical equipment so a patient can come in and actually blow into their device by detecting the odor of particular bacteria or or even lung cancer
the dots will change and they can use software to analyze the results this can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients currently they're using a method of trial and error but this could tell you precisely what disease you have
this is something that keith and i really enjoy doing i'm sure it's obvious to you now but it was actually yesterday that i was reminded of why
i was having a conversation with steve jurvetson over downstairs by the escalators and he was telling me that when chris sent out that little box
one of the items in it was the hydrophobic sand the sand that doesn't get wet he said that he was playing with it with his son and you know his son was mesmerized because he would dunk it in the water he would take it out and it was bone dry
a few weeks later he said his son was playing with a lock of his mother 's hair and he noticed that there were some drops of water on the hair and he took the thing and he looked up to steve and he said
