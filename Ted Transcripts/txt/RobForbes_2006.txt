i was listed on the online biography that said i was a design missionary that's a bit lofty i'm really more of something like a street walker
i spend a lot of time in urban areas looking for design and studying design in the public sector i take about five thousand photographs a year and
i thought that i would edit from these and try to come up with some images that might be appropriate and interesting to you and i used
stuff that was available to all people and stuff that probably contains some other important messages i'll use these sidewalks in rio as an example
very common public design done in the fifties it's got a nice kind of flowing organic form very consistent with the brazilian culture i think good design adds to culture
wholly inconsistent with san francisco or new york but i think these are my sort of information highways i live in much more of an analog world
where pedestrian traffic and interaction and diversity exchange and where i think the simple things under our feet have a great amount of meaning to us
how did i get started in this business i was a ceramic designer for about ten years and just loved utilitarian form simple things that we use every day little compositions of color and surface on form
this led me to starting a company called design within reach a company dealing with simple forms making good designers available to us and also selling the personalities and character of the designers as well
and it seems to have worked a couple of years into the process i spent a lot of time in europe traveling around looking for design and i had a bit of a wake up call in amsterdam i was there
we know a lot about what's going on with design around the world and it's getting increasingly more difficult to find design that reflects a unique culture i was walking around on the streets of amsterdam and i recognized you know the big story
from amsterdam isn't what's in the design stores it's what's out on the streets and maybe it's self explanatory but a city that hasn't been taken over by modernism
and i write a newsletter that goes out every week and i wrote an article about this and it got such enormous response that i realized that design that common design that's in the public area means a lot to people and establishes kind of a groundwork and a
i then kind of thought about the other cities in europe where i spend a lot of time looking for design like basel where vitra is located or in northern italy all cities where there are a whole lot of bicycles and where pedestrian areas and i came to the conclusion that perhaps
but it did seem that in many of these areas pedestrian traffic was protected
you wouldn't look at this and call this a designer bike a designer bike is made of titanium or molybdenum but i began looking at design in a place like amsterdam and recognized you know the first job of design is to serve a social purpose and so i look at this bike as not being
a designer bike but being a very good example of design and since that time in amsterdam i spent an increasing amount of time in the cities looking at design for common evidence of design that
really isn't under so much of a designer 's signature i was in buenos aires very recently and i went to see this bridge by santiago
a spanish architect and designer and the tourist brochures pointed me in the direction of this bridge i love bridges metaphorically and symbolically and structurally
and it was a bit of a disappointment because of the sludge from the river was encrusted on it it really wasn't in use and i recognized that oftentimes design when you're set up to see design it can be a bit of a letdown but there were
lots of other things going on in this area it was a kind of construction zone a lot of buildings were going up and approaching a building from a distance you don't see too much you get a little closer and you arrive at a nice little composition that might remind you of a mondrian or
or something but to me it was an example of industrial materials with a little bit of colors and animation and a nice little still life kind of unintended piece of design and going a little closer
you get a different perspective i find these little vignettes these little accidental pieces of design to be refreshing they give me i don't know a sense of correctness in the
world and some visual delight in the knowledge that the building will probably never look as good as this simple industrial scaffolding that is there to serve
down the road there was another building a nice visual structure horizontal vertical elements little decorative lines going across these magenta squiggles the workmen being reduced to decorative elements
just a nice kind of breakup of the urban place and you know that no longer exists you've captured it for a moment and finding this little still life 's like listening to little songs or something it gives me an enormous amount of pleasure
red drew me into this little composition optimistic to me in the sense that maybe the public service 's mailbox door service
plumbing it looks as if these different public services work together to create some nice little compositions in italy you know almost everything kind of looks good simple menus put on a board achieving kind of the sort of balance but i'm convinced that it's because you're walking around the streets and seeing things
can be comical it can draw your attention to the poor little personality of the little fire hydrant suffering from bad civic planning in havana
can animate simple blocks simple materials walking in new york i'll stop i don't always know why i take photographs of things
a nice visual composition of symmetry curves against sharp things it's a comment on the way in which we deal with public seating in the city of new york
come across some other just kind of curious relationships of bollards on the street that have different interpretations but these things amuse me
nice little piece of sculpture so there's this sort of silent hand of design at work that i see in places that i go havana is a wonderful area
it's quite free of commercial clutter you don't see our logos and brands and names and therefore you're alert to things physically and this is a great
cuba needs to be far more resourceful because of the blockades and things but a really wonderful playground i've often wondered why italy is really a leader in modern design
in our area in furnishings they're sort of way at the top the dutch are good also but the italians are good and i came across this little street in venice where the communist headquarters were sharing a wall with this catholic shrine
and i realized that you know italy is a place where they can accept these different ideologies and deal with diversity and not have the problem or they can choose to ignore them
but these you don't have warring factions and i think that maybe the tolerance of the absurdity which has made italy
so innovative and so tolerant the past and the present work quite well together in italy also and i think that
it's recognizable there and has an important effect on culture because their public spaces are protected their sidewalks are protected and you're actually able to confront these things
and i use this this is sort of what i consider to be urban spam i notice the stuff because i walk a lot but here private industry is really kind of making a mess of
some type of control over what's happening in the environment is very evident even in the way that they sell and distribute periodicals i walk to work every day or ride my scooter and i come down and park in this little spot
and i came down one day and all the bikes were red now this is not going to impress you guys who photoshop and can do stuff but this was an actual moment when i got off my bike and i looked and i thought it's as if all of my
biker brethren had kind of gotten together and conspired to make a little statement and it reminded me that
to keep in the present to look out for these kinds of things it gave me possibilities for wonder if maybe it's a yellow day in san francisco and we could all
agree and create some installations but it also reminded me of the power of pattern and repetition to make an effect in our mind
and i don't know if there's a stronger kind of effect than pattern and the way it unites kind of disparate elements i was at the art show in miami in december and spent a couple of hours looking at fine art and amazed at the prices of
know quite a nice little collage of these car keys and my closest equivalent were a group of prayer tags that i had seen in tokyo
and i thought that if pattern can unite these disparate elements it can do just about anything i don't have very many shots of people because they kind of get in the way of studying pure form i was in a small restaurant in
spain having lunch one of those nice days where you had the place kind of to yourself and you have a glass of wine and
enjoying the local area and the culture and the food and the quiet and feeling very lucky and a bus load of tourists arrived
emptied out filled up the restaurant in a very short period of time completely changed the atmosphere and character with loud voices and large bodies and such
and we had to get up and leave it was just that uncomfortable and at that moment the sun came out and through this perforated screen
pattern was cast over these bodies and they kind of faded into the rear and we left the restaurant kind of feeling ok about stuff and
i do think pattern has the capability of eradicating some of the most evil forces of society such as bad form in restaurants but quite seriously
it was a statement to me that one thing that you do sort of see is the aggressive nature of the industrial world has produced kind of
large masses of things when you in monoculture and i think the preservation of diversity in culture is something that's important to us
the last shots that i have deal with coming back to this theme of sidewalks and
i wanted to say something here about i 'm kind of optimistic you know post second world war the influence of the automobile has really been devastating in a lot of our cities a lot of urban areas have been converted into
parking lots in a sort of indiscriminate use a lot of the planning departments became subordinated to the transportation department it's as easy to rag on cars as it is on wal mart i'm not going to do that
are our contributions to a larger whole cities are the place where we're most likely to encounter diversity
and to mix with other people we go there for stimulation in art and all those other things but i think people have recognized the sanctity of our urban areas
a place like chicago has really reached kind of a level of international stature the u s is actually becoming a bit of a leader in kind of enlightened urban
planning and renewal and i want to single out a place like chicago where i look at some guy like mayor daley as a bit of a design hero for being able to work through
the political processes and all that to improve an area you would expect a city like this to have upgraded flower boxes on michigan avenue where wealthy people shop
common elements of this that you'll see throughout chicago and then there are your big d design statements the pritzker pavilion done by frank gehry
measure of this as being an important bit of design is not so much the way that it looks but the fact that it performs a very important social function there are a lot of free concerts for example that go on
in this area it has a phenomenal acoustic system but the commitment that the city has made to the public area is significant and almost an international model i work on the mayor 's council in san francisco on the international
mayor daley and the folks there i thought that i should include at least one shot of technology for you guys this is also in millennium park in chicago where
the spanish artist designer plensa has created kind of a digital readout in this park that reflects back the characters and personalities of the people
in this area and it's a welcoming area i think inclusive of diversity reflective of diversity and i think this marriage
both technology and art in the public sector is an area where the u s can really take a leadership role and chicago is one example thank you very much
