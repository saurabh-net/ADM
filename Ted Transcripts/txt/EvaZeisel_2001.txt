planned and the slogan was from was to and
of course i am not agreeing with because
who asks me are you still doing this or that i don't answer because i'm not doing things still i'm doing it the
called to do i have my plans i have my clients i am doing
twenty five all of these things were made during the last seventy five
seventy five the
the myself
some of the things i've made i made hundreds of them for the last seventy of things
of things of
i believe is called innovation innovation is not part of the aim of my
of things they make things
the craftsmen do i have so much to say i have to think what i am going to say
that means the playful search for beauty was called the first activity of man
was a mathematics professor at mit wrote the playful search for beauty was man 's first activity
that all useful qualities and all material qualities were developed from
playful search for beauty these that we have to
and this for me is now seventy five years so how can you without drying up make things with
as a gift to others for so long the playful is therefore an important part of our quality as
of our quality as some
i started to do these things
pieces as part of the
actually took me through many
and showed me a great part of the world this is not that they took me the work didn't take me
i made the things particularly because i wanted to use them to see the world i was incredibly curious to see the world and i made all these things
me to see many countries and many cultures i started
as an apprentice to a hungarian craftsman and this taught me
was in middle ages the guild system that means when i was an apprentice i had to apprentice myself in order to become
in my shop where i studied
and learned worker and apprentice and
the work as an apprentice
feet when it came from the
that it had to be kneaded it had to then go in kind of a mangle and then finally it was prepared for the throwing and
as an apprentice my master took me
to set ovens because this was part of oven making oven setting in the
and finally i had received a document that i had accomplished
roof coverers rail diggers oven setters chimney sweeps and
also got at the time a workbook which explained my rights and my working conditions and i still have that
first i set up a shop in my own garden and
and there i was sitting and my then boyfriend i didn't mean it was a boyfriend like it is meant
and i sat at the market and sold the pots my mother thought that this was not very proper so she sat with us to
however after a while there was a new factory being built in budapest a
and i visited it with several ladies and asked all sorts of questions of the director then the director asked me why do you ask all these questions
a pottery so he asked me could he please visit me and then finally he did and explained to me that
did now in my shop was an anachronism that the industrial revolution had broken out and that i rather should join
the factory there he made an art department for me where i worked for several months however
producing my designs now in molds and this was sold also to
that it was quite successful however
model maker everybody concerned himself much more with the art department that means with my work than making toilets so
the center from the bank who owned the factory saying make toilet setting behind the art department and that
so this gave me the possibility because now i was a journeyman and journeymen also take their satchel and
to see the world so as a journeyman i put an ad into the paper that i had studied that i was a down to
journeyman and i was looking for a job as a journeyman and i got several answers and
i accepted the one which was farthest from home and practically i thought halfway to america
and that was in hamburg then i first
everything was done on the wheel and so i worked in a shop where there were several
and the first day i was coming to
four turntables and one of them
behind where i was sitting was a hunchback a deaf mute hunchback who smelled very bad so i doused him
cologne every day which he thought was very nice and
the first day i came to me
my colleagues had thoughtfully put natural man 's
after i brushed them off with a hand motion they were very i finally was now accepted and here
here we have about five
actually my work took me to many countries because
to fill my curiosity and among other things other countries i worked was in the soviet union
from thirty two to thirty seven actually to
i had nothing to do i was a foreign expert i became art director of the china and glass industry and eventually at the beginning of
the accusation was that i had successfully 's life
and if this is the end of my five minutes i want to tell you that i actually did survive which was a surprise
and i'm here and since this is the end
i will tell me when your last trip to in fact the
found out that i had worked in thirty three at this factory and they came to
studio in rockland county and brought the fifteen of their artists to visit me here
and they invited myself to come to the russian factory last summer in july to
and since i don't like to travel alone they also
