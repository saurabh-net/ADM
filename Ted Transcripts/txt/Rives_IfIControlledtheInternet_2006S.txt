this poem after hearing a pretty well known actress tell a very well known interviewer on television i 'm really getting into the internet lately i just wish it were more organized
if i controlled the internet
you could auction your broken heart on ebay take the money go to amazon buy a phonebook for a country you 've never been to call folks at random until you find someone who flirts really well in a foreign language
hang left at cranky right at preoccupied u turn on silent treatment all the way back to tongue kissing and good lovin you could navigate and understand every emotional intersection some days i 'm as shallow as a baking pan
that way you could listen to cool music while you pretend to look for a job and you 're really just chattin with your pals laughter heck if i ran the web you could email dead people
it 's me i miss you laughter listen you 'll see being dead is dandy now you go back to raising kids and waging peace and craving candy if i designed the internet childhood com would be a loop
of a boy in an orchard with a ski pole for a sword trashcan lid for a shield shouting
the emperor of oranges who grows up to be me the guy who usually goes too far so if i were emperor of the internet i guess i 'd still be mortal huh but at that point i would probably already have
just how whack and un pc your mac or pc is going to be when i 'm rocking hot shit hot shot god net i guess it 's just like life
it is not a question of if you can it 's do ya we can interfere with the interface
