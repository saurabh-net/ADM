happy most of the time because i think this is the happiest species on the planet
it's kind of a well kept secret this species lives only in the congo
and they're not in too many zoos because of their sexual behavior
actually we have a lot to learn from them because they're a very egalitarian society and they're a very empathetic society
and it's used for communication
and so everything sort of has a place that it has to
but i don't think that we were that way initially
maybe it's his ability to have causal thought
maybe it's something special in his brain that allows him to have language
maybe it's something special in his brain
that allows him to make tools there were tasmanians
who were discovered around the sixteen hundreds and they had
to our knowledge they had no music
so when you compare them to the the
the he doesn't stand quite
how we got to where we are
i don't really think it's in our biology
i think we've attributed it to our biology
but i don't really think it's there
so what i want to do now is introduce you to a species called the bonobo
and she came to us when she was a
just at puberty about six or seven years of age
now this shows a bonobo on your right and a chimpanzee on your left
although shorter than us and their arms still longer
is more upright just as we are
have to rotate quite so much from side to side so the the bipedal gait is a little easier
and now we see all four the wild bonobo lives in central africa in the jungle encircled by the congo
trees as tall as forty meters one hundred and thirty feet grow densely in the area
it was a japanese scientist who first undertook serious field studies of the bonobo almost three decades
bonobos are built slightly smaller than the
by nature very gentle creatures
long and careful studies have reported many new findings on one discovery was that
to walk upright for long distances
and then go to the
you will see in this particular video more sticks too
i have a lighter in my pocket if you need one
i hope i have a lighter you can use the lighter to start the fire
very interested in fire he doesn't do it yet without a lighter
might be able to do
is a smile on the face of
some water on the fire you see the water
this is his sister this is her
she knows that that individual in the mirror is her
by raising bonobos in a culture that is both bonobo and human and documenting their development across two decades scientists are exploring how it means star in
it means star in is trying to
in the wild the parent bonobo is known to groom its offspring here panbanisha uses scissors instead of her hands to
tries to imitate panbanisha by using the scissors himself
realizing that nyota might get hurt panbanisha like any human mother carefully tugs to get the scissors back cut through tough animal
have made them two and a half million years ago by holding the rocks in both hands to strike one against
he has learnt that by using both hands and aiming his glancing blows he can make much larger sharper flakes kanzi chooses a flake he
the tough hide is difficult to cut even with a knife the rock that kanzi is using is extremely hard and ideal for stone tool making
but difficult to handle requiring great skill kanzi 's rock is from gona ethiopia and is identical to that used by our
ancestors two and a half million years ago
these are the rocks kanzi used and these are the flakes he made the flat sharp edges are like knife
compare them to the tools our ancestors used they bear a striking resemblance to kanzi 's
this is let me show you something we didn't think they would do
but since i'm advised not to do what i normally do i haven't told you that she
now she comes up to doctor sue and starts writing again
these are her symbols on very
place in the woods the similar to
the next symbol panbanisha writes represents when she goes out
this symbol is not as clear as the others but one can see panbanisha is trying to produce line and several straight
researchers began to record what panbanisha said by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk stunned scientists around
it's simply to use language around
because the driving force in language acquisition is to understand what others that are important to you are saying to you
so we want to create an environment in which bonobos like all of the individuals with whom they are interacting we want to create an environment
this environment brings out unexpected potential in kanzi and panbanisha
until nyota now one year old steals it then he peers eagerly into his mother 's mouth
looking for where the sound came from
doctor sue thinks it's important to allow such curiosity
this time panbanisha is playing the electric piano she wasn't forced to learn the piano she saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest which promotes the emergence
stay away from them now now you can chase them again time to
very good thank you so much
learning how to communicate with them in really high pitched tones
we're learning that they probably have a language in the wild
so we're sharing tools and technology and language with another species
