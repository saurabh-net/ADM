i want you to look at children who become suicide bombers through a completely different lens in two thousand and nine there were five hundred bomb blasts across pakistan
i spent the year working with children who were training to become suicide bombers and with taliban recruiters trying to understand how the taliban were converting these children into live ammunition
and why these children were actively signing up to their cause i want you to watch a short video from my latest documentary film children of the taliban
now run their own schools
target poor families and convince the parents to send their children
in return they provide free food and shelter and sometimes pay the families a monthly stipend
we've obtained a propaganda video made by the taliban young boys are taught justifications for suicide attacks and the execution of spies
i made contact with a child from swat who studied in a madrassa like this
from a poor farming family in swat
he joined the taliban a year ago when he was thirteen in
and preach to us then they take us to a madrassa and teach us things from the
he tells me that children are then given months of military training
i in my research have seen that the taliban have perfected the way in which they recruit and train children and i think it's
step process step one is that the taliban prey on families that are large that are poor that live in rural areas
they separate the parents from the children by promising to provide food clothing shelter to these children then they ship them off hundreds of miles away to hard line schools that run along the taliban agenda
step two they teach the children the koran which is islam 's holiest book in arabic a language these children do not understand and cannot speak they rely very heavily
on teachers who i have personally seen distort the message to these children as and when it suits their purpose to
these children are explicitly forbidden from reading newspapers listening to radio reading any books
that the teachers do not prescribe them if any child is found violating these rules he is severely
so they beat these children i have seen it they feed them twice a day dried bread and water
they rarely allow them to play games they tell them that for eight hours at a time all they have to do is read the koran
the children are virtual prisoners they cannot leave they cannot go home their parents are so poor they have no resources to get them back
step four the older members of the taliban the fighters start talking to the younger boys about the glories of martyrdom
they talk to them about how when they die they will be received up with lakes of honey and milk how there will be seventy two virgins waiting for them in paradise how there will be unlimited food
and how this glory is going to propel them to become heroes in their neighborhoods effectively this is the brainwashing process that has begun
step five i believe the taliban have one of the most effective means of propaganda their videos that they use
intercut with photographs of men and women and children dying in iraq and afghanistan and in pakistan and the basic message is that the western powers do not care about civilian deaths so those people who live
in areas and support governments that work with western powers are fair game that's why pakistani civilians over six thousand of whom have been killed in the last
two years alone are fair game now these children are primed to become suicide bombers they're ready to go out and fight because they've been told
that this is effectively their only way to glorify islam i want you to watch another excerpt from the film
this boy is called zenola he blew himself up
this boy is called sadik he killed twenty two this boy
this boy he killed twenty
the taliban are running suicide schools preparing a generation of boys from carrying out a
from carrying out a on
on the
the will
will on
leave you all with this thought if you grew up in these circumstances faced with these choices would you choose to live in this
or in the glorious afterlife as one taliban recruiter told me there will always be sacrificial lambs in this war thank you
