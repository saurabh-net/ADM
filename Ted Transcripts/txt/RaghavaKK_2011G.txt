everyone i 'm an artist and a dad second time around
thank you and i want to share with you my latest art project it 's a children 's book for the ipad it 's a little quirky and silly it 's called pop it and it 's about the things little kids do with their parents you can draw
as everyone should but you know i have a problem with children 's books i think they 're full of propaganda at least an indian trying to get one of these american books in park slope forget it it 's not the way i was brought up so i said i 'm going to counter this with my own propaganda if you notice carefully it 's a homosexual couple bringing up a child
and you have a lesbian couple
and you have a heterosexual couple
you know i don 't even believe in the concept of an ideal family i have to tell you about my childhood i went to this very proper christian school taught by nuns fathers brothers sisters basically i was brought up to be a good samaritan and i am
and i 'd go at the end of the day to a traditional hindu house which was probably the only hindu house in a predominantly islamic neighborhood
basically i celebrated every religious function in fact when there was a wedding in our neighborhood all of us would paint our houses for the wedding i remember we cried profusely when the little goats we played with in the summer became biriani
we all had to fast during ramadan it was
i was affected by this communal unrest my little five year old kid neighbor comes running in and he says rags rags you know the hindus are killing us muslims be careful
distill only its emotional residue and image my own life imagine history being taught differently remember that children 's book where you shake and the sexuality of the parents change i have another idea it 's a children 's book about indian independence very patriotic but when you shake it you get pakistan 's perspective
you know i 'm making a very important argument and my argument is that the only way
for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspectives at the earliest stage after all children 's books are manuals on parenting so you better give them children 's books that teach them perspectives and conversely only when you teach perspectives
will a child be able to imagine and put themselves in the shoes of someone who is different
from them i 'm making an argument that art and creativity are very essential tools in empathy you know i can 't promise my child a life without bias
