each containing clusters of tiny green leaves at the end and so densely packed together that you could actually stand on top of it
this individual lives in the atacama desert in chile and it happens to be three thousand years old it also happens to be a relative of parsley
for the past five years i've been researching working with biologists and traveling all over the world to find continuously living organisms that are two thousand years old and older
the project is part art and part science there's an environmental component and i'm also trying to create a means in which to step outside our quotidian experience of time and to start to consider a deeper
i selected two thousand years as my minimum age because i wanted to start at what we consider to be year zero and work backward from
looking at now is a tree called jomon sugi living on the remote island of yakushima the tree was in part a catalyst for the project i'd been traveling in japan without an agenda other than to photograph
i think it was my longstanding desire to bring together my interest in art science and philosophy that allowed me to be ready when the proverbial light bulb went on
so i started researching and to my surprise this project had never been done before in the arts or the sciences and perhaps naively i was surprised to find that there isn't even an area in the sciences that deals with this idea of global species longevity
so what you're looking at here is the rhizocarpon geographicum or map lichen and this is around three thousand years old and lives in greenland which is a long way to go for some lichens
visiting greenland was more like traveling back in time than just traveling very far north it was very primal and more remote than anything i'd ever experienced before
and this is heightened by a couple of particular experiences one was when i had been dropped of by boat on a remote fjord only to find that the archeologists i was supposed to meet were nowhere to be found
and it's not like you could send them a text or shoot them an email so i was literally left to my own devices but luckily it worked out obviously but it was a humbling experience to feel so disconnected
and then a few days later we had the opportunity to go fishing in a glacial stream near our campsite where the fish were so abundant
and then of course there's the lichens these lichen grow only one centimeter every hundred years i think that really puts human lifespans into a different
and what you're looking at here is an aerial photo take over eastern oregon and if the title searching for armillaria death rings sounds ominous it
is actually a predatory fungus killing certain species of trees in the forest it's also more benignly known as the honey mushroom or the humongous fungus because it happens to be one of the world 's largest organisms as well
so with the help of some biologists studying the fungus i got some maps and some gps coordinates and chartered a plane and started looking for the death rings the circular patterns in which the fungus kills the trees
so i'm not sure if there are any in this photo but i do know the fungus is down there and then this back down on the ground and you can see that the fungus is actually invading this tree
by preventing the flow of water and nutrients so this strategy has served it pretty well it's two thousand four hundred years old
and then from underground to underwater this is a brain coral living in tobago that's around two thousand years old and i had to overcome my fear of deep water to find this one this is at about sixty ft or eighteen meters depth
and you'll see there's some damage to the surface of the coral that was actually caused by a school of parrot fish that had started eating it though luckily they lost interest before killing it
now this is something that i think is one of the most quietly resilient things on the planet this is clonal colony of quaking aspen trees living in utah that is literally eighty thousand years old
what looks like a forest is actually only one tree imagine that it's one giant root system and each tree is a stem coming up from that system
so what you have is one giant interconnected genetically identical individual that's been living for eighty thousand years it also happens to be male and in theory immortal
this is a clonal tree as well this is the spruce gran picea which at nine thousand five hundred and fifty years is a mere babe in the woods the location of this tree is actually kept secret for its own protection
i spoke to the biologist who discovered this tree and he told me that that spindly growth you see there in the center is most likely a product of climate change
as it's gotten warmer on the top of the mountain the vegetation zone is actually changing so we don't even necessarily have to have direct contact with these organisms to have a very real impact on them this is the
this is the i'm just kidding
this is the fortingall yew but i put that slide in there because i'm often asked if there are any animals in the project and aside from coral the answer is no
does anybody know how old the oldest tortoise
this giant clam that was discovered off the coast of northern iceland that reached four hundred and five years old however it died in the lab as they were determining its age
after reaching full maturity so that being said it's highly unlikely that any jellyfish would survive that long in the wild
and back to the yew here so as you can see it's in a churchyard it's in scotland it's behind a protective wall and there are actually a number or ancient yews in churchyards around the u k but if you do the math you'll remember it's actually the yew trees that were there then the churches
and now down to another part of the world i had the opportunity to travel around the limpopo province in south africa with an expert in baobab trees
a number of them and this is most likely the oldest it's around two thousand and it's called the
and you know i think of all of these organisms as palimpsests they contain thousands of years of their own histories within themselves and they also contain records of natural and human events
and this can create great natural shelters for animals but they've also been appropriated for some rather dubious human uses including a bar
a prison and even a toilet inside of a tree
and this brings me to another favorite of mine i think because it is just so unusual this plant is called the welwitschia and it lives only in parts of coastal namibia and angola where it's uniquely adapted to collect moisture
from mist coming off the sea and what's more it's actually a tree it's a primitive conifer you'll notice that it's bearing cones down the center
and what looks like two big heaps of leaves is actually two single leaves that get shredded up by the harsh desert conditions over time
and it actually never sheds those leaves so it also bears the distinction of having the longest leaves in the plant kingdom
i spoke to a biologist at the kirstenbosch botanical garden in capetown to ask him where he thought this remarkable plant came from
and his thought was that if you travel around namibia you see that there are a number of petrified forests and the logs are all
the logs are all giant coniferous trees and yet there's no sign of where they might have come from so
his thought was that flooding in the north of
this is what i think is the most poetic of the oldest living things this is something called an underground forest so i spoke to a botanist at the pretoria botanical garden
who explained that certain species of trees have adapted to this region it's bushfelt region which is dry and prone to a lot of fires
so what these trees have done is if you can imagine that this is the crown of the tree and that this is ground level imagine that
the whole thing that whole bulk of the tree migrated underground and you just have those leaves peeping up above the surface
that way when a fire roars through it's the equivalent of getting your eyebrows singed the tree can easily recover
back in the u s there's a couple plants of similar age this is the clonal creosote bush which is around twelve thousand years old if you've been in the american west you know the creosote bush is pretty ubiquitous but that being said you see that this has this unique circular form
and what's happening is it's expanding slowly outwards from that original shape and it's one again that interconnected root system making it one genetically identical individual
it also has a friend nearby well i think they're friends this is the clonal mojave yucca it's about a mile away
and it's a little bit older than twelve thousand years and you see it has that similar circular form and there's some younger clones dotting the landscape behind it
and both of these the yucca and the creosote bush live on bureau of land management land
and that's very different from being protected in a national park in fact this land is designated for recreational all terrain vehicle use
so now i want to show what very well might be the oldest living thing on the planet this is siberian actinobacteria which is between four hundred thousand and six hundred thousand years old
and what they found by doing research into the permafrost was this bacteria but what's unique about it is that it's doing dna repair below freezing
and what that means is that it's not dormant it's actually been living and growing for
a million years it's also probably one the most vulnerable of the oldest living things because if the permafrost melts it
this is a map that i've put together of the oldest living things so you can get a sense of where they are you see they're all over the world the blue flags represent things that i've already photographed and the reds are places that i'm still trying to get to
you'll see also there's a flag on antarctica i'm trying to travel there to find five thousand year old moss which lives on the antarctic peninsula
so i probably have about two more years left on this project on this phase of the project but after five years i really feel like i know what's at the heart of this work
the oldest living things in the world are a record and celebration of our past a call to action in the present and a barometer of our future
they've survived for millennia in desert in the permafrost at the tops of mountains and at the bottom of the ocean
