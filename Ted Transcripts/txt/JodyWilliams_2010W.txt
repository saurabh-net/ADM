here to make a challenge to people i know there have been many challenges made to people the one i'm going to make is that it is time for us to what peace really means
peace is not kumbaya my lord peace is not
the dove and the rainbow as lovely as they are
when i see the symbols of the rainbow and the dove i think of personal serenity
i think of meditation i do not think about what i
to be peace which is sustainable peace
with justice and equality it is a sustainable peace in which the majority of people on this planet have access to enough
resources to live dignified lives
where these people have enough access to and health care
so that they can live in freedom from want and freedom from fear
this is called human security
and i am not a complete pacifist like some of my really really heavy duty non violent friends like mairead mcguire
i understand that humans are so
a nice word because i promised my mom i'd stop using the f bomb in public and i'm trying harder and harder mom i'm really
we need a little bit of police
we need a little bit of military but for
we need to redefine what makes us secure in this world it is not arming our country to
it is not getting other countries to arm themselves to the teeth with the weapons that we produce and we sell them
it is using that money more rationally to make the countries
of the world secure to make the people of the world secure
the president is offering eight point four billion
to try to get the start vote i certainly support the start vote
but he 's offering eighty four billion dollars for the modernizing of nuclear weapons
of nuclear weapons is eighty billion dollars
just that little bit of money which to me i wish it was in my bank account it's not but in global terms it's a little bit of money
but it's going to modernize weapons we do not need and will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime unless we get up off our
and take action to make it happen
it is saving the tigers it is stopping the tar sands it is
having access to medical equipment that can actually tell who does have cancer it is all of those things it is using our money for all of those things it is about action
it is about action i was in hiroshima
a couple of weeks ago and his holiness
sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city and there were about eight of us nobel
good that's good we need that in the world i don't follow that but that's cool and he says but i have become skeptical
i do not believe that meditation and prayer will change this world
i think what we need is action
his holiness in his robes is my new action hero i spoke with aung sun suu kyi a couple of days ago
the last twenty years imprisoned for her efforts to bring about democracy she was just released a couple of weeks ago and we're very
to see how long she will be free because she is already out in the streets in rangoon agitating for change she is already out in the streets working with the party to try to rebuild it but i talked to her for a range of
but one thing that i want to say because it's
she said you know we have a long road to go to finally get democracy in my country
but i don't believe in hope without endeavor
i don't believe in the hope of change unless we take action to make it so
here 's another woman hero of mine she's my friend
where she lives where does she live in exile she says the airports of the world
she is traveling because she was out of the country at the time of the elections and instead going home she conferred with all the other women that she works with who said to her stay out we need you out we need to be able to talk to you
out there so that you can give the message of what's happening here
a year and a half she's out speaking on behalf of the other women in her country wangari maathai
two thousand and four peace laureate
they call her the tree lady but she's more than the tree lady working for peace
working for peace is very creative
it's hard work every day
she was planting those trees i don't think most people understand that at the same time she was using the
of getting people together to plant those trees to talk about how to overcome the authoritarian government in her country
people could not gather without getting busted and taken to jail but if they were together planting trees for the environment
trees for the environment it was okay creativity
but it's not just iconic women
to change this world the women 's league of burma eleven individual organizations of burmese women came together because there's strength
in numbers working together is what changes our world the million signatures campaign of women inside burma working together
to change human rights to bring democracy to that country when one is arrested and taken to prison another one comes out and joins the movement recognizing that if
they work together they will ultimately bring change in their own country
there was a mother and three children the children were killed on the spot it was mairead 's sister
instead of giving in to grief depression defeat
in the face of that violence mairead hooked up with betty a staunch protestant and a staunch catholic and they took to the streets to say no more violence
and they were able to get tens of thousands of primarily women some men in the streets to bring about change
and they have been part of what brought peace to northern ireland and they're still working on it
now running for president she is educating the indigenous people of her country about what it means to be about a democracy about how you bring democracy to the country about educating about how to vote but that democracy is not just
about voting it's about being an active citizen
that's what i got stuck doing the landmine campaign one of the things that made this campaign work is because we grew from two ngo 's
to thousands in ninety countries around the world working together in common cause to ban landmines
some of the people who worked in our campaign could only work maybe an hour a month they could maybe volunteer that much there were others like myself who were full time
but it was the actions together of all of us that brought about that
change in my view what we need today is people getting up and taking action to reclaim the meaning of peace it's not
a dirty word it's hard work every single day and if each of us who cares about the different things we care about got up off our butts and volunteered
as much time as we could
we would change this world we would save this world and we can't wait for the other guy we have to do it ourselves thank you
