to talk about my dad my dad has alzheimer 's disease he started showing the symptoms about twelve years ago and he was officially diagnosed in two thousand and five
now he 's really pretty sick he needs help eating he needs help getting dressed he doesn 't really know where he is or when it is and it 's been really really hard my dad was my hero and my mentor for most of my life and i 've spent the last decade watching him disappear
my dad 's not alone there 's about
thirty five million people globally living with some kind of dementia and by two thousand and thirty they 're expecting that to double to seventy million that 's a lot of people
dementia scares us the confused faces and shaky hands of people who have dementia the big numbers of people who get it they frighten us and because of that fear we tend to do one of two things we go into denial it 's not me it has nothing to do with me it 's never going to happen to me
or we decide that we 're going to prevent dementia and it will never happen to us because we 're going to do everything right and it won 't come and
us i 'm looking for a third way
i 'm preparing to get alzheimer 's disease
prevention is good and i 'm doing the things that you can do to prevent alzheimer 's i 'm eating right
especially if you 're me cause alzheimer 's tends to run in families
so i 'm preparing to get alzheimer 's disease
based on what i 've learned from taking care of my father and researching what it 's like to live with dementia i 'm focusing on three things in my preparation
i 'm working to build my physical strength and this is the hard one i 'm trying to become a better person
let 's start with the hobbies
you can 't sit and have long talks with your old friends because you don 't know who they are it 's confusing to watch television and often very frightening and reading is just about impossible
when you care for someone with dementia and you get training they train you to engage them in activities that are familiar hands on open ended with my dad that turned out to be letting him fill out forms he was a college professor at a state school he knows what paperwork looks like
but it got me thinking what would my caregivers do with me
i read i write i think about global health a lot would they give me academic journals so i could scribble in the margins would they give me charts and graphs that i could color
so i 've been trying to learn to do things that are hands on
i 've always liked to draw so i 'm doing it more even though i 'm really very bad at it i am learning some basic origami
i can make a really great box
and i 'm teaching myself to knit which so far i can knit a blob
but you know it doesn 't matter if i 'm actually good at it what matters is that my hands know how to do it because the more things that are familiar the more things my hands know how to do the more things that i can be happy and busy doing when my brain 's not running the show anymore
they say that people who are engaged in activities are happier easier for their caregivers to look after and it may even slow the progress of the disease that all seems like win to me i want to be as happy as i can for as long as i can
a lot of people don 't know that alzheimer 's actually has physical symptoms as well as cognitive symptoms
you lose your sense of balance you get muscle tremors
and that tends to lead people to being less and less mobile they get scared to walk around they get scared to move
so i 'm doing activities that will build my sense of balance i 'm doing yoga and tai chi to improve my balance so that when i start to lose it i 'll still be able to be mobile
i 'm doing weight bearing exercise so that i have the muscle strength so that when i start to wither i have more time that i can still move around finally the third thing
my dad was kind and loving before he had alzheimer 's and he 's kind and loving now
i 've seen him lose his intellect his sense of humor his language skills but i 've also seen this he loves me he loves my sons he loves my brother and my mom and his caregivers
and that love makes us want to be around him even now even when it 's so hard when you take away everything that he ever learned in this world his naked heart still shines
i was never as kind as my dad and i was never as loving and what i need now is to learn to be like that i need a heart so pure that if it 's stripped bare by dementia it will survive
