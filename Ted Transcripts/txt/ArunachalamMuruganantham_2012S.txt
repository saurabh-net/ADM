i tried to do a small good thing for my wife it makes me to stand here
the fame the money i got out of it so what i did i 'd gone back to my early marriage days what you did in the early marriage days you tried to impress your wife i did the same
on that occasion i found my wife carrying something like this
then i was shocked what is the connection between using a sanitary pad and a milk budget and it 's called affordability
i tried to impress my new wife by offering her a packet of sanitary pads i went to a local shop i tried to buy her a sanitary pad packet that fellow looks left and right and spreads a newspaper rolls it into the newspaper gives it to me like a banned item something like that
i don 't know why i did not ask for a condom that makes me
but i am also trying to make sanitary pad with the good cotton it 's not working that makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research you need first funds not only financial crises but because of the sanitary pad research i come through all sorts of problems including a divorce notice from my wife
why the need for accumulating money then doing philanthropy what if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one that 's why
i am giving this machine only in rural india video one video
you just think competing giants even from harvard oxford is difficult i make a rural woman to compete with multinationals i 'm sustaining on seventh year already six
on public domain like an open software now one hundred and ten countries are accessing surplus educated
