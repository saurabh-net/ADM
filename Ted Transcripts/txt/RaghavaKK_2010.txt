i think it was in my second grade that i was caught drawing the bust of a nude by michelangelo i was sent straight away to my school principal
and my school principal a sweet nun
looked at my book with disgust flipped through the pages saw all the nudes you know i'd been seeing my mother draw nudes and i'd copy her
and the nun slapped me on my face and said
but it was convincing enough for me never to draw again until the ninth grade thanks to a really boring lecture i started caricaturing my teachers in school
and you know i got a lot of popularity i don't play sports i'm really bad at sports i don't have the fanciest gadgets at home
i'm not on top of the class so for me cartooning gave me a sense of identity i got popular but i was scared i'd get caught again so what i did was i quickly put together a collage of all the teachers i had drawn
glorified my school principal put him right on top and gifted it to him he had a good laugh at the other teachers and put it up on the notice board
this is a part of
i became a school hero all my seniors knew me i felt really special i have to tell you a little bit about my family that's my mother
i love her to bits she's the one who taught me how to draw and more importantly how to love she's a bit of a hippie she said don 't say that but i'm saying it anyway
the rest of my family are boring academics busy collecting ivy league decals for our classic ambassador car my father 's a little different my father believed in a holistic approach to living and you know every time he taught
these books because these books are hijacked by industrial revolution while he still held that worldview i was sixteen i got the best lawyer in town my older brother karthik and i sat him down and i said
he was very impressed he was all tearing up ready to hug me and i said hold that thought i said can i quite school then
but to cut a long story short i quit school to pursue a career as a cartoonist i must have done about thirty thousand caricatures i would do birthday parties weddings divorces anything for anyone who wanted to use my services
but most importantly while i was traveling i taught children cartooning and in exchange i learned how to be spontaneous and mad and crazy and fun when i started teaching them i said let me start doing this professionally
when i was eighteen i started my own school however an eighteen year old trying to start a school is not easy unless you have
a big patron or a big supporter so i was flipping through the pages of the times of india when i saw that the prime minister of india was visiting my home town bangalore
and you know just like how every cartoonist knows bush here and if you had to meet bush it would be the funnest thing because his face was a cartoonist 's delight i had to meet my prime minister
i went to the place where his helicopter was about to land i saw layers of security i caricatured my way through three layers by just impressing the
i i hopped into his car and off we went through
i sat him down i caricatured him and since then i've caricatured hundreds of celebrities this is one i remember fondly salman rushdie was pissed off i think because i altered the map of new york
anyway the next slide i'm about to show you
the next slide i'm about to show you is a little more serious i was hesitant to include this in my presentation because this cartoon was published
soon after nine eleven what was for me a very naive observation turned out to be a disaster
that evening i came home to hundreds of hate mails hundreds of people telling me how they could have lived another day without seeing this i was also asked to leave
the organization a cartoonists organization in america
that for me was my lifeline that's when i realized you know cartoons are really powerful art comes with responsibility anyway what i did was i decided
that i need to take a break i quit my job at the papers i closed my school and i wrapped up my pencils and my brushes and inks and i decided to go traveling
when i went traveling i remember i met this fabulous old man who i met when i was caricaturing who turned out to be an artist
i said oh my god what is that and i asked him and he said oh that thing in the night i die in the morning i am born again
so i tried going to the art store
you know there are a hundred types of brushes forget it they will confuse you even if you know how to draw so i decided i'm going to learn to paint by myself i'm going to show you a very quick clip to show you how i painted and a little bit about my city bangalore
they had to be larger than life everything had to be larger the next painting was even bigger and even bigger and for me it was i had to dance while i painted it was so exciting except
i didn't know the dance form so i started following them and i made some money sold my paintings and would rush off to france or spain
and work with them that's pepe linares a renowned flamenco singer but i had one problem my paintings never danced
as much energy as i put into them while making them they never danced so i decided i had this crazy epiphany at two in the morning i called my friends painted on their bodies and had them dance in front of a painting and all of a sudden my paintings came alive
and then i was fortunate enough to actually perform this in california with velocity circus and i sat like you guys there in the audience and i saw my work come alive you know normally you work in isolation and
the work was coming alive and it had some other artists working with me the collaborative effort was fabulous i said i'm going to collaborate with anybody and everybody i meet i started doing fashion this is a fashion show we held in london
the best collaboration of course is with children
and i must say i spent time in the bronx working with these kids and in exchange for me working with them they taught me how to be cool i don't think i've succeeded but they've taught me they said stop then i
all this is good but i want to paint like a
paint humongous paintings and they look really good and i wondered how they did it from so close so one day i had the opportunity to meet one of these guys and i said how do you paint like that who taught you
and he said oh it's very easy i can teach you but we're leaving the city because billboard painters are a dying extinct bunch of artists
i must have been nineteen and a half then and it was love at first sight i lived in india she lived in america she'd come every two months to visit me
and then i said i'm the man i'm the man and i have to reciprocate i have to travel seven oceans and i have to come and see you i did that twice and i went broke
so then i said nets what do i do she said why don't you send me your paintings my dad knows a bunch of rich guys we'll try and con them into buying it dad 's friends
dad 's friends like most
no they were really big geeks and they didn't know much about art so netra was stuck with thirty paintings of mine
so what we did was we rented a little van and we drove all over the east coast trying to sell it she contacted anyone and everyone who was willing to buy my work
she made enough money she sold off the whole collection and made enough money to move me for four years with lawyers a company everything and she became my manager
that's us in new york notice one thing
but this brought me with netra managing my career it brought me a lot of success i was really happy i thought of myself as a bit of a rockstar i loved the attention this is all the press we got and we said
it's time to celebrate and i said that the best way to celebrate is to marry netra i said let 's get
and i said not just married let 's invite everyone who 's helped us all the people who bought our work and you won 't believe it we put together a list of seven thousand people who had made a
models we had makeup artists jewelry designers all kinds of people working with me to make my wedding an art installation and i had a special
on that for me but all this excitement led to the press writing about us we were in the papers we're still in the news three years later but unfortunately something tragic happened my mother
you have to say bye to her you have to do what you have to do
and i was devastated i had shows booked up for another year i was on a high and i couldn 't i could not my life was not exuberant i could not live this larger than life person i started exploring the
of course my work turned ugly
another thing happened i lost all my audiences
the bollywood stars who i would party with and buy my work
none of them liked it my works also turned autobiographical
at this point something else happened a very very dear friend of mine
came out of the closet
and in india at that time it was illegal to be gay and it's disgusting to see how people respond to a gay person i was very upset i remember the time
when my mother used to dress me up as a little girl that's me there
anyway i don't know what my friends
my works turned a little violent i talked about this masculinity that one need not perform and i talked about the weakness of male sexuality
this time not only did my collectors disappear the political activists decided to ban me and to threaten me and to forbid me from showing
it turned nasty and i'm a bit of a chicken i can't deal with any threat this was a big threat so i decided
it was time to end and go back home
this time i said let 's try something different i need to be reborn again
and i thought the best way as most of you know who have children the best way to have a new lease on life is to have a child i decided to have a child and before i did that i quickly studied what can go wrong
a family get disfunctional and rudra was born that's my little son and two magical things happened after he was born my mother miraculously recovered after
and this man was elected president of this country you know i sat at home and i watched i teared up and i said that's where i want to be
and i wound up our life closed up everything we had and we decided to move to new york and this was just eight months ago
i moved back to new york my work has changed everything about my work has become more whimsical this one is called what the fuck was i thinking it
talks about mental incest you know
i may appear to be a very nice clean sweet boy but i'm not
these are just different cartoons and before i go want to tell you a little story
and that's an entirely different talk
i want to leave you with one story that really really inspired me i met belinda
when she was sixteen i was seventeen i was in australia and
had cancer and i was told she's not going to live
they in fact told me three weeks
i walk into her room and there was a shy girl and she was bald and she was trying to hide her baldness i whipped out my pen and i started drawing on her head and i drew a crown for her and then we started talking
and we spent a lovely time i told her how i ended up in australia how
who i conned and how i got a ticket and all the stories and i drew it out for and then i left
and within a few days of her death they published a book for her and she used my cartoon on the cover
you will join me in this magic carpet ride and touch children and be honest thank you so much
