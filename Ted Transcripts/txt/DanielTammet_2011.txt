or more precisely a high functioning autistic savant
it 's a rare condition
very often when i meet someone and they learn this about me there 's a certain kind of awkwardness
i can see it in their eyes
they want to ask me something
and in the end quite often the urge is stronger than they are
and they blurt it out
if i give you my date of birth can you tell me what day of the week i was born on
if i don 't perform a kind of one man savant show for you today i 'm going to talk instead about something far more interesting than dates of birth or cube roots
i want to talk to you briefly about perception
when he was writing the plays and the short stories that would make his name anton chekhov
kept a notebook in which he noted down his observations of the world around him little details that other people seem to miss every time i read chekhov
and his unique vision of human life i 'm reminded of why i too
and how different kinds of perceiving create different kinds of knowing and understanding
here are three questions drawn from my work rather than try to figure them out
i 'm going to ask you to consider for a moment the intuitions and the gut instincts that are going through your head and your heart as you look at them
for example the calculation can you feel where on the number line the solution is likely to fall
or look at the foreign word and the sounds
can you get a sense of the range of meanings that it 's pointing you towards
and in terms of the line of poetry why does the poet use the word hare
i 'm asking you to do this because
i believe our personal perceptions you see are at the heart of how we acquire knowledge
aesthetic judgments rather than abstract reasoning
guide and shape the process by which we all come to know what we know i 'm an extreme example of this
here are the numbers one to twelve as i see them every number with its own shape and character one is a flash of white light six is a tiny and very sad black hole
the sketches are in black and white here but in my mind they have colors
three is green four is blue five is yellow
i paint as well and here is one of my paintings it 's a multiplication of two prime numbers three dimensional shapes
and the space they create in the middle
you can 't get much bigger than pi the mathematical constant
it 's an infinite number literally goes on forever
in this painting that i made of the first twenty decimals of pi i take the colors
and the emotions and the textures
and i pull them all together
into a kind of rolling numerical landscape but it 's not only numbers that i see in colors words too for me have colors and emotions and textures
and this is an opening phrase from the novel lolita and nabokov was himself
there is a procession of syllables
wheat one prairies two lost swede towns three one two three
and this effect is very pleasant on the mind
and it helps the sentence to feel right
let 's go back to the questions i posed you a moment ago
sixty four multiplied by seventy five if some of you play chess you 'll know that sixty four is a square number
so that gives us a form that we can picture that we can perceive what about seventy five
we think of one hundred as being like a square
seventy five would look like this
so what we need to do now
is put those two pictures together in our mind something like this
sixty four becomes six thousand four hundred
so let me narrow the choices down to two
is it a happy word or a sad word
most people a majority of people say sad and
and it actually means
in my theory language evolves in such a way that sounds match correspond
with the subjective with the personal intuitive experience of the listener
let 's have a look at the third question
it 's a line from a poem by john keats words like numbers
words like numbers express fundamental relationships
between objects and events and forces that constitute our world
it stands to reason that we existing in this world
should in the course of our lives absorb intuitively those relationships and poets like other artists play with those intuitive understandings
in the case of hare it 's an ambiguous sound in english it can also mean the fibers that grow from a head and if we think of that let me put the picture up the fibers represent vulnerability
movement or motion or emotion so
what you have is an atmosphere
helps us to picture to feel intuitively what it means to limp and to tremble
so in these few minutes i hope i 've been able to share a little bit of my vision of things and to show you that words
i hope that i 've given you the desire to learn to see the world
with new eyes thank you
