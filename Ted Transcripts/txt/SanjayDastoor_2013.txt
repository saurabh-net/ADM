that you can carry with you anywhere
and you can run it for one thousand kilometers on about a dollar of electricity but when i say the word electric vehicle
people think about vehicles they think about cars and motorcycles and bicycles and the vehicles that you use every day but if you come about it from a different perspective you can create some more interesting more novel concepts so we built something
i 've got some of the pieces in my pocket here so this is the motor
this motor has enough power to take you up the hills of san francisco at about twenty miles per hour about thirty kilometers an hour and this battery
this battery right here has about
six miles of range or ten kilometers
which is enough to cover about half of the car trips in the u s alone
but the best part about these components is that we bought them at a toy store
these are from remote control airplanes and the performance of these things has gotten so good that if you think about vehicles a little bit differently you can really change things so today we 're going to show you one example of how you can use this
pay attention to not only how fun this thing is but also how the portability that comes with this can totally change the way you interact with a city like san francisco
it 's really maneuverable you have a hand held remote so you can pretty easily control acceleration braking go in reverse if you like also have braking
it 's incredible just how light this thing is i mean this is something you can pick up and carry with you anywhere you go
for every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car
which means not only is this thing fast to charge and really cheap to build
