like to do today is talk about
one of my favorite subjects and that is the neuroscience of sleep
the neuroscience of sleep the single most important
behavioral experience that we have
thirty six percent of your life
will be spent asleep which means that if you live to ninety then thirty two years
now what that thirty two years is telling us is that sleep at some level is important
and yet for most of us we don 't give sleep a second thought we throw it away we really just don 't think about sleep and so what i 'd like to do today is change your views change your ideas and your thoughts about sleep
and the journey that i want to take you on we need to start by going back in time
enjoy the honey heavy dew of slumber
but if we jump forward
four hundred years the tone about sleep changes somewhat this is from thomas edison from the beginning of the twentieth century sleep is a criminal waste of time and a heritage from our cave days
also jump into the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s some of you may remember that margaret thatcher was reported to have said sleep is for wimps and of course the infamous what was his name the infamous gordon gekko from wall street said money never sleeps
what do we do in the twentieth century about sleep well of course we use thomas edison 's light bulb
to invade the night and we occupied the dark and in the process of this occupation we 've treated sleep as an illness almost we 've treated it as an enemy at most now i suppose
we tolerate the need for sleep
why is it why do we abandon sleep in our thoughts well it 's because you don 't do anything much while you 're asleep it seems you don 't eat
you don 't drink and you don 't have sex well most of us anyway and so therefore it 's sorry it 's a complete waste of time right wrong
actually sleep is an incredibly important part of our biology and neuroscientists are beginning to explain why it 's so very important so let 's move to the brain
this is donated by a social scientist and they said they didn 't know what it was or indeed how to use it so
the other thing that 's really important about sleep is that it doesn 't arise from a single structure within the brain but is to some extent a network property and if we flip the brain on its back i love this little bit of spinal cord here this bit here is the hypothalamus
and right under there is a whole raft of interesting structures not least the biological clock the biological clock tells us when it 's good to be up when it 's good to be asleep and what that structure does is interact with a whole raft of other areas within the hypothalamus the lateral hypothalamus the ventrolateral preoptic nuclei all of those combine
and they send projections down to the brain stem here the brain stem then projects forward and bathes the cortex this wonderfully wrinkly bit over here with neurotransmitters that keep us awake and essentially provide us with our consciousness
so sleep arises from a whole raft of different interactions
is complicated and it takes thirty two years of our life but what i haven 't explained is what sleep is about so why do we sleep
and it won 't surprise any of you that of course the scientists we don 't have a consensus there are dozens of different ideas about why we sleep
the first is sort of the restoration idea and it 's
what 's been shown is that within the brain a whole raft of genes have been shown to be turned on only during sleep and those genes are associated with restoration and metabolic pathways so there 's good evidence for the whole restoration hypothesis
what about energy conservation again perhaps intuitive you essentially sleep to save calories now when you do the sums though it doesn 't really
is that if after you 've tried to learn a task
and you sleep deprive individuals the ability to learn that task is smashed it 's really hugely attenuated so sleep and memory consolidation is also very important however it 's not just
the laying down of memory and recalling it what 's turned out to be really exciting is that our ability to come up with novel solutions to complex problems is hugely enhanced by a night of sleep in fact it 's been estimated to give us a threefold advantage sleeping at night
i think the important thing to realize is that the details will vary and it 's probable we sleep for multiple different reasons but sleep is not an indulgence it 's not some sort of thing that we can
the critical thing to realize is that
if you don 't sleep you don 't fly essentially you never get there and what 's extraordinary about much of our society these days is that we are desperately sleep deprived so let 's now look at sleep deprivation
nowadays we sleep one and a half to two hours less every night so we 're in the six and a half hours every night league
if we think about other sectors of society the aged if you are aged then your ability to sleep in a single block is somewhat disrupted and many sleep again less than five hours a night shift work shift work is extraordinary perhaps twenty percent of the working population and
the body clock does not shift to the demands of working at night it 's locked onto the same light dark cycle as the rest of us so when the poor old shift worker is going home to try and sleep during the day desperately tired the body clock is saying wake up this is the time to be awake so the quality
well my goodness gracious well thank you very much indeed for not falling asleep because that 's what your brain is craving one of the things that the brain does is indulge in micro sleeps this involuntary falling asleep and you have essentially no control over it
now micro sleeps can be sort of somewhat embarrassing but they can also be deadly it 's been estimated that thirty one percent of drivers will fall asleep
at the wheel at least once in their life and in the u s the statistics are pretty good one hundred thousand accidents on the freeway have been associated with tiredness loss of vigilance and falling asleep a hundred thousand a year it 's extraordinary at another level of terror
we dip into the tragic accidents at chernobyl and indeed the space shuttle challenger which was so tragically lost and
in the investigations that followed those disasters poor judgment as a result of extended shift work and loss of vigilance and tiredness was attributed to a big chunk of those disasters so
when you 're tired and you lack sleep you have poor memory you have poor creativity
you have increased impulsiveness and you have
drugs stimulants caffeine represents the stimulant of choice across much of the western world much of the day is fueled by caffeine and if you 're a really naughty tired brain nicotine
and of course you 're fueling the waking state with these stimulants and then of course it gets to eleven o 'clock at night and the brain says to itself ah well actually i need to be asleep fairly shortly what do we do about that when i 'm feeling completely wired well of course you then resort to alcohol
is that alcohol doesn 't provide sleep a biological mimic for sleep it sedates you so it actually harms some of the neural proccessing that 's going on during memory consolidation and memory recall so it 's a short term acute measure but for goodness sake don 't become addicted to alcohol as a way of getting to sleep every night
another connection between loss of sleep is weight gain if you sleep around about five hours or less every night then you have a fifty percent likelihood of being obese
what 's the connection here
tiredness and the metabolic predisposition for weight gain stress tired people are massively stressed
and one of the things of stress of course is loss of memory which is what i sort of just then had a little lapse of but stress is so much more so if you 're acutely stressed not a great problem but it 's sustained stress associated with sleep loss that 's the problem
so sustained stress leads to suppressed immunity and so tired people tend to have higher rates of overall infection and there 's some very good studies showing that shift workers for example have higher rates of cancer
increased levels of stress throw glucose into the circulation glucose becomes a dominant part of the vasculature and essentially you become glucose intolerant therefore diabetes two
stress increases cardiovascular disease as a result of raising blood pressure so there 's a whole raft of things associated with sleep loss
so a quick show of hands who feels that they 're getting enough sleep here
ask the question well how do i know whether i 'm getting enough sleep well it 's not rocket science if you need an alarm clock to get you out of bed in the morning
if you are taking a long time to get up if you need lots of stimulants if you 're grumpy if you 're irritable if you 're told by your work colleagues that you 're looking tired and irritable chances are you are sleep deprived listen to them listen to yourself what do you do
make your bedroom a haven for sleep the first critical thing is make it as dark as you possibly can and also make it slightly cool very important actually
reduce your amount of light exposure at least half an hour before you go to bed light increases levels of alertness and will delay sleep what 's the last thing that most of us do before we go to bed we stand in a massively lit bathroom looking into the mirror cleaning our teeth it 's the worst thing we can possibly do before we went to sleep
turn off those mobile phones turn off those computers turn off all of those things that are also going to excite the brain
try not to drink caffeine too late in the day ideally not after lunch
now we 've set about reducing light exposure before you go to bed but light exposure in the morning is very good at setting the biological clock to the light dark cycle so seek out morning light basically listen to yourself
the sleep demands of the aged do not go down essentially sleep fragments and becomes less robust but sleep requirements do not go down and the fourth myth is early to bed early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise well that 's wrong at so many different levels
okay so for the last part the last few minutes what i want to do is change gears and talk about some really new breaking areas of neuroscience which is the association between mental health mental illness and sleep disruption
but it 's been largely ignored in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s when people started to think about this again they said yes well of course you have sleep disruption in schizophrenia because they 're on anti psychotics it 's the anti psychotics causing the sleep problems ignoring the fact that for a hundred years previously
sleep disruption had been reported before anti psychotics so what 's going on lots of groups several groups are studying
conditions like depression schizophrenia and bipolar and what 's going on in terms of sleep disruption we have a big study which we published last year on schizophrenia and the data were quite extraordinary in those individuals with schizophrenia
much of the time they were awake during the night phase and then they were asleep during the day other groups showed no twenty four hour patterns whatsoever their sleep was absolutely smashed and some
and the really exciting news is that
mental illness and sleep are not simply associated
but they are physically linked within the brain the neural networks that predispose you to normal sleep give you normal sleep and those that give you normal mental health are overlapping
and what 's the evidence for that well genes that have been shown to be very important in the generation of normal sleep
when mutated when changed also predispose individuals to mental health problems and last year we published a study which showed that a gene that 's been linked to schizophrenia which when mutated also smashes the sleep so we have evidence of a genuine mechanistic overlap between these two important systems
other work flowed from these studies the first
was that sleep disruption actually precedes certain types of mental illness and we 've shown that in those young individuals who are at high risk of developing bipolar disorder they already have a sleep abnormality prior to any clinical diagnosis of bipolar
the other bit of data was that
sleep disruption may actually exacerbate make worse the mental illness state my colleague dan freeman has used a range of agents which have stabilized sleep and reduced levels of paranoia in those individuals by fifty percent so what have we got we 've got
in these connections some really exciting things in terms of the neuroscience by understanding the neuroscience of these two systems we 're really beginning to understand how both sleep and mental illness are generated and regulated within the brain
the second area is that if we can use sleep and sleep disruption as an early warning signal then we have the chance of going in if we know that these individuals are vulnerable
early intervention then becomes possible and the third which i think is the most exciting
is that we can think of the sleep centers within the brain as a new therapeutic target stabilize sleep in those individuals who are vulnerable we can certainly make them healthier but also alleviate some of the appalling symptoms of mental illness so let me just finish what i started by saying is
take sleep seriously our attitudes toward sleep are so very different from a pre industrial age when we were almost
some sort of crystal waving nonsense this is a pragmatic response to good health if you have good sleep it increases your concentration attention decision making creativity social skills health if you get sleep it reduces your mood changes your stress
your levels of anger your impulsivity and your tendency to drink and take drugs and we finished by saying
that an understanding of the neuroscience of sleep is really informing the way we think about some of the causes of mental illness and indeed is providing us new ways to treat these incredibly debilitating conditions
jim butcher the fantasy writer said
sleep is god go worship and i can only recommend that you do the same thank you
