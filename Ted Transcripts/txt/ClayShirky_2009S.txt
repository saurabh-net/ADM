about the transformed media landscape and what it means for anybody who has a message they want to get out to anywhere in the world and i want to illustrate that by telling a couple of stories about that transformation i'll start here
last november there was a presidential election you probably read something about it in the papers and there was some concern that in some parts of the country there might be voter suppression
and so a plan came up to video the vote and the idea was that individual citizens with phones capable of taking photos or making video
would document their polling places on the lookout for any kind of voter suppression techniques and would upload this to a central place and that this would operate as a kind of
citizen observation that citizens would not be there just to cast individual votes
but also to help insure the sanctity of the vote overall so this is a pattern that assumes we're all in this together what matters here
technical capital it's social capital these tools don't get socially interesting until they get technologically boring
it isn't when the shiny new tools show up that their uses start permeating society it's when everybody is able to take them for granted
because now that media is increasingly social innovation can happen anywhere that people can take for granted the idea
is the largest increase in expressive capability in human history now that's a big claim i'm going to try to back it up there are only
periods in the last five hundred years where media has changed enough to qualify for the label revolution the first one is the famous one
then a couple of hundred years ago there was innovation in two way communication conversational media first the telegraph then the telephone slow text based conversations then real time voice
then about one hundred and fifty years ago there was a revolution in recorded media other than print first photos then recorded sound
you want to have a conversation in this world you have it with one other person if you want to address a group you get the same message and you give it to everybody in the group
doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press that was the media landscape as we had it in the twentieth century
and this is what changed this thing that looks like a peacock hit a windscreen is bill cheswick 's map of the internet he traces the edges of the individual networks and then color codes
the phone gave us the one to one pattern and television radio magazines books gave us the one to many pattern the internet gives us the many to many
for the first time media is natively good at supporting these kinds of conversations that's one of the big
the second big change is that as all media gets digitized the internet also becomes the mode of carriage for all other media
because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something can now gather around and talk to each other as well
and the third big change is that members of the former audience as dan gilmore calls them can now also be producers
and not consumers every time a new consumer joins this media landscape a new producer joins as well because the same equipment
phones computers let you consume and produce it's as if when you bought a book they threw in the printing press for free it's like you had a phone that could turn into a radio if you pressed the right
that is a huge change in the media landscape we're used to and it's not just internet or no
had the internet in its public form for almost twenty years now and it's still changing as the media becomes more social it's still changing patterns even among groups who know how to
deal with the internet well second story last may china in the sichuan province had a terrible earthquake seven point nine magnitude massive destruction in a wide area as the richter scale has it and the earthquake was
as it was happening people were texting from their phones they were taking photos of buildings they were taking videos of buildings shaking they were uploading it to qq china 's largest internet service they were twittering it and so
as the quake was happening the news was reported and because of the social connections chinese students coming elsewhere and going to school
the last time china had a quake of that magnitude it took them three months to admit that it had happened
now they might have liked to have done that here rather than seeing these pictures go up online but they weren't given that choice because their own citizens beat them to the punch
even the government learned of the earthquake from their own citizens rather than from the xinhua news agency and this stuff rippled like wildfire for a while there
the top ten most clicked links on twitter the global short messaging service nine of the top ten links were about the quake people collating information pointing people to news sources pointing people to the us geological survey
one was kittens on a treadmill but that's the internet for
in those first hours and within half a day
sites were up and donations were pouring in from all around the world this was an incredible coordinated
global response and the chinese then in one of their periods of media openness decided that they were going to let it go that they were going to let this citizen reporting fly
the reason so many school buildings collapsed is that corrupt officials had taken bribes to allow those building to be built to less than code
in front of these protesters in order to get them to go away essentially to say we will do anything to placate you just please stop protesting
but these are people who have been radicalized because thanks to the one child policy they have lost everyone in their next generation someone who has seen the death of a single child now has nothing to lose and so the protest kept going and finally
the chinese cracked down that was enough of citizen media and so they began to arrest the protesters they began to shut down the media that the protests were happening
china is probably the most successful manager of internet censorship in the world using something that is widely described as the great firewall of china
and the great firewall of china is a set of observation points that assume that media is produced by professionals it mostly comes in from the outside world
comes in in relatively sparse chunks and it comes in relatively slowly and because of those four characteristics they are able to filter it as it comes into the
but like the maginot line the great firewall of china was facing in the wrong direction for this challenge because not one of those four things was true in this environment
the media was produced locally it was produced by amateurs it was produced quickly and it was produced at such an incredible abundance that there was no way to filter it as it
and so now the chinese government who for a dozen years has quite successfully filtered the web is now in the position of having to decide whether to allow or shut
entire services because the transformation to amateur media is so enormous that they can't deal with it any other
they were simply shutting down access to twitter because there was no way to filter it other than that they had to turn the spigot entirely
these changes don't just affect people who want to censor messages they also affect people who want to send messages because this is really a transformation of the ecosystem as a whole not just
the classic media problem from the twentieth century is how does an organization have a message that they want to get out
to a group of people distributed at the edges of a network and here is the twentieth century answer bundle up the message send the same message
national message targeted individuals relatively sparse number of producers very expensive to do so there is not a lot of competition this is how you
reach people all of that is over we are increasingly in a landscape where media is global social ubiquitous and cheap
now most organizations that are trying to send messages to the outside world to the distributed collection of the audience are now
to this change the audience can talk back and that's a little freaky but you can get used to it after a while as people do but that's not the really crazy change that we're living in
really crazy change is here it's the fact that they are no longer disconnected from each other the fact that former consumers are now producers the fact that the
we saw some of the most imaginative use of social media during the obama campaign and i don't mean most imaginative use in politics i mean most imaginative use
and one of the things obama did was they famously the obama campaign did was they famously put up my barak obama dot com mybo com and millions of citizens rushed in to participate and to try and figure out how to help
an incredible conversation sprung up there and then this time last year obama announced that he was going to change his vote on
the foreign intelligence surveillance act he had said in january that he would not sign a bill that granted telecom immunity for possibly warrantless spying on american
by the summer in the middle of the general campaign he said i 've thought about the issue more i've changed my mind i'm going to vote for this bill and many of his own supporters on his own site went very publicly berserk
it was senator obama when they created it they changed the name later please get fisa right within days of this group being created it was the fastest growing group on mybo com within weeks of its being created it was the largest
obama had to issue a press release he had to issue a reply and he said essentially i have considered the issue i understand where you are coming from but
thing happened in the conversation people in that group realized that obama had never shut them
nobody in the obama campaign had ever tried to hide the group or make it harder to join to deny its existence to delete it to take to off the site they had understood
that their role with mybo com was to convene their supporters but not to control their
and that is the kind of discipline that it takes to make really mature use of this media media
the media landscape that we knew as familiar as it was as easy conceptually as it was to deal with the idea that professionals broadcast messages to amateurs is increasingly slipping
in a world where media is global social ubiquitous and cheap in a world of media where the former audience are now increasingly full participants
in that world media is less and less often about crafting a single message to be consumed
by individuals it is more and more often a way of creating an environment for convening and supporting groups
and the choice we face i mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard anywhere in the world isn't whether or not that is the media environment we
that's the media environment we've got the question we all face now is how can we make best use of this media even though it means changing the way we've always done it thank you very much
