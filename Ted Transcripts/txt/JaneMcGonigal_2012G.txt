your mission is to figure out how you want to spend your extra
because i 'm a game designer you might be thinking to yourself i know what she wants us to do with those minutes
she wants us to spend them playing games now this is a totally reasonable assumption given that i have made quite a habit of encouraging people to spend more time playing games for example in my first tedtalk i did propose that we should spend twenty one billion hours a week as a
this idea is so pervasive that games are a waste of time that we will come to regret that i hear it literally everywhere i go for example true story just a few weeks ago this cab driver upon finding out that a friend and i were in town for a game developer 's conference turned around and said and i quote
i hate games waste of life imagine getting to the end of your life and regretting all that time
and that 's what i want to share with you today
now as far as i know no one ever told one of the hospice workers i wish i 'd spent more time playing video games
but when i hear these top five regrets of the dying i can 't help but hear five deep human cravings that games actually help us fulfill for example
i wish i hadn 't worked so hard for many people this means i wish i 'd spent more time with my family with my kids when they were growing up well we know that playing games together has tremendous family benefits
a recent study from brigham young university school of family life reported that parents who spend more time playing video games with their kids have much stronger real life relationships with them
a recent study from university of michigan showed that these games are incredibly powerful relationship management tools they help us stay connected with people in our social network that we would otherwise grow distant from if we weren 't playing games together
i wish i 'd let myself be happier well here i can 't help but think of the groundbreaking clinical trials recently conducted at east carolina university that showed that online games can outperform pharmaceuticals for treating clinical anxiety and depression
just thirty minutes of online game play a day was enough to create dramatic boosts in mood and long term increases in happiness
i 'd had the courage to express my true self well avatars are a way to express our true selves our most heroic idealized version of who we might become you can see that in this alter ego portrait by robbie cooper of a gamer with his
and stanford university has been doing research for five years now to document how playing a game with an idealized avatar
changes how we think and act in real life making us more courageous more ambitious more committed to our goals
i wish i 'd led a life true to my dreams and not what others expected of me are games doing this yet i 'm not sure so i 've left a question mark a super mario question mark and we 're going to come back to this one
but recently i did spend three months in bed
it started two years ago when i hit my head and got a concussion now the concussion didn 't heal properly and after thirty days i was left with symptoms like nonstop headaches nausea vertigo memory loss mental fog
my doctor told me that in order to heal my brain i had to rest it so i had to avoid everything that triggered my symptoms for me that meant no reading no writing no video games no work or email no running no alcohol no caffeine in other words and i think you see where this is going no reason to live
and it happened to me my brain started telling me
it said the pain will never end
and these voices became so persistent and so persuasive
that i started to legitimately fear for my life which
is the time that i said to myself after thirty four days and i will never forget this
i said i am either going to kill myself
so i created a role playing recovery game called jane the concussion slayer now this became my new secret identity and the first thing i did as a slayer was call my twin sister i have an identical twin sister named kelly and tell her
i 'm playing a game to heal my brain and i want you to play with me
we also collected and activated power ups this was anything i could do on even my worst day to feel just a little bit good just a little bit productive
things like cuddling my dog for ten minutes or getting out of bed and walking around the block just once now the game was that simple adopt a secret identity recruit your allies battle the bad guys activate
went away it just vanished it felt like a miracle now it wasn 't a miracle cure for the headaches or the cognitive symptoms that lasted for more than a year and it was the hardest year of my life by far but even when i still had the symptoms even while i was still in pain i stopped suffering
and i could tell from their messages and their videos that the game was helping them in the same ways that it helped me they talked about feeling stronger and braver they talked about feeling better understood by their friends and family and they even talked about feeling happier even though they were in pain
even though they were tackling the toughest challenge of their lives now at the time i 'm thinking to myself
some people get stronger and happier after a traumatic event
and that 's what was happening to us the game was helping us experience what scientists call post traumatic growth which is not something we usually hear about we usually hear about post traumatic stress disorder
