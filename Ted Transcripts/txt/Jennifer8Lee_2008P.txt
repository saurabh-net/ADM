more chinese restaurants in this country than mcdonald 's burger king kentucky fried chicken and wendy 's combined forty thousand actually chinese restaurants have played an important role in american history as a matter of fact the cuban missile crisis was resolved in a chinese restaurant called
and it's not completely gratuitous because wok and roll chinese food and japanese foods so it kind of works out and
for example serves thermal stabilized sweet and sour pork on its shuttle menu for its astronauts
so let me present the question to you if our benchmark for americanness is apple pie
you should ask yourself how often do you eat apple pie versus how often do you eat chinese food
and if you think about it
a lot of the foods that you think of or we think of or americans think of as chinese food are barely recognizable to chinese for example beef with broccoli egg rolls
for example i took a whole bunch of fortune cookies back to china gave them to chinese to see how they would react i
where are they from the short answer is actually they're from japan and in kyoto outside there are still small family run bakeries that make fortune cookies as they did over one hundred years ago thirty years before fortune cookies
were introduced in the united states if you see them side by side there's yellow and brown theirs are actually flavored with miso and sesame paste so they're not as sweet
as our version so how did they get to the united states well the short answer is the japanese immigrants came over and a bunch
answer is we locked up all the japanese during world war ii including those that made fortune cookies so that's the time when the chinese moved in kind of saw a market opportunity and
so fortune cookies invented by the japanese popularized by the chinese but ultimately consumed by americans they are more american than anything else another one of my favorite dishes general tso 's chicken which by the way in the us naval academy is called admiral tso 's chicken
i love this dish the original name in my book was actually called the long march of general tso and he has marched very far indeed because he is sweet he is fried and he is chicken all things that americans love
so far actually that the chef who originally invented the dish doesn't recognize
's in taiwan right now he 's retired deaf and plays a lot of mahjong so he after this i showed him he got up and he 's like mominqimiao which means this is all nonsense and goes back to play his mahjong game
are importing it as a sort of exotic delicacy i guarantee you general tso never saw a stalk of broccoli in his life and indeed that actually was a picture of general tso i went to his
find chicken believe it or not these guys were actually crossing the road
actually found a whole bunch of general tso 's relatives who are still in the little town this guy is now five generations removed from the general this guy is about seven showed them all the pictures of general tso chicken that i showed you and they're like
we don't know this dish and then they're like is this chinese food because it doesn't look like chinese food to them but they weren't kind
i traveled around the world to visit them because in their eyes he is after all a famous qing dynasty military hero he played an important role in the taiping rebellion which was a war started by a guy who thought he was the son of god and the baby brother of jesus christ
and caused the war that killed twenty million people still the deadliest civil war in the world to this day so you know i realized when i was there general tso is kind of a lot like colonel sanders in america in that he 's
for chicken and not war but in china this guy 's actually known for war and not chicken
thirty years before the americans realized that whoa chop suey is actually not known in china and as this article points out the average native of any city in china knows nothing of chop suey
i like to say chop suey 's the biggest culinary joke that one culture has ever played on another because chop suey if you translate into chinese means tsap sui which if you translate back means odds and ends
so these people are going around china asking for chop suey which is sort of like a japanese guy coming here and saying i understand you have a very popular dish in your country called leftovers and
not only that this dish is particularly popular after that holiday you call thanksgiving
eighteen hundreds when the chinese first came to america now back then
shores as alien these people weren't eating dogs they were eating cats and they weren't eating cats they were eating rats
and not the most pc question to be asked today but if you kind of look at the popular imagery of the time not so outlandish this is actually a real
for rat poison from the late eighteen hundreds and if you see under the word clears very small
which refers not only to the rats but to the chinese in their midst because the way that the food was perceived was
for chinese exclusion meat versus rice american manhood against asiatic coolieism which shall survive and it basically made the argument that chinese
men who ate rice would necessarily bring down the standard of living for american men who ate meat and as a matter of fact then this is one of the reasons why we must exclude them from this country so
a group was specifically excluded for its national origin or ethnicity so in a way because the chinese were attacked and chop suey was created as a
chinese guy named lem sen shows up in chinatown new york city and says i want you guys all to stop making chop suey because i am the original creator
and sole proprietor of the dish known as chop suey and the way that he tells it there was a guy there was a famous chinese diplomat that showed up
and he was told to make a dish that looked very popular and could quote pass as chinese and as he said we would never print this today but basically the american man
in america in fact if you think about it chinese food is the most pervasive food on the planet served on all seven continents even antarctica
there is italian chinese food where they don't have fortune cookies so they serve fried gelato my downstairs neighbor alessandra was completely shocked when i told her dude fried gelato is not chinese she's like it 's not but they serve it in all the chinese
and even the brits have their own version this is a dish called crispy shredded beef which has a lot of crisp a lot of shred and not a lot of beef
there is west indian chinese food there's jamaican chinese food there is middle eastern chinese food there's mauritian chinese food this is a dish called magic bowl that i discovered
so there's peruvian chinese food which should not be mixed with mexican chinese food where they basically take things and make it look like fajitas
one thing they have things like risotto chop suey my personal favorite of all the restaurants i've encountered around the world was this one in brazil called kung food
has sort of garnered a lot of attention a lot of respect for basically standardizing
i got it from a fortune cookie this actually is a slip that one of the winners had because the
like this can't be true but it was true and basically of those one hundred and ten people and one hundred and four of them or so had gotten their number from the fortune cookie
i went and started looking i went across the country looking for these restaurants where these people had gotten their fortune cookies from
china in omaha which is actually run by koreans but that's another point
all these people had a very similar experience that converged at a fortune cookie and at a chinese restaurant and all these chinese restaurants were serving fortune cookies which of course we know aren't even chinese to begin with
level so a good sort of contrast is
ten years coming out with a chicken like product they did chicken pot pie they did fried chicken and then they finally introduced chicken
ten years and then within a couple of months it was such a hit they just introduced it and rolled it across the entire system of mcdonald 's in the country in contrast we have general tso 's chicken which actually started in new york city in the early nineteen seventies as i was also starting in the university in new york city in the early nineteen
ideas from one person can be copied and propagated across the entire system that there can be specialized versions of chinese food
you know depending on the region for example you know in new orleans we have cajun chinese food where they serve sichuan alligator and sweet and sour crawfish right and in philadelphia you
which looks like an egg roll on the outside but a cheesesteak on the inside i was really surprised to discover that not only in philadelphia but also in atlanta because what had happened was that a chinese family had moved from atlanta to sorry from philadelphia to atlanta and brought that
our historical lore because of the way we like narratives are full of vast characters such as you know howard schultz of starbucks and ray kroc with mcdonald 's and asa chandler with
coca cola but you know it's very easy to overlook the smaller characters oops for example like lem sen who introduced chop suey chef peng who introduced
and all the japanese bakers who introduced fortune cookies
so the point of my presentation is to make you think twice
that those whose names are forgotten in history can often have had as much if not more
what we eat today so thank you very much
