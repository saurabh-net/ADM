the energy crisis was in full bore i started reading popular science magazine and i got really excited about the potential of solar energy to try and solve that crisis
i had just taken trigonometry in high school i learned about the parabola and how it could concentrate rays of light to a single focus that got me very excited
and i really felt that there would be potential to build some kind of thing that could concentrate light so i started this company called solar devices and this was a company where i built
i sold the plans for this engine and for this dish in the back of popular science magazine for four dollars each
and i earned enough money to pay for my first year of caltech it was a really big excitement for me to get into caltech and my first year at caltech i continued the business
but then in the second year of caltech they started grading the whole first year was pass fail but the second year was graded i wasn't able to keep up with the business
and i ended up with a twenty five year detour my dream had been to convert solar energy at a very practical cost but then i had this big detour first
three lotus one two three came out and i was completely blown away by lotus one two three i began operating my business with one two three began writing add ins for one two three
then much much later in two thousand very recently the new california energy crisis or what was purported to be a big energy crisis was coming and i was trying to figure if there was some way we could build something that would capitalize on that and try and get people back up energy in case the crisis really came
i started looking at how we could build battery back up systems that could give people five hours ten hours maybe even a full day or three days worth of back up power i'm glad you heard earlier today batteries are unbelievably energy lack of density compared to fuel
so much more energy can be stored with fuel than with batteries you'd have to fill your entire parking space of one garage space just to give yourself four hours of battery back up
and i concluded after researching every other technology that we could deploy for storing energy flywheels different formulations of batteries it just wasn't practical to store energy
so what about making energy maybe we could make energy i tried to figure out maybe solar 's become attractive it's been twenty five years since i was doing this let me go back and look at what's been happening with solar cells
and the price had gone down from ten dollars a watt to about four or five dollars a watt but it stabilized and it really needed to get much lower than that to be cost effective i studied all the new things that had happened in solar cells and was trying to look for ways we could innovate and make solar cells more inexpensively
a lot of new things that are happening to do that but fundamentally the process requires a tremendous amount of energy some people even say
it takes more energy to make a solar cell than it will give out in its entire life hopefully if we can reduce the amount of energy it takes to make the cells that will become more practical but right now you pretty much have to take
so i thought of an idea what if we collect the sun with a large reflector like i had been thinking about way back when when i was in high school but maybe with modern technology we could make a cheaper large collector concentrate it to a small converter
and then the conversion device wouldn't have to be as expensive because it's much smaller rather than solar cells which have to covering the entire surface area that you want to gather sun from
very short on genetic algorithms it's a powerful way of solving intractable problems using natural selection you take a problem that you can't solve with a pure mathematical answer you build an evolutionary system to try multiple tries at guessing
you add sex where you take half of one solution and half of another and then make new mutations and you use natural selection to kill off not as good solutions usually with a genetic algorithm on a computer today with a three gigahertz processor
you can solve many many formerly intractable problems in just a matter of minutes we tried to come up with a way to use genetic algorithms to create a new type of concentrator and i'll show you what we came up with traditionally concentrators look like this those shapes are
they take all the parallel incoming rays and focus it to a single spot they have to track the sun because they have to be pointing directly at the sun they usually have about a one degree acceptance angle meaning once they're more than about a degree off
with no moving parts so we created this genetic algorithm to try this out we made a model in xl of a multi surface reflector and an amazing thing evolved literally evolved
from trying a billion cycles a billion different attempts with a fitness function that defined how can you collect the most light from the most angles over a day from the sun and this is the shape that evolved
two places and take two bounces so for direct light it takes only one bounce for off axis light it might take two and for extreme off axis it might take three
your efficiency goes down with more bounces because you lose about ten percent with each bounce but this allowed us to collect light from a plus or minus twenty five degree angle so about two and a half hours of the day we could collect with a stationary component
solar cells collect light for four and a half hours though on an average adjusted day a solar cell because the sun 's moving across the sky the solar cell is going down with a sine wave function of performance at the
axis angles it collects about four an a half average hours of sunlight a day so even this although it was great with no moving parts we could achieve high temperatures
enough we needed to beat solar cells so we took a look at another idea we looked at a way to break up a parabola into individual petals that would track
so what you see here is twelve separate petals that each could be controlled with individual microprocessors that would only cost a dollar you can buy a two megahertz microprocessor for a dollar now and you can buy stepper motors
that pretty much never wear out because they have no brushes for a dollar we can control all twelve of these petals for under fifty dollars and what this would allows us to do is not have to move the focus any more
only move the petals the whole system would have a much lower profile but also we could gather sunlight for six and a half to seven hours a day now that we have concentrated sunlight what are we going to put at the center to
so we tried to look at all the different heat engines that have been used in history to try and convert sunlight to electricity or heat to electricity and one of the great ones of all time
he added a condenser to cool the steam outside the cylinder he made the engine double acting so it had double the power those were major breakthroughs i mean all of the improvements he made and it's justifiable that our measure of energy the watt today is named after him
so we looked at this engine and this had some potential steam engines are dangerous and they had tremendous impact on the world as you know industrial revolution and ships and locomotives but they're usually good to be large so they're not good for
this engine because it was so interesting it only worked on air no steam has led to hundreds of creative designs over the years that use the stirling engine principle
and it was a major achievement because it brought the power density of the engine way up you could now get a lot more power in a lot smaller space and that allowed the engine to be used for mobile applications so once you have mobility
so because it went into mass production costs were reduced one hundred years of refinement emissions were reduced
looking at these three and forty seven others we concluded that the stirling engine would be the best one to use i want to give you a brief explanation of how we looked at it and how it works so we tried to look at the stirling engine in a new way because
it was practical weight no longer mattered for our application the internal combustion engine took off because weight mattered because you were moving around but if you're trying to generate solar energy in a static place
the weight doesn't matter so much the other thing we discovered is that efficiency doesn't matter so much if your energy source is free
normally efficiency is crucial because the fuel cost of your engine over its life dwarfs the cost of the engine
but if your fuel source is free then the only thing that matters is the up front capital cost of the engine so you don't want to optimize for efficiency you want to optimize for power per dollar
so using that new twist with the new criteria we thought we could re look at the stirling engine and also bring genetic algorithms in basically robert stirling didn't have gordon moore before him to get us three gigahertz of processor power
so we took the same genetic algorithm that we used earlier to make that concentrator which didn't work out for us to optimize the stirling engine and make its design sizes and all of its dimensions
the exact optimum to get the most power per dollar irrespective of weight irrespective of size to get the most conversion of solar energy because the sun is free
and that's the process we took let me show you how the engine works the simplest heat engine or hot air engine of all time would be this take a box a steel canister with a piston put a flame under it the piston moves up
the problem is the efficiency is one hundredth of one percent because you're heating all the metal of the chamber and then cooling all the metal of the chamber each time
you move that up and down with a little bit of energy but now you're only shifting the air down to the hot end and up to the cold end down to the hot end and up to the cold end so now you're
i'm still heating the air every time and cooling the air every time what about if i put a thermal sponge in the middle in the passageway between where the air has to move between hot and cold
so he made fine wires and cracked glass and all different kinds of materials to be a heat sponge so when the air pushes up to go from the hot end to the cold end
it puts some heat into the sponge and then when the air comes back after it's been cooled it picks up that heat again so you're reusing your energy five or six times
and that brings the efficiency up between thirty and forty percent it's a little known but brilliant genius invention of robert stirling that takes the hot air engine from being somewhat impractical like i found out when i made the real simple version in high school to very potentially possible
once you get the efficiency up if you can design this to be low enough cost so we really set out on a path to try and make the lowest cost possible we built a huge mathematical model of how a stirling engine works we applied the genetic
we got the results from that for the optimal engine we built engines so we built one hundred different engines over the last two years we measured each one we readjusted the model to what we measured and then we led that to the current prototype
it led to a very compact inexpensive engine and this is what the engine looks like let me show you what it looks like in real life
so this is the engine it's just a small cylinder down here which holds the generator inside and all the linkage and it's the hot cap the hot cylinder on the top this part gets hot this part is cool and electricity comes out
the exact converse is also true if you put electricity in this will get hot and this will get cold you get refrigeration so it's a complete reversible cycle a very efficient cycle and quite a simple thing to make
so now you put the two things together so you have the engine now what if you combine the petals and the engine in the center the petals track
thank you so this is a unit with the twelve petals these petals cost about a dollar each lightweight injection bolted plastic aluminized the mechanism to control each petal is below there with a microprocessor on each one
there are thermocouples on the engine little sensors that detect the heat when the sunlight strikes them each petal adjusts itself separately to keep the highest temperature on
each one of these petals figures out where the sun is with no user set up so you don't have to tell what latitude longitude you're at you don't have to tell what your roof slope angle is
doesn't really care what it does is it searches to find the hottest spot it searches again a half an hour later it searches again a day later it searches again a month later it basically figures out where on earth you are
by watching the direction the sun moves so you don't have to actually enter anything about that the way the unit works is when the sun comes out the engine will start and you get power out here
the hot water 's optional you don't have to use the hot water it will cool itself but you can use it to optionally heat hot water and that brings the efficiency up even higher
so this is the first test where we took it outside and each of the petals were individually seeking and what they do is step
it could be on your roof or in your backyard or somewhere else you don't have to have enough units to power your entire house you just save money with each incremental one you add so you're still using the grid potentially in this type of application to be your back up supply of course you can't use these at night
and you can't use these on cloudy days but by reducing your energy use pretty much at the peak times usually when you have you air conditioning on or other times like that
really good combination of those two factors it turns out there's a lot of powerful sun all around the world obviously but in special places where it happens to be relatively inexpensive to place these
and also in many more places where there is high wind power so an example of that is here 's the map of the united states
and all this does is affect the payback period it doesn't mean that you couldn't use solar energy you could use solar energy anywhere on earth it just affects the payback period if you're comparing to grid supplied electricity
chances for solar energy and of course look at africa it's just unbelievable what the potential is to take advantage of solar energy there and i'm really excited to talk more about finding ways we can help with that so in conclusion i would say
my journey has shown me that you can revisit old ideas in a new light and sometimes ideas that have been discarded in the past can be practical now if you apply some new technology or new twists
if you get it down below five years then it becomes almost a no brainer because the interest to own it someone else will finance it for you and you can just make money basically from day one so that's our real powerful goal that we're really shooting for in the company
other things that i learned that were very surprising to me one was how casual we are about energy
at full power so there's basically fifteen horses running at full speed just to keep the stage lit not to mention the two hundred horses that are probably running right now to keep the airconditioning going
just amazing walk in the elevator and there's lights on in the elevator of course now i'm very sensitive at home when we leave the lights on by mistake
basically oil is solar energy concentrate it's been pounded for a billion years with a lot of energy to make it have all that energy contained in it and we don't have a birthright to just use that up as fast as we are i think
