today is about something maybe a couple of you have already heard about
from oval offices to central squares from carefully guarded airwaves
from carefully guarded airwaves to open source networks
but before tahrir was a global symbol of liberation there were representative surveys
already giving people a voice
my talk today draws on this research to reveal
and what they want now
but i 'm going to end by widening the lens to the entire region
to look at the mundane topics of arab views of religion and politics
and how this impacts women
revealing some surprises along the way
so after analyzing mounds of data what we discovered was
what we discovered was unemployment and poverty alone
did not lead to the arab revolts of two thousand and eleven
if an act of desperation by a tunisian fruit vendor sparked these revolutions
it was the difference between what arabs experienced and what they expected that provided the fuel
to tell you what i mean consider this trend in egypt
on paper the country was doing great
in fact it attracted accolades from multinational organizations because of its economic growth
but under the surface was a very different reality
in two thousand and ten right before the revolution even though gdp per capita had been growing at five percent for several years egyptians had never felt worse about their lives
not surprisingly people feel better as their country gets richer
