thank you for putting up these pictures of my colleagues over here
talking about them now i'm going try an experiment i don't do experiments normally i'm a theorist but i'm going see what happens if i press this
sure enough ok i used to work in this field of elementary particles what happens to matter if you chop it up very fine what is it made of and the laws of these particles
are valid throughout the universe and they're very much connected with the history of the universe we know a lot about four forces there must be a lot more but those are at very very small distances and we haven't really interacted with them very much yet
the main thing i want to talk about is this that we have this remarkable experience in this field of fundamental physics that beauty
is a very successful criterion for choosing the right theory and why on earth could that be
well here 's an example from my own
and it was in disagreement with seven seven count them seven experiments
experiments were all wrong and we published before knowing that because we figured it was so beautiful it's gotta be right
the experiments had to be wrong and they were now our friend over there albert einstein used to pay very little attention when people said you know
there's a man with an experiment that seems to disagree with special relativity dc miller what about that and he would say
stuff like that work that's the
what do we mean by beautiful that's one thing i'll try to make that clear partially clear why should it work and is this something to do with human beings i'll let you in on the answer to the last one that i offer and that is it has nothing to do with human
somewhere in some other planet orbiting some very distant star maybe in a another galaxy there could well be
they could be out there very easily
and suppose they have you know very different sensory apparatus and so on they have seven tentacles and they have fourteen little funny looking compound eyes and a brain shaped like a pretzel
would they really have different laws there are lots of people who believe that and i think it is utter baloney
i think there are laws out there and we of course don't understand them at any given time very well
but we try and we try to get closer and closer and someday we may actually figure out the fundamental unified theory of the particles and forces
what i call the fundamental law we may not even be terribly far from it but even if we don't run across it in our lifetimes we can still think there is one out there and we're just trying to get closer and closer to
i think that's the main point to be made we express these things mathematically and when the mathematics is very simple
when in terms of some mathematical notation you can write the theory in a very brief space without a lot of complication that's essentially what we mean by beauty or elegance
here 's what i was saying about the laws they're really there
newton certainly believed that and
he said here it is the business of natural philosophy to find out those laws
the basic law let 's say here 's an assumption the assumption is that the basic law really takes the form of a unified theory of all the particles now some people call that a theory of everything that's wrong
because the theory is quantum mechanical and i won 't go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and what it's like and so on you've heard a lot of wrong things about it anyway
there are even movies about it
stuff but the main thing here is that it predicts probabilities now sometimes those probabilities are
and in a lot of familiar cases they of course are but other times they're not and you have only probabilities for different outcomes
so what that means is that the history of the universe is not determined just by the fundamental law
the fundamental law and this incredibly long series of accidents or chance outcomes that are there in addition
and the fundamental theory doesn't include those chance outcomes they are in addition
so it's not a theory of everything and in fact a huge amount of the information in the universe around us comes from those accidents and not just from the fundamental
now it's often said that
an onion and we keep doing that and build more powerful machines accelerators for particles
we look deeper and deeper into the structure of particles and in that way we get probably closer and closer to this fundamental law
is that as we do that
as we peel these skins of the onion and we get closer and closer to the underlying law we see that each skin has something in common with the previous one and with the next one
we write them out mathematically and we see they use very similar mathematics they require very similar mathematics
that is absolutely remarkable and that is a central feature of what i'm trying to say today
newton called it that's newton by the way that one this one is albert einstein hi al
and anyway he said nature conformable to herself and so what
that the new phenomena the new skins the inner skins of the slightly smaller skins of the onion that we get to resemble the slightly larger ones and
the kind of mathematics that we had for the previous skin is almost the same as what we need for the next skin and that's why the equations look so simple
use mathematics we already have
trivial example is this newton found the law of gravity
which goes like one over the square of the distance between the things gravitated coulomb in france
found the same law for electric charges here 's an example of this similarity
you look at gravity you see a certain law then you look at electricity sure enough the same rule
it's a very simple example there are lots of more sophisticated examples symmetry is very important in this discussion you know what it means a circle for example is symmetric under rotations about the center of the circle
you rotate around the center of the circle the circle remains unchanged you take a sphere in three dimensions you rotate around the center of the sphere and all those rotations leave the sphere alone they are symmetries of the sphere
so we say in general that there's a symmetry under certain operations if those operations leave the phenomenon or its description unchanged
there's a new notation in the nineteenth century that expressed this
and if you use that notation the equations get a lot simpler then einstein with his special theory of relativity looked at a whole set of symmetries of maxwell 's equations which are called special relativity
and those symmetries then make the equations even shorter and even prettier therefore
let 's look you don't have to know what these things mean doesn't make any difference but you can just look at the form you can look at the form you see above at the top a long list of equations with three components for the three directions of space x y and z
then using vector analysis you use rotational symmetry and you get this next set
then you use the symmetry of special relativity and you get an even simpler set down here showing that symmetry exhibits better and better the more and more symmetry you have the better you exhibit the simplicity and elegance
of the theory the last two the first equation says that electric charges and currents give rise to all the electric and magnetic fields
the next second equation says that there is no magnetism other than that the only magnetism comes from electric charges and currents someday we may find some slight hole in that argument but for the moment that's the case
now here is a very exciting development that many people have not heard of they should have heard of it but it's a little tricky to explain in technical detail so i won 't do it i'll just mention
called by us frank yang and
bob mills put forward fifty years ago this generalization of maxwell 's equations with a new symmetry a whole new symmetry mathematics very similar but there was a whole new symmetry
they hoped that this would contribute somehow to particle physics
it didn 't by itself contribute to particle physics but then some of us generalized it further and then it did and it gave a very beautiful description of the strong force and of the weak force
so here we say again what we said before that each skin of the onion shows a similarity to the adjoining skins so the mathematics for the adjoining skins is very similar to what we need for the
and therefore it looks beautiful
so here are the themes we believe there is a unified theory underlying
steps toward unification exhibit the simplicity symmetry exhibits the simplicity
and then there is self similarity across the scales in other words from one skin of the onion to another one proximate self similarity
and that accounts for this phenomenon that will account for why beauty is a successful criterion for selecting the right theory
here 's what newton himself said nature is very consonant and conformable to
one thing he was thinking of is something that most of us take for granted today but in his day it wasn't taken for granted
the story which is not absolutely
certain to be right but a lot of people told it four sources told it that when they had the plague in cambridge and he went down to his mother 's farm
that drew the apple down to the earth could be the same as the force regulating the motions of the planets and the moon
the same theory of gravity
this principle of nature being very remote from the conceptions of philosophers i forbore to describe it in that book least i should be accounted an extravagant freak
and so prejudice my readers against all those things which were the main design of the book now who today would claim that as a mere conceit of the human mind
that the force that causes the apple to fall to the ground is the same force that causes the planets and the moon to move around and so on everybody knows that it's a property of gravitation
not something in the human mind the human mind can of course appreciate it and enjoy it use it but it's not it doesn't stem from the human mind it stems from the character of gravity and that's true of all the things we're talking about
they are properties of the fundamental law the fundamental law is such that the different skins of the onion resemble one another and therefore the math for one skin allows you to express
simply the phenomenon of the next skin
i say here that newton did a lot of things that year
and he could have written quite an essay on what i did over my
so we don't have to assume these principles as separate metaphysical postulates
they follow from the fundamental theory
they are what we call emergent properties you don't need
you don't need something more to get something more life can emerge from
physics and chemistry plus a lot of accidents
the human mind can arise from neurobiology and a lot of accidents
doesn't diminish the importance of
to know that they follow from more fundamental things plus accidents that's a general rule
and it's critically important to realize that you don't need something more in order to get something more people keep asking that
when they read my book the quark and the jaguar and they say isn 't there something more beyond what you have there presumably they mean something supernatural
anyway there isn 't you don't need something more
to explain something more thank you very much
