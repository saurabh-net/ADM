my story is a little bit about war it's about disillusionment it's about death and it's about rediscovering idealism
i don't believe in straightforward narratives i don't believe in a life or history written as decision a led to consequence b led to consequence c these neat narratives that we're presented with
and that perhaps we encourage in each other i believe in randomness and one of the reasons i believe that is because me becoming a diplomat was random
i'm colorblind i was born unable to see most colors this is why i wear gray and black most of the time and i have to take my wife with me to chose clothes and
to be a fighter pilot when i was a boy i loved watching planes barrel over our holiday home in the countryside and it was my boyhood dream to be a fighter pilot and
i did the tests in the royal air force to become a pilot and sure enough i failed i couldn't see all the blinking different lights and i can't distinguish color
so i had to chose another career and this was in fact relatively easy for me because i had an abiding passion all the way through my childhood which was international relations as a child i read the newspaper
i was fascinated by the cold war by the inf negotiations over intermediate range nuclear missiles the proxy war between the soviet union and the u s in angola or afghanistan
these things really interested me and so i decided quite at an early age i wanted to be a diplomat and i one day
i announced this to my parents and my father denies this story to this day i said daddy i want to be a diplomat and he turned to me and he said carne you have to be very clever
i entered the british foreign service that year five thousand people applied to become a diplomat and twenty of us succeeded and
as those numbers suggest i was inducted into an elite and fascinating and exhilarating world
being a diplomat then and now is an incredible job and i loved every minute of it i enjoyed the status of it i bought myself a nice suit and wore leather soled shoes
and reveled in this amazing access i had to world events i traveled to the gaza strip i headed the middle east peace process section in the british foreign ministry i became a speechwriter
for the british foreign secretary i met yasser arafat i negotiated with saddam 's diplomats at the u n later
i traveled to kabul and served in afghanistan after the fall of the taliban and i would travel in a c one hundred and thirty transport
and visit warlords in mountain hideaways and negotiate with them about how we were going to eradicate al qaeda from
dangerous and that was exciting that was fun it was really interesting and
but i was posted to new york to serve on the u n security council for the british delegation and my responsibility was the middle east which was my specialty and there i dealt with things like the middle east peace process
the lockerbie issue we can talk about that later if you wish but above all my responsibility was iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and the sanctions we placed on iraq to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons
i was the chief british negotiator on the subject and i was steeped in the issue and anyway
it was kind of a very exciting time i mean it was very dramatic diplomacy we went through several wars during my time
in new york i negotiated for my country
the resolution in the security council of the twelfth of september two thousand and one condemning the attacks of the day before which were of course deeply present to us actually living in new york at the time
so it was kind of the best of time worst of times kind of experience i lived the high life
i worked very long hours i lived in a penthouse in union square i was a single british diplomat in new york city you can imagine what that might have meant
i had a good time
in two thousand and two when my tour came to an end
i decided i wasn't going to go back to the job that was waiting for me in london i decided to take a sabbatical in fact at the new school bruce in some inchoate inarticulate way i realized that there was something wrong
with my work with me i was exhausted
and i was also disillusioned in a way i couldn't quite put my finger on and i decided to take some time out from work the foreign office was very generous you could take these special unpaid leave as they called them
and yet remain part of the diplomatic service but not actually do any work i was nice and eventually i decided to take a secondment to join the u n in kosovo
which was then under u n administration and two things happened in kosovo which kind of
again shows the randomness of life because these things turned out to be two of the pivots of my life and helped to deliver me to the next stage
but they were random things one was that in the summer of two thousand and four the british government somewhat reluctantly decided to have an official inquiry into the use of intelligence on wmd in the run up to the iraq war
a very limited subject and i testified to that inquiry in secret i had been steeped in the intelligence on iraq and its wmd and my testimony to the inquiry said three things that
the government exaggerated the intelligence which was very clear in all the years i'd read it and indeed our own internal assessment was very clear
discreditable thing still the third reason i won 't go into but anyway i gave that testimony and that presented my with a crisis what was i going to do this testimony was deeply critical of my colleagues of my ministers
and so i was in crisis and this wasn't a pretty thing
it i hesitated i went on and on and on to my long suffering wife and eventually i decided to resign from the british foreign service i felt
in the al pacino movie the insider which you may know where he goes back to cbs after they've let him down
the tobacco guy and he goes you know i just can't do this anymore something 's broken and it was like that for me i love that movie i felt just something 's broken i can't actually sit with my foreign minister or my prime minister again
with a smile on my face and do what i used to do gladly for them so took a running leap and jumped over the edge of a cliff
and it was a very very uncomfortable unpleasant feeling and i started to fall and
today that fall hasn't stopped i'm still falling but in a way i've got used to the sensation of it and in a way i kind of like the sensation of it
a lot better than i like actually standing on top of the cliff wondering what to do a second thing happened in kosovo which kind of i need a quick gulf of water forgive me
a second thing happened in kosovo which kind of delivered the answer which i couldn't really answer which is
what do i do with my life i love diplomacy
i have no career i expected my entire life to be a diplomat to be serving my country i wanted to be an ambassador my mentors my heroes
in march two thousand and four there were terrible riots all over the province as it then was of kosovo eighteen people were killed it was
will stop is when they decide to stop and when they've had enough burning and killing and that is not a very nice feeling to see and i saw it and i went through it i went through those mobs
and with my albanian friends we tried to stop it but we failed
me something which isn't immediately obvious and it's kind of a complicated story but one of the reasons that riot took place those riots which went on for several days took place was because the kosovo people were disenfranchised from their own future
were diplomatic negotiations about the future of kosovo going on then
and the kosovo government let alone the kosovo people were not actually participating in those talks
there was this whole fancy diplomatic system this negotiation process about the future of kosovo and the kosovars weren't part of it and funnily enough they were frustrated about that
the only reason and life is not simple one reason narratives it was a complicated thing and i'm not pretending it was more simple than it was but that was one of the reasons
and that kind of gave me the inspiration or rather to be precise it gave my wife the inspiration she said why don't you advise the kosovars why don't you advise their government
on their diplomacy and the kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service they were not allowed diplomats
they were not allowed a foreign office to help them deal with this immensely complicated process which became known as the final status process of kosovo
and so that was the idea that was the origin of the thing that became independent diplomat the world 's first diplomatic advisory group and a non profit to
and it began when i flew back from london after my time at the u n in kosovo i flew back and had dinner with the kosovo prime minister and said to him
that i come and advise you on the diplomacy i know this stuff it's what i do why don't i come and help you and he
the multi party negotiation team of kosovo and kosovo became independent independent diplomat is now established in five diplomatic centers around the world and we're advising seven or eight different countries
you heard it here first is going to be a new country within the next few years we're advising polisario front of the western sahara who are fighting to get their country back from moroccan occupation after thirty four years of dispossession
we're advising various island states in the climate change negotiations which is suppose to culminate in copenhagen
a bit of randomness here too because when i was beginning independent diplomat i went to a party in the house of lords which is a ridiculous place
i was holding my drink like this and i bumped into this guy who was standing behind me and we started talking and he said i told him what i was doing and i
rather grandly i was going to establish independent diplomat in new york at that time there was just me and me and my wife were moving back to new york
and he said why don't you see my colleagues in new york and it turned out he worked for an innovation company called what if which some of you have probably heard of
and one thing led to another and i ended up having a desk in what if in new york when i started independent diplomat
and watching what if develop new flavors of chewing gum for wrigley or new flavors for coke actually helped me innovate new strategies for the
and yet the word innovation doesn't exist in diplomacy it's all zero sum games and realpolitik and ancient institutions that have been there for generations and do things the same way they've always done things
and independent diplomat today tries to incorporate some of the things i learned at what if we all sit in one office and shout at each other across the office we all work on little laptops and try to move desks to change the way we think and we use
naive experts who may know nothing about the countries we're dealing with but may know something about something else to try to inject new thinking
into the problems that we try to address for our clients it's not easy because our clients by definition are having a difficult time diplomatically there are
i don't know some lessons from all of this personal and political
and in a way they're the same thing the personal one
off a cliff is actually a good thing and i recommend it and it's a good thing to do at least once in your life just to tear everything up and jump
the second thing is a bigger lesson about the world today independent diplomat is part of a trend
the world which is that
the world is fragmenting states mean less than they used to and the power of the state is declining
that means the power of others things is rising those other things are called non state actors they may be corporations they may be mafiosi they may be nice ngos they may anything any number of things
we are living in a more complicated and fragmented world if governments are less able to affect the problems in the world
who 's left to deal with it we have no choice but to embrace that reality
what this means is it's no longer good enough to say that international relations or global affairs or chaos in somalia
what's going on in burma is none of your business and that you can leave it to governments to get on with
i can connect any one of you by six degrees of separation to the al shabaab militia in somalia
how later but if you eat fish interestingly enough but that connection is there we are all intimately connected and this isn't just tom friedman it's actually provable
in case after case after case what that means is instead of asking your politicians to do things you have to look to yourself to do things
interstate conflict today eighty percent of the agenda of the u n security council is about conflicts within states
and when i look back on my time at the security council and what happened with the kosovars and i realize that
often the people who were most directly affected by what we were doing in the security council weren't actually
actually invited to give their views to the security council i thought this is wrong something 's got to be done about this so i started off in a traditional
me and my colleagues at independent diplomat went around the u n security council we went around seventy u n member states the kazaks the ethiopians the israelis you name them we went to see them more effective and durable
you would think i mean incredibly logical so obvious anybody could it and of course everybody got it everybody went yes of course your absolutely right come back to us in maybe six months
so we looked at that observation of basically failure and thought what can we do about it and i thought
if i'm going to spend the rest of my life lobbying for these crumby governments to do what needs to be done so what we're going to do is we're actually going to set up these meetings ourselves
so now independent diplomat is in the process of setting up meetings between the u n security council and the parties to the disputes that are on the agenda of the security council so we will be bringing darfuri rebel
the northern cypriots and the southern cypriots rebels from
and awful long laundry list of chaotic conflicts around the world and we will be trying to bring the parties
to new york to sit down in a quiet room in a private setting with no press and actually explain what they want to the members of the u n security council
of course describing all this any of you who know politics will think this is incredibly difficult and i entirely agree with you the chances of failure are very high
if we don't try to make it happen
and my politics has changed fundamentally from when i was a diplomat to what i am today and i think that outputs is what matters not process not technology frankly so much
and in a way independent diplomat embodies that fragmentation that change that is happening to all of us
