now it 's no secret because i like collecting things that i love the natural history museum and the collections of animals at the natural history museum in dioramas these to me are like living sculptures right that you can go and look at and they memorialize a specific point of time in this animal 's life
so i was thinking about my own life and how i 'd like to memorialize my life you know for the ages
and also laughter the lives of my friends
so this piece memorializes my friends in these jars
and they actually move around
some people reacted in terror
and some people hide from you so this was really interesting to me this idea of taking video off the screen and putting it in real life and also adding interactivity to sculpture so over the next year
i documented forty of my other friends and trapped them in jars as well and created a piece known as garden which is literally a garden of humanity
and what it does is it actually makes you implicit in the work of art you may never experience the entire thing yourself
you can walk away you can just watch as this character stands there in the blender and looks at you or you can actually choose to interact with it
so if you do choose to interact with the piece and you press the blender button it actually sends this character into this dizzying disarray of dishevelment
by doing that you are now part of my piece you like the people that are trapped in my work
and it 's up to you if you want to choose to punch that punch card clock you actually age me so i start as a baby
and then if you punch the clock you 'll actually transform the baby into a toddler
man and then from there into an elderly man and if you punch the punch card clock a hundred times in one day
the piece goes black and is not to be reset until the next day
so in doing so you 're erasing time you 're actually implicit in this work and you 're erasing my life so i like this about interactive video sculpture that you can actually interact with it that all of you can actually touch an artwork and be part of the artwork yourselves and hopefully one day i 'll have each and every one of you trapped in one of my jars
