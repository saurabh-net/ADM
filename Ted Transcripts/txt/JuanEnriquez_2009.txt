a great big elephant in the room called the economy so let 's start talking about that i wanted to give you current picture of the economy that's what i have behind myself
of course what we have to remember is
and what you have to think about is when you're dancing in the flames what's next so what i'm going to try to do in the next seventeen and a half minutes is i'm going to talk first about the flames where we are in the economy
and i will try and give you a sense of what the ultimate reboot looks like
those three trends are the ability to engineer cells
and the problem with leverage is it makes the u s financial system look like
so a normal commercial bank
has nine to ten times leverage that means for every dollar you deposit it loans out about nine or ten a normal investment bank is not a deposit bank it's an investment bank it has fifteen to twenty times
it turns out that b of a in september had thirty two times and your friendly citibank had forty
that means every bad loan goes bad forty seven times over
and that of course is the reason why all of you are making such generous and wonderful donations to these nice folks
and as you think about that
got to wonder so what do banks have in store for you now
the government meanwhile has been acting like santa claus
we all love santa claus right but the problem with santa clause is if you look at the mandatory spending of
on what we call entitlements and then by two thousand and seven it was sixty eight percent
we weren't supposed to run into one hundred percent until about two thousand and thirty
it turns out santa isn't quite as cute when it's summertime right
and here 's his second bit of advice
and by the way the chinese prime minister reiterated this at davos last
this stuff is getting serious enough that if we don't start paying attention to the deficit we're going to end up losing
and then all bets are off
show you what it looks like i think i can safely say that i'm the only trillionaire in this room ten trilliion dollars
the only problem with this bill is it's not really worth very much
was eight bucks last week four bucks this week a buck next week
what happens to currencies when you don't stand behind them
so the next time somebody as cute as this shows up on your doorstep and sometimes this creature 's called chrysler and sometimes ford and sometimes whatever you want
just got to say no and you've got to start banishing a word that's called
this is what it looks like the orange slice is what's discretionary everything else is mandated
so what we have to start thinking about doing is capping our medical spending because that's a monster that's simply going to eat the entire budget
got to start thinking about asking people to retire a little bit later
if you're fifty to sixty we want you to work two years more
if you're under fifty we want you to work four more years
the reason why that's reasonable is when your grandparents were given social security they got it at sixty five and were expected to check out at sixty eight
we've also got to cut the military about three percent a year we've got to limit other mandatory spending we've got to quit borrowing as much because otherwise the interest is going to eat that whole pie
i got what you're thinking this is going to hell freezes over
but let me remind you this december it did snow in vegas
really important in this stuff is as we cut we also have to grow
among other things because startup companies are two percent of u s gdp investment and they're about seventeen point eight percent of output
that's where these three trends come together
the ability to engineer microbes the ability to engineer tissues and the ability to engineer robots
let me recap some of the stuff you've seen craig venter showed up last year and showed you the first fully programmable cell that acts like hardware where you can insert dna and have it boot up as a different species
in parallel the folks at mit have been building a standard registry of biological parts so think of it as a radio shack for biology you can go out and get your proteins your rna your dna whatever and start building stuff
in two thousand and six they brought together high school students and college students and started to build these little odd creatures they just happened to be alive instead of circuit boards the first
so cells have this cycle first they don't grow then they grow exponentially then they stop growing
a way of telling which stage they were
could tell very easily when your experiment was working and wasn 't and where it was in the
this got a bit more complicated two years later twenty one countries came together dozens of teams they started competing the team from rice university started to engineer
the substance in red wine that makes red wine good for you into beer
so you take resveratrol and you put it into beer of course one of the judges is wandering by and he goes wow cancer fighting beer there is a god
the team from taiwan was a little bit more ambitious they tried to engineer bacterias
in such a way that they would act as your kidneys
four years ago i showed you this picture and people oohed and ahhed because cliff tabin had been able to grow an extra wing on a chicken and that was very cool stuff back
but now moving from bacterial engineering to tissue engineering let me show you what's happened in that period of time
two years ago you saw this creature
its limbs you can freeze half its heart it regrows you can freeze half the brain it regrows
but now you don't have to have the animal itself to regenerate
you can build cloned mice molars in petri dishes
of course if you can build mice molars in petri dishes you can grow human molars in petri dishes
this should not surprise you right i mean you're born with no teeth you give away all your teeth to the tooth fairy you regrow a set of teeth but then if you lose one of those second set of teeth they don't regrow unless if you're a lawyer
but of course for most of us
put them on a biodegradable mold regrow a tooth and simply implant
and we can do it with other things
so a spanish woman who was dying of tb had a donor trachea they took all the cells off the trachea they spraypainted her stem cells on to that cartilage she regrew her own trachea and seventy two hours later it was she's now running around
this is going on in tony atala 's lab in wake forest where he is regrowing ears for injured soldiers and he 's also regrowing bladders
so there are now nine women walking around boston with regrown bladders
which is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bags for the rest of your life
this is kind of getting boring right i mean you understand where this story 's going
they sprayed stem cells on to that heart from a mouse
those stem cells self organized and that heart started to beat
this may be one of the ultimate papers
this was done in japan and in the u s published at the same time and it rebooted skin cells into stem cells last year
that meant that you can take the stuff right here and turn it into almost anything in your body
and this is becoming common it's moving very quickly it's moving in a whole series of places
us of a certain age grew up expecting that by now we would have rosie the robot from the jetsons in our house and all we've got is a
the other one ran on flat threads
if you don't have a flat world that's not good
which is why the robot 's we're designing today
this is boston dynamics bigdog
you're talking to somebody on the other side of the wall and when you don't know if that thing is human or animal that's when computers have reached human intelligence this is not an intelligence turing rest but this is as close as you can get to a physical turing test
these are not the only interesting robots you've also got flies the size of flies that are being made by robert wood at harvard
in the last olympics this gentleman who had several world records in the special olympics tried to run in the normal
the only issue with oscar pistorius is he was born without bones in the lower part of his
he came within about a second of qualifying
he sued to be allowed to run and he won the
but didn't qualify by time
and as you bring these trends together and as you think of what it means to take people who are profoundly deaf who can now begin to hear
remember the evolution of hearing aids right i mean your grandparents had these great big cones and then your parents had these odd boxes that would squawk at odd times during dinner
in ten or fifteen machine generations they will and these are machine generations not human
about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and i can they'll be able to hear
maybe how bats sing or how whales talk or how dogs talk and other types of tonal scales they'll be able to focus their hearing they'll be able to increase the sensitivity decrease the sensitivity do a series of things that we can't do and the same thing is happening in
this is a group in germany that's beginning to engineer eyes so that people who are blind can begin to see light and dark
do stuff you and i can't do
all of these things are coming together
and it's a particularly important thing to understand as we worry about the flames of the present
to keep an eye on the future
and of course the future
there have actually been twenty two species of hominids that have been around
it is common for hominids
and that's the reason why as you look at the hominid fossil record and heildelbergensis
and heildelbergensis and floresiensis and neanderthals
and homo sapiens all overlap
the common state of affairs is to have overlapping versions of hominids not one
and as you think of the implications of that here 's a brief history of the universe the universe was created thirteen point seven billion years ago and then you created all the stars and all the planets and all the galaxies and all the milky ways and then you created earth about four point five billion years ago
and then you got life about four billion years ago
that would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint
so if that's not the purpose of the universe then what's next
i think what we're going to see is we're going to see a different species of hominid
we're going to move from a homo sapiens into a homo evolutis
and i think this isn't one thousand years out i think most of us are going to glance at it and our grandchildren are going to begin to
and a homo evolutis brings together these three trends into a hominid that takes direct and deliberate control over the evolution of his species and other species
would be the ultimate reboot
