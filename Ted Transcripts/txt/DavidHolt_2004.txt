this is aunt zip from sodom north carolina she was one hundred and five years old when i took this picture she was always saying things that made me stop and think like
time may be a great healer but it ain't no beauty specialist
she said be good to your friends why without them you'd be a total stranger
black eyed susie hey hey black eyed susie
she couldn't sing much couldn't play any more and i'd pull her out on the front porch
down below there was her grandson plowing the tobacco field with a mule
double outhouse over here on the side
sing this old song she didn't have a whole lot of energy so in the ocean
in the ocean the
around she'll make a living she'll cook blackjacks
this is ralph stanley when i was going to college at university of california at santa barbara in the college of creative studies taking majors in biology and art
came from africa along with the banjo it's called claw hammer style that he had learned from his mother and grandmother
he said well you can go back to clinch mountain where i'm from or asheville or mount airy north carolina some place that has a lot of music because a lot of old people still living that play that old style
so i went back that very summer i just fell in love with the culture and the people and
you know i came back to school i finished my degrees and told my parents i wanted to be a banjo player
you can imagine how excited they were so i
those last few pictures were of ray hicks who just passed away last year he was one of the great american folk tale tellers the old jack tales that he had learned
it was really wonderful and he lived in that house that his great grandfather had built no running water no electricity a wonderful wonderful guy
and you can look at more pictures i've actually got a website that's got a bunch of photos that i've done of some of the other folks i didn't get a chance to show you
this instrument came up in those pictures it's called the mouth bow it is definitely the first stringed instrument ever in the world and still played in the southern mountains the
when the yankees saw them
fifty four i guess it was we were driving in the car outside of gatesville texas where i grew up
early part of my life outside of gatesville we were coming back from the grocery store my mom was driving my brother and i were in the back seat we were really mad at my mom we looked out the window we were surrounded by thousands of acres of cotton fields
just been to the grocery store and my mom
the jar of ovaltine that had the coupon for the captain midnight decoder ring in it and buddy that made us
my mom didn't put up with much either and she was driving and she said you boys you think you can have anything you want you don't know how hard it is to earn money
your dad works so hard you think money grows on trees you've never worked a day in your lives you boys make me so mad you're going to get a job this summer she pulled the car
i stepped out of the car we were standing on the edge of thousands of acres of cotton there were about a hundred black folks out there picking my mom grabbed us by the shoulders she marched us out in the field she went up to
two little boys never worked
would you put them to work well that must have seemed like a funny idea to that foreman put these two middle class little white boys out in a cotton field in august in texas it's hot
so he gave us each a cotton sack about ten feet long about that big around and we started picking now cotton is soft but the outside of the plant is just full of she wasn't going to
well the foreman could see he was in over his head i guess he kind of just snuck up behind us and he sang out in a i
don't want it to leave don't
all around as people started singing
good news good news chariot 's coming good news chariot 's coming good news chariot 's
i had never heard anything like that in our whole lives it was
we sat there all day picking cotton without complaining without crying while they sang things like oh mary don't you weep don't
about a quarter of a bag
but the foreman was kind enough to give us each a check for a dollar but my mother would never let us cash it i'm fifty seven still have the check
now my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work
i never ever wanted to work that hard again
but i also learned that some people in this world do have to work that hard every day and that was an eye opener and i also learned
that a great song can make hard work go a little easier and it also can bring the group together in a way that nothing else can
just a little eight year old boy that day when my mama put me out of the car in that hot texas cotton field i wasn't even
of music not even aware of it but that day in the cotton field out there picking when those people started singing i realized i was in the very heart of real music and that's where i've wanted to be i
i know
good news good news chariot 's coming good a
a few years ago but i sort of remembered this story and i told it at a concert
my mom was in the audience
something i set that whole thing
is the steel guitar it's an american made instrument it was originally made by the dopyera brothers who later on made the dobro which is a wood bodied instrument with a metal cone for
the sound comes from it's usually played flat on your lap it was made to play hawaiian music back in the nineteen twenties before they had electric guitars trying to make a loud guitar
and then african american folks figured out you could take a broken bottle neck just like that a nice merlot works very well that wine we had yesterday would have been perfect
this instrument pretty much saved my
and it was the most it almost took me out it almost took me out of this world
and i think i learned a lot about what happiness was by going through such unbelievable grief
lists because i was ready to go i was ready to check out of this world and you know at the top of the list of course were jenny and my son zeb
my parents i didn't want to hurt them but then when i thought about it beyond that it was very simple things i didn't care about
had a radio show i have a radio show on public radio riverwalk i didn't care about that i didn't care about awards or money or anything nothing nothing
on the list it would be stuff like seeing the daffodils bloom in the spring the smell of new mown hay catching a wave and bodysurfing
neighbors just gave me one of these things make that connection
make that connection this is
this is that
if you want to talk about it you know what i always do
sometimes i think it's better your funky mood
your funky mood you
but i got some medicine
and we moved across the street from michael and john whitney they were about my age john went on and michael did too to become some of the inventors of
and one of the engineers said some day you're going to be able to put this thing in your pocket i thought damn those are going to be some big pants so that christmas
got time for this that christmas i got the mister wizard fun o rama chemistry set well i wanted to be an inventor just like my dad so did michael his great granddad had been eli whitney the inventor of the cotton gin so
we looked in that this was a commercial chemistry set it had three chemicals we were really surprised to see sulfur potassium nitrate and
well obviously the next thing to do was build a cannon
of stuff and we put a pipe in the vice there and screwed a cap on the end of the pipe drilled a hole in the back of the pipe took some of our firecrackers pulled out the fuses tied them together put them in the back there
and down in that hole and then stuffed some of our gunpowder down that pipe and put three ball bearings on the top
we weren't stupid we put up a sheet of plywood about five feet in front of
we stood back we lit that thing and they flew out of there they went through that plywood like it was paper through the garage two of them landed in the side door of his new citroen
we tore everything down and buried it in his backyard that was pacific palisades it probably is still there back there
well my brother heard that we had made gunpowder he and his buddies they were older and they were pretty mean they said they were going to beat us up if we didn't make some gunpowder for them
we said well what are you going to do with it they said we're going to melt it down and make rocket fuel
sure we'll make you a big
so we made them a big batch and it was in my now we'd just moved here we'd just moved to california mom had redone the kitchen mom was gone that day we had a pie tin it became chris berquist 's job to do the melting down
no hair no eyelashes no
there were big welts all over my mom 's kitchen cabinet the air was the just full of black smoke she came home she took that chemistry set away and we never saw it again
but we thought of it often because every time she'd cook tuna surprise it made tasted faintly of gunpowder
so i like to invent things too and i think i'll close put my set with something i invented a good while back
that time drum triggers were new
and so i put them all together and sewed twelve of them in this suit
i showed you some of the hambone rhythms yesterday i'm going to be doing some of the same ones
now the drum triggers go out my tail here into the drum machine
and they can make various
so let me put them all together and also i can change the sounds by stepping on this pedal right here and
