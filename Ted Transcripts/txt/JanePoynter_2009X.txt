of living inside two biospheres of course we all here in this room live in biosphere one
so what did i learn well here i am inside biosphere two making a pizza
so i am harvesting the wheat in order to make the dough and then of course i have to milk the goats and feed the goats in order to make the cheese it took me four months in biosphere two to make a pizza here in biosphere one well it takes me about two minutes because i pick up the phone and i call and say hey can you deliver the pizza so biosphere two
was essentially a three acre entirely sealed miniature world that i lived in for two years and twenty minutes
so we had our own miniature rainforest a private beach with a coral reef we had
back in the mid eighty s when we were designing biosphere two we had to ask ourselves some pretty basic questions i mean what is a biosphere back then yes i guess we all know now that it is essentially the sphere of life around the earth right well you have to get a little more specific than that if you 're going to build one
and so we decided that what it really is is that it is entirely materially closed that is nothing goes in or out at all no material
and energetically open which is essentially what planet earth is
the doctors were incredibly concerned that he was going to succumb to some dreadful toxin or that his lungs were going to get choked with bacteria or something fungus but of course none of that happened
and over the ensuing few years there were great sagas about designing biosphere two but by one thousand nine hundred and ninety one we finally had this thing built and it was time for us to go in and give it a go we needed to know big questions
and we wanted to know this both for being able to go somewhere else in the universe if we were going to go to mars for instance would we take a biosphere with us to live in it we also wanted to know
one of the biospherians called it garden of eden on top of an aircraft carrier and then also we had the human habitat of course with the laboratories and all of that
this is the agriculture it was essentially an organic farm
at that moment i became part of that biosphere and i don 't mean that in an abstract sense i mean it rather literally when i breathed out my co two fed the sweet potatoes that i was growing
and we ate an awful lot of the sweet potatoes
when it came to our atmosphere however it wasn 't that much of a joke over the long term because it turned out that we were losing oxygen
quite a lot of oxygen and we knew that we were losing co two and so we were working to sequester carbon good lord we know that term now we were growing plants like crazy we were taking their biomass storing them in the basement growing plants going around around around trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere
we were trying to stop carbon from going into the atmosphere we stopped irrigating our soil as much as we could we stopped tilling so that we could prevent greenhouse gasses from going into the air
and i tell you when you lose a lot of oxygen and our oxygen went down quite far it went from twenty one percent down to fourteen point two percent my goodness do you feel dreadful
i mean we were dragging ourselves around the biosphere and we had sleep apnea at night so you 'd wake up gasping with breath
at the end of the two years when we came out we were elated because in fact
people on the other hand was a different subject we were
people stink we stink of
i had no idea what was in my food where it came from i didn 't even recognize half the names in most of the food that i was eating in fact i would stand for hours in the aisles of shops reading all the names on all of the things people must have thought i was nuts it was really quite
of where i was in this big biosphere in this big biosphere that we all live in in biosphere two i totally understood that i had a huge impact on my biosphere everyday and it had an impact on me very viscerally very literally so i went about my business
and one of the things we did was try to figure out how small can you make these biospheres and what can you do with them and so we sent one onto the mir space station we had one on the shuttle and one on the international space station for sixteen months where we managed to produce the first organisms to go through
complete multiple life cycles in space really pushing the envelope of understanding how malleable our life systems are
and i 'm also proud to announce that you 're getting a sneak preview on friday we 're going to announce that we 're actually forming a team to develop a system to grow plants on the moon which is going to be pretty fun and the legacy of that is a system that we were designing an entirely sealed system to grow plants to grow on mars
and part of that is that we had to model very rapid circulation of co two and oxygen and water through this plant system as a result of that modeling i ended up in all places
eritrea formerly part of ethiopia is one of those places that is astonishingly beautiful incredibly stark and i have no understanding of how people eke out a living there it is so dry this is what i saw
but this is also what i saw i saw a company that had taken seawater and sand and they were growing
it was astonishing they were also producing mangroves in a plantation
and the mangroves were providing wood and honey and leaves for the animals
so that they could produce milk and whatnot like we had in the biosphere and all of it was coming from this shrimp farms
they had created an industrial ecosystem of a sense i was there because i was actually modeling the mangrove portion for a carbon credit program under the u n kyoto protocol system
and understand its interactions with the entire earth and put your project in that context around the
we 're in the process of transforming from this to what i would call a biophilic society one where we learn to nurture society now it may not seem like it
and i think often times people get lost in that they go but how
this was my backyard very early on when i bought my property and in arizona of course everybody puts gravel down and they like to keep everything beautifully raked and they keep all the leaves away and on sunday morning the neighbors leaf blower comes out and i want to throttle them
and i threw away my rake and
all of the leaves fall from the trees that i have on my property and over time essentially what have i been doing i 've been building topsoil and so now all the birds come in and i have hawks and i have an oasis
this is what happens every spring for six weeks six to eight weeks i have this flush of green oasis this is actually in a riparian area and all of tucson could be like this if everybody would just revolt and throw away the rake the small stuff counts
the industrial revolution and prometheus has given us this the ability to light up the world
it has also given us this the ability to look at the world from the outside now we may not all have another biosphere that we can run to and compare it to this biosphere
but we can look at the world and try to understand where we are in its context and how we choose to interact
to you take a deep breath
the yogis had it right
and as you breathe think about what is in your breath
there perhaps is the co two from the person sitting next door to you
maybe there is a little bit of oxygen from some algae on the beach not far from here
it also connects us in time
there may be some carbon in your breath from the dinosaurs
