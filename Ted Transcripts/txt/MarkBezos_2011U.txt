new york i am the head of development for a non profit called robin hood when i 'm not fighting poverty i 'm fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company now in our town where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action
when i found the captain he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner who was surely having one of the worst days of her life
here it was the middle of the night she was standing outside in the pouring rain under an umbrella in her pajamas barefoot while her house was in flames
the other volunteer who had arrived just before me let 's call him lex luther
got to the captain first and was asked to go inside
and save the homeowner 's dog the dog i was stunned with jealousy here was some lawyer or money manager who for the rest of his life gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature
just because he beat me by five seconds well i was next the captain waved me over he said bezos i need you to go into the house i need you to go upstairs past the fire and i need you to get this woman a pair of shoes into the master bedroom
to get a pair of shoes now i know what you 're thinking but i 'm no hero i carried my payload
back downstairs where i met my nemesis and the precious dog by the front door
we took our treasures outside to the homeowner where not surprisingly his received much more attention than did mine a few weeks later the department received a letter from the homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort
basis and you know what i 've learned they all matter so as i look around this room at people who either have achieved or are on their way to achieving remarkable levels of success i would offer this reminder don 't wait
