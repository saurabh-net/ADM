and i say that sincerely partly because need that
i flew on air force two for eight years
now i have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane
what that's been like for me
it's a true story every bit of this is true
soon after tipper and i left the
i looked in the rearview mirror and
all of a sudden it just hit me there was no motorcade back there
you've heard of phantom limb pain
this was a rented ford taurus
she took our order and then went to the couple in the booth next to us and she lowered her a series of
a series of the very next day
but what it turned out to be was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services
the story began former vice president al gore announced in nigeria yesterday my wife tipper and i have opened a low cost family
shoney 's and we are running it ourselves
tipper was saying one more burger with fries talk about
on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on what can you
do about the climate crisis i want to start with
show some new images and i'm going to recapitulate just four or five now the slide show i update the slide show
every time i give it i add new images because i learn more about it every time i give it it's like beachcombing you know every time the tide comes in and out you find some more shells
just in the last two days we got the new temperature records in january this is just for the united states of america historical average for january is thirty one degrees last month was thirty nine
point five degrees now i know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment
but these are the recapitulation slides and then i'm going to go into new material about what you can do but i wanted to elaborate on a couple of these
first of all this is where we're projected to go with the u s contribution to global warming under business as usual
a cost it's a profit the sign is wrong it's not negative it's positive these are investments that pay for themselves but they are also very effective in deflecting our path
cars and trucks i talked about that in the slideshow but i want you to put it in perspective it's an easy visible
target of concern and it should be but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks
cars and trucks are very significant and we have the lowest standards in the world and so we should address that but it's part of the puzzle
other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks
shows it carbon capture and sequestration that's what ccs stands for is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to
to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe not quite there yet ok now what can you do
reduce emissions in your home most of these expenditures are also profitable
a hybrid use light rail figure out some of the other options that are much better it's important
be a green consumer you have choices with everything you buy between things that have a harsh effect or a much less harsh effect on the global
climate crisis consider this make a decision to live a carbon neutral life those of you who are good at branding i'd love to get your advice and help
on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people it is easier than you think it really is
a lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy reduce your carbon
and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced and what it means
is elaborated at climatecrisis net there is a carbon calculator
on this arcane science of carbon calculation to construct a consumer friendly carbon calculator
you can very precisely calculate what your co two emissions are and then you will be given options to reduce
and by the time the movie comes out in may this will be updated to two point zero and we will have click through purchases of offsets
next consider making your business carbon neutral again some of us have done that and it's not as hard as you think
community invest sustainably majora mentioned this listen if you have invested money with managers
who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance don't ever again complain about quarterly report ceo it talk about it
the movie comes out the movie is a movie version of the slideshow i gave two nights ago except it's a lot more
and it comes out in may
many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it
consider sending somebody to nashville pick well
and i am personally going to train people to give
this slideshow re purposed with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach and it's
not just the slides it's what they mean and it's how they link together and so i'm going to be conducting a course this summer
for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse in communities all across the country and we're
use copyrights so that young people can remix it
we need republicans as well this used to be a bipartisan issue and i know that in this group it really is become politically active make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work
support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions global warming pollution and trading
as long as the united states is out of the world system it's not a closed system once it becomes a closed system it's a closed system
you will have legal liability if you do not
urge your ceo to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided the market will work to solve this problem
if we can accomplish this
and in our modern country the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once
let 's rebrand global warming as many of you have suggested i like climate crisis instead of climate collapse
but again those of you who are good at branding i need your help on this that's really true
that's really true you very
