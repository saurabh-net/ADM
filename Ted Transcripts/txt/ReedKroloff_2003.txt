to be new at ted it's like being the last high school virgin you know that all of the cool people are there doing it
and you're on the outside you're at home you're like the raspyni brothers where you've got your balls in cold water
and you just play with your fingers all day and then you get invited and you're on the inside and
it's everything you hoped it would be it's exciting and there's music playing all of the time and then suddenly it's over
and it's only taken five minutes and you want to go back and do it again but i really appreciate being here and thank you chris and also thank you deborah patton for making this possible so anyway
talk about architecture a little bit within the subject of creation and optimism and if you put creation and optimism together you've got two choices that you can talk about you can talk about creationism
any kind of conversation about architecture which is in fact what you were just talking about what was going on here setting up ted small scale architecture at the present time can't really
the world trade center and what's been going on there what it means to us because
if architecture is what i believe it to be which is the built form of our cultural ambitions
what do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify
a situation that represents somebody else's cultural ambitions relative to us and our own opportunity to make something new there
and made it a subject for common conversation i don't remember in my twenty year career of practicing and writing about architecture a time when five
sat me down at a table and asked me very serious questions about zoning fire exiting safety concerns and whether carpet burns
you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way and so now we're going to think about architecture in a very different way we're going to think about it like this how many of you saw usa today today
there it is looks like that there's the world trade center site on the front cover they've made a selection they've chosen a project by daniel
the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture child prodigy piano player he started on the squeeze box and moved to a little more serious issue a bigger instrument and now to an even larger instrument upon which to
his particular brand of de constructivist magic as you see here he was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition after six previous
firms struck out with things that were so stupid and banal that even the city of new york was forced to go oh i'm really sorry we screwed up
can we do this again from the top except use some people with a vague hint of talent instead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time
hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities let 's bring in some real architects for a change and so we got this or we had a choice of that oh stop clapping
it's too late that is gone this was a scheme by a team called think a new york based team and then there was that one which was the libeskind scheme this one
this is going to be the new world trade center a giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it now i don't know what you think but i think this is a pretty stupid decision
because what you've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever
but that's what we're going to do but i want you to think about these things in terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that american architecture represents and that these two things talk about very specifically
and that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects in trying to decide whether we want architecture from the kind of technocratic
chemical or something that's more of a romantic solution now i don't mean romantic as in this is a nice place to take someone on a date
i mean romantic in the sense of there are things larger and grander than us so in the american tradition the difference between the technocratic and the romantic would be the difference between
as a really truly technocratic solution a bowing to the in jefferson 's time current popular philosophy of
now which would you rather be a grid or manifest destiny manifest destiny
a big deal it sounds big it sounds important it sounds solid it sounds american ballsy serious male
and that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time i mean it goes on in our private lives too every single day we all want to go out and buy an audi tt don't we
everyone here must own one or at least they craved one the moment they saw one and then they hopped in it turned the little electronic key rather than the real key
zipped home on their new superhighway and drove straight into a garage that looks like a tudor castle
why why why do you want to do that why do we all want to do that i even owned a tudor thing once myself
in our nature to go ricocheting back and forth between this technocratic solution
and a larger sort of more romantic image of where we are so we're going to go straight into this can i have the lights off for a moment
i'm going to talk about two architects very very briefly that represent the current split architecturally between these two traditions of a technocratic or technological solution
and a romantic solution and these are two of the top architectural practices in the united states today one very young one a little more mature this is the work of a firm called shop and what you're seeing here
is their isometric drawings of what will be a large scale camera obscura in a public park does everybody know what a camera obscura is
yeah it's one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world it's sort of a little movie without any moving parts and projects it on a page and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it
this is just the outlines of it and you can see does it look like a regular building no it's actually non orthogonal it's not up and down square rectangular anything like that that you'd see in a normal shape of a building
the computer revolution the technocratic technological revolution has allowed us to jettison normal shaped buildings traditionally shaped buildings in favor of non orthogonal buildings such as this what's interesting about it is not the shape what's interesting about it is how it's made
how it's made a brand new way to put buildings together something called mass customization no it is not an oxymoron
what makes the building expensive in the traditional sense is making individual parts custom that you can't do over and over again that's why we all live in developer houses they all want to save money by building the same thing five hundred times that's because it's cheaper
works by an architect feeding into a computer a program that says manufacture these parts the computer then talks to a machine a computer operated machine a cad cam machine
that can make a zillion different changes at a moment 's notice because the computer is just a machine it doesn't care it's manufacturing the parts it doesn't see any excess cost it doesn't spend any extra time
it's not a laborer it's simply an electronic lathe so the parts can all be cut at the same time meanwhile
send a set of assembly instructions like you used to get when you were a child when you bought little models that said bolt a to b and c to d
and so what the builder will get is every single individual part that has been custom manufactured off site and delivered on a truck to the site
to that builder and a set of these instruction manuals just simple bolt a to b and they will be able to put them together here 's the little drawing that tells them how that works
and that's what will happen in the end you're underneath it looking up into the lens of the camera obscura lest you think this is all fiction lest you think this is all fantasy or romance
young architects summer series and they said well it's summer what do you do in the summer you go to the beach and when you go to the beach what do you get you get sand dunes so let 's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana
so they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune they took photographs they fed the photographs into their computer program and that computer program shaped a sand dune
and then took that sand dune shape and turned it into at their instructions using standard software with slight modifications a set of instructions for pieces of wood
and those are the pieces of wood those are the instructions these are the pieces and here 's a little of that blown up what you can see is there's about six different colors and each color represents a type of wood to be cut a piece of wood to be cut
all of which were delivered by flat bed on a truck and hand assembled in forty eight hours by a team of eight people
only one of whom had ever seen the plans before only one of whom had ever seen the plans before and here comes dunescape coming up out of the courtyard
and there it is fully built there are only sixteen different pieces of wood
it's a great place for parties it was it was only up for six weeks it's got little dressing rooms and cabanas where lots of interesting things went on all summer long
now lest you think that this is only for the light at heart or just temporary installations this is the same firm working at the world trade center
and the redevelopment of the west side they were asked to design replace that bridge in six weeks building it including all of the parts manufactured
and they were able to do it that was their design using that same computer modeling system and only five or six really different kinds of parts a couple of struts like this some exterior cladding material
and a very simple framing system that was all manufactured off site and delivered by truck they were able to create that
you don't need any overhead lighting so the neighbors don't complain about metal highlight lighting in their face
here it is going across and there down the other side and you get the same kind of grandeur now let me show you quickly the opposite if i may woo pretty
to seduce you into something that you can do into something that will please you something that will lift your spirits something that will make you feel as if are in another world such as his nobu restaurant in new york
which is supposed to take you from the clutter of new york city to the simplicity of japan and the elegance of japanese
when it's all said and done it's got to look like seaweed said the owner
or his restaurant pod in philadelphia pennsylvania i want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white every single surface of this restaurant is white
the reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting it's all about sensuality it's all about transforming watch this i'm not touching any buttons ladies and gentlemen this is happening by itself
it transforms through the magic of lighting it's all about sensuality it's all about touch rosa mexicano restaurant where he transports us to the shores of acapulco up on the upper west side with this wall
cliff divers who there you go like that let 's see it one more time okay just to make sure that you've enjoyed it
and finally it's about comfort it's about making you feel good in places that you wouldn't have felt good before it's about bringing nature to the inside in the guardian tower of new york converted to a w union square i'm sorry i'm rushing
where we had to bring in the best horticulturists in the world to make sure that the interior of this dragged the garden space of the court garden of the union square into the building itself
this is a wine buying experience simplified by color and taste fizzy fresh soft luscious juicy smooth big and sweet wines
all explained to you by color and texture on the wall and finally it's about entertainment as in his headquarters for the
