i coined my own definition of success in nineteen hundred and thirty four when i was teaching at a high school in south bend indiana being a little bit
expected their youngsters to get an a or a b they thought a c was all right for the neighbors children because the neighbors children are all average
but they weren't satisfied when their own would make the teacher feel that they had failed or the youngster had failed and that's not right the good lord in his infinite wisdom didn't create us all equal as far as intelligence is concerned any more than we're equal for
not everybody could earn an a or a b and i didn't like that way of judging it i did know know how the alumni of various schools back in the thirties judged coaches and athletic teams
you won them all you were considered to be reasonably successful not completely because i found out we had a number of years
but it seemed that we didn't win each individual game by the margin that some of our alumni had predicted and
but that was true back in the thirties so i understood that
but i didn't like it and i didn't agree with it and i wanted to come up with something that i hoped could make me a better teacher and give the youngsters under my supervision whether it be in athletics or in the english classroom something to which to aspire other than just a higher mark
in the classroom or more points in some athletic contest i thought about that for quite a spell and i wanted to come up with my own definition i thought that might help
and i knew how mister webster defined it as the accumulation of material possessions or the attainment of a position of power or prestige or something
of that sort worthy accomplishments perhaps but in my opinion not necessarily indicative of success so i wanted to come up with something
southern indiana and dad tried to teach me and my brothers that you should never try to be better than someone else i'm sure at the time he did that i didn't it
well somewhere i guess in the hidden recesses of my mind it popped out years later never try to be better than someone else always learn from others never cease trying to be the best you can be that's under your
simple verse that said at god 's footstool to confess a poor soul knelt and bowed his head i failed he cried the master said thou didst thy best
that is success from those things and one other perhaps i coined my own definition of success which is peace of mind attained only through self satisfaction in knowing
you made the effort to do the best of which you're capable i believe that's true if you make the effort to to the best of which you're capable try and improve the situation
that exists for you i think that's success and i don't think others can judge that i think it's like character and reputation your reputation is what you are perceived to be your character is what you really are and i think
much more important than what you are perceived to be you'd hope they'd both be good but they won 't necessarily be the same well
that was my idea that i was going to try to get across to the youngsters i ran across other things i love to teach and it was mentioned
the previous speaker that i enjoy poetry and i dabble in it a bit and love it there are some things that helped me i think
be better than i would have been i know i'm not what i ought to be not what i should be but i think i'm better than i would have been if i hadn't run across certain things one was just a little verse that said no
written word no spoken plea can teach our youth what they should be nor all the books on all the shelves
what the teachers are themselves
that made an impression on me in the nineteen thirties and i tried to use that
more or less in my teaching whether it be in sports or whether it be in the english classroom i
our farm home and dad would read poetry to us so i always liked it and about the same time i ran across this one verse i ran across another one someone
lady teacher why she taught and she after some time she said she wanted to think about that then she came up and said they ask me why i teach and i reply where could i find such splendid company
a statesman strong unbiased wise another daniel webster silver tongued a doctor sits beside him whose quick steady hand may mend a bone or stem the life blood 's flow
and there a builder upward rise the arch of a church he builds wherein that minister may speak the word of god and lead a stumbling soul to touch the christ and all about
gathering of teachers farmers merchants laborers those who work and vote and build and plan and pray into a great tomorrow and i may say
i may not see the church or hear the word or eat the food their hands may grow but yet again i may and later i may say i knew him once
and he was weak or strong or bold or proud or gay i knew him once but then he was a boy they ask me why i teach and i reply where could i find such splendid company
and i believe the teaching profession it's true you have so many youngsters and i've got to think of my youngsters at ucla thirty some attorneys eleven
dentists and doctors many many teachers and other professions and that gives you a great deal of
pleasure to see them go on i always tried to make the youngsters feel that they're there to get an education number one basketball was second because it was paying their way
and they do need a little time for social activities but you let social activities take a little precedence over the other two and you're not going to have any very long so that was the ideas that i tried to get across
to the youngsters under my supervision i had three rules pretty much that i stuck with practically all the time i'd learned these prior to coming to ucla and i decided they were very important one was never be late never be late
later on i said certain things i had players if we're leaving for somewhere had to be neat and clean there was a time when i made them
jackets and shirts and ties then i saw our chancellor coming to school in denims and turtlenecks and i thought not right for me to keep this other so i let them just they had to be neat and clean
i had one of my greatest players that you probably heard of bill walton he came to catch the bus we were leaving for somewhere to play and we wasn't clean and neat so
i wouldn't let him go he couldn't get on the bus he had to go home and get cleaned up to get to the airport so i
was a stickler for that i believed in that i belive in time very important i believe you should be on time but i felt at practice for example we start on time we close on time the youngsters didn't have to
the profession most of them are young you know and probably newly married and i tell them don 't run practices late because you'll go home in a bad mood and that's not good for a young married man to go home
so i did believe on time i believe starting on time and i believe closing on time
and another one i had was not one word of profanity one word of profanity and you are out of here for the day if i see it in a game you're going to come out and sit on the bench the third one was never criticize a
i didn't want that i used to tell them i was paid to do that that's my job i'm paid to do it pitifully poor but i am paid to do it not like the coaches today for gracious sakes no
a little different than it was in my day those were three things that i stuck with pretty closely all the time and
those actually came from my dad that's what he tried to teach me and my brothers one time i came up with
pyramid eventually that i don't have the time to go on that but that helped me i think become a better teacher
something like this i had blocks in the pyramid and the cornerstones being industriousness and enthusiasm working hard and enjoying what you're doing coming up to the apex
you have to have patience to we want things to happen we talk about our youth being impatient a lot and they are
not just give it word service believe that things will work out as they should providing we do what we should i think our tendency is to hope
that things will turn out the way we want them to much of the time but we don't do the things that are necessary to make those things become reality
i worked on this for some fourteen years and i think it helped me become a better teacher but it all revolved around that original definition
of success you know a number of years ago there was a major league baseball umpire by the name of george moriarty he spelled moriarty with only one i i'd never seen that before but he did
big league baseball players they're very perceptive about those things and they noticed he had only one i in his name you'd be surprised how many also told him that that was one more than he had in his head
but he wrote something that i think he did while i tried to do in this pyramid he called it the road ahead or the road behind sometimes i think the fates must grin as we denounce them and insist the only reason we
the ancient claim we win or lose within ourselves the shining trophies on our shelves can never win tomorrow 's game you and i know deeper down there's always a chance to win the crown but when we fail to give our best
we simply haven't met the test of giving all and saving none until the game is really won of showing what is meant by
not afraid to fall if bravely we have given all for who can ask more of a man than giving all within his span giving all it seems to me is not so far from victory
best of your ability and no one can do more than that i tried to get across too that my opponents don't tell you you never heard me mention winning
never mention winning my idea is that you can lose when you outscore somebody in a game
and you can win when you're outscored i've felt that way on certain occasions at various times and i just wanted them to be able to hold their head
after a game i used to say that when a game is over and you see somebody that didn't know the outcome i hope they couldn't tell by your actions whether you outscored an opponent or the opponent outscored you
that's what really matters if you make effort to do the best you can regularly the results will be about what they should be not necessary to what you would want them to be but they will be about what they should and only you will know whether you can do that
and that's what i wanted from them more than anything else and as time went by and i learned more about other things i think it worked a little better
as far as the results but i wanted the score of a game to be the byproduct of these other things and not the end itself i believe it was
one great philosopher said no no cervantes cervantes said the journey is better than the end and i like that
i think that is it's getting there sometimes when you get there there's almost
a decent job during the week
it's getting the players to get that self satisfaction in knowing that they'd made the effort to do the best of which they are capable
sometimes i'm asked who was the best player i had or the best teams i can never answer that
about that and they said suppose that you in some way could could make the perfect player what would you want
that defense usually wins championships and would work hard on defense but i'd want one that would play offense too i'd want him to be unselfish and look for the pass first and not shoot all the time
i wanted them to be able to shoot from the outside i wanted them to be good inside too
rebound well at both ends too and why not just take someone like
keith wilkes and let it go at that he had
not the only one but he was one that i
in that particular category because i think he made the effort to become the best i mention in my book they call me
two players that gave me great satisfaction that came as close as i think anyone i ever had to reach their full potential one was was conrad burke
and one was doug mcintosh when i saw them as freshmen on our freshmen team we didn't have freshmen couldn't play varsity when i taught and
our varsity must be pretty miserable if he 's good enough to make it and you know one of them was a starting player for
the other was his next year he played thirty two minutes in a national championship game did a tremendous job for us and the next year
a starting player on the national championship team and here i thought he'd never play a minute when he was so those are the things that give you
great joy and great satisfaction to see one neither one of those youngsters could shoot very well but they had outstanding shooting percentages because they didn't force it and neither one could jump very well
but they get kept good position and so they did well rebounding they remembered that
every shot that is taken they assumed would be missed i've had too many that stand around and wait to see if it's missed then they go and it's too late somebody else is in there ahead of
they weren't very quick but they played good position kept in good balance and so they played pretty good defense for us so they had qualities that they came close to as close to reaching possibly their full potential
as any players i ever had so i consider them to be as successful as lewis alcindor or bill walton
players have i rambled enough i was told that when he makes his appearance i was supposed to shut up
