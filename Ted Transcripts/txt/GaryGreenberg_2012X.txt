i 've found after doing this for many many years that there 's a magical world behind reality and that can be seen directly through a microscope
but to really see the details of the bee and really appreciate what it is you have to look a little bit closer
so that 's just the eye of the bee with a microscope and now all of a sudden you can see that the bee has thousands of individual eyes called ommatidia and they actually have sensory hairs in their eyes so they know when they 're right up close to something because they can 't see in stereo
as we go smaller here is a human hair a human hair is about the smallest thing that the eye can see it 's about a tenth of a millimeter
and as we go smaller again about ten times smaller than that is a cell so you could fit ten human cells across the diameter of a human hair
so when we would look at cells this is how i really got involved in biology and science is by looking at living cells in the microscope when i first saw living cells in a microscope i was absolutely enthralled and amazed at what they looked like so if you look at the cell like that from the immune system
if you take some heart cells from an animal and put it in a dish they 'll just sit there and beat that 's their job every cell has a mission in life and these cells the mission is to move blood around our body
that 's a micron or a micrometer and we go all the way down to here to a nanometer and an angstrom now an angstrom is the size of the diameter of a hydrogen atom that 's how small that is and microscopes that we have today can actually see individual
atoms so these are some pictures of individual atoms each bump here is an individual atom this is a ring of cobalt atoms so this whole world the nano world this area in here is called the nano world
and the nano world the whole micro world that we see there 's a nano world that is wrapped up within that and the whole and that is the world of molecules and atoms but i want to talk about this larger world
the world of the micro world so if you were a little tiny bug living in a flower what would that flower look like if the flower was this big it wouldn 't look or feel like anything that we see when we look at a flower so if you look at this flower here and you 're a little bug if you 're on that surface of that flower
that 's what the terrain would look like the petal of that flower looks like that so the ant is kind of crawling over these objects and if you look a little bit closer at this stigma and the stamen here this is the style of that flower and you notice that it 's got these little these are like little jelly like
things that are what are called spurs these are nectar spurs so this little ant that 's crawling here it 's like it 's in a little willy wonka land it 's like a little disneyland for them it 's not like what we see these are little bits of
individual grain of pollen there and there
and here is a what you see as one little yellow dot of pollen when you look in a microscope it 's actually made of thousands
the honey that we eat here 's a close up
so that 's thousands of little grains of pollen there and there 's the pistil there and these are the little things called trichomes and that 's what makes the flower give a fragrance and plants actually communicate with one another through their fragrances
i want to talk about something really ordinary just ordinary sand i became interested in sand about ten years ago when i first saw sand from maui and in fact this is a little bit of sand from maui so sand is about
a tenth of a millimeter in size each sand grain is about a tenth of a millimeter in size but when you look closer at this
an amazing array of incredible things exist in sand
and the reason that is is because in a place like this island a lot of the sand is made of biological material because the reefs provide a place where all these microscopic animals or macroscopic animals grow and when they die their shells and their teeth and their bones break up and they make grains of sand things like coral and so forth
so here 's for example a picture of sand from maui this is from lahaina and when we 're walking along a beach we 're actually walking along millions of years of biological and geological history we don 't realize it but it 's actually a record of that entire ecology
so here we see for example a sponge spicule two bits of coral here
that 's a sea urchin spine really some amazing stuff so when i first looked at this i was i thought gee this is like a little treasure trove here i couldn 't believe it and i 'd go around dissecting the little bits out and making photographs of them here 's what most of the sand in our world looks like these are quartz crystals
and feldspar so most sand in the world on the mainland is made of quartz crystal and feldspar it 's the erosion of granite rock
so mountains are built up and they erode away by water
and rain and ice and so forth and they become grains of sand
there 's some sand that 's really much more colorful these are sand from near the great lakes and you can see that it 's filled with minerals like pink garnet and green epidote all kinds of amazing stuff and if you look at different sands from different places every single beach every single place you look at sand it 's different
here 's from big sur like they 're little jewels there are places in africa where they do the mining of jewels and you go to the sand where the rivers
so every grain of sand is unique every beach is different every single grain is different there are no two grains of sand alike in the world every grain of sand is coming somewhere and going somewhere they 're like a snapshot in time
now sand is not only on earth but sand is ubiquitous throughout the universe in fact outer space is filled with sand
and that sand comes together to make our planets and the moon and you can see those in micrometeorites this is some micrometeorites that the army gave me and they get these out of the drinking wells in the south pole
and they 're quite amazing looking and these are the tiny constituents that make up the world that we live in the planets and the moon
so nasa wanted me to take some pictures of moon sand so they sent me sand from all the different landings
of the apollo missions that happened forty years ago and i started taking pictures with my three dimensional microscopes this was the first picture i took it was kind of amazing i thought it looked kind of a little bit like the moon
which is sort of interesting now the way my microscopes work is normally in a microscope you can see very little at one time so what you have to do is you have to refocus the microscope keep taking pictures and then i have a computer program that puts all those pictures together into one picture so you can see actually what it looks like
other sands when these micrometeorites come in
they vaporize and they make these fountains these microscopic fountains that go up into the i was going to say up into the air but there is no air goes sort of up and these microscopic glass beads are formed instantly and they harden and by the time they fall down back to the surface of the moon
so what i 've been trying to tell you today is things even as ordinary as a grain of sand can be truly extraordinary if you look closely and if you look from a different and a new point of view i think that this was best put by william blake when he said to see a world in a grain of sand
and a heaven in a wild flower hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour thank you
