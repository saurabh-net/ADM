do we know about the future difficult question simple answer nothing we cannot predict the future
we only can create a vision of the future how it might be a vision which reveals disruptive ideas which is inspiring and this is the most important reason which breaks the chains of common thinking there are a lot of people who created their own vision about the future for instance
today we know that this future vision didn 't come true so this is our largest airplane which we have the airbus a three hundred and eighty and it 's quite huge so a lot of people fit in there and it 's technically completely different than the vision i 've shown to you
i 'm working in a team with airbus and we have created our vision about a more sustainable future of aviation so sustainability is quite important for us which should incorporate social but as well as environmental and economic values
so we have created a very disruptive structure which mimics the design of bone or a skeleton which occurs in nature so that 's why it looks maybe a little bit weird especially to the people who deal with structures in general
but at least it 's just a kind of artwork to explore our ideas about a different future
so our children are getting larger but at the same time we are growing into different directions so
what we need is space inside the aircraft inside a very dense area
these people have different needs so we see a clear need of active health promotion especially in the case of the old people
we want to be treated as individuals we like to be productive throughout the entire travel chain and what we are doing in the future is we want to use the latest man machine interface
we want to integrate this and show this in one product
so we combined these needs with technology 's themes so for instance we are asking ourselves how can we create more light how can we bring more natural light into the airplane so this airplane has no windows anymore for example
it will be more like a living organism than just a collection of very complex technology
and then we are talking also about materials synthetic biology for example and my belief is that we will get more and more new materials which we can put into structure later on because structure is one of the key issues in aircraft design
so let 's compare the old world with the new world i just want to show you here what we are doing today so this is a bracket of an a three hundred and eighty crew rest compartment
it takes a lot of weight and it follows the classical design rules this here is an equal bracket for the same purpose it follows the design of bone the design process is completely different
at the one hand we have one point two kilos and at the other hand zero point six kilos so this technology three d printing and new design rules really help us to reduce the weight which is the biggest issue in aircraft design because it 's directly linked to greenhouse gas emissions
push this idea a little bit forward so how does nature build its components and structures so nature is very clever it puts all the information into these small building blocks which we call dna and nature builds large skeletons out of
and the same approach can be applied to technology as well so our building block is carbon nanotubes for example to create a large rivet less skeleton at the end of the
and you take this wood and make morphological optimization so you make structures sub structures which allows you to transmit electrical energy or data and now we take this material combine this with a top down approach and build bigger and bigger components
so how might the airplane of the future look so we have very different seats which adapt to the shape of the future passenger with the different anthropometrics we have social areas inside the aircraft which might turn into a place where you can play virtual golf
