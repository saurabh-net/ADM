a little bit about user generated content i'm going to tell you three stories on the way to one argument that's going to tell you a little bit about how we open user generated content up for
six this man john philip sousa traveled to this place the united states capitol to talk about this technology what he called the quote talking machines
was not a fan of the talking machines this is what he had to say these talking machines are going to ruin artistic development of music in this country when i was a boy in front of every house in the
evenings you would find young people together singing the songs of the day or the old songs today you hear these infernal machines going night and day
we will not have a vocal chord left sousa said the vocal chords will be eliminated by a process of evolution as was the tail of man when he came from the
now this is the picture i want you to focus on
this is a picture of culture
we could describe it using modern computer terminology as a kind of read write culture
it's a culture where people participate in the creation and the re creation of their culture in that sense it's read write sousa 's fear
was that we would lose
because of these quote infernal machines they would take it away
and in its place we'd have the opposite of read write culture what we could call read only culture
now as you look back
the twentieth century at least in what we think of as the quote developed world
hard not to conclude that sousa was right
never before in the history of human culture had it been as professionalized never before as concentrated never before has creativity of the millions been as effectively displaced
and displaced because of these quote infernal machines the twentieth century was that century where at least for those places we know the best
culture moved from this read write to read only existence so second
as lord blackstone described it land is protected by trespass law for most of the history of trespass law by presuming it protects the land all the way down below
that was a pretty good system for most of the history of the regulation of land until this technology came along and people began to wonder these instruments trespassers
got a chance to address that question two farmers thomas lee and
who raised chickens had a significant complaint because of these technologies the complaint was that their chickens followed the pattern of the airplanes and flew themselves into the walls
when the airplanes flew over the land and so they appealed to lord blackstone to say these airplanes were trespassing
since time immemorial the law had said you can't fly over the land without permission of the landowner
so this flight must stop
the supreme court said the doctrine protecting land all the ways to the sky has no place in the modern world otherwise
revolts at the idea common sense
a new way to spread content
and therefore a new battle over the control of the businesses that would spread
now at that time the entity the legal cartel that controlled the performance rights for most of the music that would be broadcast using these technologies was ascap
and bmi was much more democratic in the art that it would include within its repertoire including african american music for the first time in the
now ascap said they didn't care the people will revolt they predicted because the very best music was no longer available because they had shifted
to the second best public domain provided by well they didn't
well they didn't access to
okay three stories here 's the argument
in my view the most significant thing to recognize about what this internet is doing is its opportunity to revive the read write culture that
sousa romanticized digital technology is the opportunity for the revival of these vocal chords that he spoke so passionately to congress
user generated content spreading in businesses in extraordinarily valuable ways like these celebrating amateur culture
by which i don't mean amateurish culture i mean culture where people produce for the love of what they're doing and not
for when you think of what sousa romanticized in the young people together singing the songs of the day of the old songs you should recognize
access to this culture so let 's have some very few examples to get a sense of what i'm talking about here here 's something called anime music video first example taking anime captured from television re edited to music you should be
you should be jesus survives
jesus survives so this is
people taking and recreating using other people 's content using digital technologies to say things differently now the importance of this is not the technique that you've seen here
is how our kids think it is what your kids are as they increasingly understand digital technologies and their relationship
now in response to this new use of culture using digital technologies
the law has not greeted this sousa revival with very much common sense
because if copyright law at its core regulates something called copies then in the digital world the one fact we can't escape is that every single use of culture produces a copy
every single use therefore requires permission without permission you are a trespasser you're a trespasser with about as much sense as these people were
there's a growing extremism that comes from both sides in this debate in response to this conflict between the law and the use of these technologies one side
builds new technologies such as one recently announced that will enable them to automatically take down from sites like youtube
among our kids there's a growing copyright abolitionism a generation that rejects the very notion of what copyright is supposed to do
the extremism on one side begets extremism on the other a fact we should have learned many many times
over and both extremes in this debate are just wrong now the balance
that i try to fight for i as any good liberal try to fight for first by looking to the government total mistake
look first to the courts and the legislatures to try to get them to do something to make the system make more sense it failed partly because the courts are too passive partly because
the legislatures are corrupted by which i don't mean that there's bribery operating to stop real change but more the economy
to fix it so we need something
we need a different kind of solution and the solution here in my view is a private solution a solution that looks to legalize what it is to be young again and to realize the economic potential of that and that's where the
story of bmi becomes relevant because as bmi demonstrated competition here can achieve some form of balance
the same thing can happen now we don't have a public domain to draw upon now so instead what we need is
two types of changes first that artists and creators embrace the idea choose that their work be made available more freely
so for example they can say their work is available freely for non commercial this amateur type of use but not freely for any commercial use and second
we need the businesses that are building out this read write culture to embrace this opportunity expressly to enable it
so that this ecology of free content or freer content can grow on a neutral platform
they both exist simultaneously so that more free can compete with less free and the opportunity to develop the creativity in that competition can teach one the lessons of the other now
i would talk about one particular such plan that i know something about but i don't want to violate ted 's first commandment of selling so i'm not going to talk about this at all i'm instead just going to remind you
the point that bmi teaches us that artists choice
much more important much more important than business it's the point about how this connects to our kids
we have to recognize they're different from us this is us
we made mixed tapes they remix music we watched tv they make tv it is technology that has made
and as we see what this technology can do we need to recognize
the instinct the technology produces we can only criminalize it we can't stop our kids from using it we can only drive it underground we can't make our kids passive again we can only make them quote pirates and is that
good we live in this weird
age of prohibitions where in many areas of our life we live life constantly against the law ordinary people live life
against the law and that's what i we are doing to our kids they live life knowing they live it against the law
better at least for them
for opening for business thank you very much
