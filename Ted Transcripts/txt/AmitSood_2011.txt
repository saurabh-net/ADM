and she allowed me to do it and it took eighteen months a lot of fun negotiations and stories i can tell you with seventeen very interesting museums from nine countries but i 'm going to focus on the demo
i grew up in india i had a great education i 'm not complaining but i didn 't have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks and so when i started traveling and going to these museums i started learning a lot and while working at google i tried to put
so simple you come to googleartproject com you look around at all these museums here you 've got the uffizi you 've got the moma the hermitage the rijks the van gogh i 'm going to actually get to one of my favorites the metropolitan museum of art in new york two ways of going in very simple click
and bang you 're in this museum it doesn 't matter where you are bombay mexico it doesn 't really matter you move around you have fun you want to navigate around the museum open the plan up and in one click jump
thanks i haven 't come to the best part
and this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology so
this image for example has close to i think around ten billion pixels and i get a lot of people asking me
what do you get for ten billion pixels so i 'm going to try and show you what you really get for ten billion pixels you can zoom around very simply you see some fun stuff happening here i love this guy his expression is priceless but then you really want to go deep and so i started playing around and i found something going on over here
went in and i started noticing that these kids were actually beating something
i did a little research spoke to a couple of my contacts at the met and actually found out that this is a game called squall which involves beating a goose with a stick on shrove tuesday and apparently it was quite popular i don 't know why they did it but i learned something about it
now just to get really deep in you can really get to the cracks now just to give you some perspective i 'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get
the best is yet to come
so in a second so now let 's just quickly jump into
the moma again in new york so another one of my favorites the starry night now the example i showed you was all about finding details but what if you want to see brush strokes and what if you want to see how van gogh actually created this masterpiece you zoom in you really go in i 'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting and i 'm really going to get to the cracks this is
the starry night i think never seen like this before i 'm going to show you my other favorite feature there 's a lot of other stuff here but i don 't have time
this is the real cool part it 's called collections any one of you anybody doesn 't matter if you 're rich if you 're poor if you have a fancy house doesn 't matter you can go and create your own museum online create your own collection across all these images very simply you go in
and i 've created this called the power of zoom you can just zoom around this is the ambassadors
so i think in conclusion for me the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from google it doesn 't in my opinion even come from the museums i probably shouldn 't say that
it really comes from these artists and that 's been my humbling experience in this i mean i hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online and the biggest question i get asked nowadays
is did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum
