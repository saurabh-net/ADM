i thought i would talk about today is the transition from one mode of thinking about nature to another that's tracked by architecture what's interesting about architects is
we always have tried to justify beauty by looking to nature and arguably
was whether the number five or the number seven was a better proportion to think about architecture because the nose was one fifth of your head or because your head was one seventh of your body
and the reason that that was the model of beauty and of nature was because the decimal point had not been invented yet it was in the sixteenth century
and everybody had to dimension a building in terms of fractions so a room would be dimensioned as one fourth of a facade the structural dais of that might be dimensioned
