what the big wants the big being
the organization the system the country and what the small wants the individual the person and how do you bring those two things together charlie ledbetter yesterday
very articulately about this need to bring consumers to bring people into the process of creating things
and that's what i want to talk about today so bringing together the small to help facilitate and create the big
i think is something that we believe in something i believe in and something that we kind of bring to life through what we do
i call this first chapter for the brits in the room the blinding glimpse of the bleeding obvious often the good ideas are so
staring at you right in the face that you kind of miss them and i think a lot of times what we do is just sort of hold the mirror up to our clients and
to describe to them what their patient experience was and i think they were expecting they'd worked with lots of consultants before i think they were expecting some kind of hideous org chart with thousands of bubbles and
and all kinds of you know god knows whatever the first thing we actually shared with them was this your eyeballs completely dissolve
this is fifty nine seconds into the film
this is a minute fifty nine
three minutes nineteen i think something happens i think a head may appear in a second five minutes ten
five minutes ten six minutes twenty
we showed them the whole cut and they were all completely what is this and the point is
when you lie in a hospital bed all day all you do is look at the roof and it's a really shitty experience
and just putting yourself in the position of the patient this is christian who works with us at ideo he just lay in the hospital bed and kind of stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles for a really long time
that's what it's like to be a patient in the hospital and they were sort you know blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious oh my goodness so looking at the situation from the point of view of the person out
as opposed to the traditional position of the organization in was for these guys quite a revelation and so
that was a really catalytic thing for them so they snapped into action they said ok it's not about systemic change it's not about huge ridiculous things that we need to do it's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of
so we started with them prototyping some really little things that we could do to have a huge amount of impact the first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror
and we band aided it here onto a gurney a hospital trolley so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor
you could actually have a conversation with them you could kind of see them in your rear view mirror so it created a tiny human interaction very small example of something that they could do
nurses themselves sort of snapped into action said ok we embrace this what can we do the first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling
was really i showed this to my mother recently i think my mother now thinks that i'm some sort of interior decorator it's what i do for a living sort of
not particularly the world 's best design solution for those of us who are real sort of hard core designers but nonetheless a fabulous empathic solution for people
things that they started doing themselves like changing the floor going into the patient 's room so that it signified this is my room this is my personal space
was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem so you went from public space to private space and another idea again that came from one of the nurses which i love was they took traditional sort of corporate white boards then they put them on one wall of the patient 's room and they put
so that what you could actually do was go into the room and write messages to the person who was sick
which was lovely so tiny tiny tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact i thought that was a really really nice
so this is not particularly a new idea kind of seeing opportunities in things that are around you and snapping and turning them into a solution it's a history
of invention based around this i'm going to read this because i want to get these names right joan ganz cooney saw her daughter
came down on a saturday morning saw her daughter watching the test card waiting for programs to come on one morning and from that came sesame street
malcolm mclean was moving from one country to another and was wondering why it took these guys so long to get the boxes onto the ship and from
and from came velcro
and finally for the brits percy shaw this is a big british invention saw the cat 's eyes at the side of the road when he was driving home one night and from that came
a whole series of just using your eyes seeing things for the first time seeing things afresh and using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities
second one without sounding overly zen and this is a quote from the buddha finding yourself in the margins looking to the edges of things is often a really interesting place to start
we were asked by a device producer we did the palm pilot and the treo we did a lot of sexy tech
they'd seen this and they wanted a sexy piece of technology for medical diagnostics this was a device that a nurse uses when they're doing
a spinal procedure in hospital they'll ask the nurses to input data and they had this vision of the nurse kind of clicking away on this aluminum device and it all being incredibly
gadget lustish when we actually went and watched this procedure taking place and i'll explain this in a second it became very obvious that there was a human
was hold the patient 's hand to comfort them human gesture which made the fabulous two handed data
completely impossible so the thing that we designed much less sexy but much more human and practical was this
so it's not a palm pilot by any stretch of the imagination but it has a thumb scroll so you can do everything with one hand so again going back to this the idea that
a tiny human gesture dictated the design of this product and i think that's really really important
so again this idea of workarounds we use this phrase workarounds a lot sort of looking around us i was actually looking around the ted and just watching all of these kind of things happen while i've been here
follow the line in the street it's a picture in a japanese subway people consciously follow things even why we
why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence because we kind of have to we're just compelled to we don't know why but we
why do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle again we're sort of using the world around us to create our own design solutions
we sort of assume that because there's a pole in the street that it's okay to use it so we park our shopping cart there it's there for our use on some level so again we sort of co opt our environment to do all these different
we co opt other experiences we take one item and transfer it to another
third section is this idea of not knowing of consciously putting yourself backwards i talk about unthinking situations all the time
and he was asked by his boss to help design a storage system for children this is the billy bookcase it's ikea 's biggest selling product hammer it together hammer it together with a shoe if you're me because they're impossible to assemble
but big selling bookcase how do we replicate this for children the reality is when you actually watch children
what came out of this this is the storage system that he designed so what is this i hear you all ask no i
this and i think this is a particularly lovely solution so you know it's a totally different way of looking at the situation it's a completely empathic solution apart from the fact that teddy 's probably not loving it
a really nice way of re framing the ordinary and i think that's one of the things and putting yourself in the position of the person and i think that's one of the threads that i've heard again from
last section green armband we've all got them is about this really i mean it's about
so again we were asked to design a water pump for a company called approtec in kenya they're now called kickstart
and again as designers we wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful and spend a lot of time thinking of the form and that was completely irrelevant when you put yourself in the position of
these people things like the fact that this has to be able to fold up and fit on a bicycle become much more relevant than the form of it the way it's produced it has to be produced with indigenous
ourselves over to their world so what seems like a very clunky product is in fact incredibly useful it's powered a bit like a stairmaster you pump up and down on it
the needs of the design company the needs of the individuals in the company to feel good about a product we were actually designing and the needs of the individuals we were designing it for
there it is pumping water from thirty feet
as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets to all of you this morning we've made a donation on everybody 's behalf here to kickstart no pun intended their next project
because again i think sort of putting our money where our mouth is here we feel that this is an important gesture so we've handed out bracelets small is the new big i hope you'll all wear them so that's it thank you hello
