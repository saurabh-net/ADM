what you just heard are the interactions of barometric pressure wind and temperature readings that were recorded of hurricane noel in two thousand and seven the musicians played off a three dimensional graph of weather data like this every single bead every single colored band represents a weather element that can also be read as a musical note
i find weather extremely fascinating weather is an amalgam of systems that is inherently invisible to most of us so i use sculpture and music to make it not just visible but also tactile and audible all of my work begins very simple i extract information from a specific environment using very low tech
data collecting devices generally anything i can find in the hardware store i then compare my information to the things i find on the internet satellite images
weather data from weather stations as well as offshore buoys that 's both historical as well as real data and then i compile all of these numbers on these clipboards that you see here these clipboards are filled with numbers and from all of these numbers i start with only two or three variables that begins my translation process
my translation medium is a very simple basket a basket is made up of horizontal and vertical elements
when i assign values to the vertical and horizontal elements i can use the changes of those data points over time to create the form
i use natural reed because natural reed has a lot of tension in it that i cannot fully control that means that it is the numbers that control the form not me
what i come up with are forms like these these forms are completely made up of weather data or science data every colored bead every colored string represents a weather element and together these elements not only construct the form but they also reveal behavioral relationships that may not come across through a two dimensional graph
when you step closer you actually see that it is indeed all made up of numbers the vertical elements are assigned a specific hour of the day so all the way around you have a twenty four hour timeline but it 's also used to assign a temperature range on that grid i can then weave the high tide readings water temperature air temperature and moon phases
i also translate weather data into musical scores and musical notation allows me a more nuanced way of translating information without compromising it so all of these scores are made up of weather data every single color dot every single line is a weather element and together these variables construct a score
i use these scores to collaborate with musicians this is the one thousand nine hundred and thirteen trio performing one of my pieces at the milwaukee art museum
what i love about this work is that it challenges our assumptions of what kind of visual vocabulary belongs in the world of art versus science
