so let me just start with my story so i tore my knee joint meniscus cartilage playing soccer in college then i went on to tear my acl the ligament in my knee
and then developed an arthritic knee and i'm sure that many of you in this audience have that same story and by the way i married a woman who has exactly the same story
so this motivated me to become an orthopedic surgeon and to see if i couldn't focus on solutions for those problems that would keep me playing sports and not limit me
so with that let me just show you a quick video to get you in the mood of what we're trying to explain
all aware of the risk of cancer but there's another disease that's destined to affect even more of us arthritis
it's not aging that causes arthritis common injuries can lead to decades of pain
our joints quite literally grind to a halt
for a solution we've turned to engineering to design artificial components to replace our worn out body parts
but in the midst of the modern buzz around the promises of a bionic body
we stop and ask if there's a better more natural way
what if all the replacements our bodies need already exist in nature or within our own stem cells
this is the field of biologic replacements where we replace worn out parts with new natural ones
and so the mission is how do i treat these things biologically and let 's talk about both what i did for my wife and what i've done for hundreds of other patients
first thing for my wife and the most common thing i hear from my patients particularly in the forty to eighty year old age group seventy year old age group is they come in and say hey doc isn't there just a shock absorber you can put in my knee i'm not ready for joint replacement
and so for her i put in a human meniscus allograft donor right into her knee joint space and and then for that unstable ligament we put in a human donor ligament to stabilize the knee
so here 's my wife 's bad knee on the left and her just hiking now four months later in aspen and doing well and it works not just for my wife but certainly for other patients
girl on the video jen hudak just won the superpipe in aspen just nine months after having destroyed her knee as you see in the other image and having a paste graft to that knee and so we can regrow these surfaces biologically
so with all this success why isn't that good enough you might ask well the reason is because there's not enough donor cycles there's not enough young healthy people falling off their motorcycle and donating that tissue to us
and the tissue 's very expensive and so that's not going to be a solution that's going to get us global with biologic
tissue but the solution is animal tissue because it's plentiful it's cheap you can get it from young healthy tissues
but the barrier is immunology and the specific barrier is a specific epitope called the galactosyl or gal epitope so if we're going to transplant animal tissues to people we have to figure out a way to get rid of that epitope
then take that regeneration template and insert it into the missing meniscus cartilage to regrow that
now done that procedure and it's been done worldwide in over four thousand cases so it's an fda approved and worldwide accepted way to regrow the
that's great when i can degrade the tissue but what happens for your ligament when i need an intact ligament i can't grind it up in a blender
so in that case i have to design and we designed with uri galili and tom turek an enzyme wash to wash away
those galactosyl epitopes with a specific enzyme and we call that a gal stripping technique what we do is humanize the tissue it's by gal stripping that tissue we humanize it
and we've done that now we've taken pig ligament young healthy big tissue put it into ten patients in an fda approved trial
and then one of our patients went on to have three canadian masters downhill championships on his pig lig as he calls it so we know it can work and there's a wide clinical trial of this tissue now pending
so what about the next step what about getting to a total biologic knee replacement not just the parts how are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement well here 's how we're going to do it
so what we're going to do is take an articular cartilage from a young healthy pig strip it of its antigens load it with your stem cells
then put it back on to that arthritic surface in your knee tack it on there have you heal that surface and then create a new biologic surface for
so that's our biologic approach right now we're going to rebuild your knee with the parts we're going to resurface it with a completely new surface but
we have other advantages from the animal kingdom there's a benefit of four hundred million years of ambulation we can harness those benefits we can use thicker younger better tissues than you might have injured in your knee or that you might have when you're forty fifty or sixty
we can do it as an outpatient procedure we can strip that tissue very economically and so this is how we can get biologic knee replacement to go global and so welcome to super biologics it's not hardware
it's not software it's bioware it's version two point
it's version two point that coming to
coming to an operating theater near you soon i believe thank you very much
