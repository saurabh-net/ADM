those of us in education
i grew up in the inner city and there were kids
and those schools are still lousy today fifty six years later
and you know something about a lousy school it 's not like a bottle of wine
and they say we 'll we 're going to do
what we did last year this year
what kind of business model is that between ten and three
who created that business model
and they don 't care whether or not geoff is upset he can 't go to the bank go find another bank they all operate the same way
so i was a little slow and i did not trust technology and when they first came out with those new contraptions
when we were having folks being crippled by polio
the same way then that we 're doing right now we should do something
for years i went to look i went the harvard ed school i thought i knew something they said it was the agrarian calendar and people had but let me tell you why that doesn 't make sense
well it just turns out in the one thousand eight hundred and forty s we did have schools were open all year
so this is not something that is ordained from the education gods to use science
my wife yvonne and i we have four kids three grown ones and a fifteen year old
we didn 't know how critical those first three years were we didn 't know what was happening in those young brains we didn 't know the role that language a stimulus and response call and response how important that was in developing those children we know that lots of places
you know we provide health services and people are always fussing at me about you know because i 'm all into accountability and data and all of that good stuff but
we do health services and i have to raise a lot of money people used to say when they 'd come fund us geoff why do you provide these health services i used to make stuff up
and you 've never read a study from mit that says giving your kid
i mean you 're educators you work you say you think you 've got it great no and you find out they didn 't get july maybe june
so how much money did we just spend on all
because in my older years i 've become somewhat of a clairvoyant
i can predict school scores
you take me to any school
i 'm really good at inner city schools that are struggling and you tell me last year
forty eight percent of those kids were on grade level
and i say okay what 's the plan what did we do from last year to this year you say we 're doing the same thing i 'm going to make a prediction
teachers need real information right now about what 's happening to their kids the high stakes is today because you can do something about it
and here 's the rub some of it 's not going to work
you know people tell me yeah those charter schools a lot of them don 't work
out the science and things not working
the latest and greatest thing
that thing lasted all of three weeks
not a person not a soul
that shouldn 't stop you from pushing the science forward
our job as educators there 's some stuff we know that we can do
and we 've got to do better the evaluation we have to start with kids earlier we have to make sure that we provide the support to young people
we 've got to give them all of these opportunities so
innovating until we really nail this science down
is something that is absolutely critical and this is something by the way
that i think is going to be a challenge for our entire field
cannot wait another fifty years to get this right
we have run out of time continue this foolishness
when the safety of america is threatened we will spend any amount of money
the real safety of our nation is preparing this next generation
so that they can take our place and be the leaders of the world when it comes to thinking and technology and democracy and all that stuff we care about i dare say it 's a pittance
what it would require for us to really begin to solve some of these problems
this year 's seniors will have one hundred percent graduating high school last i heard we had ninety three percent accepted to college we 'd better get that other seven percent
so that 's just how this goes applause jl so how do you stick with them after they leave high school gc well you know one of the bad problems we have in this country
in many ways mimics what
a good parent does it is absolutely possible
