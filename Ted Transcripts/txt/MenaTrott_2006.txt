more nerve wracking but then i started thinking about my family i started thinking about my father and my grandfather and my great grandfather and i realized that
all of these teds going through my blood
i had to be consider this my element so
which i really was appalled by and because i wanted to impress
you all with slides since i saw the great presentations yesterday with graphs i made a graph that moves
and i talk about the makeup of me
so so besides this freakish thing this is my science slide so this is math and this is science this is genetics this is my grandmother
and this is where i get this mouth
i'm a blogger which probably to a lot of you means different things you may have heard about the kryptonite lock
sort of brouhaha where a blogger talked about how you hack or break into a kryptonite lock using a ballpoint pen and it spread all over kryptonite had to adjust the lock and they had to address it to
not typesetted on a old typewriter it's on word so bloggers exposed this or they worked hard to expose this
you know blogs are scary this is what you see i see this and i'm sure scared and i swear on stage shitless about blogs because this is not something that's friendly but there are blogs that
changing the way we read news and consume media and you know these are great examples these people are reaching thousands if not millions of readers and that's incredibly important
you know we had during the hurricane you have msnbc posting about the hurricane on their blog updating it frequently this was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools
you know you have my friend who has a blog on digital on pdrs personal recorders
he makes enough money just by running ads to support his family up in oregon that's all he does now and this is something that blogs has made possible and then you have something like this which is interplast it's a wonderful organization
of people and doctors who go to developing nations to offer plastic surgery to those who need it so children with cleft palates they will get it and they document their story this is wonderful i am not caring
that's what i am i'm a blogger i
i wasn't happy with my job because i was a designer but i wasn't being really stimulated i was an english major in college i didn't have any use for it but i missed writing
so i started to write a blog and i started to create things like these little stories and this was an illustration about my camp experience when i was eleven years old
and how i went to a ymca camp christian camp and basically by the end i had made my friends hate me so much that i hid in a bunk they couldn't find me they sent a search party and i overheard people saying
they wish i had killed myself jumped off bible peak so you can laugh this is ok this is who makes this is me this is what happened to me
and when i started my blog it was really this one goal i wanted i realized i said you know i am not going to be famous to the world but i could be famous to people on the internet
and i set a goal i said i'm going to win an award because i had never won an award in my entire life and i said i'm going to win this award the south by southwest weblog award and i
reached all of these people and i had tens of thousands of people reading about my life everyday and then i wrote a post about a banjo
i wrote a post about wanting to buy a banjo a three hundred dollar banjo which is a lot of money and i don't play instruments i don't know anything about music i like music and i
and i think i probably heard steve martin playing and i said i could do that and i said i said to my husband i said ben can i buy a banjo and he 's like no and my
he told me you cannot buy a banjo this is you're just like your dad who buys who collects instruments and
i wrote a post about how i was so mad at him he was such a tyrant he would not let me buy this banjo and for those people who know me understood my joke this is mena this is how i make a joke at people because
the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant this person is so loving and so sweet that he lets me dress him up and post pictures of him to my blog
if he knew i was showing this right now i put this in today he would kill me but the thing was i wrote this and my friends read it and they're like oh that mena she wrote a post about you know wanting a stupid thing and being stupid
but i got emails from people that said oh my god your husband is such an asshole how much money does he spend on beer in a year
ok what who are these people and why are they reading this and i realized i don't want to reach these people i don't want to write for this public audience
and i started to kill my blog slowly i'm like i don't want to write this anymore and i slowly and slowly and i did tell personal stories from time to then i wrote this one and i put this up because of einstein today
personal that interests me and this is you know this is who who i am you know you see norman rockwell and you have art critics say you know norman rockwell is not art norman rockwell hangs in living rooms and bathrooms and this is not
something to be considered high art and i think this is like one of the most important things to us as you know humans
these things resonate to us and you know if you think about blogs you think of high art blogs the history paintings about you know
all biblical stories and then you have this these are the blogs that interest me the people that just tell stories and one story is about this baby and his name is odin and his father was a blogger
and he was writing his blog one day and his wife gave birth to her baby twenty five at twenty five weeks and he never expected this one day it was normal one day then the next day it was hell
and this is a one pound baby and so odin was documented every single day pictures were taken every day day one day two you know you have day nine they're talking about his apnea
thirty nine he gets pneumonia this his baby is so small and i've never encountered such a just
he 's having failures breathing failures and heart failures and it's slowing down and you don't know what to expect but then it gets better you know day ninety six he goes home
you see this post that's not something that you're going to see in a paper or a magazine but this is something that this person feels and people are excited about it you know twenty eight comments that's not a huge amount of people reading but twenty eight people matter
and today he is a healthy baby who you know if you read his blog it's snowdeal org his father 's blog he
so blogs you know so what you've probably heard these thing before we talked about the well and we talked about all these sort of things throughout our online history but i think blogs are basically just an evolution
and that's where we are today it's this record of who you are your persona you have your google search where you say hey what is mena trott and then you find these things and you're happy or unhappy
but then you also find people 's blogs and those are the records of people that are writing daily not necessarily about the same topic but things that interest to them
we talk about the world flattens as being this panel and i am very optimistic whenever i think about blogs i'm like oh we've got to reach all these people millions and hundreds of millions and billions of people
the life record of a blog is something that i find incredibly important and we started with a slide of my
but you know this is basically the extent of the family that i know in terms of my direct line and i showed a norman rockwell painting before and this one
i grew up with looking at constantly i would spend hours looking at just the connections saying oh the little kid at the top has red hair so does that first generation up there and just these little things you know this is not
science but this was enough for me to be really so interested about how we have evolved and how we can trace our line
this is all i have i have a couple of facts about somebody i have their date of birth and their age and what they did in their household if they spoke english and that's it that's all i know of these people
and it's pretty sad because how i only go back five generations and then it's it i don't even know what happens on my mom 's side because she's from cuba and i don't have that many things
this is my great great grandmother this is the only picture i have and to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs
photo that has greatly influenced me or a series of photos is this project that's done by an argentinean man or his and his wife and he 's basically taking a picture of his family every day
for the past what is seventy six twenty oh my god i'm seventy seven twenty nine years twenty nine years
a joke originally about my graph that i left out is that you see all this math i'm just happy i was able to add it up to one hundred because that's my skill set
so this you have you have these people aging and now this is them today or last year
a powerful thing to have to be able to track this i wish that i would have this of my family i know that
one day my children will be wondering or my grandchildren or my great grandchildren if i ever have children what i am going to
who i was and so i do something that's very narcissistic i am a blogger that is an amazing thing for me because it captures a moment in time every day i take a picture of myself i've been doing this since last year
because there are bad pictures
not to be there and so you see these things it's not just always smiling now i've kind of evolved it so i have this look if you look at my driver 's license i have the same look and it's it's a pretty
so this woman her name was emma and she was a blogger on our service typepad and she was a beta tester so she was there right when we opened you know there was one hundred people
and she wrote about her life dealing with cancer and she was writing and writing and writing and we all started reading it because we had so few blogs on the service we could keep track of everyone and she was writing one day and you know then she disappeared for a little bit
and her sister came on
and she said that that emma had passed away and all of our support staff who had talked to her were were really emotional and it was a very hard day at the company
and it was this was one of those instances where i realized how much blogging affects our relationship and flattening this sort of world that this woman is in england and she lives
she lived a life where she was talking about her what she was doing but the big thing that
really influenced us was her sister wrote to me and she said you know and she wrote on this blog that writing her blog during the last couple of months of her life was probably the best thing that had happened to her and being able to talk to people being able to share
what was going on and being able to write and receive comments and that was amazing to be able to know that we had empowered that and that
blogging was something that she felt comfortable doing and that the idea that blogging doesn't have to be scary that we don't always have to be attack of the blogs that we can be people who are open and wanting to help and talk to people that was an amazing thing and
and so i printed out her or i sent a pdf of her blog to her family and they passed it out at her memorial service and even in her her obituary they mentioned her blog because it was such a big part of her life and that's a huge thing
so that's this is her legacy and i think that my call to action to all of you is you know think about blogs think about what they are think about what you've thought of them you know and then
actually do it because it's something that is really going to change our lives so thank you so
