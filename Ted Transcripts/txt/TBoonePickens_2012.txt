and my record is good on the subject
a hundred years ago we were looking at coal of course and we were looking at whale oil and we were looking at crude oil
and it wasn 't ours though it was theirs so at that point one thousand nine hundred and twelve we selected crude oil over whale oil and some more coal
we would prefer to have cleaner cheaper domestic ours and we have that we have that which is natural
and the cost annually is three trillion dollars and one trillion of that goes to opec that has got to be stopped
now if you look at the cost of opec it cost seven trillion dollars on the milken institute study last year seven trillion dollars
since one thousand nine hundred and seventy six is what we paid for oil from opec now that includes the cost of military and the cost of the fuel both
but it 's the greatest transfer of wealth from one group to another in the history of mankind and it continues and away from us
and with that we have found ourselves to be the world 's policemen we are policing the world and how are we doing that
raise your hand if you think you know
there are twelve one is under construction by the chinese and the other eleven belong to us why do we have eleven aircraft carriers
do we have a corner on the market are we smarter than anybody else
actually most of the eleven we have are tied up in the mid east why why are they in the mid east they 're there to control keep the shipping lanes open and make oil available and the united states uses about twenty million barrels a
somehow that doesn 't seem right that 's not sustainable so where do we go from here does that continue
seventy percent of it is used for transportation fuel so when somebody says let 's go more nuclear
let 's go wind let 's go solar fine i 'm for anything american anything american but if you 're going to do anything about the dependency on foreign oil you have to address transportation
so here we are using twenty million barrels a day producing eight importing twelve and from the twelve five comes from opec
in the history of america we 've never had an energy plan we don 't even realize the resources that we have available to us if you take the last ten years and bring forward you 've transferred to opec a trillion dollars
if you go forward the next ten years and cap the price of oil at one hundred dollars a barrel you will pay two point two trillion that 's not sustainable either but the days of cheap oil are over
to you the saudis do they have to have
and the opec nations are the ones that price the oil so where are we headed from here we 're headed to natural gas natural gas will do everything we want it to do it 's one hundred and thirty octane fuel
you 're going to find and i 'll tell you in just a minute what you 're looking for
to make it happen but here you can look at the list natural gas will fit all of those it will replace or be able to be used for that it 's for power generation transportation it 's peaking fuel
it 's all those do we have enough natural gas look at the bar on the left it 's twenty four trillion it 's what we use a year
how does that translate to barrels of oil equivalent it would be three times what the saudis claim they
and where i 've targeted is on the heavy duty trucks there are eight million of them
you take eight million trucks these are eighteen wheelers and take them to natural gas reduce carbon by thirty percent it is cheaper and it will cut our imports three million barrels
so you will cut sixty percent off of opec with eight million trucks there are two hundred and fifty million vehicles in america so what you have is natural gas is the bridge fuel is the way i see it i don 't have to worry about the bridge to where at my age
but as i said i 'm for anything american now let me take you i 've been a realist i went from theorist early to realist i 'm back to theorist again if you look at the world you have methane hydrates in the ocean around every continent
and here you can see methane if that 's the way you 're going to go that there 's plenty of methane natural gas is methane methane and natural gas are interchangeable but if you decide that you 're going to use some methane and i 'm gone so it 's up to you
but we do have plenty of methane hydrates
and yet we have no energy plan so there 's nothing going on that impresses me in washington on that plan other than i 'm trying to focus on that eight million eighteen wheelers
if we could do that i think we would take our first step to an energy plan if we did we could see that our own resources are easier to use than anybody can imagine thank you
pickens plan that was based on wind energy and you abandoned it basically because the economics changed what happened
and at the time i went into the wind business natural gas was nine dollars today it 's two dollars and forty cents
plummeted which made wind uncompetitive in a nutshell that 's what happened
you burn it you release co two
so you believe in the threat of climate change why doesn 't that prospect concern you the
but if that 's it and that becomes the reason that renewables don 't get invested in
you all do ca but i don 't think that 's right boone i think you 're a person who believes in your legacy you 've made the money you need you 're one of the few people in a position to really swing the debate
but chris i think where we 're headed the long term i don 't mind going back to nuclear and i can tell you what the last page of the report that will take them five years to write will be one don 't build a reformer on a fault
do not build a reformer on the ocean
and now i think reformers are safe move them inland and on very stable ground and build the reformers there isn 't anything wrong with nuke you 're going to have to have energy there is no question you can 't okay
global warming gas than co two is that a concern
in one thousand nine hundred and fifty three fracking came out in forty seven and don 't believe for a minute when our president gets up there and says the department of energy thirty years ago developed fracking i don 't know what in the hell he 's talking about
i mean seriously the department of energy did not have anything to do with fracking the first frack job was in forty seven i saw my first one in fifty three i 've fracked over three thousand wells in my life never had a problem with messing up an aquifer or anything else now
the largest aquifer in north america is from midland texas to the south dakota border across eight states
there 's no problems i don 't understand why the media is focused on eastern pennsylvania
picture then i guess of how the world eventually gets off fossil fuels is through innovation ultimately
buses lamta have been on natural gas for twenty five years
the ft worth t has been on it for twenty five years why air quality was the reason they used natural gas and got away from diesel why are all the trash trucks today in southern california on natural gas it 's because of air quality i know what
what is at the other end of that bridge is for this audience to figure out if someone comes to you with a plan that really looks like it might be part of this solution are you ready to invest in those technologies even if they aren 't maximized for profits they might be maximized for the future health of the planet believer in global warming
