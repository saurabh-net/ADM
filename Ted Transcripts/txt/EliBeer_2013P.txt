when i was looking at these pictures it brought me back many years to my past when i was a child i grew up in a small neighborhood in jerusalem
when i was six years old
i was walking back from school on a friday afternoon
with my older brother we were passing by a bus stop we saw a bus blow up in front of our eyes
the bus was on fire
and many people were hurt and killed
we were so scared and we just ran away
growing up i decided i wanted to become a doctor and save lives maybe that was because of what i saw when i was a child
when i was fifteen i took an emt course
and i went to volunteer on an ambulance
for two years i volunteered on an ambulance in jerusalem i helped many people
but whenever someone really needed help
i never got there in time we never got there the traffic is so bad the distance and everything we never got there when somebody really needed us
one day we received a call about a seven year old child choking from a hot dog
traffic was horrific and we were coming from the other side of town
in the north part of jerusalem
when we got there twenty minutes later we started cpr on the kid
a doctor comes in from a block away
stop us checks the kid and tells us to stop cpr that second he declared this child dead
at that moment i understood
that this child died for nothing
if this doctor who lived one
so i went over to the manager of the ambulance company and i told him please whenever you have a call coming into our neighborhood we have fifteen great guys who are willing to stop everything they 're doing and run and save lives just alert us by beeper we 'll buy these beepers just tell your dispatch to send us the beeper
and we will run and save lives
and we did turns who 's going to listen to the radio scanners the next day while i was listening to the scanners i heard about a call coming in of a seventy year old man
hurt by a car only one block away from me on the main street of my neighborhood
i ran there by foot i had no medical equipment when i got there the seventy year old man was lying on the floor blood was gushing out of his neck he was on coumadin i knew i had to stop his bleeding or else he would die
i took off my yarmulke because i had no medical equipment and with a lot of pressure i stopped his bleeding he was bleeding from his neck when the ambulance arrived
fifteen minutes later i gave them over a patient who was alive
when i went to visit him two days later he gave me a hug and was crying and thanking me for saving his life
at that moment when i realized this is the first person i ever saved in my life after two years volunteering in an ambulance i knew this is my life 's mission
so today twenty two years later we have united hatzalah
passionate about saving lives and they 're spread all around so whenever a call comes in they just stop everything and go and run and save a life
our average response time today went down to less than three minutes in israel
god forbid bomb attacks shootings whatever it is even a woman three o 'clock in the morning falling in her home and needs someone to help her three minutes we 'll have a guy with his pajamas running to her house and helping her get up
the reasons why we 're so successful are because of three things thousands of passionate volunteers who will leave everything they do and run to help people they don 't even know
and we save people that otherwise would not be saved
the second reason is because of our technology you know israelis are good in technology every one of us has on his phone no matter what kind of phone
and the third thing are these ambucycles these ambucycles are an ambulance on two wheels we don 't transfer people but we stabilize them and we save their lives
they never get stuck in traffic they could even go on a sidewalk they never literally get stuck in traffic that 's why we get there so fast a few years after i started this organization in a jewish community two muslims from east jerusalem called me up
i said to myself i saw so much tragedy so much hate and it 's not about saving jews it 's not about saving muslims it 's not about saving christians it 's about saving people so i went ahead full force
arabs and jews they don 't always get along together but here in this situation the communities literally it 's an unbelievable situation that happened the diversities all of a sudden they had a common interest let 's save lives together settlers were saving arabs and arabs were saving settlers it 's an unbelievable concept that could work only when you have such a great cause
and these are all volunteers no one is getting money they 're all doing it for the purpose of saving lives
when my own father collapsed a few years ago from a cardiac arrest one of the first volunteers to arrive to save my father was one of these muslim volunteers from east jerusalem who
was in the first course to join hatzalah
and he saved my father could you imagine how i felt in that moment
when i started this organization i was seventeen years old i never imagined that one day i 'd be speaking at tedmed i never even knew what tedmed was then i don 't think it existed but i never imagined
i never imagined that it 's going to go all around it 's going to spread around and this last year we started in panama and brazil all i need
is a partner who is a little meshugenah like me
passionate about saving lives and willing to do it
and i 'm actually starting it in india very soon with a friend who i met in harvard just a while back
even australia and mexico and many other jewish communities but it could spread everywhere it 's very easy to adopt
and we made a difference i guess you could call this a lifesaving flash mob and it works
when i look all around here
i see lots of people
who would go an extra mile run an extra mile to save other people
no matter who they are no matter what religion no matter who where they come from we all want to be heroes
we just need a good idea
