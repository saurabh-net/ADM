over and over some people nodding yes
recently i showed this to my students and i just asked them to try and explain why it happened the questions and conversations that followed were fascinating check out this video that maddie from my period three class sent me that evening
obviously as maddie 's chemistry teacher i love that she went home and continued to geek out about this kind of ridiculous demonstration that we did in class
but what fascinated me more is that maddie 's curiosity took her to a new level
if you look inside that beaker you might see a candle maddie 's using temperature to extend this phenomenon to a new scenario you know questions and curiosity like maddie 's are magnets that draw us towards our teachers and they transcend
all technology or buzzwords in education but if we place these technologies before student inquiry we can be robbing ourselves of our greatest tool as teachers our students questions
for example flipping a boring lecture from the classroom to the screen of a mobile device might save instructional time but if it is the focus of our students experience it 's the same dehumanizing chatter just wrapped up in fancy clothing but if instead we have the guts
to confuse our students perplex them and evoke real questions
through those questions we as teachers have information that we can use to tailor robust
and informed methods of blended instruction
so twenty first century lingo jargon mumbo jumbo aside
the truth is i 've been teaching for thirteen years now
and it took a life threatening situation
not some scripted curriculum that gave them tidbits of random information
in may of two thousand and ten at thirty five years old
with a two year old at home and my second child on the way i was diagnosed with a large aneurysm at the base of my thoracic aorta this led to open heart surgery this is the actual real email from my doctor right
there now when i got this i was press caps lock
absolutely freaked out okay but
and third through intense reflection he gathered the information that he needed
to design and revise the procedure and then with a steady hand
that i bring to my lesson planning still today
rule number one curiosity comes first
questions can be windows to great instruction but not the other way around
we 're all teachers we know learning is ugly
and just because the scientific
method is allocated to page five of section one point two of chapter one of the one that we all skip and rule number three
but it also deserves our revision
can we be the surgeons of our classrooms
as if what we are doing one day will save lives our students our worth it
and each case is different
southern family and on the left riley now riley 's going to be a big girl in a couple weeks here she 's going to be four years old
and anyone who knows a four year old knows that they love to ask why yeah why
i could teach this kid anything because she is curious about everything we all were at that age
but the challenge is really for riley 's future teachers the ones she has yet to meet
how will they grow this curiosity
you see i would argue that riley is a metaphor for all kids
to the senior who 's checked out before the year 's even begun or that empty desk
in the back of an urban middle school 's classroom
but if we as educators leave behind this simple role as disseminators of content and embrace a new paradigm
as cultivators of curiosity and inquiry
we just might bring a little bit more meaning to their school day and spark their imagination thank you very much teach chemistry
