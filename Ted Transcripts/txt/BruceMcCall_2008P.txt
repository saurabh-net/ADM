i lead i called it serious nonsense because on the serious side i use a technique of painstaking realism
of editorial illustration from when i was a kid i copied it and i never unlearned it it's the only style i know and it's very kind of staid and formal
and meanwhile i use nonsense as you can see this is a scottish castle where people are playing golf indoors and
