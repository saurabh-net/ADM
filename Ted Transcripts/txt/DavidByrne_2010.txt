the venue where i as a young man some of the music that i wrote was first performed it was remarkably
a pretty good sounding room with all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere it actually sounded pretty good this is a song that was recorded there in the picture
the nature of the room meant that words could be understood the lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood the sound system was kind of decent
and there wasn't a lot of reverberation in the room so the rhythms could be pretty intact too pretty concise
other places around the country had similar rooms this is tootsie 's orchid lounge in nashville the music was in some ways different but in structure and form
very much the same the clientele behavior was very much the same too
so the bands at tootsie 's or at cbgb 's had to play loud enough
be loud enough to overcome people falling down shouting out and doing whatever else they were doing since then i've played other places that are much nicer i've played
the disney hall here and carnegie hall and places like that and it's been very exciting but i also noticed that sometimes the music that
had written or was writing at the time didn't sound all that great in some of those halls we managed but
specific rooms do i have a place a venue in mind when i write is that a kind of model for
creativity do we all make things with a venue a context in mind okay africa
most of the popular music that we know now
has a big part of its roots in west africa and the music there i would say the instruments the intricate rhythms
the way it's played the setting the context it's all perfect it all works perfect the music works perfectly in that setting there's no big room to
create reverberation and confuse the rhythms the instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification etc etc it's no accident it's perfect for that particular context this kind of
the room flatters the music it actually improves it this is the room that
some of his music for this is the organ
it's not as big as a gothic cathedral so he can write things that are a little bit more intricate he can very innovatively actually change keys without risking huge
to one another they used to eat drink and yell out to people on the stage just like they do at cbgb 's and places like that if they liked an aria
they would holler and suggest that it be done again as an encore not at the end of the show but immediately and
was an opera experience this is the opera house that wagner built for himself
and the size of the room is not that big it's smaller than this but
wagner made an innovation he wanted a bigger band he wanted a little more bombast so he increased the size of the orchestra pit so he could get more low end instruments
a lot more reverberant than la scala around the same according to alex ross who writes for the new yorker
this kind of rule came into effect that audiences had to be quiet no more eating drinking and yelling at the stage or
a different kind of music worked best in these kind of halls it meant that there could be extreme dynamics which there weren't in some of these other kinds of music
the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic and a little more textural it looks like
that was bob 's last record
clubs again it's noisy they're playing for dancers there's certain sections of the song the songs had different sections that the dancers really liked and they'd say play that part again
be loud enough to be heard above that same thing goes true for that's the beginning of the century for the
whole of twentieth century popular music whether it's rock or latin music or whatever doesn't really change that much it changes about a third of the way into the twentieth century when this became
one of the primary venues for music and this was one way that the music got there microphones enabled singers in particular and
singers like frank sinatra could use the
and do things that they could never do without a microphone other singers after him went even further
been impossible without a microphone it would have been impossible without recorded music as well and he 's singing right into your ear he 's whispering into your ear the effect is just electric it's like the guy is
sitting next to you whispering
who knows what into your ear
so at this point music diverged there's live music and there's recorded music and they no longer have to be exactly the same now there's venues like this a discotheque and there's jukeboxes in bars
the dancers liked certain sections more than they did others so there early hip hop guys would loop certain
live performance when it was incredibly successful ended up in what is probably acoustically the worst sounding venues on the planet sports stadiums
that this is what they're writing for the tempos are medium it sounds big it's more a social situation than a musical situation and in some ways the music that they're writing for this
place works perfectly so there's more new venues one of the new ones is the automobile i grew up with a radio in a car but now that's evolved into something else the car is a whole venue works perfectly on it
it might not be what you want to listen to at home but it works great in the car
has a huge frequency spectrum you know big bass and high end and the voice kind of stuck in the middle automobile music you can share with your friends
there's one other kind of new venue the private mp three player presumably this is just for christian music and
in some ways it's like carnegie hall or when the audience had to hush up because you can now hear every single detail in other ways it's more like the west african music because
if the music in an mp three player gets too quiet you turn it up and the next minute your ears are blasted out by a louder passage so that doesn't really work i think
pop music mainly it's written today to some extent is written for these kind of players for this kind of personal experience where you can hear extreme detail but the dynamic doesn't change that much
so i asked myself okay is this a model for creation this adaptation that we do and
does it happen anywhere else well according to david attenborough and some other people birds do it too that the birds in the canopy
where the foliage is dense their calls tend to be high pitched short and repetitive
and the birds on the floor tend to have lower pitched calls so they don't get distorted when they bounce off the forest floor and birds like
this savannah sparrow they tend to have a buzzing
call and it turns out that a sound like this is
the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their
the east coast of the united states where the forests are a little denser has one kind of call and the tananger on the other side on the west a different
do it too and i thought well if this is a model for creation if we make music
is that how it works yeah i think it's evolutionary it's adaptive but the pleasure and the passion and the joy is still there
this is a reverse view of things from the kind of traditional romantic view the romantic view is that first comes the passion and then the outpouring of emotion and then somehow it gets shaped into something
and i'm saying well the passion 's still there but the vessel that it's going to be injected into and poured into
that is instinctively and intuitively created first we already know where that passion is going
but this conflict of views is kind of interesting the writer thomas frank
says that this might be a kind of explanation why some voters vote against their best interests that voters like a lot of us
assume that if they hear something that sounds like it's sincere that it's coming from the gut that it's passionate that it's more authentic and they'll vote for that so that if somebody can fake sincerity if they can fake passion
i'm saying the two the passion the joy are not mutually exclusive maybe what the world needs now is for us to realize that we are like the birds we adapt
we sing and like the birds the joy is still there even though we have changed what we do to fit the context thank you very much
