it's been reported that wikileaks your baby has in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world 's media combined can that possibly be true
so these are as far as we can tell classical whistleblowers
and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us so we use just state of the art encryption to bounce stuff around the internet to hide trails pass it through legal jurisdictions like sweden and belgium to those legal protections
the mail the regular postal
or not vet it like a regular news organization
format it which is sometimes something that's quite hard to do when you're talking about giant databases of information release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and
so you make an effort to ensure the documents are legitimate but you actually almost never know who the identity of the
that's right yeah very rarely do we ever know and
if we find out at some stage
asking what the code is for a ted membership
so let 's take the example actually this is something you leaked a few years ago if we can have this document up so this was a story in kenya a few years ago can you tell us what you
so this is the kroll report this was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the kenyan government
its election in two thousand and four prior to two thousand and four kenya was ruled by daniel arap moi for about eighteen years he was a soft dictator of kenya
and when kibaki got into power through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in kenya they commissioned this report spent about two
million pounds on this and an associated report and then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on moi who was the richest man
is the richest man in kenya
it's the holy grail of kenyan journalism
so i went there in two thousand and seven and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election the national election december twenty eight
we released that report we did so three days after the new president kibaki had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean
so this report then became a dead albatross around
and i mean to cut a long story short word of the report leaked into kenya not from the official media but indirectly and in your opinion it actually shifted the election
this became front page of the guardian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of kenya in
so your leak really substantially changed the world 's
you get on em just open em up i see your element uh got about four all
all right hahaha i
so what was the impact of that
we ended up sending two people to baghdad to further research that story so this is just the first
three attacks that occurred in that
eleven people died in that attack right including two reuters employees
there were between eighteen and twenty six people
and releasing this caused widespread outrage what was the key element of this that actually caused the outrage do
can see the gross disparity in force you have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street and
and killing people rescuing the wounded and there was two journalists involved that clearly weren't insurgents because that's their full time job
i mean there's been this u s intelligence analyst bradley manning arrested and it's alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked
we have denied receiving those cables he has been charged about five days ago
obtaining one hundred and fifty thousand cables and releasing fifty now we had released
early in the year a cable from
the reykjavik u s embassy but this is not necessarily connected i mean i was a known visitor
we would have released them ca you because
well because these sort of things reveal what the true state
say arab governments are like the true human rights abuses in those governments if you look at declassified cables that's the sort of
so let 's talk a little more broadly about this i mean in general what's your philosophy why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information
well there's a question as to what sort of information is important in the world what sort of information can achieve reform
so information that organizations are spending economic effort into concealing
that's a really good signal
that when the information gets out there's a hope of it doing some good
because the organizations that know it best that know it from the inside out are spending work
are there risks with that either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence
your records with your doctor that's a legitimate secret
we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well motivated
so they are well motivated and what would you say to for example the you know the parent of someone whose son is out serving the u s military and he says you know
put up something that someone had an incentive to put out it shows a u s soldier laughing at people dying
that gives the impression has given the impression to millions of people around the world that u s soldiers are inhuman people actually they're not my son isn 't how dare you what would you say
we do get a lot of that but remember the people in baghdad the people
don't need to see the video
they see it every day so it's not going to change their opinion it's not going to change their perception that's what
found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government light is good
any irony in the fact that in order for you to shine that light you have to yourself create secrecy around your sources
not really i mean we don't have any wikileaks dissidents yet
have sources who are dissidents on other sources
we're presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled to continue our mission not to
just based on what we've heard so far i'm curious as to the opinion in the ted audience you know there might be a couple of views of wikileaks and of julian you know
hero people 's hero bringing this important light dangerous troublemaker
but i think for ted you are i mean it's an intriguing story that's just happened right what is this ja so this is
a sample of what we do sort of every day so late last year in november last year there was a series of well blowouts in albania
like the well blowout in the gulf of mexico but not quite as
and we got a report a sort of engineering analysis into what happened saying that in fact security guards
rival various competing oil firms had in fact parked trucks there and blown them up
knew what it was about so we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue
that basis we put it out and said look we're skeptical about this thing we don't know but what can we do the material looks good it feels right but we
we then got a letter just this week
wanting to track down the source saying
saying this screen shot
with the author in the microsoft word id
have you had information from inside bp
the past few months has been sort of minimized while we're re engineering our back systems for the phenomenal public interest that we have
that's a problem i mean
like any sort of growing startup organization we are sort of overwhelmed by
growth and that means we're getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high caliber but don't have enough people to actually
so that's the key bottleneck basically journalistic volunteers and or the funding of journalistic salaries
yeah and trusted people i mean we're an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with so we have to restructure in order to
have people who will deal with the highest national security
help us understand about you personally and how you came to do this and i think i read that as a kid you went to thirty seven different schools can that be right a psychologist might say
a recipe for breeding paranoia what the movie business
and you were also i mean you
at an early age and ran into the authorities early on
with hacker i mean there's like there's a method that can be deployed for various things unfortunately at the moment
it's mostly deployed by the russian mafia in order to steal your grandmother 's bank accounts so this phrase is not not as nice as it used to be
yeah well i certainly don't think you're stealing anyone 's grandmother 's
what about your core values can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped
the incident but the core values
capable generous men do not create victims they nurture victims
and that's something from my father and something from other
generous men that have been in my life
capable generous men do not create victims they
you know i'm a combative
there is another way of
so just tell us very quickly in the last minute the story what happened in iceland you basically published something there ran into trouble with a bank
the news service there was injuncted from running the story instead they publicized your side that made you very high profile in iceland what happened next
this is a great case you know iceland went through this financial crisis it was the hardest hit of any country in the world its banking sector was ten times the gdp of the rest of the economy
anyway so we release this
july last year and the national tv station was injuncted five minutes before it went on air like out of a movie
injunction landed on the news desk and the news reader was like this has never happened before what do we do well we just show the website instead for all that time
and we became very famous in iceland went to iceland and spoke about this issue and there was a feeling in the community
to sort of become an offshore haven
with the strongest journalistic protections in the world with a new nobel prize for freedom of speech iceland 's a nordic
like norway it's able to tap into the system and just a month ago this was passed by the icelandic parliament watching big brother
or it's just all to be played for either way
i'm not sure which way it's going to go i mean there's enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and
the e u between china and the united states which way is it going to go it's hard to see that's why it's a very interesting time to be in because with just a little bit of effort we can shift
