recent debate over copyright laws like sopa in the united states and the acta agreement in europe
has been very emotional and i think some dispassionate quantitative reasoning could really bring a great deal to the debate i 'd therefore like to propose that we employ we enlist the cutting edge field of copyright math whenever we approach this subject for instance just recently
the motion picture association revealed that our economy loses fifty eight billion dollars a year to copyright theft
now rather than just argue about this number a copyright mathematician will analyze it and he 'll soon discover that this money could stretch from this auditorium all the way across ocean boulevard to the westin and then to mars
now this is obviously a powerful some might say dangerously powerful insight
this is the equivalent to the entire american corn crop failing along with all of our fruit crops as well as wheat tobacco rice sorghum whatever sorghum is
and tv satellite and cable revenues are way up other content markets like book publishing and radio are also up
so this small missing chunk here is puzzling
theft which is quite a lot when you consider that back in ninety eight the bureau of labor statistics indicated that the motion picture and video industries were employing two hundred and seventy thousand people
other data has the music industry at about forty five thousand people and so the job losses that came with the internet and all that content theft have therefore left us with negative employment in our content industries and this is just one of the many mind blowing statistics that copyright mathematicians have to deal with every day and some people think that string theory is tough
some people think this number 's a little bit large but copyright mathematicians who are media lobby experts are merely surprised that it doesn 't get compounded for inflation every year
now when this law first passed the world 's hottest mp three player could hold just ten songs and it was a big christmas hit because what little hoodlum wouldn 't want a million and a half bucks worth of stolen goods in his pocket
