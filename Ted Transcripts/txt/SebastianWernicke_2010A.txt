you go on the ted website you can currently find there over a full week of ted talk videos over one point three million words of transcripts and millions of user ratings
and that's a huge amount of data and it got me wondering if you took all this data and put it through statistical analysis
also could you create the worst possible ted talk that they would still let you get away with
to find this out i looked at three things i looked at the topic that you should choose i looked at how you should deliver it and the visuals onstage
now with the topic there's a whole range of topics you can choose but you should choose wisely because your topic strongly correlates with how users will react to your talk
now to make this more concrete let 's look at the list of top ten words that statistically stick out
in the most favorite ted talks
in the least favorite ted talks so if you came here to talk about how french coffee will spread happiness in our brains go
well if you generalize this the most favorite ted talks are those that
feature topics we can connect with both easily and deeply such as happiness our own body food emotions
the more technical topics such as architecture materials and strangely enough men those are not good topics to talk about
how should you deliver your talk ted is famous for keeping a very sharp eye on the clock so they're going to hate me for revealing this because actually you should talk as long as they will let
all ranking lists on ted com except if you want to have a talk that's beautiful inspiring or funny then you should be brief but
other than that talk until they drag you off the stage
pushing the clock there's a few rules to obey i found these rules out by comparing the statistics of four word phrases that appear more often in the most and
now let 's go to the visuals the most obvious visual thing on stage is the speaker and analysis shows if you want to be among the most favorite ted speakers you should
let your hair grow a little bit longer than average make sure you wear your glasses and be slightly more dressed up than the average ted speaker
the ratings that talks get on the website for example fascinating talks contain a statistically high amount of
i'm not the first one who has done this analysis but i'll leave this to your good judgment so now it's time to put it all together and
give you something i will not impose the ultimate or worst ted talk on you but rather give you a tool to create your own and i call this tool the ted pad and
ted pad is a matrix of one hundred specifically selected highly curated sentences that you can easily piece together to get your own ted talk
you only have to make one decision and that is are you going to use the white version for very good ted talks about
and have fun with it now i hope you enjoy the session i hope you enjoy designing your own ultimate and worst possible ted talks
and i hope some of you will be inspired for next year to create this which i really want to see thank you very much
