and the third is pretty innovative it's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique it activates what's called the buzzing bridge or the dog
i turn the crank and i apply pressure
it makes a sound like a barking dog okay all of this is pretty innovative if you consider
that the hurdy gurdy appeared about a thousand years ago and it took two people to play it one to turn the crank and another person yes to play the melody by physically pulling up large wooden pegs
luckily all of this changed a couple of centuries later so one person could actually play and almost this is pretty heavy carry the hurdy gurdy
