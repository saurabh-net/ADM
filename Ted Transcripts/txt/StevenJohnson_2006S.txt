if you haven't ordered yet i generally find the rigatoni with the spicy tomato sauce goes best with
diseases of the small intestine so sorry it just feels like i should be doing stand up up here because of the setting no what i want to do is take you back
and tell the story in brief of this outbreak which in many ways i think helped create the world that we live in today and particularly the kind of city that we live in today
london was this city of two point five million people and it was the largest city
on the face of the planet at that point but it was also the largest city that had ever been built and so the victorians were trying to kind of live through and simultaneously invent
a whole new scale of living this scale of living that we you know now call metropolitan living
it was in many ways at this point in the mid eighteen fifties a complete disaster
they were basically a city living with a modern kind of industrial metropolis with an elizabethan public infrastructure
so people for instance just to gross you out for a second
had cesspools of human waste in their basement like a foot to two feet deep and they would just kind of
the buckets down there and hope that it would somehow go away and of course it never really would go away and
all of this stuff basically had accumulated to the point where the city was incredibly offensive to just walk around in it was an amazingly smelly city
not just because of the cesspools but also the sheer number of livestock in the city would shock people not just the horses but people had cows in their attics that they would use for milk that they would kind of hoist up there
and keep them in the attic until literally their milk ran out and they died and then they would kind of drag them off to the bone boilers down the street
so you would just walk around in london at this point and just be overwhelmed with this stench and what ended up happening is that an entire
emerging public health system became convinced that it was the smell that was killing everybody that was creating these diseases that would kind of
and every four or five years another epidemic would take ten thousand twenty thousand people in london and throughout the uk
of early you know kind of founding public health interventions in the system of the city one of which was called the nuisances act which they got everybody as far as they could to empty out their cesspools
and just pour all that waste into the river because if we get it out of the streets it'll smell much better and oh right we drink from the river
so what ended up happening actually is they ended up increasing the outbreaks of cholera because as we now know cholera is actually in the water it's a water borne disease not something that's in the air it's not something you smell or inhale it's something you ingest
and so one of the founding moments of kind of public health in the nineteenth century effectively poisoned the water supply of london much more effectively than any modern day bioterrorist could have ever dreamed of doing so of carnage and
offensive conditions and in the midst of all this kind of scientific confusion about what was actually killing people it was a very
who had been arguing for about four or five years that cholera was in fact a waterborne disease and had basically convinced nobody of this the public health authorities had largely ignored what he had to say
he'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies but nothing had really kind of stuck and part of what's so interesting about this story to me is that in some ways it's a great case study
how cultural change happens how a good idea eventually comes to win out over much worse ideas and snow labored for a long time with this great insight that everybody kind of ignored and then on one day
somehow contracted cholera came down with cholera at forty broad street you can't really see it in this map but this is the map that
and it turns out that the cesspool that they still continue to have despite the nuisances act
bordered on an extremely popular water pump local watering hole that was well known for the best water in all of soho that all the residents from soho and the surrounding neighborhoods would go to
and so this little girl inadvertently ended up contaminating the water in this popular pump and one of the most terrifying outbreaks in the history of
england erupted about two or three days later literally ten percent of the neighborhood died in seven days and much more would have died if people hadn't fled after the initial kind of outbreak kind of kicked
beast because he thought an outbreak that concentrated could actually potentially end up convincing people that in fact
the real menace of cholera was in the water supply and not in the air he suspected an outbreak that concentrated would probably
infections that you might expect and so he went right in there and started interviewing people he eventually enlisted the
help of this amazing other figure who 's kind of the other protagonist of the book this guy henry whitehead who was a local minister
who was not at all a man of science but was incredibly socially connected he knew everybody in the neighborhood and he managed to track down whitehead did many of the cases of people who had drunk water from the pump or who hadn't drunk water from the pump
and eventually snow made a map of the outbreak he found increasingly that people who drank from the pump were getting sick people who hadn't drunk from the pump were not getting sick
and he thought about kind of representing that as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods people who hadn 't you know percentages of people
and you can see in this map the pump right at the center of it and you can see that one of the residence down the way had about fifteen people dead and the map is actually a little bit bigger as you get further and further away from the pump the deaths begin to
grow less and less frequent and so you can see this kind of something poisonous kind of emanating out of this pump that you could see in a glance
and so with the help of this map and with the help of kind of more kind of evangelizing that he did over the next few years and that whitehead did
when the next big cholera outbreak came to london the authorities had been convinced in part because of this story in part because of this map
that in fact the water was the problem and they had already started building the sewers in london and they immediately went to this outbreak and they told everybody to start boiling their water
and that was the last time that london has seen a cholera outbreak since so part of this story i think well it's a terrifying story it's a very dark story and it's a story that continues on in many of the developing cities of the world
it's also a story really that is fundamentally optimistic which is to say that it's possible to solve these problems if we listen to reason if we listen to
in these kinds of situations and what it ended up doing is making the idea of large scale metropolitan living a sustainable one
when people were looking at ten percent of their neighborhoods dying in the space of seven days there was a widespread consensus that this couldn't go on that people weren't meant to live in cities of two point five million people
but because of what snow did because of this map because of the whole series of kind of reforms that happened in the wake of this map we now take for granted
that cities have ten million people cities like this one are in fact sustainable things we don't worry that new york city is going to collapse in on itself quite the way that you know rome did and be ten percent of its size in one hundred years or two hundred years
and so that in a way is the ultimate legacy of this map it's a map of deaths that ended up creating a whole new way of life the life that we're enjoying here today thank you very much
