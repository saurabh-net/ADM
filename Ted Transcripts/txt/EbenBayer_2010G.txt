so i'd like to spend a few minutes with you folks today imagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years but before i do that i need to talk to you about synthetic materials like plastics which require huge amounts of energy to create
like that we're using mushrooms to create an entirely new class of materials which perform a lot like plastics during their use but are made from crop waste and are totally compostable at the end of their lives first
i need to talk to you about what i consider one of the most egregious offenders in the disposable plastics category this is a material you all know is styrofoam but i like to think of it as toxic white stuff
in a single cubic foot of this material about what would come around your computer or large television you have the same energy content of about a liter and a half of petrol yet after just a few weeks of use you'll throw this material in the trash
the epa estimates in the united states by volume this material occupies twenty five percent of our landfills even worse
it finds its way into our natural environment on the side of the road or next to a river if it's not picked up by a human like me and you it'll stay there for thousands and thousands of years
you'll find it inside of you
so for all these reasons i think we need better materials and there are three key principles we can use to guide these materials the first is feedstocks
second of all we should really strive to use far less energy in creating these materials i say far less because ten percent isn't going to cut it we should be talking about half a quarter one tenth the energy content
and lastly and i think perhaps most importantly we should be creating materials that fit into what i call nature 's recycling system
that packaging i got in the mail yesterday is going to last for thousands of years this is crazy but nature provides us with a really good model here
to the forest floor where they're actually upcycled into next year 's topsoil
and this gets us back to the mushrooms
or woody biomass and can transform them into a chitinous polymer which you can form into almost any shape in our process we basically use it as a glue
fire resistant moisture resistant vapor resistant materials that can absorb impacts that can absorb acoustical impacts but these materials are grown
so i'd like to share with you the four basic steps required to make these materials the first is selecting a feedstock preferably something that's regional that's in your area right local manufacturing
the next is actually taking this feedstock and putting in a tool physically filling an enclosure a mold in whatever shape you want to get
then you actually grow the mycelium through these particles and that's where the magic happens because the organism is doing the work in this process not the equipment
the final step is of course the product whether it's a packaging material a table top or building block our vision is local manufacturing like the local food movement for production so we've created formulations for all around the world using regional byproducts if you're in china
you might use a rice husk or a cottonseed hull if you're in northern europe or north america you can use things like buckwheat husks or
when this lid goes on the part
days assemble them into biocomposites our entire facility is comprised of thousands and thousands and thousands of these tools
so i've said a number of times that we grow materials and it's kind of hard to picture how that happens so my team has taken five days worth of growth
a typical growth cycle for us and condensed it into a fifteen second time lapse and i want you to really watch closely these little white dots on the screen
because over the five day period what they do is extend out and through this material using the energy that's contained in these seed husks to build this chitinous polymer matrix
so in front of your eyes this part just self assembled it actually takes a little longer it takes five days but it's much faster than conventional farming
the last step of course is application in this case we've grown a corner block a major fortune five hundred furniture maker uses these corner blocks
best of all when it gets to the customer it's not trash they can actually put this in their natural ecosystem without any processing and it's going to improve the local soil
the next is self assembly because the organism is actually doing most of the work in this process you don't need a lot of equipment to set up a production facility so you can have lots of small facilities spread all across the world
what i want to guarantee is that in ten thousand years our descendants our children 's children will be living happily and in harmony
with a healthy earth and i think that can be some really good news thank you
