good morning ladies and gentlemen my name is art benjamin and i am a mathemagician what that means is i combine my loves of math and magic to do something i call
i see i see one way in the back you sir that's three and anybody on this side here ok you over there on the aisle would the four of you with calculators please bring out your calculators then join me up on stage and let 's give these volunteers a nice round of applause
i haven't had the chance to work with these calculators i need to make sure that they are all working properly would somebody get us started by giving us a two digit number please how about a two digit number
would you like to try a more standard calculator just in case ok great what i'm going to try and do then i notice that took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer that's ok
i'll give you a shortcut for multiplying even faster on the calculator there is something called the square of a number which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself for instance five squared would be
and on most calculators that will give you the square on some of these ancient rpn calculators you've got an x squared button on it will allow you to do the calculation even faster what i'm going to try and do now is to square in my head four two digit numbers
faster than they can do on their calculators even using the shortcut method what i'll use is the second row this time and i'll get four of you one two three four
yell out a two digit number and if you would square the first number and if you would square the second the third and the
i will try and race you to the answer ok so quickly a two digit number please
let me try to take this one step further i'm going to try to square some three digit numbers this time i won 't even write these down i'll just call them out as they're called out to me anyone i point to call out a three digit number
another another three digit another
another another three digit number sir
let me try to take this one step further
i'm going to try to square a four digit number this time now you can all take your time on this i will not beat you to the answer on this one but i will try to get the answer right
nine ab nine seven seven five that does yours go
in the meanwhile let me conclude
so you should have as an answer either a six digit or probably a seven digit number how many digits do you have six or seven seven and yours
i shall attempt the impossible or at least the improbable
the odds of me getting all four of these right by random guessing would be one in ten thousand ten to the fourth power ok any six of them really scramble them up
you leave out the number seven and let 's give all four of these people for my next number
while i mentally recharge my batteries i have one more question for the audience by any chance does anybody here happen to know
anybody here who 'd like to know the day of the week they were born we can do it that way of course i could just make up an answer and you wouldn't know so i come prepared for that
i didn't mean to look at you sir you were just sitting there
you can help me out here if you wouldn't mind this is a book of calendars and yeah ok
that book in front of you do me a favor turn to a year outside of the nineteen hundreds either into the eighteen hundreds or way into the
things up now by alluding to something from earlier in the presentation
was a gentleman up here who had a ten digit calculator where is he would you stand up ten digit guy ok well stand up for me just for a second so i can see where
you have a ten digit calculator sir as well ok what i'm going to try and do is to square in my head a five digit number requiring a ten digit calculator
but to make my job more interesting for you as well as for me i'm going to do this problem thinking out loud
so you can actually honestly hear what's going on in my mind while i do a calculation of this size
now i have to apologize to our magician friend lennart green i know as a magician we're not supposed to reveal our secrets but i'm not too afraid that people are going to start doing my show next week
let 's see let 's take a let 's take a different row of
with you i'll get five digits one two three four oh i did this row already let 's do the row before you starting with you sir one two three four five call out a single digit that will be the five digit number that i will try to square
add all those numbers together and with any luck arrive at the answer now let me recap
while i explain something else
i know that you can use right
while i do these calculation you might
words as opposed to numbers creep into the calculation let me explain what that is this is a phonetic code a mnemonic device that i use that allows me to convert numbers
into words i store them as words and later on retrieve them as numbers i know it sounds complicated it's not i just don't want you to think you're seeing something out of rain man here
there's definitely a method to my madness definitely definitely sorry
want to talk to me about adhd afterwards
by the way one last instruction for my judges with
the calculators ok you know who you are there is at least a fifty percent chance that i will make a mistake here if i do
don't tell me what the mistake is just say you 're close or something like that and i'll try and figure out the answer which could be pretty entertaining in itself if here
here that to fission to
