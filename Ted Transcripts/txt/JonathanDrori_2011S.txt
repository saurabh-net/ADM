you know how many species of flowering plants there are
and the reason that sexual reproduction is so important there are lots of other things that plants can do to reproduce
you can take cuttings they can sort of have sex with themselves they can pollinate themselves but they really need to spread their genes to mix with other genes so that they can adapt to environmental niches evolution works that way
as there are flowering plants and that 's actually rather useful for forensics and so on most pollen that causes hay fever for us is from plants that use the wind to disseminate the pollen and that 's a very inefficient process which is why it gets up our noses so much
because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it hoping that your sex cells your male sex cells which are held within the pollen will somehow reach another flower just by chance so all the grasses which means all of the cereal crops and most of the trees have wind borne pollen
but most species actually use insects to do their bidding and that 's more intelligent in a way because the pollen they don 't need so much of it the insects and other species can take the pollen transfer it directly to where it 's required
so we 're aware obviously of the relationship between insects and plants there 's a symbiotic relationship there whether it 's flies or birds or bees they 're getting something in return and that something in return is generally nectar
sometimes that symbiosis has led to wonderful adaptations the hummingbird hawk moth is beautiful in its adaptation the plant gets something and the hawk moth spreads the pollen somewhere else
plants have evolved to create little landing strips here and there for bees that might have lost their way there are markings on many plants that look like other insects
these are the anthers of a lily cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen
this orchid known as darwin 's orchid
because it 's one that he studied and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it
that nectar tube to get to the nectar and darwin said looking at this flower i guess something has coevolved with this and sure enough there 's the insect and i mean normally it kind of rolls it away but in its erect form that 's what it looks like
now you can imagine that if
nectar is such a valuable thing and expensive for the plant to produce
and it attracts lots of pollinators then just as in human sex people might start to deceive they might say i 've got a bit of nectar do you want to come and get it now this is a plant this is a plant here
that insects in south africa just love and they 've evolved with a long proboscis to get the nectar at the bottom and this is the mimic so this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant
and here is the long probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic because the mimic doesn 't give it any nectar it thought it would get some so not only has the fly not got the nectar from the mimic plant it 's also if you look very closely
if you look at the every home should have one scanning electron microscope picture you can see that there are actually some patterning there which is three dimensional so it probably even feels good for the insect as well as looking good
and these electron microscope pictures here 's one of an orchid mimicking an insect
you can see that different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures to our eye have very very different textures to what an insect might perceive
the surface there really quite different from the other surfaces we looked at sometimes the whole plant
mimics an insect even to us i mean i think that looks like some sort of flying animal or beast it 's a wonderful amazing thing
this one 's clever it 's called obsidian i think of it as insidium sometimes to the right species of bee this looks like another very aggressive bee and it goes and bonks it on the head lots and lots of times to try and drive it away and of course covers itself with pollen the other thing it does is that this plant mimics
another orchid that has a wonderful store of food for insects and this one doesn 't have anything for them so it 's deceiving on two levels fabulous
this one doesn 't smell so good this is a flower that really really smells pretty nasty and is designed again evolved to look like carrion so flies love this they fly in and they pollinate
fabulous thing now if you think that 's fabulous this is one of my great favorites this is the philodendron selloum for anyone here from brazil you 'll know about this plant this is the most amazing thing that sort of phallic bit there is about a foot long and
it does something that no other plant that i know of does and that is that when it flowers that 's the spadix in the middle there for a period of about two days
it metabolizes in a way which is rather similar to mammals so instead of having starch which is the food of plants it takes something rather similar
absolutely astonishing this thing does something else which is unusual not only will it raise itself to one hundred and fifteen fahrenheit forty three or forty four degrees centigrade for two days but it keeps constant temperature
now most pollinators that we think about are insects but actually in the tropics
many birds and butterflies pollinate and many of the tropical flowers are red and that 's because butterflies and birds see similarly to us we think and can see the color red very well
but if you look at the spectrum birds and us we see red green and blue and see that spectrum insects see green
blue and ultraviolet and they see various shades of ultraviolet so there 's something that goes on off the end there and wouldn 't it be great if we could somehow see what that is i hear you ask well yes we can so what is an insect seeing
last week i took these pictures of rock rose helianthemum in dorset these are little yellow flowers like we all see little yellow flowers all over the place
and this is what it looks like with visible light
and then i put some ultraviolet filters on my camera and took a very very long exposure with the particular frequencies of ultraviolet light
just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property no flower was damaged in the process of this shot it was just attached to the tripod not killed then under ultraviolet light look at that and that could be
