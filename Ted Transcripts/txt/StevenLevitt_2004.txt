to know that so if you
drug dealer in the height of the crack cocaine
women you know you name it jewelry bling bling it had it all ten years of research
a unique opportunity to go inside a gang to see the actual books the financial records of the gang that the answer turns out not to be that being in the gang
three things i want to do first i want to explain how and why
crack cocaine had such a profound influence inner city gangs
somebody like me came to be able to see the inner workings of a gang it's an interesting story i think
i want to tell you in a very superficial way about some of the things we found when we actually got to look at the financial records the books of the gang so before i do that
which is that this presentation has been rated r by the motion picture association of america it contains adult themes adult language
so let me start by talking about crack cocaine and how it transformed the gang and to do that you have to actually go back to a time before crack cocaine in the early eighties and look at
a lot of power and you got to beat people up you got a lot of
respect but there was no money in it ok the gang had no way to make money and they couldn't charge dues to the people in the gang because the people in the gang didn't have any money
great product powdered cocaine but you've got to know rich white people and most of the inner city gang members didn't know any rich white people they couldn't sell to that market you couldn't really do petty crime either it turns out petty crime 's a terrible way to make a living so as a result
a gang leader you had you know power it's a pretty good life but the thing was in the end you were living at home with your mother and so
and in the words of malcolm gladwell
crack cocaine was the extra chunky version of the
have time to talk about it today but if you think about it
i would say that in the last twenty five years of every invention or innovation that's occurred in this country the biggest one in terms of impact on the well being
of people who live in the inner city was crack cocaine and for the worse not for the better but for the worse it had a huge impact on life so what was it about crack cocaine it was a brilliant way of getting the brain high
and it turned out there was this audience
didn't know it wanted crack cocaine but when it came it really did and it was a perfect drug you could sell for
the cocaine that went into it for a dollar sell it for five dollars highly addictive the high was very short so for fifteen minutes you get this great high and then when you come down all you want to do
get high again it created a wonderful market and for the people who were there running the gang it was a great way seemingly to make a lot of money at least for the people
this is where we enter the picture not really me i'm really a bit player in all this my co author sudhir venkatesh is the main character so was a
he had spent following the grateful dead and in his own words he looked like a freak he 's a south asian very dark skinned south asian big man and he had hair in his words down to his ass
defied all kinds of boundaries was he black or white was he man or woman he was really a curious sight to be seen so he showed up at the university of chicago and the famous sociologist william julius wilson
and he took one look at sudhir who was going to go do some surveys for him and decided he knew exactly the place to send him which was to one of the
but they did say well ok let 's hear your questions
so i kid you not the first question on the survey that he was sent to ask was how do you
makes you wonder about academics ok so the choice of
found out is in fact that the real answer was the following
the survey was not in the end going to be what got sudhir off the hook he was held hostage overnight home
and you and i probably faced with the situation
well i guess i'm going to write my dissertation on the grateful dead
hey guys i had so much fun hanging out with you last night i wonder if i could do it again tonight and that was the beginning of what turned out to be a beautiful relationship
that involved sudhir living in the housing project on and off for ten years hanging out in crack houses going to jail
but ultimately the story has a happy ending for sudhir who became one of the most respected sociologists in the country and especially for me as i sat in my office with my excel spreadsheet open waiting for sudhir to come and deliver to me the latest load would get
one of the most unequal co authoring relationships ever
but i was glad to be the beneficiary of it so what do we find
what do we find in the gang well let me say one thing we really got access to everybody in the gang we got an inside look at the gang from the very bottom up to the very top they trusted sudhir
in ways that really no academic has ever or really anybody any outsider has ever earned the trust of these gangs
to the point where they actually opened up what was most interesting for me their books their financial records that they kept and they made them available to us and we not only could study them but we could ask them questions about what was in them so if i have to kind of summarize very quickly in the short time i have
what sort of the bottom line of what i take away from the gang is is that if i had to draw a parallel between the gang and any other organization
would be that the gang is just like mcdonald 's
in a lot of different respects the restaurant mcdonald 's so first in one way which isn't maybe the most interesting way but it's a good way to start is in the way it's organized the hierarchy of the gang the way it looks so here 's what the org chart of the gang looks like
and sudhir says it's not like these guys had a very sophisticated kind of view of
like what happened in american corporate life but they had seen movies like wall street and they kind of had learned a little bit about what it was like to be in the real world
now below that board of directors you've got essentially what are regional vp 's people who control say the south side of chicago or the west side of chicago now
sudhir got to know very well the guy who had the unfortunate assignment of trying to take the iowa franchise which it turned out for this black gang was not one of the more brilliant financial endeavors that
that really makes the gang seem like mcdonald 's is its franchisees that the guys who are running you know the local
gangs the four square block by four square block areas they're just like the guys in some sense who are running the mcdonald 's they are the entrepreneurs they get
the exclusive property rights to control the drug selling they get the name of the gang behind them for merchandising and marketing
these are the teenagers typically who 'd be standing out on the street corner selling the drugs extremely dangerous work
important to note that almost all of the weight all of the people in this organization are at the bottom ok just like mcdonald 's so in some sense the foot soldiers are a lot like the people who
are taking your order at mcdonald 's and indeed it's not just by chance that they're like them in fact in these neighborhoods they'd be the same people so the same kids who are working in the gang were actually at the very same time
they would typically be working part time at a place like mcdonald 's which already i think foreshadows the main result that i've talked about about what a crappy job
it was being in the gang because obviously if being in the gang were such a wonderful lucrative job why in the world would these guys moonlight
so what do the wages look like so you might be surprised but based on the actual you know being able to talk to them and to see their records this is what it looks like in terms of the
fiction it's fact there was very little money in the gang especially at the bottom now if you managed to rise up say and be that local leader the guy who 's the equivalent of the mcdonald 's franchisee
hundred thousand dollars a year and that in some ways was the best job you could hope to get if you were growing up in one of these neighborhoods
as a young black male if you managed to rise to the very top two hundred thousand or four hundred thousand dollars a year is what you'd hope to make truly you would be a great success story
parts of this is that indeed among the many other ramifications of crack cocaine is that the most talented individuals
in these communities this is what they were striving for they weren't trying to make it in legitimate ways because there were no legitimate channels out this was the best way out and it actually was the right choice probably to try to make it out
why is it such a bad job well the reason it's such a bad job is that there's somebody shooting at you a lot of the time so
the death rates we found in our gang and admittedly this was not really sort of a standard situation this was a
time of intense violence of a lot of gang wars as this gang actually became quite successful but there were costs and so the death rate
not to mention the rate of being arrested sent to prison being wounded the death rate in our sample was seven percent per person per year
in the gang for four years you expect to die with about a twenty five percent likelihood that is about as high as you can get so for comparison 's purposes
think about some other walk of life where you may expect might be extremely risky like let 's say that you were a
you were convicted of murder and you're sent to death row
turns out the death rates on death row from all causes including execution two percent a
those of you who believe that a death penalty 's going to have an enormous deterrent effect on crime now
to give you a sense of just how bad the inner city was during crack and i'm not really focusing on the negatives but really there's another story to tell you there
if you look at the death rates just of random young black males growing up in the inner city in the united states the death rates
during crack were about one percent that's extremely high and this is violent death it's unbelievable in some sense to put it into perspective if you compare this
to the soldiers in iraq for instance right now fighting the war zero point five percent so in some very literal way
the young black men who were growing up in this country were living in a war zone very much in the sense of the way that the soldiers over in iraq are fighting in a war
out on a street corner
i think there are a couple answers
used to be the gang was a rite of passage
that the young people controlled the gang that as you got older you dropped out of the gang
so what happened was the people who happened to be in the right place at the right time the people who happened to be leading the gang
in the mid to late eighties became very very
and so the logical thing to think was that well the next generation so they're going to age out of the gang like everybody else has and the next generation is going to take over and get the
so there are striking similarities i think to the internet boom right the first set of people in silicon valley got very very rich and then all of my friends
said maybe i should go do that too and they were willing to work very cheap
for stock options that never came in some sense that's what happened exactly to the set of people we were looking at is that they were willing to start at the bottom just like say
a lawyer at a law firm a first year lawyer is wiling to start at the bottom work eighty hour weeks for not that much money because they think they're going to make partner but what happened was
the rules changed and they never got to make partner indeed the same people who were running all of the major gangs in the late nineteen eighties are still running the major gangs in chicago today
they never passed on any of the wealth so everybody got stuck at that three fifty an hour job and it turned out to be a disaster
the other thing the gang was very very good at was marketing and trickery and so for instance one thing the gang would do is you know the gang leaders would have big entourages and they'd drive fancy cars
and have fancy jewelry so what sudhir eventually realized as he hung out with them more is that really they didn't own those cars they just leased them
and really they did all sorts of things to trick the young people into thinking what a great deal the gang was going to be so for instance they would give a fourteen year old kid
give him a whole you know roll of bills to hold that fourteen year old kid would say oh well you know he would say to his friends hey look at all the money i got in the gang it wasn't his money
until he spent it and then essentially he was in debt to the gang and was sort of an indentured servant for a while so i have a couple minutes let me do
i hadn't thought i'd have time to do
which is to talk about what we learned more generally about economics from the study of
so economists tend to talk in technical words often our theories fail quite miserably when we go to the data but actually what's kind of interesting is that in this setting it turned out that some of the economic theories that worked
one which is more unpleasant than the other that's what you call a compensating differential it's why we think garbage men might be paid more than people who work in parks ok so in the words of one of the members of the gang i think
game has a nash equilibrium here 's the translation you get from the gang member they're talking about the decision of why they don't go shoot
if we start shooting around there in the other gang 's territory nobody and i mean you dig it nobody going to step on their turf but we gotta be careful because they can shoot around here too and then we all
always got paid ok no matter how bad it was economically he always got himself
so we had some theories related to cash flow and lack of access to capital markets and things like that but then we asked the gang member well why is it you always get paid and your workers don't always get paid his
often pay themselves million dollar bonuses even when companies are losing a lot of money to know that
