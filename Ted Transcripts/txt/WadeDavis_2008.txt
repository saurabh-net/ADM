born of the imagination and the imagination the imagination as we know it came into being when our species descended from our progenitor homo
and infused with consciousness began a journey that would carry it to every corner of the habitable world for a time we shared the stage with our distant cousins neanderthal who clearly had some spark of awareness but whether it was the
and for five thousand years been crawling into the belly of the earth where in the light of the flickers of tallow candles they had brought into being the great art of the upper paleolithic
and i spent two months in the caves of southwest france with the poet clayton eshleman who wrote a beautiful book called juniper fuse and you could look at this art and you could of course see the complex social organization of the people who brought it into being
but more importantly it spoke of a deeper yearning something far more sophisticated than hunting magic and the way clayton put it was this way he said you know
hunting magic but as postcards of nostalgia and viewed in that light it takes on a whole other resonance and the most amazing thing about the upper paleolithic
is that as an aesthetic expression it lasted for almost twenty thousand years if these were postcards of nostalgia ours was a very long farewell indeed
and it was also the beginning of our discontent because if you wanted to distill all of our experience since the paleolithic it would come down to two words how and why
and these are the slivers of insight upon which cultures have been forged now all people share the same raw
adaptive imperatives we all have children we all have to deal with the mystery of death the world that waits beyond death the elders who fall away into their elderly years
all of this is part of our common experience and this shouldn 't surprise us because after all biologists have finally proven it to be true something that philosophers have always dreamt to be true and that is the fact that we are all brothers and sisters we are all cut from the same genetic cloth
all of humanity probably is descended from a thousand people who left africa roughly seventy thousand years ago
but the corollary of that is that if we all are brothers and sisters and share the same genetic material all human populations share the same raw human genius the same intellectual acuity and so whether that genius is placed into
of affairs in human experience there is no trajectory of progress there's no pyramid that conveniently places victorian england at the apex and descends down the flanks to the so called primitives of the world
all peoples are simply cultural options different visions of life itself
but what do i mean by different visions of life making for completely different possibilities for existence well let 's slip for a moment into the greatest culture sphere ever brought into being by the imagination that of polynesia ten thousand square kilometers
tens of thousands of islands flung like jewels upon the southern sea i recently sailed on the hokulea named after the sacred star of hawaii throughout the south pacific to make a film about the navigators
these are men and women who even today can name two hundred and fifty stars in the night sky these are men and women who can sense the presence of distant atolls of islands beyond the visible horizon simply by watching the reverberation of waves across the hull of their vessel
knowing full well that every island group in the pacific has its unique refractive pattern that can be read with the same perspicacity with which a forensic scientist would read a fingerprint
these are sailors who in the darkness in the hull of the vessel can distinguish as many as thirty two different sea swells moving through the canoe at any one point in time
and if we slip from the realm of the sea into the realm of the spirit of the imagination you enter the realm of tibetan buddhism and i recently made a film called the buddhist science of the mind
i travelled for a month in nepal with our good friend matthieu ricard and you'll remember matthieu famously said to all of us here once at ted western science is a major response to minor needs we spend all of our lifetime trying to live to be one hundred without losing our teeth
the buddhist spends all their lifetime trying to understand the nature of existence our billboards celebrate naked children in underwear their billboards are manuals prayers to the well being of all sentient creatures
the blessing of trulshik rinpoche we began a pilgrimage to a curious destination accompanied by a great doctor and the destination was a single room in a nunnery where a woman had gone into lifelong retreat fifty five years before
and en route we took darshan from rinpoche and he sat with us and told us about the four noble truths the essence of the buddhist path all life is suffering that doesn't mean all life is negative it means things happen
the cause of suffering is ignorance by that the buddha did not mean stupidity he meant clinging to the illusion that life is static and predictable
the third noble truth said that ignorance can be overcome and the fourth and most important of course was the delineation of a contemplative practice that not only had the possibility
you saw a woman who was more clear than a pool of water in a mountain stream and of course this is what the tibetan monks told us
they said at one point you know we don't really believe you went to the moon but you did you may not believe that we achieve enlightenment in one lifetime but we do
all of their aspirations all of their needs and of course the human population has its own reciprocal obligations i spent thirty years living amongst the people of chincherro
you start off at eleven thousand five hundred feet you run down to the base of the sacred mountain antkilka you run up to fifteen thousand feet descend three thousand feet climb again over the course of twenty four hours
and of course the waylakamaspin the trajectory of the route is marked by holy mounds of earth where coke is given to the earth libations of alcohol to the wind the vortex of the feminine is brought to the mountain top
and the metaphor is clear you go into the mountain as an individual but through exhaustion through sacrifice you emerge as a community that has once again reaffirmed its sense of place in the planet
and at forty eight i was the only outsider ever to go through this only one to finish it i only managed to do it by chewing more coca leaves in one day than anyone in the four thousand year history of the
localized rituals become pan andean and these fantastic festivals like that of the qoyllur rit 'i which occurs when the pleiades reappear in the winter sky
it's kind of like an andean woodstock sixty thousand indians on pilgrimage to the end of a dirt road that leads to the sacred valley called the
which is dominated by three tongues of the great glacier the metaphor is so clear you bring the crosses from your community in this wonderful fusion of christian and
and then you do the ritual dances that empower the crosses now these ideas and these events allow us even to deconstruct iconic places that many of you have been to like machu picchu machu picchu was never a lost city
on the contrary it was completely linked in to the fourteen thousand kilometers of royal roads the inca made in less than a century but more importantly it was linked in to the andean notions of sacred geography
and then beyond salcantay of course when the southern cross reaches the southernmost point in the sky directly in that same alignment the milky way overhead but what is enveloping machu picchu from below the sacred river the urubamba or the vilcanota
which is itself the earthly equivalent of the milky way but it's also the trajectory that viracocha walked at the dawn of time when he brought the universe into being and where does the river
right on the slopes of the koiariti so five hundred years after columbus these ancient rhythms of landscape are played out in ritual
these of course are the descendants of the ancient tairona civilization if those of you who are here remember that i mentioned that they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but the training for the priesthood is extraordinary
taken from their families sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness for eighteen years two nine year periods deliberately chosen to evoke the nine months they spend in the natural mother 's womb
all that time the world only exists as an abstraction as they are taught the values of their society values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic balance
now the measure of a society is not only what it does but the quality of its aspirations and i always wanted to go back into these mountains to see if this could possibly be true as indeed had been reported by the great anthropologist
these really are a people who live and breathe the realm of the sacred a baroque religiosity that is simply awesome they consume more coca leaves than any human population half a pound per man per day
the gourd you see here is everything in their lives is symbolic their central metaphor is a loom they say upon this loom i weave my life they refer to the movements as they exploit the ecological niches of the gradient
as threads when they pray for the dead they make these gestures with their hands spinning their thoughts into the heavens you can see the calcium build up on the head of the poporo gourd
the gourd is a feminine aspect the stick is a male you put the stick in the powder to take the sacred ashes well they're not ashes they're burnt
but if you break a gourd you cannot simply throw it away because every stroke of that stick that has built up that calcium the measure of a man 's life has a thought behind it
and they are the descendants of the ancient tairona civilization the greatest goldsmiths of south america who in the wake of the conquest retreated into this isolated volcanic massif that soars to twenty thousand feet above the caribbean coastal plain
there are four societies the kogi the wiwa the kankuamo and the arhuacos i traveled with the arhuacos
and the wonderful thing about this story was that this man danilo viathanya if we just jump back here for a second
and i said danilo you won 't remember this but when you were an infant i carried you on my back up and down the mountains and because of that danilo invited us to go to the very heart of the world
a place where no journalist had ever been permitted not simply to the flanks of the mountains but to the very iced peaks which are the destiny of the pilgrims
no it's not true that they're kept in the darkness for eighteen years but they are kept within the confines of the ceremonial men 's circle for eighteen years this little boy
will never step outside of the sacred fields that surround the men 's hut for all that time until he begins his journey of initiation
for that entire time the world only exists as an abstraction as he is taught the values of society including this notion that their prayers alone maintain
the cosmic balance before we could begin our journey we had to be cleansed at the portal of the earth
and this is actually the place where the great mother sent the spindle into the world that elevated the mountains and created the homeland that they call the heart of the world
we traveled high into the potomo and as we crested the hills we realized that the men were interpreting every single bump on the landscape in terms of their own
intense religiosity and then of course as we reached our final destination a place called
were in for a surprise because the farc were waiting to kidnap us and so we ended up being taken aside into these huts hidden away until the darkness
and then abandoning all our gear we were forced to ride out in the middle of the night in a quite dramatic scene it's going to look like a john ford western
and we ran into a farc patrol at dawn so it was quite harrowing it will be a very interesting film but what was fascinating is that the minute there was a sense of danger the mamos went into a circle of divination
and of course this is a photograph literally taken the night we were in hiding as they divine their route to take us out of the mountains
we were able to because we had trained people in filmmaking continue with our work and send our wiwa and arhuaco filmmakers to the final sacred lakes to get the last shots for the film
and we followed the rest of the arhuaco back to the sea taking the elements from the highlands to the sea and here you see how their sacred landscape has been covered by brothels and hotels and casinos
and yet still they pray and it's an amazing thing to think that this close to miami two hours from miami there is an entire civilization of people praying every day for your well being
they call themselves the elder brothers they dismiss the rest of us who have ruined the world as the younger brothers they cannot understand why it is that we do what we do to the earth
now if we slip to another end of the world i was up in the high arctic to tell a story about global warming inspired in part by the former vice president 's wonderful book
and what struck me so extraordinary was to be again with the inuit a people who don't fear the cold but take advantage of it a people who
find a way with their imagination to carve life out of that very frozen a people for whom blood on ice is not a sign of death but an affirmation of life
in a place like kanak in northern greenland it literally comes in now in november and stays until march so their entire year has been cut in half
now i want to stress that none of these peoples that i've been quickly talking about here are disappearing worlds these are not dying peoples
on the contrary you know if you have the heart to feel and the eyes to see you discover that the world is not flat the world remains a rich
they're unique facets of the human imagination they're unique answers to a fundamental question what does it mean to be human and alive
and when asked that question they respond with six thousand different voices and collectively those voices become our human repertoire for dealing with the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia
our industrial society is scarcely three hundred years old that shallow history shouldn 't suggest to anyone that we have all of the answers for all of the questions that will confront us in the ensuing millennia
the myriad voices of humanity are not failed attempts at being us they are unique answers to that fundamental question what does it mean to be human and alive
and there is indeed a fire burning over the earth taking with it not only plants and animals but the legacy of humanity 's brilliance
right now as we sit here in this room of those six thousand languages spoken the day that you were born fully half aren't being taught to children
so you're living through a time when virtually half of humanity 's intellectual social and spiritual legacy is being allowed to slip away
this does not have to happen these peoples are not failed attempts at being modern quaint and colorful and destined to fade away as if by natural law in every case these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces
