many of the tests are conducted while yves is strapped onto the wing because yves body is an integral part of the aircraft and
and i
the wing is open so our first critical moment it 's open he is down is he flying commentator two it looks like he 's stabilized he 's starting to make his climb commentator there 's that ninety degree turn you 're talking about taking him out he 's out over the channel
and what he 's going to do as he approaches the ground is pull down on those toggles and that 's the
manager of systems as a pilot but this is really you need fluidity you need to be agile and also to adapt really fast
that means if i have a problem with the first one i pull i still have the possibility to open the second one and this is my life that 's the real important thing about safety i did use that during these last fifteen years about twenty times
never with that type of wing but at the beginning i can release my wing when
so the next thing i saw was just blue it was the sea i have also an audible altimeter so i was at my minimum altitude in that vector fast so
civil aviation is something that we know very well we have a hundred years of experience
and you can adapt really precisely with that i have to adapt to something new that means improvise so it 's really a play between these two approaches something that i know very well these principles for example we have two engines on an airbus
that 's my ejection seat so i have the approach of a professional pilot with the respect
and then i stabilize and according to my altitude i continue on two or three engines it 's sometimes possible it 's quite complicated to explain but according to which
thanks to the increasing technology better technology it will be safe and i hope it will be for everybody
