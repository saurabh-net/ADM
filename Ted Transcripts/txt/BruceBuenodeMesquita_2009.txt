i'm going to try to do is explain to you quickly how to predict and illustrate it with some predictions about what iran is going to do in the next couple of years
in order to predict effectively we need to use science and the reason that we need to use science is because then we can reproduce what we're doing it's not just wisdom or guesswork
and if we can predict then we can engineer the future so if you are concerned to influence energy policy or you are concerned to influence national security policy
or health policy or education science and a particular branch of science is a way to do it not the way we've been doing it which is seat of the pants wisdom
now before i get into how to do it let me give you a little truth in advertising because i'm not engaged in the business of magic
there are lots of thing that the approach i take can predict and there are some that it can 't it can predict
much of what has to do with business but sorry if you're looking to speculate in the stock market
i don't predict stock markets ok it's not going up any time really soon but i'm not engaged in doing that
i'm not engaged in predicting random number generators i actually get
phone calls from people who want to know what lottery numbers are going to win i don't have a clue
i engage in the use of game theory game theory is a branch of mathematics and that means sorry that even in the study of politics math has come
the picture we can no longer pretend that we just speculate about politics we need to look at this in a rigorous way now
what is game theory about it assumes that people
are looking out for what's good for them that doesn't seem terribly shocking although it's controversial for a lot of people that we are self interested
in order to look out for what's best for them or what they think is best for them
and they face limitations constraints they may be weak they may be located in the wrong part of the world they may be einstein
away farming someplace in a rural village in india not being noticed as was the case for ramanujan for a long time a great mathematician but nobody noticed
who is rational a lot of people are worried about what is rationality about people are rational mother theresa she was rational
i think there are only two exceptions that i'm aware of two year olds they are not rational they have very fickle preferences they switch what they think all the time
and schizophrenics are probably not rational but pretty much everybody else is rational that is they are just trying to do what they think is in their own best
now in order to work out what people are going to do to pursue their interests we have to think about who has influence in the world if you're trying to influence corporations to change their behavior with regard to producing pollutants
you would like it to have but if you show them that it's in their interest then they're responsive so we have to work out who influences problems
if we're looking at iran the president of the united states we would like to think may have some influence certainly the president in iran has some influence
doesn't know much about iran or about energy policy or about health care or about any particular policy that person
surrounds himself or herself with advisers if we're talking about national security
it's the secretary of state maybe it's the secretary of defense the director of national intelligence maybe the ambassador to the united nations or somebody else who they think is going to know more about the
problem but lets face it the secretary of state doesn't know much about iran the secretary of defense doesn't know much about iran each of those people in turn
has advisers who advise them so they can advise the president there are lots of people shaping decisions and so if we want to predict correctly
we have to pay attention to everybody who is trying to shape the outcome not just the people at the pinnacle of the decision making pyramid
a lot of times we don't do that there's a good reason that we don't do that and there's a good reason that
using game theory and computers we can overcome the limitation of just looking at a few people imagine a problem with just five decision makers
imagine for example that sally over here wants to know what harry and jane and george and frank
thinking and sends messages to those people sally 's giving her opinion to them and they're giving their opinion to sally
but sally also wants to know what harry is saying to these three and what they're saying to harry and harry wants to know
what each of those people are saying to each other and so on and sally would like to know what harry thinks those people are saying that's a complicated problem that's a lot to know with five decision makers
there are a lot of linkages one hundred and twenty as a matter of fact if you remember your factorials five factorial is one hundred and twenty
that mean we've doubled the number of pieces of information we need to know from one hundred and twenty to two hundred and forty no how about ten times but computers
they can they don't need coffee breaks they don't need vacations they don't need to go to sleep at night
why should we believe what he 's saying
so i'm going to show you
a factoid this is an assessment by the central intelligence agency of the percentage of time that the model i'm talking about
is right in predicting things whose outcome is not yet known when the experts who provided the data inputs got it wrong
that's not my claim that's a cia claim you can read it it was declassified a while ago you can read it in a volume edited by h bradford westerfield yale university press
so what do we need to know in order to predict
we do need to know who has a stake in trying to shape the outcome of a decision we need to know what they say they want
that is how willing are they to drop what they're doing when the issue comes up and attend to it instead of something else that's on their plate how big a deal is it to them and how much clout could they bring to bear if they chose to
on the issue if we know those things we can predict their behavior
by assuming that everybody cares about two things on any decision they care about the outcome they'd like an outcome as close to what they are interested in as possible
they're careerists they also care about getting credit there's ego involvement they want to be seen as important in shaping the outcome
or as important if it's their druthers to block an outcome and so we have to figure out how they balance those two things different people trade off
going down in a blaze of glory or giving it up putting their finger in the wind and doing whatever they think is going to be a winning position most people fall in between and if we can work out where they fall we can work out how to negotiate with them
to change their behavior so with just that little bit of input
we can work out what the choices are that people have what the chances are that they're willing to take what they're after what they value what they want and what they believe about other people you might notice what we don't need to know
no history in here how they got
to where they are may be important in shaping the input information but once we know where they are we're worried about where they're going to be headed in the future how they got there turns out not to
be terribly critical in predicting i remind you of that ninety percent accuracy rate
so where are we going to get this information we can get this information from the internet
from the economist the financial times the new york times u s news and world report lots of sources like that or we can get it from asking experts who spend their lives studying places and problems
because those experts know this information if they don't know who are the people trying to influence the decision how much clout do they have
how much they care about this issue and what do they say they want are they experts that's what it means to be an expert that's the basic stuff an expert needs to know
turn to iran let me make
three important predictions you can check this out iran going to do
about its nuclear weapons program
how secure is the theocratic regime in iran what's its future and everybody 's best friend
things going for him how are things going to be working out for him in the next year or two
you take a look at this this is not based on statistics i want to be very clear here i'm not projecting some
the dynamics of interaction and these are the simulated dynamics the predictions about
the path of policy so you can see here on the vertical axis i haven't shown it all the way down to zero there are lots of other options but here i'm just showing you
it would achieve some national pride but not go ahead and build a weapon and down at one hundred they would build civilian nuclear energy which is what they say is their objective
the yellow line shows us the most likely path the yellow line includes an analysis of eighty seven decision makers in iran and a vast number of outside influencers trying to pressure iran
changing its behavior various players in the united states and egypt and saudi arabia and russia european union japan so on and so forth
the white line reproduces the analysis if the international environment just left iran to make its own internal decisions under its own domestic political pressures that's not going to be happening but you can see
the line comes down faster if they're not put under international pressure if they're allowed to pursue their own devices
but in any event by the end of this year beginning of next year we get to a stable equilibrium outcome and that equilibrium is not what the united states would like
but it's probably an equilibrium that the united states can live with and that a lot of others can live with and that is that iran will achieve that nationalist pride
making enough weapons grade fuel through research so that they could show that they know how to make weapons grade fuel but not enough to actually build a bomb
how is this happening over here you can see this is the distribution of power
in favor of civilian nuclear energy today this is what that
power block is predicted to be like by the late parts of two thousand and ten early parts of two thousand and eleven
out here today there are a bunch of people ahmadinejad for example who would like not only to build a bomb but test a bomb that
power disappears completely nobody supports that by two thousand and eleven these guys are all shrinking the power is all drifting over here so the outcome is going to be the weapons grade fuel
who are the winners and who are the losers in iran take a look at these guys they're growing in power
and by the way this was done a while ago before the current economic crisis and that's probably going to get steeper these
are the moneyed interests in iran the bankers the oil people the bazaaries they are growing in political clout as the
are isolating themselves with the exception of one group of mullahs who are not well known to americans that's this line here growing in power
these are what the iranians call the quietists these are the ayatollahs mostly based in qom who have great clout in the religious community
have been quiet on politics and are going to be getting louder because they see iran going in an unhealthy direction a direction contrary to what khomeini had in mind
player in iran he is on the way down
ok so i'd like you to take a little away from this everything is not predictable the stock market is at least for me not predictable
but most complicated negotiations are predictable again whether we're
health policy education environment energy litigation mergers
all of these are complicated problems that are predictable
that this sort of technology can be applied to
the reason that being able to predict those things is important is not just because you might run a hedge fund and make money off of it but because if you can predict what people will do you
what they will do and if you engineer what they do you can change the world you can get a better result i would like to leave you with one thought
which is for me the dominant theme of this gathering and is the dominant theme of this way of thinking about the world when people say to you
with i don't know how to do it thank you
i got very nervous halfway through the talk though just panicking whether you'd included in your model the possibility that putting this prediction out there might change the result we've got eight hundred people in
thought about that since i've done a lot of work for the intelligence community they've also pondered that it would be a good thing if
people paid more attention took seriously and engaged in the same sorts of calculations because it would change things but it would change things in two beneficial ways it would hasten
how quickly people arrive at an agreement and so it would save everybody a lot of grief and time
to say people of iran this is your destiny lets go there
well people of iran this is what many of you are going to evolve to want and we could get there a lot sooner and you would suffer
a lot less trouble from economic sanctions and we would suffer a lot less fear of the use of military force on our end and the world would be a better place here 's hoping they
