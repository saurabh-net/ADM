standing in front of an audience is a cross between an out of body experience and a deer caught in the headlights
so please forgive me for violating one of the ted commandments by relying on words on paper and i only hope i 'm not struck by lightning bolts before
i was a student in the sixty s a time of social upheaval and questioning and on a personal level an awakening sense of idealism the war in vietnam was raging the civil rights movement was under way and pictures had a powerful influence on me
our political and military leaders were telling us one thing and photographers were telling us another i believed the photographers and so did millions of other americans
their images fueled resistance to the war and to racism they not only recorded history they helped change the course of history their pictures became part of our collective consciousness and as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience change became not only possible but
i saw that the free flow of information represented by journalism specifically visual journalism can bring into focus both the benefits and the cost of political policies
it puts a human face on issues which from afar can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact what happens at ground level
far from the halls of power
happens to ordinary citizens one by one and i understood that documentary photography has the ability to interpret events from their point of view
it gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice and as a reaction it stimulates public opinion and gives impetus to public debate thereby preventing the interested parties from totally controlling the agenda
much as they would like to coming of age in those days made real the concept that the free flow of information is absolutely vital for a free and dynamic society to function properly
the press is certainly a business and in order to survive it must be a successful business but the right balance must be found between marketing considerations and journalistic responsibility
society 's problems can 't be solved until they 're identified on a higher plane the press is a service industry and the service it provides is awareness every story does not have to sell something
there 's also a time to give that was a tradition i wanted to follow
seeing the war created such incredibly high stakes for everyone involved and that visual journalism could actually become a factor in conflict resolution i wanted to be a photographer in order to be a war photographer
but i was driven by an inherent sense that a picture that revealed the true face of war would almost by definition be an anti war photograph
i 'd like to take you on a visual journey through some of the events and issues i 've been involved in over the past twenty five years
in one thousand nine hundred and eighty one i went to northern ireland ten ira prisoners were in the process of starving themselves to death in protest against conditions in jail
the reaction on the streets was violent confrontation i saw that the front lines of contemporary wars are not on isolated battlefields but right where people live
in guatemala the central government controlled by a oligarchy of european decent was waging a scorched earth campaign against an indigenous rebellion and i saw an image that reflected the history of latin america conquest through a combination of the bible and the sword
an anti sandinista guerrilla was mortally wounded as commander zero attacked a town in southern nicaragua
and was transformed by the energy and spirit of a child
at the same time a civil war was taking place in el salvador and again the civilian population was caught up in the conflict
i 've been covering the palestinian israeli conflict since one thousand nine hundred and eighty one this is a moment from the beginning of the second intifada in two thousand when it was still stones and molotovs against an army
in two thousand and one the uprising escalated into an armed conflict and one of the major incidents was the destruction of the palestinian refugee camp in the west bank town of jenin
without the political will to find common ground the continual friction of tactic and counter tactic only creates suspicion and hatred and vengeance and perpetuates the cycle of violence
a mosque in northern bosnia was destroyed by serbian artillery and was used as a makeshift
dead serbian soldiers were collected after a battle and used as barter for the return of prisoners or bosnian soldiers killed in action
at the same time in south africa after nelson mandela had been released from prison the black population commenced the final phase of liberation from apartheid
one of the things i had to learn as a journalist was what to do with my anger i had to use it channel its energy turn it into something that would clarify my vision instead of clouding it
it was a very old ritual that seemed symbolic of the political struggle that was changing the face of south africa
elsewhere in africa there was famine
in somalia the central government collapsed and clan warfare broke out farmers were driven off their land and crops and livestock were destroyed or stolen starvation was being used as a weapon of mass destruction primitive but extremely effective hundreds of thousands of
people were exterminated slowly and painfully
the international community responded with massive humanitarian relief and hundreds of thousands of more lives were saved american troops were sent to protect the relief shipments but they were eventually drawn into the conflict and after the tragic battle in mogadishu they were
i 'm a witness and i want my testimony to be honest and uncensored
i also want it to be powerful and eloquent and to do as much justice as possible to the experience of the people i 'm photographing this man was in an ngo feeding center being helped as much as he could be helped he literally had nothing
he was a virtual skeleton
yet he could still summon the courage and the will to move he had not given up and if he didn 't give up how could anyone in the outside world ever dream of losing hope
and it was the most uplifting thing i 've ever seen
this man had just been liberated from a hutu death
i think he knew what the scars on his face would say to the rest of the
this time maybe confused or discouraged by the military disaster in somalia the international community remained silent and somewhere around eight hundred thousand people were slaughtered by their own countrymen sometimes their own neighbors using farm implements as weapons
perhaps because a lesson had been learned by the weak response to the war in bosnia and the failure in rwanda
when serbia attacked kosovo international action was taken much more decisively nato forces went in and the serbian army withdrew
ethnic albanians had been murdered their farms destroyed and a huge number of people forcibly deported
they were received in refugee camps set up by ngos in albania and macedonia
the imprint of a man who had been burned inside his own home the image reminded me of a cave
i found a boy from the local orphanage wandering around the front line
my work has evolved from being concerned mainly with war to a focus on critical social issues as well
after the fall of ceausescu i went to romania and discovered a kind of gulag of children where thousands of orphans were being kept in medieval conditions
ceausescu had imposed a quota on the number of children to be produced by each family thereby making women 's bodies an instrument of state economic policy
an aluminum factory in czechoslovakia was filled with carcinogenic smoke and dust and four out of five workers came down with cancer after the fall of suharto in indonesia i began to explore conditions of poverty in a country that was on its way towards modernization
i spent a good deal of time with a man who lived with his family on a railway embankment and had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident
when the story was published unsolicited donations poured in a trust fund was established and the family now lives in a house in the countryside and all their basic necessities are taken care of it was a story that wasn 't trying to sell anything
journalism had provided a channel for people 's natural sense of generosity and the readers responded
i met a band of homeless children who 'd come to jakarta from the countryside and ended up living in a train station by the age of twelve or fourteen they 'd become beggars and drug addicts the rural poor had become the urban poor and in the process they 'd become invisible
these heroin addicts in detox in pakistan reminded me of figures in a play by
isolated waiting in the dark but drawn to the light
i thought it was important to emphasize that people were being helped whether by international ngos or by local grassroots organizations so many children have been orphaned by the epidemic that grandmothers have taken the place of parents and a lot of children had been born with hiv a hospital in zambia
i began documenting the close connection between hiv aids
and tuberculosis this is an msf hospital in cambodia
in the fall of two thousand and four i went to
an msf hospital in a camp for displaced people
i 've been working on a long project on crime and punishment in america
this is a scene from
a prisoner on a chain gang in alabama was punished by being handcuffed to a post in the midday sun
this experience raised a lot of questions among them questions about race and equality and for whom in our country opportunities and options are available
i didn 't see either of the planes hit and when i glanced out my window i saw the first tower burning and i thought it might have been an accident
a few minutes later when i looked again and saw the second tower burning i knew we were
at the time i was photographing in these different places i thought i was covering separate stories but on nine eleven history crystallized and i understood i 'd actually been covering a single story for more than twenty years and the attack on new york was its latest manifestation
the central commercial district of kabul afghanistan at the end of the civil war
shortly before the city fell to the taliban
a taliban fighter shot during a battle as the northern alliance entered the city of kunduz
when war with iraq was imminent i realized the american troops would be very well covered so i decided to cover the invasion from inside baghdad
a marketplace was hit by a mortar shell that killed several members of a single family
