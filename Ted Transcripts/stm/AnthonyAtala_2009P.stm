AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 16.38 27.61 <o,f0,male> this is actually a painting that hangs at the countway library at harvard medical school and it shows the first time an organ was ever transplanted in the front you see actually joe
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 28.40 36.91 <o,f0,male> the patient ready for the transplant while in the back room you see hartwell harrison the chief of urology at harvard actually harvesting the kidney
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 46.96 54.60 <o,f0,male> they were still dealing with a lot of the same challenges as many decades ago certainly many advances many lives saved
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 54.96 69.33 <o,f0,male> but we have a major shortage of organs in the last decade the number of patients waiting for a transplant has doubled while at the same time the actual number of transplants has remained almost entirely flat
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 69.79 77.71 <o,f0,male> that really has to do with our aging population we're just getting older medicine is doing a better job of keeping us alive
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 78.25 86.06 <o,f0,male> but as we age our organs tend to fail more so that's a challenge not just for organs but also for tissues
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 96.89 103.08 <o,f0,male> a very stunning statistic every thirty seconds a patient dies from
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 104.59 112.92 <o,f0,male> that could be treated with tissue regeneration or replacement so what can we do about it we've talked about stem cells tonight
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 114.11 122.21 <o,f0,male> that's a way to do it but still ways to go to get stem cells into patients in terms of actual therapies for
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 123.79 131.55 <o,f0,male> be great if our bodies could regenerate wouldn't it be great if we could actually harness the power of our bodies to actually
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 132.01 140.67 <o,f0,male> heal ourselves it's not really that foreign of a concept actually it happens on the earth every day
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 141.18 154.01 <o,f0,male> this is actually a picture of a salamander salamanders have this amazing capacity to regenerate you see here a little video this is actually a limb injury in this salamander
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 154.27 163.53 <o,f0,male> and this is actually real photography timed photography showing how that limb regenerates in a period of days you see the scar form
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 163.98 173.31 <o,f0,male> and that scar actually grows out a new limb so salamanders can do it why can't we why can't humans regenerate
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 174.27 178.77 <o,f0,male> actually we can regenerate your body
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 180.45 191.41 <o,f0,male> many organs and every single organ in your body has a cell population that's ready to take over at the time of injury it happens every day as you age
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 192.35 203.75 <o,f0,male> you get older your bones regenerate every ten years your skin regenerates every two weeks so your body is constantly regenerating the challenge occurs when there is an injury
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 204.07 211.88 <o,f0,male> at the time of injury or disease the body 's first reaction is to seal itself off from the rest of the body
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 212.33 219.53 <o,f0,male> it basically wants to fight off infection and seal itself whether it's organs inside your body or your skin
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 220.15 227.59 <o,f0,male> the first reaction is for scar tissue to move in to seal itself off from the outside
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 228.07 235.64 <o,f0,male> so how can we harness that power one of the ways that we do that is actually by using smart biomaterials
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 236.46 247.03 <o,f0,male> how does this work well on the left side here you see a urethra which was injured this is the channel that connects the bladder to the outside of the body and you see that it is injured
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 247.71 257.58 <o,f0,male> we basically found out that you can use these smart biomaterials that you can actually use as a bridge if you build that bridge and you close off
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 258.23 265.31 <o,f0,male> from the outside environment then you can create that bridge and cells that regenerate in your body can then
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 265.96 276.26 <o,f0,male> cross that bridge and take that path that's exactly what you see here it's actually a smart biomaterial that we used to actually treat this patient this was an injured urethra
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 276.58 284.10 <o,f0,male> on the left side we used that biomaterial in the middle and then six months later on the right hand side you see this reengineered urethra
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 284.47 294.15 <o,f0,male> turns out your body can regenerate but only for small distances the maximum efficient distance for regeneration is only about one centimeter
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 294.96 305.82 <o,f0,male> so we can use these smart biomaterials but only for about one centimeter to bridge those gaps so we do regenerate but for limited distances
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 306.37 315.50 <o,f0,male> what do we do now if you have injury for larger organs what do we do when we have injuries for structures which are much larger than one centimeter
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 316.33 325.01 <o,f0,male> then we can start to use cells the strategy here is if a patient comes in to us with a diseased or injured organ you can
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 325.47 333.53 <o,f0,male> very small piece of tissue from that organ less than half the size of a postage stamp you can then tease that tissue apart
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 333.86 343.23 <o,f0,male> and look at its basic components the patient 's own cells you take those cells out grow and expand those cells outside the body in large quantities
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 350.88 359.54 <o,f0,male> but actually these materials are fairly complex and they are designed to degrade once inside the body it disintegrates a few months later
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 360.08 367.00 <o,f0,male> acting only as a cell delivery vehicle it's bringing the cells into the body it's allowing the cells to regenerate new tissue
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 367.36 376.57 <o,f0,male> and once the tissue is regenerated the scaffold goes away and that's what we did for this piece of muscle this is actually showing a piece of muscle and how we go through the structures
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 376.95 385.00 <o,f0,male> to actually engineer the muscle we take the cells we expand them we place the cells on the scaffold and we then place the scaffold back into the patient
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 385.33 393.19 <o,f0,male> but actually before placing the scaffold into the patient we actually exercise it we want to make sure that we condition
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 393.50 403.92 <o,f0,male> this muscle so that it knows what to do once we put it into the patient that's what you're seeing here you're seeing this muscle bio reactor actually exercising the muscle back and forth
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 405.80 410.50 <o,f0,male> okay these are flat structures that we see here the muscle
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 411.63 424.60 <o,f0,male> what about other structures this is actually an engineered blood vessel very similar to what we just did but a little bit more complex here we take a scaffold and we basically scaffold can be like a piece of paper here
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 432.70 443.25 <o,f0,male> a blood vessel is made up of two different cell types we take muscle cells we paste or coat the outside with these muscle cells very much like baking a layer cake if you will
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 443.73 450.64 <o,f0,male> you place the muscle cells on the outside you place the vascular blood vessel lining cells on the inside
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 451.11 460.68 <o,f0,male> you now have your fully seeded scaffold you're going to place this in an oven like device it has the same conditions as a human body thirty seven degrees centigrade
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 461.09 472.06 <o,f0,male> ninety five percent oxygen you then exercise it as what you saw on that tape and on the right you actually see a carotid artery that was engineered this is actually the artery that goes from your neck
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 472.23 477.70 <o,f0,male> to your brain and this is an x ray showing you the patent functional blood vessel
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 493.43 500.66 <o,f0,male> they are not nearly as complex as hollow organs hollow organs have a much higher degree of complexity because you're asking these organs to act on
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 502.12 509.49 <o,f0,male> so the bladder is one such organ same strategy we take a very small piece of the bladder less than half the size of a postage stamp
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 509.76 522.28 <o,f0,male> we then tease the tissue apart into its two individual cell components muscle and these bladder specialized cells we grow the cells outside the body in large quantities it takes about four weeks to grow these cells from the organ
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 522.83 530.65 <o,f0,male> take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder we coat the inside with these bladder lining cells we coat the outside
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 530.91 541.34 <o,f0,male> with these muscle cells we place it back into this oven like device from the time you take that piece of tissue six to eight weeks later you can put the organ right back into the patient
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 542.02 556.11 <o,f0,male> this actually shows the scaffold the material is actually being coated with the cells when we did the first clinical trial for these patients we actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient we brought patients in
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 556.63 569.68 <o,f0,male> six to eight weeks prior to their scheduled surgery did x rays and we then composed a scaffold specifically for that patient 's size pelvic cavity for the second phase of the trials we just had different sizes small medium large and extra large
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 574.87 577.09 <o,f0,male> i'm sure everyone here wanted an extra large right
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 579.81 589.59 <o,f0,male> so bladders are definitely a little bit more complex than the other structures but there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it this is actually a heart valve which we
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 590.51 603.81 <o,f0,male> and the way you engineer this heart valve is the same strategy we take the scaffold we seed it with cells and you can now see here the valve leaflets opening and closing we exercise these prior to implantation same strategy
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 604.47 611.73 <o,f0,male> and then the most complex are the solid organs for solid organs they're more complex because you're using a lot more cells per centimeter
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 612.16 625.88 <o,f0,male> this is actually a simple solid organ like the ear it's now being seeded with cartilage that's the oven like device once it's coated it gets placed there and then a few weeks later we can take out the cartilage scaffold
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 626.24 638.98 <o,f0,male> this is actually digits that we're engineering these are being layered one layer at a time first the bone we fill in the gaps with cartilage we then start adding the muscle on top and you start layering these solid structures again
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 639.93 647.35 <o,f0,male> more complex organs but by far the most complex solid organs are actually the vascularized
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 647.72 655.47 <o,f0,male> highly vascularized a lot of blood vessel supply organs such as the heart the liver the kidneys
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 656.15 666.82 <o,f0,male> this is actually an example several strategies to engineer solid organs this is actually one of the strategies we use a printer and instead of using ink we use you just saw and inkjet cartridge
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 667.10 673.91 <o,f0,male> we just use cells this is actually your typical desktop printer it's actually printing this two chamber heart
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 674.15 683.39 <o,f0,male> one layer at a time you see the heart coming out there it takes about forty minutes to print and about four to six hours later you see the muscle cells contract
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 690.93 698.96 <o,f0,male> this technology was developed by tao ju who worked at our institute and this is actually still of course experimental not for use in patients
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 699.74 705.99 <o,f0,male> another strategy that we have followed is actually to use decellularized organs we actually take donor organs
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 717.97 726.73 <o,f0,male> we actually take the donor liver we use very mild detergents and we by using these mild detergents we take all the cells out of the liver
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 727.49 737.70 <o,f0,male> two weeks later we basically can lift this organ up it feels like a liver we can hold it like a liver it looks like a liver but it has no cells
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 738.12 750.61 <o,f0,male> all we are left with is the skeleton if you will of the liver all made up of collagen a material that's in our bodies that will not reject we can use it from one patient to the next we then take this vascular structure
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 751.01 759.36 <o,f0,male> and we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supply you can see actually that's a floroscopy we're actually injecting contrast into the organ
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 759.91 768.70 <o,f0,male> now you can see it start we're injecting the contrast into the organ into this decellularized liver and you can see the vascular tree that remains intact
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 769.06 779.31 <o,f0,male> we then take the cells the vascular cells blood vessel cells we perfuse the vascular tree with the patient 's own cells we perfuse the outside of the liver with the patient 's own liver cells
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 779.53 790.62 <o,f0,male> and we can then create functional livers and that's actually what you're seeing this is still experimental but we are able to actually reproduce the functionality of the liver structure experimentally
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 791.16 802.73 <o,f0,male> for the kidney as i talked to you about the first painting that you saw the first slide i showed you ninety percent of the patients on the transplant wait list are waiting for a kidney
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 803.12 810.60 <o,f0,male> ninety percent so another strategy we're following is actually to create wafers that we stack together like an accordion if you
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 811.14 817.36 <o,f0,male> so we stack these wafers together using the kidney cells and then you can see these miniature kidneys that we've
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 817.95 826.87 <o,f0,male> they are actually making urine again small structures our challenge is how to make them larger and that is something we're working on right now at the institute
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 828.05 836.51 <o,f0,male> the things that i wanted to summarize for you then is what is a strategy that we're going for in regenerative medicine if at all possible
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 836.80 849.08 <o,f0,male> we really would like to use smart biomaterials that we can just take off the shelf and regenerate your organs we are limited with distances right now but our goal is actually to increase those distances over time
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 849.62 857.09 <o,f0,male> if we cannot use smart biomaterials then we'd rather use your very own cells why because they will not reject we can take cells from you
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 865.24 875.27 <o,f0,male> if you present with a diseased wind pipe we'd like to take cells from your windpipe if you present with a diseased pancreas we'd like to take cells from that organ why
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 875.90 886.20 <o,f0,male> because we'd rather take those cells which already know that those are the cell types you want a windpipe cell already knows it's a windpipe cell we don't need to teach it to become another cell type
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 886.47 900.48 <o,f0,male> so we prefer organ specific cells and today we can obtain cells from most every organ in your body except for several which we still need stem cells for like heart liver nerve and pancreas and for those we still need stem cells
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 901.75 909.88 <o,f0,male> if we can not use stem cells from your body then we'd like to use donor stem cells and we prefer cells that will not reject
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 910.36 920.54 <o,f0,male> and will not form tumors and we're working a lot with the stem cells that we published on two years ago stem cells from the amniotic fluid and the placenta which have those properties
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 921.71 931.59 <o,f0,male> so at this point i do want to tell you that some of the major challenges we have you know i just showed you this presentation everything looks so good everything works
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 932.57 940.31 <o,f0,male> these technologies really are not that easy some of the work you saw today was performed by over seven hundred researchers at our institute
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 949.75 966.95 <o,f0,male> so i always like to show this cartoon this is how to stop a runaway stage and there you see the stagecoach driver and he goes on the top panel he goes a b c d e f he finally stops the runaway stage and those are usually the basic scientists the bottom is usually the surgeons
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 970.67 972.97 <o,f0,male> i'm a surgeon so that's not that funny
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 974.41 985.53 <o,f0,male> but actually method a is the correct approach and what i mean by that is that anytime we've launched one of these technologies to the clinic we've made absolutely sure that we do everything we can
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 985.77 996.26 <o,f0,male> in the laboratory before we ever launch these technologies to patients and when we launch these technologies to patients we want to make sure that we ask ourselves a very tough question
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 996.70 1007.05 <o,f0,male> are you ready to place this in your own loved one your own child your own family member and then we proceed because our main goal of course is first to do no harm
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 1007.51 1018.31 <o,f0,male> i'm going to show you now a very short clip it's a five second clip of a patient who received one of the engineered organs we started implanting some of these structures over fourteen years ago
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 1018.55 1027.97 <o,f0,male> so we have patients now walking around with organs engineered organs for over ten years as well i'm going to show a clip of one young lady she had a spina bifida defect
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 1036.36 1038.67 <o,f0,male> actually took care
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 1045.19 1046.28 <o,f0,female> and now i can just go
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 1049.80 1050.44 <o,f0,female> i want
AnthonyAtala_2009P 1 AnthonyAtala_2009P 1052.28 1063.53 <o,f0,male> see at the end of the day the promise of regenerative medicine is a single promise and that is really very simple to make our patients better thank you for your attention
