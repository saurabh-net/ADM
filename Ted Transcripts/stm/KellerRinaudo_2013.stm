KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 17.79 19.35 <o,f0,male> not very many of you
KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 19.45 24.06 <o,f0,male> okay and actually of those hands if you don 't include roomba how many of you have a robot at home
KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 32.56 38.32 <o,f0,male> so we really want to build a robot that anyone can use whether you 're eight or eighty
KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 50.1 51.72 <o,f0,male> and have around their kids
KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 52.1 59.88 <o,f0,male> this robot can 't be creepy or uncanny he should be friendly and cute so meet romo
KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 60.73 71 <o,f0,male> romo 's a robot that uses a device you already know and love your iphone as his brain and by leveraging the power of the iphone 's processor
KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 71.3 73.06 <o,f0,male> we can create a robot
KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 73.27 87.6 <o,f0,male> that is wi fi enabled and computer vision capable for one hundred and fifty bucks which is about one percent of what these kinds of robots have cost in the past when romo wakes up he 's in creature mode
KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 87.9 101.51 <o,f0,male> so he 's actually using the video camera on the device to follow my face if i duck down he 'll follow me he 's wary so he 'll keep his eyes on me if i come over here he 'll turn to follow me if i come over here
KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 107.65 114.46 <o,f0,male> he gets scared just like any other creature so in a lot of ways romo is like a pet that has a mind of his own
KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 130.81 150.05 <o,f0,male> and romo will actually stream video to this device so i can see everything that romo sees and i get a robot 's eye view of the world now this is a free app on the app store so if any of you guys had this app on your phones we could literally right now share control of the robot and play games together so i 'll show you really quickly romo actually he 's streaming video so you can see me and the entire ted audience
KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 159.52 164.61 <o,f0,male> and i can take pictures of you i 've always wanted a picture of a one thousand five hundred person ted audience so i 'll snap a picture
KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 164.61 183.39 <o,f0,male> and in the same way that you scroll through content on an ipad i can actually adjust the angle of the camera on the device so there are all of you through romo 's eyes and finally because romo is an extension of me i can express myself through his emotions so i can go in and i can say let 's make romo excited
KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 185.96 201.92 <o,f0,male> but the most important thing about romo is that we wanted to create something that was literally completely intuitive you do not have to teach someone how to drive romo in fact who would like to drive a robot okay awesome here you go
KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 202.5 218.84 <o,f0,male> thank you scott and even cooler you actually don 't have to be in the same geographic location as the robot to control him so he actually streams two way audio and video between any two smart devices so you can log in through the browser
KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 226.69 235.06 <o,f0,male> who has an iphone and her mom buys her a robot that girl can take her iphone put it on the robot send an email to grandma who lives on the other side of the country
KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 258.74 264.48 <o,f0,male> this is actually something that one of our engineers dom built in a weekend it 's built on top of a google open framework
KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 264.48 279.44 <o,f0,male> called blockly this allows you to drag and drop these blocks of semantic code and create any behavior for this robot you want you do not have to know how to code to create a behavior for romo and you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser which is what you see romo doing on the left
KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 279.44 293.66 <o,f0,male> and then if you have something you like you can download it onto your robot and execute it in real life run the program in real life and then if you have something you 're proud of you can share it with every other person who owns a robot in the world so all of these wi fi enabled robots actually learn from each other
KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 293.66 303.73 <o,f0,male> the reason we 're so focused on building robots that everyone can train is that we think the most compelling use cases in personal robotics are personal they change from
KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 303.73 311.34 <o,f0,male> person to person so we think that if you 're going to have a robot in your home that robot ought to be a manifestation of your own imagination
KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 311.52 317.78 <o,f0,male> so i wish that i could tell you what the future of personal robotics looks like to be honest i have no idea
KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 317.94 335.81 <o,f0,male> but what we do know is that it isn 't ten years or ten billion dollars or a large humanoid robot away the future of personal robotics is happening today and it 's going to depend on small agile robots like romo and the creativity of people like yourselves
