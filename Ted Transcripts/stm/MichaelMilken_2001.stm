MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 13.55 23.93 <o,f0,female> today i would take a few minutes to try to talk about creating value how you can leverage your own capabilities how you might be able to increase
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 24.49 32.18 <o,f0,female> your effectiveness but more than that how you can make the world a better place for you your family your community
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 40.10 48.37 <o,f0,female> even leverage them more so i thought i'd first talk a little bit about financial technology and what it's given the world an opportunity
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 49.31 61.44 <o,f0,female> to look at here and my own life was dramatically affected by my days at berkeley i chose to go there but the free speech movement allowed you to
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 62.41 75.46 <o,f0,female> engage it also provided me a very unusual opportunity my first financing assignment i was able to raise one thousand one hundred dollars to bail seven hundred people out of jail a dollar fifty a person with a fifty dollar deposit
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 85.01 95.78 <o,f0,female> which happened when i was home from berkeley on vacation and the dream capital of the world was on fire troops were in the streets and i learned that civil rights
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 96.17 102.59 <o,f0,female> was a lot more than where you sat on the bus or where you go to school or where you can go to the bathroom but a right
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 102.72 112.06 <o,f0,female> to participate in the american dream and our economic society and i went back to berkeley and created my little formula that what is prosperity
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 112.56 121.71 <o,f0,female> it's a function of having financial technology which serves as a multiplier effect on human capital social capital and real assets
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 122.43 131.70 <o,f0,female> and if we reflect on the last thirty years we see we've accomplished quite a bit sixty two million jobs created in our country
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 132.10 141.19 <o,f0,female> sixty two million new jobs and with the concern about people being laid off today we have the world 's greatest job creation machine
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 141.95 154.00 <o,f0,female> it's millions of small businesses many of which have access to capital through financial technology today that offset the continual drop and loss of jobs by large companies
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 154.63 168.84 <o,f0,female> in fact if you look in the nineteen eighties when financial technology really took hold in the early nineteen eighties you'll see that the spread opened up dramatically small companies access to capital accelerated their job growth
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 169.12 176.71 <o,f0,female> and large companies continued to lay off people and reduce their size the most valuable company in the world today general electric
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 177.18 187.68 <o,f0,female> has increased in value almost twenty five fold in twenty years and employs today twenty five percent less people than it did twenty years ago
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 188.45 197.70 <o,f0,female> well what about other areas not just leveraging economic but one of the real growths in our economy in the united states in the past twenty years has been
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 206.09 214.99 <o,f0,female> and what can we do there now the amount of giving in america has increased dramatically from fifteen billion to one hundred and forty billion
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 215.40 224.56 <o,f0,female> over the past thirty five years however as a percentage of our economy it hasn't really changed that much it's about two percent of our
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 226.14 237.01 <o,f0,female> and so the amount of dollars that are being given is actually pretty small compared to the amount of human capital the amount of time and effort and creativity that our population 's been putting in
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 237.48 245.71 <o,f0,female> but the great growth in our society that many of you have participated in is the growth in private and family foundations
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 246.09 260.14 <o,f0,female> they've grown from twenty two thousand when my brother and i founded the milken family foundation to fifty four thousand today they've grown from about twenty five billion in assets to almost a half a trillion today
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 260.76 269.51 <o,f0,female> how can that half a trillion which is a gigantic number leverage itself in a world economy that dwarfs
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 281.90 289.83 <o,f0,female> but as many of you have participated venture philanthropy has grown up the people tend to be younger different ideas
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 290.16 296.33 <o,f0,female> trying to leverage on their companies assets their assets and their creativity at a very young age
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 297.95 309.16 <o,f0,female> like to take you back eight years briefly and talk about the challenge that i was faced with at cap cure prostate cancer was the most diagnosed cancer in america
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 309.62 323.35 <o,f0,female> no one ever spoke about it and there was little to no research this young man jonathan simons was one of our country 's leading scientists an m d ph d from johns hopkins he chose to go in the field of prostate cancer
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 323.68 332.98 <o,f0,female> he was told by his adviser are you sure you want to do this there's very little money in fact this would be career suicide if you pick this career
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 333.67 342.07 <o,f0,female> luckily for us he went ahead and picked this career and we at cap cure focused on supporting the jonathan simons of the world
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 342.45 352.11 <o,f0,female> today jonathan runs the cancer center at emory university and just received a grant from the woodruff foundation for one hundred million to move there from hopkins
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 366.60 378.34 <o,f0,female> it was projected with an increasing age of our population that this number would dramatically increase over the next eight years to well over fifty five thousand men passing away
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 387.69 397.74 <o,f0,female> in fact the difference in the last eight years between the projected rates and the actual rates amounts to seventy thousand american men
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 398.36 412.37 <o,f0,female> that is the same number of people that saw the superbowl this year in tampa seventy thousand families seventy thousand american men are alive today versus what we had projected just eight years ago
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 414.17 419.64 <o,f0,female> this particular disease and we haven't reached the levels of childhood leukemia
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 420.23 428.87 <o,f0,female> or testicular cancer where we have about a ninety five percent cure rate today in just eight years through increased public awareness
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 429.80 436.88 <o,f0,female> research measured in millions of dollars not billions of dollars we've dramatically changed the outlook
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 437.56 448.34 <o,f0,female> when we formed the milken foundation twenty years ago our major thrust is in education and as i interact with many of you in the audience this is one of your passions
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 449.30 459.74 <o,f0,female> a huge industry the second largest industry in our country how can you change education with a four hundred billion dollars being spent
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 460.17 471.43 <o,f0,female> in k twelve education in our country how can any foundation even the largest have a dramatic effect this was an issue my brother and i faced almost twenty years ago
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 471.88 481.42 <o,f0,female> and our solution was we had to find a way to motivate teachers let communities know that maybe the most important person in their community
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 481.70 488.68 <o,f0,female> was that teacher in first grade kindergarten second grade fifth grade eighth grade in their community single them out
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 499.05 507.49 <o,f0,female> we told them well we've changed a few things so we're going to start at twenty five thousand per teacher if you're a teacher in southern illinois
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 507.92 514.53 <o,f0,female> twenty five years of teaching two master 's degrees that's about your annual pay today
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 525.03 534.41 <o,f0,female> we tried to let the community know that they were the star but more than that we tried to let the teacher know how much we appreciated them
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 534.98 547.00 <o,f0,female> if you ever need to be uplifted join us in september october november on these tours around the country it is an uplifting feeling and a chance to meet america 's heroes every day
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 547.54 558.33 <o,f0,female> like to show you a little film that captures what we tried to do these people that perform their work and their love every day trying to get them in the public
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 559.51 565.52 <o,f0,male> right here in boston for the second year in a row a pittsburgh public school teacher is the winner of a major national award

MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 712.03 719.42 <o,f0,female> one swing through the country is an uplifting feeling we hear about all the problems in education but there is greatness
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 720.72 728.87 <o,f0,female> three million people in our country working we have tried every year to pick those one hundred two hundred three hundred that are shining examples of
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 738.98 747.39 <o,f0,female> and we identified this teacher who had devoted thirty years of his life to education and he had a best friend living next door
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 754.63 763.42 <o,f0,female> his friend was the wealthiest member of the community but did not move over twenty years and still lived in the same house next to his other friend who was a teacher
MichaelMilken_2001 1 MichaelMilken_2001 764.90 777.09 <o,f0,female> well that day the day before he got a call telling him that he had won a major award this teacher and the award had a large financial
