SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 16.77 22.88 <o,f0,female> i was privileged to train in transplantation under two great surgical pioneers
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 31.94 36.32 <o,f0,female> who performed the first liver transplant in the u k in the following year
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 47.11 49.28 <o,f0,female> against all odds
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 55.84 57.96 <o,f0,female> next raising the money
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 90.06 92.67 <o,f0,female> perhaps more important i am
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 100.47 103.99 <o,f0,female> but not all patients on the transplant wait list are so fortunate
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 105.07 120.95 <o,f0,female> the truth is there are just simply not enough donor organs to go around as the demand for donor organs continues to rise in large part due to the aging population the supply has remained relatively constant
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 121.66 125.2 <o,f0,female> in the united states alone one hundred thousand
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 141.99 144.91 <o,f0,female> and the gift of life has been extended
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 156.23 158.39 <o,f0,female> to a relative or loved one
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 158.9 172.04 <o,f0,female> but as there was still a dire shortage of donor organs the gift of life was then extended from living related donors to now living unrelated donors and this then has given rise
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 174.49 176.94 <o,f0,female> and unexpected moral controversy
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 178.1 179.67 <o,f0,female> how can
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 184.68 188.64 <o,f0,female> from one that is forced or coerced from for example
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 189.11 192.18 <o,f0,female> a submissive spouse an in law
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 192.57 195.68 <o,f0,female> a servant a slave an employee
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 200.5 202.64 <o,f0,female> in my part of the world
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 206.99 208.74 <o,f0,female> and in some areas
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 219.54 225.76 <o,f0,female> shortly after i performed the first liver transplant i received my next assignment and that was
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 225.86 231.61 <o,f0,female> to go to the prisons to harvest organs from executed prisoners
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 232.22 242.1 <o,f0,female> i was also pregnant at the time pregnancies are meant to be happy and fulfilling moments in any woman 's life
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 242.63 244.51 <o,f0,female> but my joyful period
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 249.04 251.24 <o,f0,female> thoughts of walking through
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 251.76 254.5 <o,f0,female> the prison 's high security death row
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 254.63 259.53 <o,f0,female> as this was the only route to take me to the makeshift operating room
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 260.49 262.06 <o,f0,female> and at each time
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 269.29 276.84 <o,f0,female> and for two years i struggled with the dilemma of waking up at four thirty am on a friday morning
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 281.78 290.24 <o,f0,female> ready to receive the body of an executed prisoner remove the organs and then transport these organs
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 290.36 292.19 <o,f0,female> to the recipient hospital
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 298.33 300.36 <o,f0,female> no doubt i was informed
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 325.97 328.53 <o,f0,female> at engrafting the gift of life
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 340.39 345.71 <o,f0,female> but really none of us remained the same i was troubled
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 347.15 354.11 <o,f0,female> that the retrieval of organs from executed prisoners was at least as morally controversial
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 354.31 358.43 <o,f0,female> as the harvesting of stem cells from human embryos
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 369.95 372.23 <o,f0,female> for those who have no influence
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 372.64 374.15 <o,f0,female> it made me wonder
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 374.66 378.98 <o,f0,female> if there could be a better way a way to circumvent death
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 379.35 382.16 <o,f0,female> and yet deliver the gift of life
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 394.4 400.4 <o,f0,female> from wide open incisions to keyhole procedures tiny incisions
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 401.53 407.1 <o,f0,female> and in transplantation concepts shifted from whole organs to cells
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 407.26 410.65 <o,f0,female> in one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight at the university of minnesota
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 410.82 419.01 <o,f0,female> i participated in a small series of whole organ pancreas transplants i witnessed the technical difficulty
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 419.22 421.3 <o,f0,female> and this inspired in my mind
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 427.86 430.74 <o,f0,female> i thought to myself why not take
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 430.92 446.54 <o,f0,female> the individual cells out of the pancreas the cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes and transplant these cells technically a much simpler procedure than having to grapple with the complexities of transplanting
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 472.02 476.45 <o,f0,female> pancreatic islet cells captured the attention of the media
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 476.57 478.67 <o,f0,female> and the imagination of the public
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 479.73 484.65 <o,f0,female> i too was fascinated by this new and disruptive cell technology
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 484.76 487.41 <o,f0,female> and this inspired a shift in my mindset
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 487.46 491.63 <o,f0,female> from transplanting whole organs to transplanting cells
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 492.32 494.41 <o,f0,female> and i focused my research
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 495.09 499.47 <o,f0,female> stem cells as a possible source for cell transplants
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 500 505.36 <o,f0,female> today we realize that there are many different types of stem cells
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 505.44 519.39 <o,f0,female> embryonic stem cells have occupied center stage chiefly because of their pluripotency that is their ease in differentiating into a variety of different cell types
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 540.34 542.21 <o,f0,female> inspired
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 555.65 559.84 <o,f0,female> you and i i think would be very happy to get rid of anyway
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 576.87 584.94 <o,f0,female> fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells but adult stem cells are not embryonic stem cells
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 585.24 590.24 <o,f0,female> and here is the limitation adult stem cells are mature cells
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 591.02 594.47 <o,f0,female> and like mature human beings these cells
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 649.12 656.15 <o,f0,female> aging adult cells from you and me they are racing to reprogram these cells back into more useful
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 660.02 662.06 <o,f0,female> we are focused on taking fat
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 663.15 666.53 <o,f0,female> and reprogramming mounds of fat
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 666.78 669.79 <o,f0,female> into fountains of youthful cells
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 679.05 683.07 <o,f0,female> if this research is successful
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 683.61 685.93 <o,f0,female> it may then reduce the need
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 686 690.89 <o,f0,female> to research and sacrifice human embryos
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 692.22 695.43 <o,f0,female> indeed there is a lot of hype but also hope
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 702 709.72 <o,f0,female> heart disease stroke diabetes spinal cord injury muscular dystrophy retinal eye diseases
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 709.8 714.18 <o,f0,female> are any of these conditions relevant personally to you
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 714.63 722.89 <o,f0,female> in may two thousand and six something horrible happened to me i was about to start a robotic operation
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 723.06 729.61 <o,f0,female> but stepping out of the elevator into the bright and glaring lights of the operating room i realized that my left
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 736.37 741.1 <o,f0,female> i had taken a rather hard knock during late spring skiing yes i fell
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 741.13 748.27 <o,f0,female> and i started to see floaters and stars which i casually dismissed as too much high altitude sun exposure
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 758.95 773.24 <o,f0,female> but not before a prolonged period of convalescence three months in a head down position this experience taught me to empathize more with my patients and especially those with retinal diseases
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 774.93 777.3 <o,f0,female> thirty seven million people worldwide
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 791.83 797.35 <o,f0,female> or part vision to millions of patients with retinal diseases worldwide
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 817.15 818.67 <o,f0,female> it is a fact
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 819.19 822.37 <o,f0,female> that when our organs or tissues are injured
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 839.41 845.94 <o,f0,female> stem cells may be used as building blocks to repair damaged scaffolds within our body
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 846.03 850 <o,f0,female> or to provide new liver cells to repair damaged liver
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 869.39 872.92 <o,f0,female> yearly four point eight million suffer
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 896.54 899.36 <o,f0,female> stem cells may one day herald
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 899.52 902.47 <o,f0,female> a quantum leap in the field of cardiology
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 903.26 905.27 <o,f0,female> stem cells provide hope
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 905.34 913.55 <o,f0,female> for new beginnings small incremental steps cells rather than organs repair
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 913.78 915.32 <o,f0,female> rather than replacement

SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 918.07 920.05 <o,f0,female> may one day reduce the need

SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 943.99 947.23 <o,f0,female> the research success that we celebrate today
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 947.28 948.93 <o,f0,female> has been made possible
SusanLim_2010P 1 SusanLim_2010P 949.34 959.64 <o,f0,female> by the curiosity and contribution and commitment of individual scientists and medical pioneers each one has his story
