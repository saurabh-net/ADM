ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 17.6 21.28 <o,f0,female> i remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 22.12 26.96 <o,f0,female> my father was listening to bbc news on his small gray radio
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 28.75 34.03 <o,f0,female> there was a big smile on his face which was unusual then because the news mostly depressed him
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 35.8 37.43 <o,f0,female> the taliban are gone
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 43.56 46.36 <o,f0,female> but i could see that my father was very very happy
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 49.24 51.9 <o,f0,female> you can go to a real school now
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 81.1 82.65 <o,f0,female> to a secret school
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 84.85 87.62 <o,f0,female> it was the only way we both could be educated
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 89.71 92.22 <o,f0,female> each day we took a different route
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 92.56 95.33 <o,f0,female> so that no one would suspect where we were going
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 96.67 101.46 <o,f0,female> we would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 104.87 106.74 <o,f0,female> the school was in a house
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 107.23 111.79 <o,f0,female> more than one hundred of us packed in one small living room
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 112.88 115.5 <o,f0,female> it was cozy in winter but extremely hot
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 125.79 130.58 <o,f0,female> from time to time the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because taliban were suspicious
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 132.15 134.95 <o,f0,female> we always wondered what they knew about us
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 151.89 154.72 <o,f0,female> i was very lucky to grow up in a family
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 155.38 157.86 <o,f0,female> where education was prized
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 157.9 159.51 <o,f0,female> and daughters were treasured
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 161.44 164.4 <o,f0,female> my grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 166.37 172.45 <o,f0,female> a total maverick from a remote province of afghanistan he insisted that his daughter my mom
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 179.74 182.28 <o,f0,female> but my educated mother became a teacher
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 208.41 211.65 <o,f0,female> receive an education including his daughters
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 212.66 214.23 <o,f0,female> despite the taliban
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 214.91 216.49 <o,f0,female> despite the risks
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 229.42 233.09 <o,f0,female> there were times i would get so frustrated by our life
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 233.63 237.07 <o,f0,female> and always being scared and not seeing a future
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 237.78 239.34 <o,f0,female> i would want to quit
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 251.62 259.88 <o,f0,female> your money can be stolen you can be forced to leave your home during a war but the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 262.28 264.6 <o,f0,female> and if we have to sell our blood
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 264.67 266.58 <o,f0,female> to pay your school fees
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 283.83 288.62 <o,f0,female> fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 289.45 293.12 <o,f0,female> and had my family not been so committed to my education i would be one of
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 321.35 325.59 <o,f0,female> he not only brags about my college degree but also that i was the first woman and
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 325.73 329.6 <o,f0,female> and that i am the first woman to drive him through the streets of kabul
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 336.07 338.11 <o,f0,female> my family believes in me
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 351.08 353.32 <o,f0,female> that 's why i cofounded sola
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 359.44 362.5 <o,f0,female> where it 's still risky for girls to go to school
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 363.32 367.41 <o,f0,female> the exciting thing is that i see students at my school
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 367.83 370.4 <o,f0,female> with ambition grabbing at opportunity
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 372.85 374.78 <o,f0,female> and i see their parents
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 374.82 377.36 <o,f0,female> and their fathers who like my own
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 394.51 397.18 <o,f0,female> but ahmed is the father of one of my students
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 398.27 400.68 <o,f0,female> less than a month ago he
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 400.78 404.94 <o,f0,female> and his daughter were on their way from sola to their village
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 423.07 425.64 <o,f0,female> that if he sent his daughter back to school
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 432.76 435.86 <o,f0,female> but i will not ruin my daughter 's
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 436.23 439.5 <o,f0,female> future because of your old and backward ideas
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 441.33 443.78 <o,f0,female> what i 've come to realize about afghanistan
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 444.1 450.76 <o,f0,female> and this is something that is often dismissed in the west that behind most of us who succeed
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 457.8 462.1 <o,f0,female> and who sees that her success is his success
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 462.84 465.25 <o,f0,female> it 's not to say that our mothers aren 't key
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 465.57 473.92 <o,f0,female> in our success in fact they 're often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 474.5 477.87 <o,f0,female> but in the context of a society like in afghanistan
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 477.95 480.03 <o,f0,female> we must have the support of men
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 481.69 484.99 <o,f0,female> under the taliban girls who went to school
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 485.23 488.4 <o,f0,female> numbered in the hundreds remember it was illegal
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 515.79 518.43 <o,f0,female> much beyond the u s troops withdrawal
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 521.2 523.21 <o,f0,female> but when i am back in afghanistan
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 528.98 532.61 <o,f0,female> and their parents who advocate for them who encourage them
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 539.23 544.13 <o,f0,female> to me afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 1 ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X 548.17 550.28 <o,f0,female> and every single day
