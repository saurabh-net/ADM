JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 29.20 41.16 <o,f0,male> transcends all the baggage that normally comes with what people would call sort of a rational conclusion to something and it concludes in something that you see here that you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 42.41 43.07 <o,f0,female> the second
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 44.98 45.65 <o,f0,female> the second
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 46.69 53.28 <o,f0,male> is that this process does not have a signature there is no authorship architects are obsessed with authorship
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 64.06 73.53 <o,f0,male> and the third is that it challenges and this is in the length of this very hard to support why connect all these things but it challenges the high modernist notion of flexibility
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 73.87 81.75 <o,f0,male> high modernists said we will create sort of singular spaces that are generic almost anything can happen within them i call it sort of shotgun flexibility turn your
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 82.42 91.24 <o,f0,male> this way shoot and you're bound to kill something so this is the promise of high modernism within a single space actually any kind of activity can happen but as we're seeing
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 133.04 141.54 <o,f0,male> to talk about i'm going to build up the seattle central library in this way before your eyes in about five or six diagrams and i truly mean this is the design process that you'll see
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 142.16 152.47 <o,f0,male> with the library staff and the library board we settled on two core positions this is the first one and this is showing over the last nine hundred years the evolution of the book and other technologies
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 153.50 167.00 <o,f0,male> this diagram was our sort of position piece about the book and our position was books are technology that's something people forget but it's a form of technology that will have to share its dominance with any other form of truly potent technology or media
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 176.55 188.82 <o,f0,male> had a second responsibility and that was for social roles ok now this i'll come back to later but something actually the librarians at first said no this isn't our mandate our mandate is media and particularly the book
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 217.42 224.45 <o,f0,male> but it meant that whatever issue was troubling the library at that moment was starting to engulf every other activity that was happening in
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 224.82 233.48 <o,f0,male> in this case what was getting engulfed were these social responsibilities by the expansion of the book and so we proposed what's at the lower diagram very dumb approach
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 241.90 250.75 <o,f0,male> of the spectrum of whatever would happen in the future put those in boxes designed specifically for it and put the things that we can't predict on the rooftops so that was the core idea
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 251.42 264.88 <o,f0,male> now we had to convince the library that social roles was equally important to media in order to get them to accept this what you're seeing here is actually their program on the left that's as it was given to us in all of its clarity and glory
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 266.07 271.86 <o,f0,male> our first operation was to re digest it back to them show it to them and say you know what we haven't touched it
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 272.14 282.59 <o,f0,male> but only one third of your own program is dedicated to media and books two thirds of it is already dedicated that's the white band below the thing you said isn't important is already dedicated to social functions
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 282.95 291.65 <o,f0,male> so once we had presented that back to them they agreed that this sort of core concept could work we got the right to go back to first principles that's the third diagram we recombined everything
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 302.23 312.38 <o,f0,male> a series of five platforms sort of combs collective programs and on the right are the more indeterminate spaces things like reading rooms whose evolution in twenty thirty forty years we can't predict
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 312.76 319.79 <o,f0,male> so that literally was the design of the building they signed it and to their chagrin we came back a week later and we presented them this
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 357.77 366.35 <o,f0,male> to give you some sense of the power of this idea the biggest block is what we call the book spiral it's literally built in a very inexpensive way it is a
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 366.75 373.36 <o,f0,male> parking garage for books it just so happens to be in the sixth through tenth floor of the building but that is not necessarily an expensive
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 374.29 387.08 <o,f0,male> approach and it allows us to organize the entire dewey decimal system on one continuous run no matter how it grows or contracts within the building it will always have its clarity to end the sort of trail of tears that we've all experienced
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 390.41 400.21 <o,f0,male> and so this was the final operation which was to take these blocks as they were all pushed off kilter and to hold onto them with a skin that skin serves double duty again for economics
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 400.64 409.10 <o,f0,male> one it is the lateral stability for the entire building it is a structural element but its dimensions were designed not only for structure but also for holding on every piece of glass
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 410.03 420.09 <o,f0,male> the glass was then i'll just use the word impregnated but it had a layer of metal that was called stressed metal that metal acts as a micro louver so from the exterior of the building the sun sees it as totally
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 427.27 433.43 <o,f0,male> see if i can find it for anyone who is gets motion sickness i apologize so this is the building
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 436.40 442.98 <o,f0,male> and i think what's important is when we first unveiled the building the public thought saw it as being totally about
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 466.27 474.27 <o,f0,male> so now we're going into what we call the reading room sorry living room this is actually a program that we invented with the library it was recognizing that public libraries
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 474.57 481.48 <o,f0,male> are the last vestige of public free space there are plenty of shopping malls that allow you to get out of the rain in downtown seattle
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 482.30 491.60 <o,f0,male> but there are not so many free places that allows you to get out of the rain so this was an unprogrammed area where people could pretty much do anything including eat yell play chess and so forth
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 512.93 516.61 <o,f0,male> this is actually the place that we put into the building so i could propose to my wife
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 520.43 520.77 <o,f0,female> she said
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 525.93 529.06 <o,f0,male> running out of time so i'm actually going to stop i can show this to you later but
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 530.63 535.31 <o,f0,male> very quickly get into the book spiral because i think it 's as i said the most this is the main reading room
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 564.39 574.41 <o,f0,male> go back and so i'm going to hit a second project i'm going to go very very quickly through this now this is the dallas theater it was an unusual client for us because they came to us and they said
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 575.07 583.33 <o,f0,male> need you to do a new building we've been working in a temporary space for thirty years but because of that temporary space we've become an infamous theater
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 583.78 589.25 <o,f0,male> company theater is really focused in new york chicago and seattle with the exception of the dallas theater company
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 590.72 604.33 <o,f0,male> and the very fact that they worked on a provisional space meant that for beckett they could blow out a wall they could do cherry orchard and blow a hole through the floor and so forth so it was a very daunting task for us to do a brand new building that could keep the be a pristine building
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 604.64 610.84 <o,f0,male> this kind of experimental nature and the second is they were what we call a multi form theater they do
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 632.46 639.63 <o,f0,male> thought was to literally put the theater on its head to take those things that were previously defined as front of house and back of house and stack them above house and below house
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 651.08 657.19 <o,f0,male> and it allowed us to go back to first principles and redefine fly tower acoustic enclosure light enclosure and so forth
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 658.20 666.74 <o,f0,male> and at the push of a button it allows the artistic director to move between proscenium thrust and in fact arena and traverse and flat floor
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 667.05 677.13 <o,f0,male> in a very quick transfiguration so in fact we can go using operational budget we can sorry capital cost we can actually achieve what was no longer achievable in operational
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 692.32 704.42 <o,f0,male> so an artistic director has the ability to show have a performance that enters in a wagnerian procession shows the first act in thrust the intermission in a greek procession second act in arena and so
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 705.60 712.63 <o,f0,male> i'm going to show you what what this actually means this is the theater up close any portion around the theater actually can be opened discretely
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 715.01 721.63 <o,f0,male> the light enclosure can be lifted separate to the acoustic enclosure so you can do beckett with dallas as the backdrop
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 738.47 747.20 <o,f0,male> you can bring enormous objects in so in fact their the dallas theater company their first show will be a play about charles lindbergh and they'll want to bring in real aircraft
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 747.39 755.06 <o,f0,male> and then it also provides them in the off season the ability to actually rent out their space for entirely different things
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 756.36 758.94 <o,f0,male> this is it at night sorry from a distance
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 767.70 768.01 <o,f0,male> again
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 772.22 784.62 <o,f0,male> is a monster truck show i'm going to show now the last project this also is an unusual client they inverted the whole idea of development they came to us and they said unlike normal developers they said we want to start out by providing
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 795.77 804.80 <o,f0,male> and the fact that they wanted to support the contemporary art museum actually built their pro forma so they worked in reverse and that pro forma led us to a mixed use building
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 805.11 816.08 <o,f0,male> that was very large in order to support their aspirations of the art but it also opened up opportunities for the art itself to collaborate interact with commercial spaces that actually artists more and more want to work within
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 817.05 823.92 <o,f0,male> also charged us with thinking about how to have something that was both a single building and a credible sort of sub building
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 824.79 831.53 <o,f0,male> this is louisville 's skyline and i'm going to take you through various constraints that led to the project first the physical constraints
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 831.91 840.28 <o,f0,male> we actually had to operate on three discrete sites all of them well well smaller than the size of the building we had to operate next to the new muhammad ali center and
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 841.76 848.81 <o,f0,male> operate within the one hundred year floodplain now this area floods three to four times a year and there's a levee behind our site similar to the ones that
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 851.04 853.79 <o,f0,male> have to operate behind the i sixty four corridor
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 855.28 866.10 <o,f0,male> a street that cuts through the middle of these separate sites so these we're starting to build a sort of nightmare of constraints in a bathtub underneath the bathtub are the city 's main power lines
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 867.05 876.84 <o,f0,male> and there's a pedestrian corridor that they wanted to add that would link a series of cultural buildings and a view corridor because this is the historic district that they didn't want to obstruct with the new building
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 878.88 886.87 <o,f0,male> and now we're going to add one point one million square feet and if we did the traditional thing that one point one million square feet these are the different programs
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 897.26 910.90 <o,f0,male> and then we would size all the other elements the different commercial elements hotel luxury housing offices and so forth and dump it on top and we would create something that was unviable in fact and you know this this is called the time warner building
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 923.90 931.14 <o,f0,male> downtown and make circulation connections and reroute the road so that's the basic concept and now i'm going to show you what it leads to
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 933.27 940.79 <o,f0,male> it seems a very formal willful gesture but something derived entirely out of the constraints and again when we unveiled it there was sort of nervousness that this was
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 941.07 946.95 <o,f0,male> an architect making a statement not an architect who was attempting to solve a series of problems
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 947.52 954.57 <o,f0,male> now within that center zone as i said we have the ability to mix a series of things so here you can see that these this sort of an x ray
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 955.04 962.32 <o,f0,male> the towers are totally developer driven they told us the dimensions the sizes and so forth and we focused on taking all the public components the lobbies the bars
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 963.16 972.07 <o,f0,male> everything that the different commercial elements would have and combined it in the center in the sort of subway map in the transfer zone that would also include the contemporary art museum
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 973.07 980.80 <o,f0,male> so it creates a situation like this where you have artists who can operate within an art space that also has an amazing view on the twenty two nd floor
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 999.99 1006.31 <o,f0,male> so how to build this it's very simple it's a chair so we begin by building the cores
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1006.79 1014.37 <o,f0,male> as we're building the cores we build the contemporary art museum at grade that allows us to have incredible efficiency and cost efficiency this is not a high budget building
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1014.96 1021.68 <o,f0,male> the moment the cores get to mid level we finish the art museum we put all the mechanical equipment in it and then we jack it up into the air this is how they build really
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1043.13 1043.30 <o,f0,male> the
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1043.57 1048.48 <o,f0,male> theater is under construction and this project will start construction in about a year and finish in two thousand
