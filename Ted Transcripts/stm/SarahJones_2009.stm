SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 13.56 23.94 <o,f0,female> tell you that when i was asked to be here i thought to myself that well it's ted and these tedsters are you know as innocent as that name sounds these are the
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 50.35 61.15 <o,f0,female> is the great unveiling and so i thought i'd come up here and unveil my real voice to you although many of you already know that i do speak the queen 's english because i am from queens new york
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 63.42 69.93 <o,f0,female> the theme of this session of course is invention and while i don't have any patents that i'm aware of
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 72.31 82.26 <o,f0,female> you will be meeting a few of my inventions today and i suppose it's fair to say that i am interested in the invention of self or selves
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 83.20 92.19 <o,f0,female> all born into certain circumstances with particular physical traits unique developmental experiences geographical and historical contexts but then what
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 93.32 105.71 <o,f0,female> to what extent do we self construct do we self invent how do we self identify and how mutable is that identity like what if one could be anyone at any time
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 106.14 114.87 <o,f0,female> well my characters like the ones in my shows allow me to play with the spaces between those questions and so i've brought a couple of them with me

SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 278.13 286.64 <o,f0,female> yeah i just i can't keep up with whether you can say you know the different things what are you allowed to say or not say i just i don't want to offend anybody

SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 303.58 309.42 <o,f0,female> it's heartening to me even though quite frankly some of your presentations are horrifying absolutely
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 310.65 322.98 <o,f0,female> it's true it's true you know between the environmental degradation and the crashing of the world markets you're talking about and of course we know it's all because of the all the
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 324.24 334.67 <o,f0,female> i don't know how else to say it to you so i'll just say it my way the ganeyvish tetikeyt coming from the governments and the you know the bankers and the wall street you know it anyway
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 336.57 344.86 <o,f0,female> the point is i'm happy somebody has practical ideas to get us out of this mess so i salute each of you and your stellar achievements
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 345.41 358.12 <o,f0,female> thank you for all that you do and congratulations on being such big makhers that you've become ted meisters so happy continued success congratulations mozel
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 398.55 406.45 <o,f0,female> i just i'm sorry i'm just trying not to be nervous because this is a very wonderful experience for me and everything and i just you know i'm not used to doing public speaking and
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 412.64 421.05 <o,f0,female> to calm down and take a deep breath but then on top of that you know sarah jones told me we only have eighteen minutes so then i'm like should i be nervous you know because maybe it's better and i'm just trying not to panic and freak out so i like
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 423.51 431.11 <o,f0,female> so anyway what i was trying to say is that i really love ted like i love everything about this it's amazing like it's i can't get over this right now
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 431.54 440.57 <o,f0,female> and like people would not believe seriously where i'm from that this even exists you know like even i mean i love like the name the ted i mean i know it's a real person and everything but i'm just saying that
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 441.44 450.17 <o,f0,female> you know i think it's very cool how it's also an acronym you know which is like you know is like very high concept and everything like that i like that and actually
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 450.40 464.94 <o,f0,female> i can relate to the whole like acronym thing and everything because actually i'm a sophomore at college right now at my school actually i was part of co founding an organization which is like a leadership thing you know like you guys you would really like it and everything and
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 465.61 478.63 <o,f0,female> the organization is called da bomb and da bomb not like what you guys can build and everything it's like da bomb it means like dominican it's an acronym dominican american benevolent organization for mothers and babies
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 496.01 496.55 <o,f0,female> is
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 500.45 511.33 <o,f0,female> we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise and who also happen to be mothers like me i am a working mother and i also go to school full time
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 511.83 520.48 <o,f0,female> and you know it's like it's so important to have like role models out there i mean i know sometimes our lifestyles are very different whatever but like even at my job like i just got promoted
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 530.28 538.09 <o,f0,female> but i think whether you own your own company or you're just starting out like me like something like this so vital for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 538.39 552.68 <o,f0,female> and if everybody like all people really had access to that it would be a very different world out there as i know you know so i think all people we need that but especially i look at people like me you know like i mean latinos we're about to be the majority
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 555.34 556.58 <o,f0,female> two weeks so
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 557.30 560.68 <o,f0,female> we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 568.74 578.01 <o,f0,female> and i just i love you guys i love ted and if you don't mind privately now in the future i'm going to think of ted as an acronym for technology entertainment and dominicans thank you very much
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 601.42 608.11 <o,f0,female> the older lady you just met very very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother 's side it's a long story believe me
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 612.11 621.45 <o,f0,female> to united nations school where i encountered a plethora of new characters including alexandre my french teacher
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 623.47 631.21 <o,f0,female> you know it was beginner french that i am taking with her you know and it was madame bousson you know she was very
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 633.23 642.24 <o,f0,female> it was like you know she was there in the class you know she was kind of typically french you know she was was very chic but she was very filled with ennui you know and
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 662.22 662.72 <o,f0,female> yes i
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 663.18 671.49 <o,f0,female> german for three years and it was quite the experience because i was the only black girl in the class even in the un school
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 672.81 684.69 <o,f0,female> you know it was wonderful the teacher herr schtopf he never discriminated never he always always treated each of us you know equally unbearably during the class so there were the teachers
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 684.83 693.89 <o,f0,female> and then there were my friends classmates from everywhere many of whom are still dear friends to this day and they've inspired many characters as well
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 695.64 697.29 <o,f0,female> for example a friend of mine
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 712.02 720.28 <o,f0,female> and i wanted to start by telling you that once sarah jones told me that we will be having the opportunity to come here to ted in california
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 721.22 730.65 <o,f0,female> i was very pleased and frankly relieved because you know i am a human rights advocate and usually my work it takes me to washington d c
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 731.01 743.15 <o,f0,female> and there i must attend these meetings mingling with some tiresome politicians trying to make me feel comfortable by telling how often they are eating the curry in georgetown so you can just imagine right
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 744.38 750.03 <o,f0,female> but i'm thrilled to be joining all of you here i wish we had more time together but that's for another time
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 758.78 764.17 <o,f0,female> and sadly i don't think we'll have time for you to meet everybody i brought but
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 767.58 769.93 <o,f0,female> to behave myself it's my first time
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 771.96 778.07 <o,f0,female> but i do want to introduce you to a couple of folks you may recognize if you saw bridge and tunnel
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 779.60 786.05 <o,f0,female> well thank you good evening my name is pauline ning and
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 788.15 794.10 <o,f0,female> i want to tell you that i'm of course i am a member of the chinese community in new york
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 796.09 803.78 <o,f0,female> when sarah jones asked me to please come to ted i said well you know first i don't know
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 805.11 818.68 <o,f0,female> that you know before two years ago you would not find me in front of an audience of people much less like this because i did not like to give speeches because i feel that as an immigrant i do not have
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 819.59 828.29 <o,f0,female> good english skills for speaking but then i decided just like governor arnold schwartzenegger i try anyway
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 833.43 840.16 <o,f0,female> my daughter my daughter wrote that she told me always start your speech with humor but my background
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 840.66 848.28 <o,f0,female> i want to tell you story only briefly my husband and i we brought our son and daughter here in nineteen eighties
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 848.77 858.42 <o,f0,female> to have the freedom we cannot have in china at that time and we tried to teach our kids to be proud of their tradition but it's very
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 859.34 865.14 <o,f0,female> as immigrant i would speak chinese to them and they would always answer me back in english
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 865.91 871.71 <o,f0,female> they love rock music pop culture american culture but when they got older
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 872.03 880.73 <o,f0,female> when the time comes for them to start think about getting married that's when we expect them to realize a little bit more their own culture
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 881.99 889.41 <o,f0,female> that's where we had some problems my son he says he is not ready to get married and he has a sweetheart
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 889.61 897.85 <o,f0,female> but she is american woman not chinese it's not that it's bad but i told him what 's wrong with a chinese woman
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 899.22 906.86 <o,f0,female> but i think he will change his mind soon so then i decide instead i will concentrate on my daughter
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 907.86 918.61 <o,f0,female> the daughter 's marriage is very special to the mom but first she said she's not interested she only wants to spend time with her friends and then
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 919.04 927.39 <o,f0,female> at college it's like she never came home and she doesn't want me to come and visit so i said what 's wrong in this picture
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 928.33 938.83 <o,f0,female> so i accused my daughter to have like a secret boyfriend but she told me mom you don't have to worry about boys because i don't like them
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 941.52 953.38 <o,f0,female> and i said yes men can be difficult but all women have to get used to that she said no mom i mean i don't like boys i like girls i am
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 954.96 963.31 <o,f0,female> so i always teach my kids to respect american ideas but i told my daughter that this is one exception
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 967.91 973.02 <o,f0,female> is not gay she is just confused by this american problem
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 974.82 983.63 <o,f0,female> but she told me mom it's not american she said she is in love in love with a nice chinese girl
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 985.87 990.16 <o,f0,female> so these are the words i am waiting to hear but from my son not my
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 996.22 1000.88 <o,f0,female> i did not know what to do but then over time i have come to understand
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 1002.09 1007.07 <o,f0,female> this is who she is so even though sometimes it's still
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 1009.14 1015.01 <o,f0,female> will share with you that it helps me to realize society is more tolerant
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 1023.91 1030.95 <o,f0,female> so i think maybe ted you impact people 's lives in the ways that maybe even you don't realize
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 1032.60 1039.49 <o,f0,female> for my daughter 's sake i thank you for your ideas worth spreading thank you
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 1051.77 1061.24 <o,f0,female> good evening my name is habbi belahal and i would like to first of all thank sarah jones for putting all of the pressure on the only arab who she brought
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 1062.66 1070.86 <o,f0,female> to be last today i am originally from jordan and i teach comparative literature at queens college
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 1071.30 1076.89 <o,f0,female> it is not harvard but i feel a bit like a fish out of water but
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 1078.17 1086.40 <o,f0,female> i am very proud of my students and i see that a few of them did make it here to the conference so you will get the extra credit i
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 1088.81 1097.49 <o,f0,female> i know that i may not look like the typical denizen as you would say i do like to make the point that
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 1098.68 1107.57 <o,f0,female> we in global society we are never as different as the appearances may suggest so if you will indulge me i will share
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 1107.86 1117.58 <o,f0,female> quickly with you a bit of verse which i memorized as a young girl at sixteen years of age so back in the ancient times
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 1130.52 1130.85 <o,f0,female> and
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 1142.19 1152.43 <o,f0,female> hold your hand i want to hold your hand i want to hold your hand and when i touch you i feel happy inside
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 1152.83 1158.56 <o,f0,female> it's such a feeling that my love i can't hide i can't hide i can't
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 1170.60 1174.14 <o,f0,female> because i was at the same time in my life listening to the
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 1175.70 1185.20 <o,f0,female> on the radio they were very popular so all of that is to say that i like to believe that for every
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 1189.03 1196.86 <o,f0,female> to one another there is always a lyric connecting ears and hearts across the continents in rhyme
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 1197.30 1208.08 <o,f0,female> and i pray that this is the way that we will self invent in time that's all thank you very much for the opportunity okay
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 1228.22 1228.48 <o,f0,female> i
SarahJones_2009 1 SarahJones_2009 1236.10 1250.86 <o,f0,female> here it's been a long time coming and i feel like i'm home and i know i've performed for some of your companies or some of you have seen me elsewhere but this is honestly one of the best audiences i've ever experienced the whole thing is amazing and so don't you all go reinventing yourselves any time soon
