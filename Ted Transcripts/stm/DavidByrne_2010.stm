DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 17.00 25.48 <o,f0,male> the venue where i as a young man some of the music that i wrote was first performed it was remarkably
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 25.63 35.16 <o,f0,male> a pretty good sounding room with all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere it actually sounded pretty good this is a song that was recorded there
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 39.78 40.39 <o,f0,male> in the picture
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 50.78 58.04 <o,f0,male> the nature of the room meant that words could be understood the lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood the sound system was kind of decent
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 59.17 66.44 <o,f0,male> and there wasn't a lot of reverberation in the room so the rhythms could be pretty intact too pretty concise
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 67.21 77.22 <o,f0,male> other places around the country had similar rooms this is tootsie 's orchid lounge in nashville the music was in some ways different but in structure and form
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 77.71 82.46 <o,f0,male> very much the same the clientele behavior was very much the same too
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 84.64 90.11 <o,f0,male> so the bands at tootsie 's or at cbgb 's had to play loud enough
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 92.42 102.50 <o,f0,male> be loud enough to overcome people falling down shouting out and doing whatever else they were doing since then i've played other places that are much nicer i've played
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 103.42 111.61 <o,f0,male> the disney hall here and carnegie hall and places like that and it's been very exciting but i also noticed that sometimes the music that
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 112.66 120.58 <o,f0,male> had written or was writing at the time didn't sound all that great in some of those halls we managed but
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 132.77 138.48 <o,f0,male> specific rooms do i have a place a venue in mind when i write is that a kind of model for
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 138.97 146.97 <o,f0,male> creativity do we all make things with a venue a context in mind okay africa
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 154.57 157.59 <o,f0,male> most of the popular music that we know now
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 157.96 165.61 <o,f0,male> has a big part of its roots in west africa and the music there i would say the instruments the intricate rhythms
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 165.87 176.71 <o,f0,male> the way it's played the setting the context it's all perfect it all works perfect the music works perfectly in that setting there's no big room to
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 177.45 188.61 <o,f0,male> create reverberation and confuse the rhythms the instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification etc etc it's no accident it's perfect for that particular context
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 200.68 201.21 <o,f0,male> this kind of
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 212.79 217.15 <o,f0,male> the room flatters the music it actually improves it this is the room that
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 219.04 221.25 <o,f0,male> some of his music for this is the organ
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 221.77 231.85 <o,f0,male> it's not as big as a gothic cathedral so he can write things that are a little bit more intricate he can very innovatively actually change keys without risking huge
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 275.98 283.38 <o,f0,male> to one another they used to eat drink and yell out to people on the stage just like they do at cbgb 's and places like that if they liked an aria
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 283.70 290.74 <o,f0,male> they would holler and suggest that it be done again as an encore not at the end of the show but immediately and
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 295.47 300.82 <o,f0,male> was an opera experience this is the opera house that wagner built for himself
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 301.40 306.86 <o,f0,male> and the size of the room is not that big it's smaller than this but
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 308.33 316.86 <o,f0,male> wagner made an innovation he wanted a bigger band he wanted a little more bombast so he increased the size of the orchestra pit so he could get more low end instruments
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 341.92 348.95 <o,f0,male> a lot more reverberant than la scala around the same according to alex ross who writes for the new yorker
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 350.66 357.99 <o,f0,male> this kind of rule came into effect that audiences had to be quiet no more eating drinking and yelling at the stage or
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 366.13 376.03 <o,f0,male> a different kind of music worked best in these kind of halls it meant that there could be extreme dynamics which there weren't in some of these other kinds of music
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 386.61 390.07 <o,f0,male> the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic and a little more textural
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 396.49 397.11 <o,f0,male> it looks like
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 402.24 404.18 <o,f0,male> that was bob 's last record
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 417.08 425.77 <o,f0,male> clubs again it's noisy they're playing for dancers there's certain sections of the song the songs had different sections that the dancers really liked and they'd say play that part again
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 453.82 460.30 <o,f0,male> be loud enough to be heard above that same thing goes true for that's the beginning of the century for the
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 460.85 472.46 <o,f0,male> whole of twentieth century popular music whether it's rock or latin music or whatever doesn't really change that much it changes about a third of the way into the twentieth century when this became
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 473.31 483.61 <o,f0,male> one of the primary venues for music and this was one way that the music got there microphones enabled singers in particular and
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 493.83 497.14 <o,f0,male> singers like frank sinatra could use the
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 497.99 504.34 <o,f0,male> and do things that they could never do without a microphone other singers after him
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 504.84 505.71 <o,f0,male> went even further
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 517.52 529.05 <o,f0,male> been impossible without a microphone it would have been impossible without recorded music as well and he 's singing right into your ear he 's whispering into your ear the effect is just electric it's like the guy is
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 529.73 531.46 <o,f0,male> sitting next to you whispering
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 531.99 533.90 <o,f0,male> who knows what into your ear
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 534.86 548.89 <o,f0,male> so at this point music diverged there's live music and there's recorded music and they no longer have to be exactly the same now there's venues like this a discotheque and there's jukeboxes in bars
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 569.92 576.74 <o,f0,male> the dancers liked certain sections more than they did others so there early hip hop guys would loop certain
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 594.53 604.75 <o,f0,male> live performance when it was incredibly successful ended up in what is probably acoustically the worst sounding venues on the planet sports stadiums
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 625.42 637.19 <o,f0,male> that this is what they're writing for the tempos are medium it sounds big it's more a social situation than a musical situation and in some ways the music that they're writing for this
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 637.45 651.53 <o,f0,male> place works perfectly so there's more new venues one of the new ones is the automobile i grew up with a radio in a car but now that's evolved into something else the car is a whole venue
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 662.76 664.31 <o,f0,male> works perfectly on it
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 665.22 669.34 <o,f0,male> it might not be what you want to listen to at home but it works great in the car
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 669.90 679.91 <o,f0,male> has a huge frequency spectrum you know big bass and high end and the voice kind of stuck in the middle automobile music you can share with your friends
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 681.35 689.54 <o,f0,male> there's one other kind of new venue the private mp three player presumably this is just for christian music and
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 694.71 705.39 <o,f0,male> in some ways it's like carnegie hall or when the audience had to hush up because you can now hear every single detail in other ways it's more like the west african music because
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 706.01 715.37 <o,f0,male> if the music in an mp three player gets too quiet you turn it up and the next minute your ears are blasted out by a louder passage so that doesn't really work i think
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 715.93 727.64 <o,f0,male> pop music mainly it's written today to some extent is written for these kind of players for this kind of personal experience where you can hear extreme detail but the dynamic doesn't change that much
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 728.49 736.81 <o,f0,male> so i asked myself okay is this a model for creation this adaptation that we do
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 738.22 738.65 <o,f0,male> and
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 739.75 748.24 <o,f0,male> does it happen anywhere else well according to david attenborough and some other people birds do it too that the birds in the canopy
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 748.59 755.56 <o,f0,male> where the foliage is dense their calls tend to be high pitched short and repetitive
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 756.33 766.17 <o,f0,male> and the birds on the floor tend to have lower pitched calls so they don't get distorted when they bounce off the forest floor and birds like
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 767.03 771.20 <o,f0,male> this savannah sparrow they tend to have a buzzing
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 774.24 779.89 <o,f0,male> call and it turns out that a sound like this is
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 780.28 785.43 <o,f0,male> the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 797.37 805.61 <o,f0,male> the east coast of the united states where the forests are a little denser has one kind of call and the tananger on the other side on the west
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 808.08 808.71 <o,f0,male> a different
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 816.90 825.60 <o,f0,male> do it too and i thought well if this is a model for creation if we make music
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 838.84 849.45 <o,f0,male> is that how it works yeah i think it's evolutionary it's adaptive but the pleasure and the passion and the joy is still there
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 850.53 863.54 <o,f0,male> this is a reverse view of things from the kind of traditional romantic view the romantic view is that first comes the passion and then the outpouring of emotion and then somehow it gets shaped into something
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 864.10 872.05 <o,f0,male> and i'm saying well the passion 's still there but the vessel that it's going to be injected into and poured into
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 872.72 879.51 <o,f0,male> that is instinctively and intuitively created first we already know where that passion is going
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 882.74 889.77 <o,f0,male> but this conflict of views is kind of interesting the writer thomas frank
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 890.82 900.71 <o,f0,male> says that this might be a kind of explanation why some voters vote against their best interests that voters like a lot of us
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 901.28 914.93 <o,f0,male> assume that if they hear something that sounds like it's sincere that it's coming from the gut that it's passionate that it's more authentic and they'll vote for that so that if somebody can fake sincerity if they can fake passion
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 925.27 936.50 <o,f0,male> i'm saying the two the passion the joy are not mutually exclusive maybe what the world needs now is for us to realize that we are like the birds we adapt
DavidByrne_2010 1 DavidByrne_2010 937.47 947.35 <o,f0,male> we sing and like the birds the joy is still there even though we have changed what we do to fit the context thank you very much
