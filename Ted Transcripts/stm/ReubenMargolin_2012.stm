ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 33.8 35.8 <o,f0,male> this is the double raindrop
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 36.29 38.69 <o,f0,male> of all my sculptures it 's the most talkative
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 43.96 54.35 <o,f0,male> it adds together the interference pattern from two raindrops that land near each other instead of expanding circles they 're expanding hexagons
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 60.37 63.26 <o,f0,female> all the sculptures move by mechanical means
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 141.47 143.38 <o,f0,female> a single drop of rain
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 144.29 146.07 <o,f0,female> increasing amplitude
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 193.12 197.38 <o,f0,female> the mechanism that drives it has nine motors and about three thousand pulleys
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 208.21 212.02 <o,f0,female> four hundred and forty five strings in a three dimensional weave
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 212.75 215.1 <o,f0,female> transferred to a larger scale
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 215.71 217.84 <o,f0,female> actually a lot larger with a lot of help
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 218.59 222.05 <o,f0,female> fourteen thousand and sixty four bicycle reflectors
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 223.04 224.91 <o,f0,female> a twenty day install
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 245.1 249.69 <o,f0,female> connected is a collaboration with choreographer gideon obarzanek
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 250.85 253.02 <o,f0,female> strings attached to dancers
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 254.31 260.97 <o,f0,female> this is very early rehearsal footage but the finished work 's on tour and is actually coming through l a in a couple weeks
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 293.44 295.93 <o,f0,female> take your finger and draw this line
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 296.39 298.49 <o,f0,female> summer fall
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 298.55 300.57 <o,f0,female> winter spring
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 312.58 317.55 <o,f0,female> did you know that 's a continuous sheet of cloud that 's dipping in and out of the condensation layer
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 318.77 327.26 <o,f0,female> what if every seemingly isolated object was actually just where the continuous wave of that object poked through into our world
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 352.74 358.75 <o,f0,female> and you might say surely rueben if you took even just the slightest step back the cycles of
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 358.75 364.11 <o,f0,female> hunger and eating waking and sleeping laughing and crying would emerge as pattern
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 365.32 367.2 <o,f0,female> but i would say if i did that
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 368.25 369.9 <o,f0,female> too much would be lost
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 372.38 375.6 <o,f0,female> this tension between the need to look deeper
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 376.76 382.27 <o,f0,female> and the beauty and immediacy of the world where if you even try to look deeper you 've already missed what you 're looking for
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 382.93 388.2 <o,f0,female> this tension is what makes the sculptures move and for me the path between these two extremes
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 388.24 390.02 <o,f0,female> takes the shape of a wave
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 483.83 487.86 <o,f0,female> and does it ever change do you think you 're designing one thing and then when it 's produced it looks like something else
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 495.36 504.44 <o,f0,female> i actually hated it the very moment i turned it on i hated it it was like a really deep down gut reaction and i wanted to throw it out
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 505.03 508.69 <o,f0,female> and i happened to have a friend who was over and he said why don 't you just wait
ReubenMargolin_2012 1 ReubenMargolin_2012 509.08 523.37 <o,f0,female> and i waited and the next day i liked it a bit better the next day i liked it a bit better and now i really love it and so i guess one the gut reactions a little bit wrong sometimes and two it does not look like as expected
