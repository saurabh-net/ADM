LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 17.09 29.41 <o,f0,male> may have heard about the koran 's idea of paradise being seventy two virgins and i promise i will come back to those virgins but in fact here in the northwest we're living very close to the real koranic idea
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 30.97 40.72 <o,f0,female> defined thirty six times as gardens watered by running streams since i live on a houseboat on the running stream of lake union
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 41.53 47.25 <o,f0,female> this makes perfect sense to me but the thing is how come it's news to most people
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 48.03 55.78 <o,f0,female> i know many well intentioned non muslims who 've begun reading the koran but given up disconcerted by its otherness
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 56.19 69.44 <o,f0,male> the historian thomas carlyle considered muhammad one of the world 's greatest heroes yet even he called the koran as toilsome reading as i ever undertook a wearisome confused jumble
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 71.21 82.47 <o,f0,male> part of the problem i think is that we imagine that the koran can be read as we usually read a book as though we can curl up with it on a rainy afternoon with a bowl of popcorn within reach
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 82.81 90.06 <o,f0,male> as though god and the koran is entirely in the voice of god speaking to muhammad were just another author on the best
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 103.61 112.81 <o,f0,male> phrases and snippets taken out of context in what i call the highlighter version which is the one favored by both muslim fundamentalists and anti muslim
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 114.46 126.16 <o,f0,male> so this past spring as i was gearing up to begin writing a biography of muhammad i realized i needed to read the koran properly as properly as i could
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 127.35 141.48 <o,f0,male> my arabic 's reduced by now to wielding a dictionary so i took four well known translations and decided to read them side by side verse by verse along with a transliteration and the original seventh century arabic
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 144.35 145.29 <o,f0,female> now i did have
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 145.69 147.34 <o,f0,female> an advantage
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 147.96 155.64 <o,f0,male> my last book was about the story behind the shia sunni split and for that i'd worked closely with the earliest islamic histories
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 155.95 165.33 <o,f0,male> so i knew the events to which the koran constantly refers its frame of reference i knew enough that is to know that i'd be a tourist in the
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 165.71 174.88 <o,f0,female> koran an informed one an experienced one even but still an outsider an agnostic jew reading
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 178.74 180.39 <o,f0,female> so i read slowly
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 184.99 190.51 <o,f0,male> set aside three weeks for this project and that i think is what is meant by hubris because
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 194.50 196.43 <o,f0,male> it turned out to be three months
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 198.65 203.70 <o,f0,male> i did resist the temptation to skip to the back where the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 204.29 212.24 <o,f0,male> but every time i thought i was beginning to get a handle on the koran that feeling of i get it now it would slip away overnight and
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 212.91 219.98 <o,f0,male> in the morning wondering if i wasn't lost in a strange land and yet the terrain was very familiar
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 220.65 231.85 <o,f0,male> the koran declares that it comes to renew the message of the torah and the gospels so one third of it reprises the stories of biblical figures like abraham moses joseph mary
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 232.55 243.02 <o,f0,female> jesus god himself was utterly familar from his earlier manifestation as yahweh jealously insisting on no other gods
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 243.98 252.51 <o,f0,female> the presence of camels mountains desert wells and springs took me back to the year i spent wandering the sinai desert
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 253.25 265.14 <o,f0,female> and then there was the language the rhythmic cadence of it reminding me of evenings spent listening to bedouin elders recite hours long narrative poems entirely from memory
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 266.17 274.92 <o,f0,female> and i began to grasp why it's said that the koran is really the koran only in arabic
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 275.95 283.83 <o,f0,female> take the faatihah the seven verse opening chapter that is the lord 's prayer and the shema israel of islam combined
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 284.42 295.34 <o,f0,female> it's just twenty nine words in arabic but anywhere from sixty five to seventy two in translation and yet the more you add the more seems to go missing
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 296.23 303.04 <o,f0,female> the arabic has an incantatory almost hypnotic quality that begs to be heard rather than
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 306.59 316.39 <o,f0,female> it wants to be chanted out loud to sound its music in the ear and on the tongue so the koran in english is a kind of shadow of itself
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 318.03 325.84 <o,f0,female> called his version an interpretation but all is not lost in translation
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 326.14 336.61 <o,f0,male> as the koran promises patience is rewarded and there are many surprises a degree of environmental awareness for instance and of humans as mere stewards of god 's creation
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 337.43 349.11 <o,f0,female> unmatched in the bible and where the bible is addressed exclusively to men using the second and third person masculine the koran includes women talking for instance of
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 349.39 355.68 <o,f0,female> believing men and believing women honorable men and honorable women
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 356.34 364.94 <o,f0,female> or take the infamous verse about killing the unbelievers yes it does say that but in a very specific context
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 365.67 372.01 <o,f0,female> the anticipated conquest of the sanctuary city of mecca where fighting was usually forbidden
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 372.54 384.90 <o,f0,female> and the permission comes hedged about with qualifiers not you must kill unbelievers in mecca but you can you are allowed to but only after a grace period is over
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 385.52 392.18 <o,f0,female> and only if there's no other pact in place and only if they try to stop you getting to the kaaba and
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 393.68 401.65 <o,f0,female> you first and even then god is merciful forgiveness is supreme and so essentially
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 403.08 403.80 <o,f0,female> better if you
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 417.85 427.64 <o,f0,female> some of these verses are definite in meaning it says and others are ambiguous the perverse at heart will seek out the ambiguities
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 436.38 441.35 <o,f0,female> the phrase god is subtle appears again and again and indeed the whole
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 443.17 449.60 <o,f0,female> most of us have been led to believe as in for instance that little matter of virgins and
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 451.86 458.48 <o,f0,female> old fashioned orientalism comes into play here the word used four times is
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 461.11 468.07 <o,f0,female> as dark eyed maidens with swelling breasts or as fair high bosomed virgins
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 469.33 476.56 <o,f0,female> yet all there is in the original arabic is that one word houris not a swelling breast nor a high bosom in
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 479.80 489.67 <o,f0,female> now this may be a way of saying pure beings like in angels or it may be like the greek kouros or kara an eternal youth but the truth is
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 491.41 499.25 <o,f0,female> and that's the point because the koran is quite clear when it says that you'll be a new creation
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 500.97 508.43 <o,f0,female> and that you will be recreated in a form unknown to you which seems to me a far more appealing prospect
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 518.72 520.65 <o,f0,male> number seventy two never
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 522.66 533.34 <o,f0,male> seventy two virgins in the koran that idea only came into being three hundred years later and most islamic scholars see it as the equivalent of people with wings sitting on
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 534.48 540.97 <o,f0,female> harps paradise is quite the opposite it's not
LesleyHazleton_2010X 1 LesleyHazleton_2010X 544.18 549.05 <o,f0,female> it's plenty it's gardens watered by
