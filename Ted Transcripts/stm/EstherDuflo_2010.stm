EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 18.43 24.68 <o,f0,female> so here it is you can check i am short i'm french i have a pretty strong french accent so that's going to be clear in a moment
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 26.45 33.85 <o,f0,female> maybe sobering thought and something you all know about and i suspect many of you gave something to the people of haiti this
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 36.35 42.40 <o,f0,female> something else that i believe in the back of your mind you also know is
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 43.40 48.29 <o,f0,female> twenty five thousand children die of entirely preventable causes
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 51.56 60.57 <o,f0,female> and i suspect that many of you probably gave something towards that problem as well but somehow it doesn't happen with the same intensity so why is that
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 62.38 64.37 <o,f0,female> well here is a thought experiment for you
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 85.33 98.40 <o,f0,female> do you believe the people who tell you that aid is not going to help on the contrary it might hurt it might exacerbate corruption dependence etc or maybe you turn to the past after all we have spent billions of
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 99.95 102.51 <o,f0,female> maybe you look at the past and see has it done any good
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 103.39 107.25 <o,f0,female> and sadly we don't know and worst of all we
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 119.85 126.65 <o,f0,female> how do you know what would have happened without the aid maybe it would have been much worse or maybe it would have been better
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 127.98 136.88 <o,f0,female> idea we don't know what the counterfactual is there's only one africa so what do you do to give the aid and hope and pray that something
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 139.28 145.07 <o,f0,female> do you focus on your everyday life and let the earthquake every eight days continue to happen
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 145.95 150.57 <o,f0,female> is if we don't know whether we are doing any good we are not any
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 183.59 188.95 <o,f0,female> every year at least twenty five million children do not get the immunization they should get
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 190.10 203.84 <o,f0,female> so this is what you call a last mile problem the technology is there the infrastructure is there and yet it doesn't happen so you have your million how do you use your million to solve this last mile problem
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 204.90 206.73 <o,f0,female> and here 's another question
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 209.50 221.29 <o,f0,female> nine hundred thousand people every year most of them in sub saharan africa most of them under five in fact that is the leading cause of under five mortality we already know how to
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 244.18 247.98 <o,f0,female> the other half also benefits because the contagion of the disease spread
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 248.88 259.95 <o,f0,female> and yet only a quarter of kids at risk sleep under a net societies should be willing to go out and subsidize the net give them for free or for that matter pay people to use them because of those contagion benefits
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 261.08 262.51 <o,f0,female> not so fast say other people
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 273.92 280.27 <o,f0,female> to give the nets for free to maximize coverage or do you make people pay in order to make sure that they really value
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 294.93 300.13 <o,f0,female> so here is the thing i cannot answer the big question whether aid did any good or not
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 331.33 340.26 <o,f0,female> and in this way you can take the guesswork out of policy making by knowing what works what doesn't work and why
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 358.92 372.21 <o,f0,female> now it's not because the vaccines are not there they are there and they are free and it's not because parents do not care about their kids the same child that is not immunized against measles if they do measles parents will spend thousands of rupees to help them
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 373.05 386.27 <o,f0,female> so you get these empty village sub centers and crowded hospitals so what is the problem well part of the problem surely is that people do not fully understand after all in this country as well all sorts of myths and misconceptions go
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 397.83 404.96 <o,f0,female> to action imagine you are a mother in udaipur district rajasthan you have to walk a few kilometers to get your kids immunized
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 419.89 425.77 <o,f0,female> because a we can make it easy and b we can maybe give people a reason to act
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 428.89 431.83 <o,f0,female> so these are simple ideas but we didn't know so let 's try them
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 432.44 436.76 <o,f0,female> so what we did is we did a randomized controlled trial in one hundred and thirty four villages in
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 438.23 450.86 <o,f0,female> so the blue dots are selected randomly we made it easy i'll tell you in a moment in the red dots we made it easy and gave people a reason to act now the white dots are comparisons nothing changed
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 451.99 456.60 <o,f0,female> so we made it easy by organizing this monthly camp where people can get their kids immunized
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 457.64 460.99 <o,f0,female> and then you make it easy and give a reason to act now
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 467.07 469.06 <o,f0,female> it's never going to convince anybody
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 469.21 476.73 <o,f0,female> to do something that they don't want to do on the other hand if your problem is you tend to postpone then it might give you a reason to act today
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 524.34 536.39 <o,f0,female> should you give them for free or should you ask people to pay for them so the answer hinges on the answer to three simple questions one is if people must pay for a bed net are they going to purchase them
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 537.46 543.94 <o,f0,female> one is if i give bed nets for free are people going to use them and the third one is
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 544.24 553.60 <o,f0,female> do free bed nets discourage future purchase the third one is important because if we think people get used to handouts it might destroy markets to distribute free bed nets
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 554.93 559.28 <o,f0,female> now this is a debate that has generated a lot of emotion and angry rhetoric it's
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 560.68 574.00 <o,f0,female> it turns out it's an easy question we can know the answer to this question we can just run an experiment and many experiments and they all have the same results so i'm just going to talk to you about one and this one that was in kenya
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 583.20 591.22 <o,f0,female> and some people get one hundred percent discount and some people twenty percent discounts and some people get fifty percent discounts etc and now we can see what
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 592.41 592.84 <o,f0,female> so how
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 594.33 601.43 <o,f0,female> what you can see is that when people have to pay for their bed nets the coverage rate really falls down a lot
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 601.77 610.67 <o,f0,female> so even with partial subsidy three dollars is still not the full cost of a bed net and now you only have twenty percent of the people with the bed nets you lose the health immunity that's not great
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 626.65 631.99 <o,f0,female> who got the free bed nets one year later were offered the option to purchase a bed net
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 633.37 644.73 <o,f0,female> and people who got the free one were actually more likely to purchase the second one than people who didn't get a free one so people do not get used to handouts they get used to nets maybe we need to give them
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 648.78 652.54 <o,f0,female> nets so you will think that 's great you know how to immunize you know how to give bed nets
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 663.33 664.56 <o,f0,female> to get kids into school
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 687.93 688.70 <o,f0,female> for example
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 692.48 697.41 <o,f0,female> were invented in britain before the industrial revolution goods used to go on
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 706.74 712.58 <o,f0,female> so should they have continued to carry the goods on the horse carts on the ground that they would eventually get there
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 713.46 716.59 <o,f0,female> if that had been the case there would have been no industrial revolution
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 717.34 718.69 <o,f0,female> so why shouldn 't we do the same with
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 720.34 727.51 <o,f0,female> in technology we spend so much time experimenting fine tuning getting the absolute cheapest way to do something so why aren't we doing that
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 737.43 744.11 <o,f0,female> how many extra years of education do you get for your hundred dollars now i'm going to show you what we get
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 752.74 758.63 <o,f0,female> and that's not bad for your hundred dollars you get between one and three extra years of education
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 767.39 774.35 <o,f0,female> the most surprising results tell people the benefits of education that's very cheap to do
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 774.55 781.84 <o,f0,female> so for every hundred dollars you spend doing that you get forty extra years of education and
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 785.17 791.44 <o,f0,female> the kids of their worms and for every hundred dollars you get almost thirty extra years of education
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 792.04 801.91 <o,f0,female> so this is not your intuition this is not what people would have gone for and yet these are the programs that work we need that kind of information we need more of it and then we need to guide
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 804.88 815.20 <o,f0,female> so now i started from the big problem and i couldn't answer it and i cut it into smaller questions and i have the answer to these smaller questions and they are good scientific robust answers so
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 816.59 818.33 <o,f0,female> let 's go back to haiti for a moment
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 820.05 823.39 <o,f0,female> in haiti about two hundred thousand people died
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 836.80 845.79 <o,f0,female> but if we were willing to spend ten thousand dollars for every child under five who dies that would be ninety billion per year just
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 852.08 856.69 <o,f0,female> of the problem is that in haiti although the problem is huge somehow we understand it it's
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 857.63 865.95 <o,f0,female> you give your money to doctors without borders you give your money to partners in health and they'll send in the doctors and they'll send in the lumber and they'll helicopter things out and
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 869.91 881.93 <o,f0,female> so first it's mostly invisible second it's huge and third we don't know whether we're doing the right thing there's no silver bullet you cannot helicopter people out of poverty and that's very frustrating
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 905.92 907.18 <o,f0,female> we can get started
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 912.78 921.07 <o,f0,female> here 's an example of how this can be powerful deworming worms have a little bit of a problem grabbing the headlines they are not beautiful and don't kill anybody
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 933.38 938.29 <o,f0,female> in two thousand and nine so this evidence is powerful it can prompt action
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 939.11 952.96 <o,f0,female> so we should get started now now it's not going to be easy it's a very slow process you have to keep experimenting and sometimes ideology has to be trumped by practicality and sometimes what works somewhere doesn't work elsewhere so it's a slow process
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 956.39 961.64 <o,f0,female> i'm proposing it's like twentieth century medicine it's a slow deliberative process
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 973.70 976.36 <o,f0,female> and now maybe we can go back to the bigger question
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 976.70 978.49 <o,f0,female> that i started with at the beginning
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 979.59 988.26 <o,f0,female> i cannot tell you whether the aid we have spent in the past has made a difference but can we come back here in thirty years and say
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 988.91 991.59 <o,f0,female> we have done it really prompted a change for the better
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 994.53 996.60 <o,f0,female> and i hope we will thank you
