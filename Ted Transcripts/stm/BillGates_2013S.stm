BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 15.46 18.28 <o,f0,male> it doesn 't matter whether you 're a basketball player
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 18.85 21.91 <o,f0,male> a tennis player a gymnast
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 38.75 41.85 <o,f0,male> we all need people who will give us feedback
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 41.92 43.85 <o,f0,male> that 's how we improve
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 44.49 56.31 <o,f0,male> unfortunately there 's one group of people who get almost no systematic feedback to help them do their jobs better and these people have one of the most important jobs in the world
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 56.74 58.82 <o,f0,male> i 'm talking about teachers
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 59.2 72.49 <o,f0,male> when melinda and i learned how little useful feedback most teachers get we were blown away until recently over ninety eight percent of teachers just got one word of feedback
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 73.07 75 <o,f0,male> satisfactory
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 75.69 84.7 <o,f0,male> if all my bridge coach ever told me was that i was satisfactory i would have no hope of ever getting better how would i know
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 101.69 104.05 <o,f0,male> our teachers deserve better
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 104.99 113.62 <o,f0,male> the system we have today isn 't fair to them it 's not fair to students and it 's putting america 's global leadership at risk
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 114.33 125.7 <o,f0,male> so today i want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the tools for improvement they want and deserve let 's start by asking who 's doing well
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 141.96 144.94 <o,f0,male> consider the rankings for reading proficiency
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 145.3 154.58 <o,f0,male> the u s isn 't number one we 're not even in the top ten we 're tied for fifteenth with iceland and poland
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 154.9 163.96 <o,f0,male> now out of all the places that do better than the u s in reading how many of them have a formal system for helping teachers improve
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 175 187.4 <o,f0,male> so there 's really only one area where we 're near the top and that 's in failing to give our teachers the help they need to develop their skills let 's look at the best academic performer
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 187.59 203.85 <o,f0,male> the province of shanghai china now they rank number one across the board in reading math and science and one of the keys to shanghai 's incredible success is the way they help teachers keep improving
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 203.97 221.05 <o,f0,male> they made sure that younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work they have weekly study groups where teachers get together and talk about what 's working they even require each teacher to observe and give feedback to their colleagues
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 221.69 225.6 <o,f0,male> you might ask why is a system like this so important
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 225.64 229.76 <o,f0,male> it 's because there 's so much variation in the teaching profession
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 230.05 234.29 <o,f0,male> some teachers are far more effective than others
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 234.34 249.34 <o,f0,male> in fact there are teachers throughout the country who are helping their students make extraordinary gains if today 's average teacher could become as good as those teachers our students would be blowing away the rest of the world
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 249.55 254.08 <o,f0,male> so we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 254.57 256.29 <o,f0,male> what would that system look like
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 256.74 258.48 <o,f0,male> well to find out
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 268.36 283.67 <o,f0,male> we had observers watch videos of teachers in the classroom and rate how they did on a range of practices for example did they ask their students challenging questions did they find multiple ways to explain an idea
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 283.78 295.46 <o,f0,male> we also had students fill out surveys with questions like does your teacher know when the class understands a lesson do you learn to correct your mistakes
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 295.76 299.51 <o,f0,male> and what we found is very exciting first
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 299.65 302.99 <o,f0,male> the teachers who did well on these observations
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 322.54 325.94 <o,f0,male> i want to show you what this video component of met
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 326.2 329.91 <o,f0,male> looks like in action
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 346.29 359.65 <o,f0,female> my name is sarah brown wessling i am a high school english teacher at johnston high school in johnston iowa turn to somebody next to you tell them what you think i mean when i talk about moves to prove i 've talk about i think that there is a difference for teachers between
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 359.65 374.83 <o,f0,female> the abstract of how we see our practice and then the concrete reality of it okay so i would like you to please bring up your papers i think what video offers for us is a certain degree of reality you can 't really dispute what you see on the video
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 374.83 381.13 <o,f0,female> and there is a lot to be learned from that and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a profession
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 381.13 389.6 <o,f0,female> when we actually get to see this i just have a flip camera and a little tripod and invested in this tiny little wide angle lens
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 389.6 407.99 <o,f0,female> at the beginning of class i just perch it in the back of the classroom it 's not a perfect shot it doesn 't catch every little thing that 's going on but i can hear the sound i can see a lot and i 'm able to learn a lot from it so it really has been a simple but powerful tool in my own reflection
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 410.72 426.27 <o,f0,female> once i 'm finished taping then i put it in my computer and then i 'll scan it and take a peek at it if i don 't write things down i don 't remember them so having the notes is a part of my thinking process and i discover what i 'm seeing as i 'm writing
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 453.19 458.27 <o,f0,female> and then help our broader communities understand what this complex work is really all about
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 459.8 473.86 <o,f0,female> i think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate things that we cannot convey in a lesson plan things you cannot convey in a standard things that you cannot even sometimes convey in a book of pedagogy
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 490.86 493.4 <o,f0,male> but we still have more work to do
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 493.42 498.23 <o,f0,male> diagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve is only half the battle
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 498.81 503.18 <o,f0,male> we also have to give them the tools they need to act on the diagnosis
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 503.56 513.17 <o,f0,male> if you learn that you need to improve the way you teach fractions you should be able to watch a video of the best person in the world teaching fractions
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 513.22 519.08 <o,f0,male> so building this complete teacher feedback and improvement system won 't be easy
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 519.53 525.72 <o,f0,male> for example i know some teachers aren 't immediately comfortable with the idea of a camera in the classroom
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 526.52 529.82 <o,f0,male> that 's understandable but our experience with met
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 530.04 547.78 <o,f0,male> suggests that if teachers manage the process if they collect video in their own classrooms and they pick the lessons they want to submit a lot of them will be eager to participate building this system will also require a considerable investment
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 548.69 553.93 <o,f0,male> our foundation estimates that it could cost up to five billion dollars
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 554.23 564.35 <o,f0,male> now that 's a big number but to put it in perspective it 's less than two percent of what we spend every year on teacher salaries
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 564.74 567.78 <o,f0,male> the impact for teachers would be phenomenal
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 567.94 572 <o,f0,male> we would finally have a way to give them feedback
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 572.17 574.43 <o,f0,male> as well as the means to act on it
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 574.87 591.74 <o,f0,male> but this system would have an even more important benefit for our country it would put us on a path to making sure all our students get a great education find a career that 's fulfilling and rewarding and have a chance to live out their dreams
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 591.95 596.33 <o,f0,male> this wouldn 't just make us a more successful country
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 596.54 601.05 <o,f0,male> it would also make us a more fair and just one too
BillGates_2013S 1 BillGates_2013S 602.06 608.58 <o,f0,male> i 'm excited about the opportunity to give all our teachers the support they want and deserve
