ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 31.09 36.29 <o,f0,male> and they've been dogging me for a year i got to tell you it's driving me nuts actually sometimes i wake up in the middle of
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 43.47 51.43 <o,f0,male> when i was fifteen i found this
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 76.14 84.12 <o,f0,male> what it looks like so what's unique about the site is that it's anonymous and it has no memory there's no archive
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 84.81 95.94 <o,f0,male> are no barriers there's no registration these things that we're used to with forums don't exist on four chan and that's led to this discussion that's completely raw completely unfiltered
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 106.88 115.91 <o,f0,male> the largest memes that have come out of this site some of you might be familiar with are these lolcats just silly pictures of cats with text and this resonates with millions
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 116.64 123.72 <o,f0,male> there are tens of thousands of these and there is a whole blogging empire now dedicated to pictures like these and
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 124.75 132.49 <o,f0,male> rick astley 's kind of rebrith these past two years rickroll was this bait and switch really simple classic bait and switch
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 150.72 162.85 <o,f0,male> there are thousands of memes that come out of the site there are a handful that have escaped into the mainstream the ones i've just shown you but every day every month people are producing thousands of these
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 163.85 171.84 <o,f0,male> like this have rules we do they're the codified rules that i've come up with which are more or less ignored by the community
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 172.09 180.81 <o,f0,male> and so they've come up with their own set of rules the rules of the internet and so there are three that i want to show you specifically rule one is you don't talk about b
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 181.91 183.30 <o,f0,male> two is you do not talk about
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 192.04 195.88 <o,f0,male> i will spare you that slide i assure you it is very true
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 197.31 209.25 <o,f0,male> b is the first board we started with and it is in many ways the beating heart of the website it is where a third of all the traffic is going and b is known for
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 209.59 217.39 <o,f0,male> more than anything not just the memes they've created but the exploits and chris just touched on one of those a second ago and that was
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 217.99 231.13 <o,f0,male> the time one hundred poll so somebody at time at the magazine thought it would be fun to nominate me for this thing they did last year and so they placed me on it and the internet got wind of it my community
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 234.41 239.87 <o,f0,male> i didn't instruct them to do it they just decided that that's what they wanted and so you know three hundred and ninety percent approval rating ain't so
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 240.01 241.65 <o,f0,female> bad
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 242.70 244.51 <o,f0,female> so they broke that
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 244.86 249.46 <o,f0,male> and i ended up on top i ended up at this really fancy party
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 250.68 260.52 <o,f0,male> but that's not what's interesting about this it's that they weren't putting me at the top of this list they were actually it got so sophisticated to the point where they gamed
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 260.86 262.39 <o,f0,male> all of the top twenty one
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 263.44 266.41 <o,f0,male> places to spell marblecake also the game
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 269.77 272.59 <o,f0,female> the amount of time and effort that went into that is
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 284.95 295.34 <o,f0,male> very famously scientology and so the story is scientology had this embarrassing video of tom cruise it went up online they got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the internet
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 320.47 329.21 <o,f0,male> so we've got this activist group that's this grassroots group that's come out of the site and last i'm going to show you the example the story of dusty the cat
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 330.25 334.62 <o,f0,male> is the name that we've given to this cat this young man
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 347.02 349.19 <o,f0,male> for people to do something about this
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 350.81 364.37 <o,f0,male> so what they did is they i mean they put c s i to shame here the internet detectives came out they matched they found his myspace they took the youtube video and they mashed everything in the video and within twenty four hours they had his name
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 365.69 369.11 <o,f0,male> and within forty eight hours he was arrested
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 385.82 396.15 <o,f0,male> sites like it are kind of going the way of the dinosaur right now they're endangered because we're moving towards social networking we're moving towards persistent identity we're moving towards
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 397.43 405.36 <o,f0,male> you know a lack of privacy really we're sacrificing a lot of that and i think in doing so moving towards those things we're losing something valuable
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 415.60 415.87 <o,f0,female> you
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 423.42 424.67 <o,f0,female> that this is not being
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 424.99 426.33 <o,f0,female> streamed to them live right now
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 426.64 430.57 <o,f0,male> well you never know some of them we've got people in seventy five countries
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 433.16 433.70 <o,f0,male> tell
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 457.67 468.75 <o,f0,female> yes and no i mean for as much good that kind of comes out of this environment there is plenty of bad there are plenty of downsides but i think that the greater good is
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 494.80 507.67 <o,f0,male> words saying things you know can be constructive it can be really damaging and if you cut the link between what is said and any attribution back to you i mean surely there are huge risks with that
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 508.76 510.61 <o,f0,male> there are certainly but
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 515.59 517.41 <o,f0,male> the board what you might say at ted right
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 517.89 525.59 <o,f0,male> yeah i posted a thread on sunday and within twenty four hours it had over twelve thousand responses
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 526.41 532.11 <o,f0,male> the thing is i didn't make it into that presentation because i can't read to you anything that they said
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 537.33 538.60 <o,f0,female> know bleeped out
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 539.54 540.74 <o,f0,female> but there were some good things that
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 567.33 572.34 <o,f0,male> i'm not sure i would have necessarily recommended everyone at ted to go and check it out anyway
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 574.24 584.58 <o,f0,male> yourself i mean you're a figure of some intrigue you've got this surprising semi underground influence but it's not making you a lot of money yet
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 586.16 587.44 <o,f0,male> what's the commercial picture
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 588.36 595.26 <o,f0,female> the commercial picture is that there really isn't much of one i guess the site has adult content on it
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 595.95 604.63 <o,f0,female> it's got some very obscene content on it just in terms of language alone and when you've got that you've pretty much sacrificed any hope of making lots of money
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 622.78 633.93 <o,f0,female> first very kind of pained awkward conversations the content is not dinner table conversation in the least but my parents i think part of why they
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 651.61 655.02 <o,f0,male> and so in ten years time what do you picture yourself
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 657.49 670.99 <o,f0,female> a good question as i said i just went back to school and i am considering majoring in urban studies and then going on to urban planning kind of taking whatever i've learned from online communities and trying to adapt that to
