EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 12.68 18.37 <o,f0,female> i think it'll be a relief to some people and a disappointment to others that i'm not going to talk about vaginas today
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 19.35 28.33 <o,f0,female> i began the vagina monologues because i was worried about vaginas i'm very worried today about this notion this world this prevailing
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 29.29 34.92 <o,f0,female> kind of force of security i see this word hear this word feel this word everywhere
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 35.25 43.83 <o,f0,female> real security security checks security watch security clearance why has all this focus on security made me feel so much more insecure
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 44.74 53.74 <o,f0,female> what does anyone mean when they talk about real security and why have we as americans particularly become a nation that strives for security above all else
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 65.60 70.98 <o,f0,female> actually the good news this is of course unless your whole life is about being secure
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 71.75 81.48 <o,f0,female> i think that when that is the focus of your life these are the things that happen you can't travel very far or venture too far outside a certain circle
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 81.88 96.37 <o,f0,female> you can't allow too many conflicting ideas into your mind at one time as they might confuse you or challenge you you can't open yourself to new experiences new people new ways of doing things they might take you off course you can't not know who you are
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 96.74 110.36 <o,f0,female> so you cling to hard matter identity you become a christian muslim jew you're an indian egyptian italian american you're a heterosexual or a homosexual or you never have sex or at least that's what you say when you identify yourself
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 110.94 120.39 <o,f0,female> you become part of an us in order to be secure you defend against them you cling to your land because it is your secure place you must fight anyone who encroaches upon it
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 120.76 134.84 <o,f0,female> you become your nation you become your religion you become whatever it is that will freeze you numb you and protect you from doubt or change but all this does actually is shut down your mind in reality it does not really make you safer
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 135.48 149.27 <o,f0,female> i was in sri lanka for example three days after the tsunami and i was standing on the beaches and it was absolutely clear that in a matter of five minutes a thirty foot wave could rise up and desecrate a people a population and lives
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 149.85 158.82 <o,f0,female> all this striving for security in fact has made you much more insecure because now you have to watch out all the time there are people not like you
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 169.71 177.86 <o,f0,female> and becoming more entrenched in your fundamental thinking your days become devoted to protecting yourself this becomes your mission that is all you do
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 178.70 186.85 <o,f0,female> ideas get shorter they become sound bytes there are evil doers and saints criminals and victims there are those who if they 're not with us are against us
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 187.40 196.60 <o,f0,female> it gets easier to hurt people because you do not feel what's inside them it's easier to lock them up force them to be naked humiliate them occupy them invade them and kill them
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 208.77 218.21 <o,f0,female> and spend a great deal of time in different portions i've met women and men all over this planet who through various circumstances war
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 218.87 232.98 <o,f0,female> poverty racism multiple forms of violence have never known security or have had their illusion of security forever devastated i've spent time with women in afghanistan under the taliban who were essentially brutalized and censored
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 234.30 246.76 <o,f0,female> bosnian refugee camps i was with women in pakistan who have had their faces melted off with acid i've been with girls all across america who were date raped or raped by their best friends when they were drugged one night
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 247.34 261.11 <o,f0,female> one of the amazing things that i've discovered in my travels is that there is this emerging species i loved when he was talking about this other world that's right next to this world i've discovered these people who in v day world we call vagina warriors
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 261.71 275.93 <o,f0,female> these particular people rather than getting ak forty seven s or weapons of mass destruction or machetes in the spirit of the warrior have gone into the center the heart of pain of loss they have grieved it they have died into it
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 276.28 286.90 <o,f0,female> and allowed and encouraged poison to turn into medicine they have used the fuel of their pain to begin to redirect that energy towards another mission and another trajectory
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 287.40 299.03 <o,f0,female> these warriors now devote themselves and their lives to making sure what happened to them doesn't happen to anyone else there are thousands if not millions of them on the planet i venture there are many in this room
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 299.38 309.11 <o,f0,female> they have a fierceness and a freedom that i believe is the bedrock of a new paradigm they have broken out of the existing frame of victim and perpetrator
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 309.70 319.68 <o,f0,female> their own personal security is not their end goal and because of that because rather than worrying about security because the transformation of suffering is their end goal
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 320.03 330.46 <o,f0,female> i actually believe they are creating real safety and a whole new idea of security i want to talk about a few of these people that i've met tomorrow i am going to cairo
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 330.98 338.88 <o,f0,female> and i'm so moved that i will be with women in cairo who are v day women who are opening the first safe house for battered women in the middle east
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 339.38 348.39 <o,f0,female> that will happen because women in cairo made a decision to stand up and put themselves on the line and talk about the degree of violence that is happening in egypt
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 348.89 362.72 <o,f0,female> and were willing to be attacked and criticized and through their work over the last years this is not only happening that this house is opening but it's being supported by many factions of the society who never would have supported it
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 363.51 377.98 <o,f0,female> women in uganda this year who put on the vagina monologues during v day actually evoked the wrath of the government and i love this story so much there was a cabinet meeting and a meeting of the presidents to talk about whether vaginas could come to uganda
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 378.49 388.34 <o,f0,female> and in this meeting it went on for weeks in the press two weeks where there was huge discussion the government finally made a decision that the vagina monologues could not be performed in uganda
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 388.58 395.42 <o,f0,female> but the amazing news was that because they had stood up these women and because they had been willing to risk their security
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 395.86 403.40 <o,f0,female> it began a discussion that not only happened in uganda but all of africa as a result this production which had already sold out
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 432.24 443.86 <o,f0,female> she was basically threatened to be expelled from school they told her she couldn't love her vagina in high school that it was not a legal thing that it was not a moral thing that it was not a good thing
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 444.63 453.27 <o,f0,female> so she really struggled with this what to do because she was a senior and she was doing well in her school and she was threatened expulsion so what she did is she got all her friends together
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 454.28 461.95 <o,f0,female> i believe it was one hundred one hundred and fifty students all wore i love my vagina tee shirts and the boys wore i love her vagina tee shirts
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 464.64 474.31 <o,f0,female> now this seems like a fairly you know frivolous but what happened as a result of that is that that school now is forming a sex education class
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 474.64 485.08 <o,f0,female> it's beginning to talk about sex it's beginning to look at why it would be wrong for a young high school girl to talk about her vagina publicly or to say that she loved her vagina publicly
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 486.13 496.55 <o,f0,female> i know i've talked about agnes here before but i want to give you an update on agnes i met agnes three years ago in the rift valley when she was a young girl she had been mutilated
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 505.39 513.99 <o,f0,female> she made a decision not to go and get a razor or a glass shard but to devote her life to stopping that happening to other girls
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 514.30 526.57 <o,f0,female> for eight years she walked through the rift valley she had this amazing box that she carried and it had a torso of a woman 's body in it a half a torso and she would teach people everywhere she went what a healthy vagina looked like and what a mutilated vagina looked like
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 553.12 560.35 <o,f0,female> safe house in africa to stop mutilation when she began her mission eight years ago she was reviled
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 560.70 570.77 <o,f0,female> she was detested she was completely slandered in her community i am proud to tell you that six months ago she was elected the deputy mayor of narok
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 578.38 592.64 <o,f0,female> what i'm trying to say here is that if your end goal is security and if that's all you're focusing on what ends up happening is that you create not only more insecurity in other people but you make yourself far more insecure
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 593.04 600.55 <o,f0,female> real security is contemplating death not pretending it doesn't exist not running from loss but entering grief
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 610.30 624.86 <o,f0,female> it cannot be bought or arranged or made with bombs it is deeper it is a process it is acute awareness that we are all utterly inter bended and one action by one being in one tiny town has consequences everywhere
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 644.38 651.90 <o,f0,female> south africa and i had no idea where i was i didn't know where i was going where i'd come from and i panicked i had a total anxiety attack
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 659.50 669.23 <o,f0,female> we are all essentially permanently displaced people all of us are refugees we come from somewhere and we are hopefully traveling all the time moving towards a new place
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 669.85 682.34 <o,f0,female> freedom means i may not be identified as any one group but that i can visit and find myself in every group it does not mean that i don't have values or beliefs but it does mean i am not hardened around them
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 683.09 692.58 <o,f0,female> i do not use them as weapons in the shared future it will be just that shared the end goal will becoming vulnerable
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 705.27 708.83 <o,f0,male> how are you doing are you exhausted
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 715.22 728.03 <o,f0,female> you know i think carl jung once said that in order to survive the twentieth century we have to live with two existing opposite thoughts at the same time and i think part of what i'm learning in this process is that
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 728.91 735.67 <o,f0,female> one must allow oneself to feel grief and i think as long as i keep grieving and weeping and then
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 736.66 744.40 <o,f0,female> when i start to pretend that what i'm seeing isn't impacting me and isn't changing my heart then i get in trouble
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 745.19 754.90 <o,f0,female> because when you spend a lot of time going from place to place country to country and city to city the degree to which women for example are violated and the epidemic of it
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 755.24 765.07 <o,f0,female> and the kind of ordinariness of it is so devastating to one 's soul that you have to take the time or i have to take the time now to process that
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 777.77 785.66 <o,f0,female> if you think about women women are the primary resource of the planet they give birth we come from them they are mothers they are
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 786.19 794.45 <o,f0,female> visionaries they are the future if you think that the un now says that one out of three women on the planet will be raped or beaten in their lifetime
EveEnsler_2005G 1 EveEnsler_2005G 794.72 805.95 <o,f0,female> we're talking about the desecration of the primary resource of the planet we're talking about the place where we come from we're talking about parenting imagine that you've been raped and you're bringing up a boy child how does it impact your ability to work
