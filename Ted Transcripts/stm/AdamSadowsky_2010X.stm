AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 16.84 22.56 <o,f0,male> hi there i'm going to be talking a little bit about music machines and life
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 23.27 35.26 <o,f0,male> or more specifically what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine for a music video some of you may recognize this image this is the opening frame of the video that we created
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 35.68 47.32 <o,f0,male> be showing the video at the end but before we do i want to talk a little bit about what it is that they wanted now when we first started talking to ok go the name of the song is this too shall pass
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 48.67 59.65 <o,f0,male> we were really excited because they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with and we were very excited about this because of course they have a history of dancing with machines
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 75.22 86.40 <o,f0,male> we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted and they explained that they wanted kind of a rube goldberg machine now for those of you who don't know a rube goldberg machine is a
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 94.71 102.19 <o,f0,male> so we were excited by this idea and we started talking about exactly what it would look like and we came up with some parameters
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 115.93 117.60 <o,f0,male> we came up with a list of
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 134.94 149.22 <o,f0,male> they wanted band integration that is the machine acting upon the band members specifically not the other way around they wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling so as the song picks up emotion so should the machine get grander
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 149.66 158.96 <o,f0,male> in its process they wanted us to make use of the space so we have this ten thousand sq ft warehouse we were using divided between two floors it included an exterior loading dock
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 159.13 167.48 <o,f0,male> we used all of that including a giant hole in the floor that we actually descended the camera and cameraman through they wanted it messy and we were happy to oblige
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 168.73 176.94 <o,f0,male> the machine itself would start the music so the machine would get started it would travel some distance reacting along the way hit play on
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 177.13 188.80 <o,f0,male> an ipod or a tape deck or something that would start playback and the machine would maintain synchronization throughout and speaking of synchronization they wanted it to sync to the rhythm and to hit specific beats along the way
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 194.52 208.31 <o,f0,male> they wanted it to end precisely on time okay so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect and they wanted the music to drop out at a certain point in the video and actual live audio from the machine to play part of the song
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 209.40 216.29 <o,f0,male> and as if that wasn't enough all of these incredibly complicating things right they wanted it in one shot
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 224.13 224.31 <o,f0,male> okay
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 226.40 234.05 <o,f0,male> so just some statistics about sort of what we went through in the process the machine itself has eighty nine distinct interactions
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 235.12 245.78 <o,f0,male> it took us eighty five takes to get it on film to our satisfaction of those eighty five takes only three actually successfully completed their
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 247.23 250.80 <o,f0,male> we destroyed two pianos and ten televisions in the process
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 252.61 255.20 <o,f0,male> we went to home depot well over a hundred times
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 257.62 259.63 <o,f0,male> and we lost one high heeled shoe
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 260.30 274.64 <o,f0,male> when one of our engineers heather knight left her high heeled shoe after a nice dinner and returned back to the build and left it in a pile of stuff and another engineer thought well that would be a really good thing to use and ended up using it as a really nice trigger and it's actually in the machine
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 275.98 285.48 <o,f0,male> so what did we learn from all of this well having completed this we have the opportunity to step back and reflect on some of the things and we learned that small stuff stinks
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 286.15 295.83 <o,f0,male> little balls in wooden tracks are really susceptible to humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust and they fall out of the tracks the exact angles makes it hard to
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 296.40 305.12 <o,f0,male> get right and yet a bowling ball will always follow the same path it doesn't matter what temperature it is doesn't matter what's in its way it will pretty much get where it needs to go
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 305.42 313.91 <o,f0,male> but as much as the small stuff stinks we needed somewhere to start so that we would have somewhere to go and so you have to start with it you have to focus on it small stuff stinks
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 317.24 319.40 <o,f0,male> what else planning is incredibly important
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 323.82 336.96 <o,f0,male> you know we spent a lot of time ideating and even building some of these things it's been said that no battle plan survives contact with the enemy i think our enemy was physics and she's a cruel mistress
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 338.82 349.94 <o,f0,male> often we had to pull things out as a result because of timing or aesthetics or whatever and so while planning is important so is flexibility these are all things that ended up not making it into the final machine
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 364.55 372.65 <o,f0,male> real car near the end of the video the big real car works every time there's no problem about it the little one had a tendency to try to run off the track and that's a problem
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 373.05 382.25 <o,f0,male> but you don't want to have to reset the whole machine because the lego car at the end doesn't work right so you put that up front so that if it fails at least you know you don't have to reset the whole thing
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 385.35 386.19 <o,f0,female> can be
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 390.14 397.17 <o,f0,male> were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing months were spent in this tiny cold warehouse and the wonderful elation that we
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 402.79 404.05 <o,f0,male> this too shall pass
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 420.86 421.30 <o,f0,male> we
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 427.99 428.36 <o,f0,male> the
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 441.87 442.46 <o,f0,male> they've done
