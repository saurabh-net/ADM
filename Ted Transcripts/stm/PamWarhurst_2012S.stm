PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 33.17 35.3 <o,f0,female> and now it 's more like this
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 39.56 41.58 <o,f0,female> we call it propaganda gardening
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 49.3 51.12 <o,f0,female> people 's front gardens
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 51.31 53.96 <o,f0,female> and even in front of the police station
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 82.01 85.08 <o,f0,female> and you know we 're not doing it because we 're bored
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 87.95 90.93 <o,f0,female> because we want to start a revolution
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 91.16 101.62 <o,f0,female> we tried to answer this simple question can you find a unifying language that cuts across age and income and culture that will help people themselves find a new way of living
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 108.32 110.09 <o,f0,female> can we find that language
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 110.47 113.82 <o,f0,female> and then can we replicate those actions
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 114.95 117.08 <o,f0,female> and the answer would appear to be yes
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 117.16 119.4 <o,f0,female> and the language would appear to be food
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 149.57 163.78 <o,f0,female> what we teach our kids in school and what new skills we share amongst ourselves and business what we do with the pound in our pocket and which businesses we choose to support now let 's imagine those plates agitated with community actions around food
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 164.36 178.32 <o,f0,female> if we start one of those community plates spinning that 's really great that really starts to empower people but if we can then spin that community plate with the learning plate and then spin it with the business plate we 've got a real show there we 've got some action theater
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 196.95 200.76 <o,f0,female> we 've not asked anybody 's permission to do this we 're just doing it
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 219.91 221.95 <o,f0,female> so back to the public meeting
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 225.62 229.09 <o,f0,female> two seconds and then the room exploded i have never
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 229.12 231.42 <o,f0,female> ever experienced anything like that in my life
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 231.55 244.92 <o,f0,female> and it 's been the same in every single room in every town that we 've ever told our story people are ready and respond to the story of food they want positive actions they can engage in and in their bones
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 244.92 252.39 <o,f0,female> they know it 's time to take personal responsibility and invest in more kindness to each other and to the environment
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 253.03 256.98 <o,f0,female> and since we had that meeting three and a half years ago
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 257.23 259.14 <o,f0,female> it 's been a heck of a roller coaster
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 340.76 354.23 <o,f0,female> and for those people that don 't want to do either of those things maybe they can cook so we pick them seasonally and then we go on the street or in the pub or in the church or wherever people are living their lives this is about us going to the people and saying
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 354.43 358.54 <o,f0,female> we are all part of the local food jigsaw we are all part of a solution
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 384.23 387.62 <o,f0,female> past our cafes and our small shops through our market
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 415.24 416.84 <o,f0,female> and the kids are on the board
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 417 422.49 <o,f0,female> and because the community was really keen on working with the high school the high school is now teaching agriculture
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 441.42 444.41 <o,f0,female> we have turned that into a market garden training center
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 444.63 461.83 <o,f0,female> and that is polytunnels and raised beds and all the things you need to get the soil under your fingers and think maybe there 's a job in this for me in the future and because we were doing that some local academics said you know we could help design a commercial horticulture course for you there 's not one that we know of so they 're doing that and we 're going to launch it later this year
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 499.01 504.49 <o,f0,female> and then we had a chat with the farmers and we said we 're really serious about this but they didn 't actually believe us
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 504.53 519.96 <o,f0,female> so we thought okay what should we do i know if we can create a campaign around one product and show them there is local loyalty to that product maybe they 'll change their mind and see we 're serious so we launched a campaign because it just amuses me called every egg matters
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 536.32 546.84 <o,f0,female> asking for a local todmorden egg and the result of that was some farmers upped the amount of flocks they got of free range birds and then they went on to meat birds and although these are really really small steps that
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 572.38 575.03 <o,f0,female> and we 're just volunteers and it 's only an experiment
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 581.92 585.31 <o,f0,female> but it is joined up and it is inclusive
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 589.98 592.38 <o,f0,female> this is a movement for everyone
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 608.02 613.25 <o,f0,female> it 's been really quite a roller coaster experience but going back to that first question that we asked
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 613.53 615.08 <o,f0,female> is it replicable yeah
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 615.24 622.15 <o,f0,female> it most certainly is replicable more than thirty towns in england now are spinning the incredible edible plate
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 628.17 630.93 <o,f0,female> and worldwide we 've got communities across america
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 645.3 648.05 <o,f0,female> and none of this takes more money
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 648.78 651.29 <o,f0,female> and none of this demands a bureaucracy
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 662.91 665.6 <o,f0,female> and there 's some great ideas already in our patch
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 731.82 737.57 <o,f0,female> if we want to inspire the farmers of tomorrow then please let us say to every school
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 738.32 744.79 <o,f0,female> create a sense of purpose around the importance to the environment local food and soils
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 749.52 754.04 <o,f0,female> there are so many things you can do but ultimately this is about something really simple
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 754.74 757.35 <o,f0,female> through an organic process
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 757.59 765.78 <o,f0,female> through an increasing recognition of the power of small actions we are starting at last to believe in ourselves again
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 765.95 769.85 <o,f0,female> and to believe in our capacity each and every one of us
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 769.97 771.95 <o,f0,female> to build a different
PamWarhurst_2012S 1 PamWarhurst_2012S 772.55 776.57 <o,f0,female> and a kinder future and in my book that 's incredible
