ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 17.27 23.71 <o,f0,female> i would like to start my talk with actually two questions and the first one is how many people here actually eat pig meat
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 27.51 31.34 <o,f0,female> and how many people have actually seen a live pig producing this meat
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 36.01 43.34 <o,f0,female> come from you actually never see a pig which is really strange because on a population of sixteen million people we have twelve million pigs
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 43.88 54.19 <o,f0,female> and well of course the dutch can't eat all these pigs they eat about one third and the rest is exported to all kinds of countries in europe and the rest of the world a lot goes to the u k germany
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 54.81 65.03 <o,f0,female> and what i was curious about because historically the whole pig would be used up until the last bit so nothing would be wasted and i was curious to find out if this was actually still the case
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 65.57 75.46 <o,f0,female> and i spent about three years researching and i followed this one pig with number five thousand and forty nine all the way up until the end and to what products it's made of and
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 75.88 85.51 <o,f0,female> in these years i met all kinds people like for instance farmers and butchers which seems logical but i also met aluminum mold makers ammunition producers and
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 86.38 93.93 <o,f0,female> all kinds of people and what was striking to me is that the farmers actually had no clue what was made of their pigs but
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 94.46 104.81 <o,f0,female> the consumers as in us had also no idea of the pigs being in all these products so what i did is i took all this research and i made it into a
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 105.41 111.94 <o,f0,female> well basically it's a product catalog of this one pig and it carries a duplicate of his ear tag on the back
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 112.59 120.82 <o,f0,female> and it consists of seven chapters the chapters are skin bones meat internal organs blood fat and miscellaneous
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 122.96 134.44 <o,f0,female> in total they weigh one hundred and three point seven kilograms and to show you how often you actually meet part of this pig in a regular day i want to show you some images of the book
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 135.66 145.93 <o,f0,female> you probably start the day with a shower so in soap fatty acids made from boiling pork bone fat are used as a hardening agent but also for giving it a pearl like
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 147.15 156.49 <o,f0,female> if you look around you in the bathroom you see lots more products like shampoo conditioner anti wrinkle cream body lotion but also toothpaste
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 157.29 160.53 <o,f0,female> then so before breakfast you've already met the pig so many times
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 162.40 169.89 <o,f0,female> then at breakfast the pig that followed the hairs off the pig or proteins from the hairs off the pig were used as an improver of dough
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 189.70 202.00 <o,f0,female> well when you're off to work under the road or under the buildings that you see there might very well be cellular concrete which is a very light kind of concrete that's actually got proteins from bones inside and it's also fully reusable
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 202.40 208.35 <o,f0,female> in the train brakes at least in the german train brakes there's this part of the brake that's made of bone ash
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 209.29 217.57 <o,f0,female> and in cheesecake and all kinds of desserts like chocolate mousse tiramisu vanilla pudding everything that's cooled in the supermarket there's gelatin to make it look good
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 219.09 229.59 <o,f0,female> fine bone china this is a real classic of course the bone in fine bone china gives it its translucency and also its strength in order to make these really fine shapes like this
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 235.74 244.65 <o,f0,female> used in paint for the texture but also for the glossiness in sandpaper bone glue is actually the glue between the sand and the paper
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 245.91 252.92 <o,f0,female> and then in paintbrushes hairs are used because apparently they're very suitable for making paintbrushes because of their hard wearing nature
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 253.88 265.04 <o,f0,female> i was not planning on showing you any meat because of course half the book 's meat and you probably all know what meats they are but i didn't want you to miss out on this one because this well it's called portion controlled meat cuts and
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 265.58 277.26 <o,f0,female> this is actually sold in the frozen area of the supermarket and what it is it's actually steak so this is sort of cow but what happens when you slaughter a cow at least in industrial factory farming
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 277.92 287.71 <o,f0,female> they have all these little bits of steak left that they can't actually sell as steak so what they do is they glue them all together with fibrin from pig blood into this really large sausage
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 288.51 297.40 <o,f0,female> freeze the sausage cut it in little slices and sell those as steak again and this also actually happens with tuna and scallops
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 300.70 313.09 <o,f0,female> so with the steak you might drink a beer in the brewing process there's lots of cloudy elements in the beer so to get rid of these cloudy elements what some companies do is they pour the beer through a kind of gelatin sieve in order to get rid of
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 315.15 317.31 <o,f0,female> this actually also goes for wine as well as
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 320.27 330.69 <o,f0,female> actually a company in greece that produces these cigarettes that actually contain hemoglobin from pigs in the filter and according to them this creates an artificial lung in the filter
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 333.23 335.39 <o,f0,female> so this is actually a healthier cigarette
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 350.17 352.90 <o,f0,female> this must be the strangest thing i found this is a
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 353.90 361.66 <o,f0,female> coming from a very large ammunition company in the united states and while i was making the book i contacted all the producers of products
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 362.03 370.83 <o,f0,female> because i wanted them to send me the real samples and the real specimens so i sent this company an email saying hello i'm christien i'm doing this research and
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 384.82 389.05 <o,f0,female> i thought that was really weird as if the dutch government sends emails to anyone so
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 394.27 403.38 <o,f0,female> the most beautiful thing i found at least what i think is the most beautiful in the book is this heart valve it's actually a very low tech and very high tech product at the same time
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 403.90 410.43 <o,f0,female> the low tech bit is that it's literally a pig 's heart valve mounted in the high tech bit which is a memory metal casing and
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 411.06 419.53 <o,f0,female> what happens is this can be implanted into a human heart without open heart surgery and once it's in the right spot they remove the outer shell and the heart
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 420.29 425.92 <o,f0,female> well it gets this shape and at that moment it starts beating instantly it's really a sort of magical moment
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 427.11 434.28 <o,f0,female> so this is actually a dutch company so i called them up and i asked can i borrow a heart valve from you and the
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 435.99 445.64 <o,f0,female> really enthusiastic so they were like okay we'll put it in a jar for you with formalin and you can borrow it great and then i didn't hear from them for weeks so
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 446.10 456.77 <o,f0,female> i called and i asked what 's going on with the heart valve and they said well the director of the company decided not to let you borrow this heart valve because want his product to be associated with
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 461.64 469.00 <o,f0,female> the last product from the book that i'm showing you is renewable energy actually to show that my first question if pigs are still used up until the last bit
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 469.18 477.96 <o,f0,female> was still true well it is because everything that can't be used for anything else is made into a fuel that can be used as renewable energy source
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 479.33 485.91 <o,f0,female> i found one hundred and eighty five products and what they showed me is that well firstly
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 487.80 498.44 <o,f0,female> that we don't treat these pigs as absolute kings and queens and the second is that we actually don't have a clue of what all these products that surround us are made of and
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 499.67 508.36 <o,f0,female> you might think i'm very fond of pigs but actually well i am a little bit but i'm more fond of raw materials in general and i think that
