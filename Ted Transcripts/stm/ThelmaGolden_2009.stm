ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 27.35 37.29 <o,f0,female> artists who have led my exhibitions because my work in understanding art and in understanding culture has come by following artists
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 37.70 45.94 <o,f0,female> by looking at what artists mean and what they do and who they are jay jay from good times
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 48.85 59.94 <o,f0,female> significant to many people of course because of dyn o mite but perhaps more significant as the first really black artist on prime time tv
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 60.99 70.42 <o,f0,female> michel basquiat important to me because the first black artist in real time that showed me the possibility of who and what
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 70.82 77.82 <o,f0,female> i was about to enter into my overall project is about art specifically about black artists
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 78.30 85.98 <o,f0,female> very generally about the way in which art can change the way we think about culture and ourselves
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 86.28 94.91 <o,f0,female> my interest is in artists who understand and rewrite history who think about themselves within the narrative
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 95.21 105.85 <o,f0,female> of the larger world of art but who have created new places for us to see and understand i'm showing two artists here glenn ligon and carol walker
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 106.62 118.54 <o,f0,female> many who really form for me the essential questions that i wanted to bring as a curator to the world i was interested in the idea of why and how
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 119.59 134.39 <o,f0,female> could create a new story a new narrative in art history and a new narrative in the world and to do this i knew that i had to see the way in which artists work understand the artist 's studio as a laboratory
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 135.14 142.13 <o,f0,female> imagine then reinventing the museum as a think tank and looking at the exhibition
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 142.37 149.54 <o,f0,female> as the ultimate white paper asking questions providing the space to look and to think about
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 163.91 177.68 <o,f0,female> to express the ways in which art could provide space for a dialogue complicated dialogue dialogue with many many points of entry and how the museum could be the space for this contest of ideas
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 178.05 188.52 <o,f0,female> this exhibition included over twenty artists of various ages and races but all looking at black masculinity from a very particular point of view
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 192.51 204.26 <o,f0,female> what was significant about this exhibition is the way in which it engaged me in my role as a curator as a catalyst for this dialogue
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 204.68 212.89 <o,f0,female> one of the things that happened very distinctly in the course of this exhibition is i was confronted with idea of how powerful images can be
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 213.09 219.88 <o,f0,female> and people 's understanding of themselves and each other i'm showing you two works one on the right by leon golub one on the left
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 220.41 231.13 <o,f0,female> by robert colescott and in the course of the exhibition which was contentious controversial and ultimately for me life changing in my sense of what art could be
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 231.50 239.14 <o,f0,female> a woman came up to me on the gallery floor to express her concern about the nature of how powerful images could be
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 239.32 248.36 <o,f0,female> and how we understood each other and she pointed to the work on the left to tell me how problematic this image was as it related for her to the idea
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 248.64 256.11 <o,f0,female> of how black people had been represented and she pointed to the image on the right as an example to me of the kind of dignity
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 256.30 265.52 <o,f0,female> that needed to be portrayed to work against those images in the media she then assigned these works racial identities basically saying to me that the work on the right
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 276.77 290.29 <o,f0,female> a white artist the point of that for me was to say in that space in that moment that i really more than anything wanted to understand how images could work how images did work and how artists
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 302.42 313.50 <o,f0,female> home for many of black america very much the psychic heart of the black experience really the place where the whole harlem renaissance existed
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 314.33 325.04 <o,f0,female> harlem now sort of explaining and thinking of itself in this part of the century looking both backwards and forwards i always say harlem is an interesting community because unlike many other places
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 325.18 333.93 <o,f0,female> it thinks of itself in the past present and the future simultaneously no one speaks of it just in the now it's always what it was and what it can be
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 334.61 342.49 <o,f0,female> and in thinking about that then my second project the second question i ask can a museum be a catalyst in a community
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 342.80 356.02 <o,f0,female> can a museum house artists and allow them to be change agents as communities rethink themselves this is harlem actually on january twentieth thinking about itself in a very wonderful way
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 356.75 364.79 <o,f0,female> so i work now at the studio museum in harlem thinking about exhibitions there thinking about what it means to discover art 's possibility
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 365.14 377.19 <o,f0,female> now what does this mean to some of you in some cases i know that many of you are involved in cross cultural dialogues you're involved in ideas of creativity and innovation think about the place that artists can play in
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 377.65 390.72 <o,f0,female> that that is the kind of incubation and advocacy that i work towards in working with young black artists think about artists not as content providers though they can be brilliant at that but again as real catalysts
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 404.96 415.04 <o,f0,female> that has happened since then to think of the possibilities that we are all privileged to stand in today and imagine that this museum that came out of a moment of great protest
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 415.52 428.35 <o,f0,female> and one that was so much about examining the history and the legacy of important african american artists to the history of art in this country like jacob lawrence norman lewis romare beardon and
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 438.57 443.11 <o,f0,female> got up and said to him give us a poem and mohammed ali said me
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 444.06 455.52 <o,f0,female> a profound statement about the individual and the community the space in which now in my project of discovery of thinking about artists of trying to define what might be
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 470.29 484.16 <o,f0,female> to this end the specific project that has made this possible for me is a series of exhibitions all titled with an f freestyle frequency and flow which have set out to discover and define
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 484.86 492.61 <o,f0,female> the young black artists working in this moment who i feel strongly will continue to work over the next many years
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 492.93 503.60 <o,f0,female> this series of exhibitions was made specifically to try and question the idea of what if would mean now at this point in history to see
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 504.21 516.03 <o,f0,female> as a catalyst what it means now at this point in history as we define and redefine culture black culture specifically in my case but culture generally i named this group of artists
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 517.36 530.06 <o,f0,female> around an idea which i put out there called post black really meant to define them as artists who came and start their work now looking back at history but starting in this moment historically
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 530.47 540.23 <o,f0,female> it is really in this sense of discovery that i have a new set of questions that i'm asking this new set of questions is what does it mean right now
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 540.41 554.17 <o,f0,female> to be african american in america what can artwork say about this where can can a museum exist as the place for us all to have this conversation
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 554.82 561.63 <o,f0,female> really most exciting about this is thinking about the energy and the excitement that young artists can bring
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 562.00 569.10 <o,f0,female> their works for me are about not always just simply about the aesthetic innovation that their minds imagine that
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 569.99 584.34 <o,f0,female> visions create and put out there in the world but more perhaps importantly through the excitement of the community that they create as important voices that will allow us right now to understand our situation as well as in the future
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 584.98 596.72 <o,f0,female> i am continually amazed by the way in which the subject of race can take itself in many places that we don't imagine it should be
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 597.26 610.47 <o,f0,female> i am always amazed by the way in which artists are willing to do that in their work it is why i look to art it's why i ask questions of art it is why i make exhibitions
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 621.58 630.11 <o,f0,female> this generation has to say to the rest of us it's considering what it means for these artists to be both out in the world as their work travels
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 630.39 637.79 <o,f0,female> but in their communities as people who are seeing and thinking about the issues that face us it's also
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 638.03 649.72 <o,f0,female> about thinking about the creative spirit and nurturing it and imagine in particularly in urban america about the nurturing of the spirit now where perhaps does this end up right now
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 650.07 663.42 <o,f0,female> for me it is about re imagining this cultural discourse in an international context so the last iteration of this project has been called flow with the idea now of creating a real
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 664.07 671.55 <o,f0,female> network of artists around the world really looking not so much from harlem and out but looking across
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 681.60 692.61 <o,f0,female> i have begun that looking through artists through artworks and imagining what they can tell us about the future what they tell us about our future and what they create
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 693.05 701.60 <o,f0,female> in their sense of offering us this great possibility of watching that continent emerge as part of our bigger dialogue
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 702.24 713.08 <o,f0,female> so what do i discover when i look at artworks what do i think about when i think about art i feel like the privilege i've had as a curator is not just
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 713.28 724.10 <o,f0,female> the discovery of new works the discovery of exciting works but really it has been what i've discovered about myself and what i can offer in the space of an exhibition
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 724.43 732.58 <o,f0,female> to talk about beauty to talk about power to talk about ourselves and to talk and speak to each other
ThelmaGolden_2009 1 ThelmaGolden_2009 733.06 742.52 <o,f0,female> that's what makes me get up every day and want to think about this generation of black artists and artists around the world thank you
