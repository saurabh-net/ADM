MarcinJakubowski_2011U 1 MarcinJakubowski_2011U 16.36 23.39 <o,f0,male> my name is marcin farmer technologist i was born in poland now in the u s
MarcinJakubowski_2011U 1 MarcinJakubowski_2011U 23.39 35.87 <o,f0,male> i started a group called open source ecology we 've identified the fifty most important machines that we think it takes for modern life to exist things from tractors bread ovens circuit makers
MarcinJakubowski_2011U 1 MarcinJakubowski_2011U 53.86 68.94 <o,f0,male> i was useless i had no practical skills the world presented me with options and i took them i guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle so i started a farm in missouri and learned about the economics of farming
MarcinJakubowski_2011U 1 MarcinJakubowski_2011U 68.94 81.29 <o,f0,male> i bought a tractor then it broke i paid to get it repaired then it broke again then pretty soon i was broke too
MarcinJakubowski_2011U 1 MarcinJakubowski_2011U 81.29 94.15 <o,f0,male> realized that the truly appropriate low cost tools that i needed to start a sustainable farm and settlement just didn 't exist yet i needed tools that were robust modular
MarcinJakubowski_2011U 1 MarcinJakubowski_2011U 94.31 105.33 <o,f0,male> highly efficient and optimized low cost made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime not designed for obsolescence i found that i would have to build them myself
MarcinJakubowski_2011U 1 MarcinJakubowski_2011U 105.33 108.49 <o,f0,male> so i did just that
MarcinJakubowski_2011U 1 MarcinJakubowski_2011U 126.6 141.65 <o,f0,male> then contributors from all over the world began showing up prototyping new machines during dedicated project visits so far we have prototyped eight of the fifty machines and now the project is beginning to grow on its own
MarcinJakubowski_2011U 1 MarcinJakubowski_2011U 143.49 158.11 <o,f0,male> we know that open source has succeeded with tools for managing knowledge and creativity and the same is starting to happen with hardware too we 're focusing on hardware because it is hardware that can change people 's lives in such tangible material ways
MarcinJakubowski_2011U 1 MarcinJakubowski_2011U 158.11 168.03 <o,f0,male> if we can lower the barriers to farming building manufacturing then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential that 's not only in the developing world
MarcinJakubowski_2011U 1 MarcinJakubowski_2011U 168.03 178.15 <o,f0,male> our tools are being made for the american farmer builder entrepreneur maker we 've seen lots of excitement from these people who can now start a construction business parts
MarcinJakubowski_2011U 1 MarcinJakubowski_2011U 184.98 193.7 <o,f0,male> our goal is a repository of published designs so clear so complete that a single burned dvd is effectively a civilization starter kit
MarcinJakubowski_2011U 1 MarcinJakubowski_2011U 193.7 199.97 <o,f0,male> i 've planted a hundred trees in a day
MarcinJakubowski_2011U 1 MarcinJakubowski_2011U 205.58 218.42 <o,f0,male> and built a tractor in six days from what i 've seen this is only the beginning if this idea is truly sound then the implications are significant
MarcinJakubowski_2011U 1 MarcinJakubowski_2011U 218.42 232.69 <o,f0,male> a greater distribution of the means of production environmentally sound supply chains and a newly relevant diy maker culture can hope to transcend artificial scarcity
MarcinJakubowski_2011U 1 MarcinJakubowski_2011U 232.69 241.75 <o,f0,male> we 're exploring the limits of what we all can do to make a better world with open hardware technology thank you
