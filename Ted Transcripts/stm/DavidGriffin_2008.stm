DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 132.52 136.39 <o,f0,male> and finally the bow of the titanic without movie stars
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 155.44 169.26 <o,f0,male> four years ago i was at the beach with my son and he was learning how to swim in this relatively soft surf of the delaware beaches but i turned away for a moment and he got caught into a riptide and started to be pulled out towards the jetty
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 169.96 180.06 <o,f0,male> i can stand here right now and see as i go tearing into the water after him the moments slowing down and freezing into this arrangement
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 180.34 193.47 <o,f0,male> i can see the rocks are over here there's a wave about to crash onto him i can see his hands reaching out and i can see his face in terror looking at me saying help me dad
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 194.38 200.13 <o,f0,male> i got him the wave broke over us we got back on shore he was fine we were a little bit rattled
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 201.10 208.58 <o,f0,male> but this flash bulb memory as it's called is when all the elements came together to define not just the event
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 208.79 216.18 <o,f0,male> but my emotional connection to it and this is what a photograph taps into when it makes its own powerful connection to
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 217.26 228.51 <o,f0,male> now i have to tell you i was talking to kyle last week about this that i was going to tell this story and he said oh yeah i remember that too i remember my image of you was that you were up on the shore yelling at me
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 230.69 232.06 <o,f0,male> i thought i was a hero
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 236.15 245.83 <o,f0,male> so this represents this is a cross sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world 's greatest photojournalists working at the very top of their craft except one
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 247.33 257.89 <o,f0,male> this photograph was taken by doctor euan mason in new zealand last year and it was submitted and published in national geographic last year we added a section to our website called your shot
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 258.23 266.42 <o,f0,male> where anyone can submit photographs for possible publication and it has become a wild success tapping into the enthusiast photography community
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 267.07 277.86 <o,f0,male> the quality of these amateur photographs can at times be amazing and seeing this reinforces for me that every one of us has at least one or two great photographs in
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 279.86 287.30 <o,f0,male> to be a great photojournalist you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you you've got to be able to make them all the time
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 289.01 293.28 <o,f0,male> but even more importantly you need to know how to create a visual narrative
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 293.74 295.87 <o,f0,male> you need to know how to tell a story
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 296.29 301.49 <o,f0,male> so i'm going to share with you some coverages that i feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 311.88 320.42 <o,f0,male> the original intent was to travel there and bring back a classic story of diverse species of an exotic locale and that is what nick did up to a point
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 320.83 330.69 <o,f0,male> this is a serval cat he 's actually taking his own picture shot with what's called a camera trap there's an infrared beam that's going across and he 's stepped into the beam and taken his photograph
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 332.58 342.05 <o,f0,male> these are baboons at a watering hole nick the camera again an automatic camera took thousands of pictures of this and nick ended up with a lot of pictures of the rear ends of
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 345.30 348.86 <o,f0,male> a lion having a late night snack notice he 's got a broken tooth
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 352.90 358.70 <o,f0,male> and a crocodile walks up a river bank toward its den i love this little bit of water that comes off the back of his tail
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 361.26 370.74 <o,f0,male> but the centerpiece species of zakouma are the elephants it's one of the largest intact herds in this part of africa here 's a photograph shot in moonlight something that
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 390.61 398.01 <o,f0,male> but once the annual rains began the herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park and that's when they ran into trouble
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 399.01 404.77 <o,f0,male> for outside the safety of the park were poachers who would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 427.96 436.94 <o,f0,male> this is actually one of the rangers they were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory they couldn't leave it there because it's still valuable but what nick did
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 437.30 445.54 <o,f0,male> was he brought back a story that went beyond the old school method of just straight isn 't this an amazing world and instead
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 446.10 457.37 <o,f0,male> created a story that touched our audiences deeply instead of just knowledge of this park he created an understanding and an empathy for the elephants the rangers and the many issues surrounding human wildlife conflicts
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 458.68 470.95 <o,f0,male> now let 's go over to india sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way we were looking at the same issue that richard wurman touches upon in his new world population project for the first time in history
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 471.58 479.78 <o,f0,male> more people live in urban rather than rural environments and most of that growth is not in the cities but in the slums that surround them
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 481.07 487.33 <o,f0,male> jonas bendiksen a very energetic photographer came to me and said we need to document this and here 's my
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 501.95 513.91 <o,f0,male> just go in and see just a little bit of everything we put jonas into dharavi which is part of mumbai india and let him stay there and really get into the heart and soul of this
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 515.51 528.46 <o,f0,male> really major part of the city what jonas did was not just go and do a surface look at the awful conditions that exist in such places he saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part of how the entire urban area functioned
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 529.22 536.86 <o,f0,male> by staying tightly focused in one place jonas tapped in to the soul and the enduring human spirit that underlies this community
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 539.27 540.42 <o,f0,male> and he did it in a beautiful
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 555.23 570.83 <o,f0,male> we weren't the only ones to tackle this subject but the photographs that brian and randy created are among the best to capture both the human and natural devastation of overfishing here in a photo by brian a seemingly crucified shark is caught up in a gill net off of baja
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 571.66 578.58 <o,f0,male> i've seen sort of ok pictures of bycatch the animals accidentally scooped up while fishing for a specific species
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 578.87 587.10 <o,f0,male> but here brian captured a unique view by positioning himself underneath the boat when they threw the waste overboard
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 598.69 608.19 <o,f0,male> on land randy olson photographed a makeshift fish market in africa where the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals the main parts having already been sent to europe
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 609.45 620.86 <o,f0,male> and here in china randy shot a jellyfish market as prime food sources are depleted the harvest goes deeper into the oceans and brings in more such sources of protein this is called fishing down the food chain
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 621.69 623.15 <o,f0,male> but there are also glimmers of hope
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 623.83 631.68 <o,f0,male> and i think anytime we're doing a big big story on this we don't really want to go and just look at all the problems we also want to look for solutions
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 654.74 665.66 <o,f0,male> took a look at the sweep of the medical system that is utilized to handle the american wounded coming out of iraq it is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end and exits back home on the other
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 666.06 673.66 <o,f0,male> jim started in the battlefield here a medical technician tends to a wounded soldier on the helicopter ride back to the field hospital
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 674.54 682.33 <o,f0,male> here is in the field hospital the soldier on the right has the name of his daughter tattooed across his chest as a reminder of home
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 683.79 689.70 <o,f0,male> from here the more severely wounded are transported back to germany where they meet up with their families for the first time
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 693.60 701.53 <o,f0,male> and then back to the states to recuperate at veterans hospitals such as here in walter reed and finally often fitted with high tech
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 702.25 712.38 <o,f0,male> they exit the medical system and attempt to regain their pre war lives jim took what could have been a straight up medical science story and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 715.15 720.29 <o,f0,male> now these stories are great examples of how photography can be used to address some of our most important topics
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 721.14 726.64 <o,f0,male> but there are also times when photographers simply encounter things that are when it comes down to it just plain fun
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 736.98 745.19 <o,f0,male> in fact a year earlier a researcher had been grabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed so you can imagine paul was maybe a little bit hesitant about getting into the water
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 746.49 748.30 <o,f0,male> now what leopard seals do mostly
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 748.64 753.32 <o,f0,male> is they eat penguins you know of the march of the penguins this is sort of the munch of the penguins
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 756.19 763.08 <o,f0,male> here a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out to see if the coast is clear and then everybody kind of runs out and goes out
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 769.39 779.11 <o,f0,male> and he said he was never really afraid of this well this one female came up to him she's probably it's a shame you can't see it in the photograph but she's twelve feet long
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 779.53 794.09 <o,f0,male> so she is pretty significant in size and paul said he was never really afraid because she was more curious about him than threatened this mouthing behavior on the right was really her way of saying to him hey look how big i am or you know my what big teeth you have
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 795.81 808.73 <o,f0,male> then paul thinks that she simply took pity on him to her here was this big goofy creature in the water that for some reason didn't seem to be interested in chasing penguins so what she did was she started to bring penguins to
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 808.93 812.57 <o,f0,male> him alive and put them in front of him
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 813.24 822.51 <o,f0,male> she dropped them off and then they would swim away she'd kind of look at him like what are you doing go back and get them and then bring them back and drop them in front of him and she did this
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 829.43 835.40 <o,f0,male> his head which just resulted in a fantastic photograph
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 850.21 857.11 <o,f0,male> and lost interest with him and went back to what she does best paul set out to photograph a relatively mysterious and unknown creature
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 857.43 870.64 <o,f0,male> and came back with not just a collection of photographs but an amazing experience and a great story it is these kinds of stories ones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial that demonstrate the power of photojournalism
DavidGriffin_2008 1 DavidGriffin_2008 871.90 884.27 <o,f0,male> i believe that photography can make a real connection to people and can be employed as a positive agent for understanding the challenges and opportunities facing our world today thank you
