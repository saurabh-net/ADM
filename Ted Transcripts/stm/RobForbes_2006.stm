RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 15.65 25.33 <o,f0,male> i was listed on the online biography that said i was a design missionary that's a bit lofty i'm really more of something like a street walker
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 25.95 34.84 <o,f0,male> i spend a lot of time in urban areas looking for design and studying design in the public sector i take about five thousand photographs a year and
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 35.24 43.05 <o,f0,male> i thought that i would edit from these and try to come up with some images that might be appropriate and interesting to you and i used
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 58.68 66.18 <o,f0,male> stuff that was available to all people and stuff that probably contains some other important messages i'll use these sidewalks in rio as an example
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 66.61 77.42 <o,f0,male> very common public design done in the fifties it's got a nice kind of flowing organic form very consistent with the brazilian culture i think good design adds to culture
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 78.01 85.82 <o,f0,male> wholly inconsistent with san francisco or new york but i think these are my sort of information highways i live in much more of an analog world
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 86.33 95.11 <o,f0,male> where pedestrian traffic and interaction and diversity exchange and where i think the simple things under our feet have a great amount of meaning to us
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 95.79 107.64 <o,f0,male> how did i get started in this business i was a ceramic designer for about ten years and just loved utilitarian form simple things that we use every day little compositions of color and surface on form
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 108.29 119.38 <o,f0,male> this led me to starting a company called design within reach a company dealing with simple forms making good designers available to us and also selling the personalities and character of the designers as well
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 119.71 129.54 <o,f0,male> and it seems to have worked a couple of years into the process i spent a lot of time in europe traveling around looking for design and i had a bit of a wake up call in amsterdam i was there
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 139.20 150.27 <o,f0,male> we know a lot about what's going on with design around the world and it's getting increasingly more difficult to find design that reflects a unique culture i was walking around on the streets of amsterdam and i recognized you know the big story
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 150.74 159.82 <o,f0,male> from amsterdam isn't what's in the design stores it's what's out on the streets and maybe it's self explanatory but a city that hasn't been taken over by modernism
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 169.41 181.06 <o,f0,male> and i write a newsletter that goes out every week and i wrote an article about this and it got such enormous response that i realized that design that common design that's in the public area means a lot to people and establishes kind of a groundwork and a
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 182.07 196.38 <o,f0,male> i then kind of thought about the other cities in europe where i spend a lot of time looking for design like basel where vitra is located or in northern italy all cities where there are a whole lot of bicycles and where pedestrian areas and i came to the conclusion that perhaps
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 208.66 213.38 <o,f0,male> but it did seem that in many of these areas pedestrian traffic was protected
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 214.35 229.18 <o,f0,male> you wouldn't look at this and call this a designer bike a designer bike is made of titanium or molybdenum but i began looking at design in a place like amsterdam and recognized you know the first job of design is to serve a social purpose and so i look at this bike as not being
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 229.74 240.53 <o,f0,male> a designer bike but being a very good example of design and since that time in amsterdam i spent an increasing amount of time in the cities looking at design for common evidence of design that
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 241.11 248.55 <o,f0,male> really isn't under so much of a designer 's signature i was in buenos aires very recently and i went to see this bridge by santiago
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 249.51 258.48 <o,f0,male> a spanish architect and designer and the tourist brochures pointed me in the direction of this bridge i love bridges metaphorically and symbolically and structurally
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 258.98 270.11 <o,f0,male> and it was a bit of a disappointment because of the sludge from the river was encrusted on it it really wasn't in use and i recognized that oftentimes design when you're set up to see design it can be a bit of a letdown but there were
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 270.69 283.61 <o,f0,male> lots of other things going on in this area it was a kind of construction zone a lot of buildings were going up and approaching a building from a distance you don't see too much you get a little closer and you arrive at a nice little composition that might remind you of a mondrian or
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 284.62 295.06 <o,f0,male> or something but to me it was an example of industrial materials with a little bit of colors and animation and a nice little still life kind of unintended piece of design and going a little closer
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 295.54 305.66 <o,f0,male> you get a different perspective i find these little vignettes these little accidental pieces of design to be refreshing they give me i don't know a sense of correctness in the
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 306.47 315.29 <o,f0,male> world and some visual delight in the knowledge that the building will probably never look as good as this simple industrial scaffolding that is there to serve
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 315.68 326.82 <o,f0,male> down the road there was another building a nice visual structure horizontal vertical elements little decorative lines going across these magenta squiggles the workmen being reduced to decorative elements
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 327.21 339.13 <o,f0,male> just a nice kind of breakup of the urban place and you know that no longer exists you've captured it for a moment and finding this little still life 's like listening to little songs or something it gives me an enormous amount of pleasure
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 381.71 389.30 <o,f0,male> red drew me into this little composition optimistic to me in the sense that maybe the public service 's mailbox door service
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 389.92 404.01 <o,f0,male> plumbing it looks as if these different public services work together to create some nice little compositions in italy you know almost everything kind of looks good simple menus put on a board achieving kind of the sort of balance but i'm convinced that it's because you're walking around the streets and seeing things
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 404.98 412.03 <o,f0,male> can be comical it can draw your attention to the poor little personality of the little fire hydrant suffering from bad civic planning in havana
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 412.61 421.21 <o,f0,male> can animate simple blocks simple materials walking in new york i'll stop i don't always know why i take photographs of things
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 421.65 430.77 <o,f0,male> a nice visual composition of symmetry curves against sharp things it's a comment on the way in which we deal with public seating in the city of new york
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 431.11 439.53 <o,f0,male> come across some other just kind of curious relationships of bollards on the street that have different interpretations but these things amuse me
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 452.64 461.38 <o,f0,male> nice little piece of sculpture so there's this sort of silent hand of design at work that i see in places that i go havana is a wonderful area
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 461.75 469.11 <o,f0,male> it's quite free of commercial clutter you don't see our logos and brands and names and therefore you're alert to things physically and this is a great
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 477.14 486.58 <o,f0,male> cuba needs to be far more resourceful because of the blockades and things but a really wonderful playground i've often wondered why italy is really a leader in modern design
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 487.08 500.37 <o,f0,male> in our area in furnishings they're sort of way at the top the dutch are good also but the italians are good and i came across this little street in venice where the communist headquarters were sharing a wall with this catholic shrine
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 500.84 511.98 <o,f0,male> and i realized that you know italy is a place where they can accept these different ideologies and deal with diversity and not have the problem or they can choose to ignore them
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 512.38 520.35 <o,f0,male> but these you don't have warring factions and i think that maybe the tolerance of the absurdity which has made italy
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 521.04 528.75 <o,f0,male> so innovative and so tolerant the past and the present work quite well together in italy also and i think that
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 528.94 537.95 <o,f0,male> it's recognizable there and has an important effect on culture because their public spaces are protected their sidewalks are protected and you're actually able to confront these things
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 547.22 556.63 <o,f0,male> and i use this this is sort of what i consider to be urban spam i notice the stuff because i walk a lot but here private industry is really kind of making a mess of
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 574.17 587.97 <o,f0,male> some type of control over what's happening in the environment is very evident even in the way that they sell and distribute periodicals i walk to work every day or ride my scooter and i come down and park in this little spot
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 588.61 601.82 <o,f0,male> and i came down one day and all the bikes were red now this is not going to impress you guys who photoshop and can do stuff but this was an actual moment when i got off my bike and i looked and i thought it's as if all of my
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 603.35 610.09 <o,f0,male> biker brethren had kind of gotten together and conspired to make a little statement and it reminded me that
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 610.94 618.74 <o,f0,male> to keep in the present to look out for these kinds of things it gave me possibilities for wonder if maybe it's a yellow day in san francisco and we could all
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 619.27 627.82 <o,f0,male> agree and create some installations but it also reminded me of the power of pattern and repetition to make an effect in our mind
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 628.47 641.90 <o,f0,male> and i don't know if there's a stronger kind of effect than pattern and the way it unites kind of disparate elements i was at the art show in miami in december and spent a couple of hours looking at fine art and amazed at the prices of
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 650.53 660.34 <o,f0,male> know quite a nice little collage of these car keys and my closest equivalent were a group of prayer tags that i had seen in tokyo
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 660.85 674.99 <o,f0,male> and i thought that if pattern can unite these disparate elements it can do just about anything i don't have very many shots of people because they kind of get in the way of studying pure form i was in a small restaurant in
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 676.09 682.45 <o,f0,male> spain having lunch one of those nice days where you had the place kind of to yourself and you have a glass of wine and
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 682.91 692.08 <o,f0,male> enjoying the local area and the culture and the food and the quiet and feeling very lucky and a bus load of tourists arrived
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 692.76 703.98 <o,f0,male> emptied out filled up the restaurant in a very short period of time completely changed the atmosphere and character with loud voices and large bodies and such
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 704.34 712.11 <o,f0,male> and we had to get up and leave it was just that uncomfortable and at that moment the sun came out and through this perforated screen
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 712.64 721.75 <o,f0,male> pattern was cast over these bodies and they kind of faded into the rear and we left the restaurant kind of feeling ok about stuff and
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 722.66 732.46 <o,f0,male> i do think pattern has the capability of eradicating some of the most evil forces of society such as bad form in restaurants but quite seriously
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 732.77 741.57 <o,f0,male> it was a statement to me that one thing that you do sort of see is the aggressive nature of the industrial world has produced kind of
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 743.35 753.48 <o,f0,male> large masses of things when you in monoculture and i think the preservation of diversity in culture is something that's important to us
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 753.91 758.68 <o,f0,male> the last shots that i have deal with coming back to this theme of sidewalks and
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 760.04 772.04 <o,f0,male> i wanted to say something here about i 'm kind of optimistic you know post second world war the influence of the automobile has really been devastating in a lot of our cities a lot of urban areas have been converted into
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 772.57 782.20 <o,f0,male> parking lots in a sort of indiscriminate use a lot of the planning departments became subordinated to the transportation department it's as easy to rag on cars as it is on wal mart i'm not going to do that
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 797.49 805.88 <o,f0,male> are our contributions to a larger whole cities are the place where we're most likely to encounter diversity
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 806.33 814.18 <o,f0,male> and to mix with other people we go there for stimulation in art and all those other things but i think people have recognized the sanctity of our urban areas
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 814.44 821.88 <o,f0,male> a place like chicago has really reached kind of a level of international stature the u s is actually becoming a bit of a leader in kind of enlightened urban
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 822.28 830.39 <o,f0,male> planning and renewal and i want to single out a place like chicago where i look at some guy like mayor daley as a bit of a design hero for being able to work through
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 830.69 840.00 <o,f0,male> the political processes and all that to improve an area you would expect a city like this to have upgraded flower boxes on michigan avenue where wealthy people shop
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 853.69 861.30 <o,f0,male> common elements of this that you'll see throughout chicago and then there are your big d design statements the pritzker pavilion done by frank gehry
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 861.91 872.65 <o,f0,male> measure of this as being an important bit of design is not so much the way that it looks but the fact that it performs a very important social function there are a lot of free concerts for example that go on
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 873.03 883.65 <o,f0,male> in this area it has a phenomenal acoustic system but the commitment that the city has made to the public area is significant and almost an international model i work on the mayor 's council in san francisco on the international
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 889.34 897.67 <o,f0,male> mayor daley and the folks there i thought that i should include at least one shot of technology for you guys this is also in millennium park in chicago where
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 898.03 908.67 <o,f0,male> the spanish artist designer plensa has created kind of a digital readout in this park that reflects back the characters and personalities of the people
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 909.16 917.71 <o,f0,male> in this area and it's a welcoming area i think inclusive of diversity reflective of diversity and i think this marriage
RobForbes_2006 1 RobForbes_2006 918.15 926.23 <o,f0,male> both technology and art in the public sector is an area where the u s can really take a leadership role and chicago is one example thank you very much
