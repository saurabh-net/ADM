RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 16.11 23.79 <o,f0,female> i think it was in my second grade that i was caught drawing the bust of a nude by michelangelo i was sent straight away to my school principal
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 24.45 26.56 <o,f0,female> and my school principal a sweet nun
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 28.47 35.58 <o,f0,female> looked at my book with disgust flipped through the pages saw all the nudes you know i'd been seeing my mother draw nudes and i'd copy her
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 36.39 41.03 <o,f0,female> and the nun slapped me on my face and said
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 46.41 56.03 <o,f0,female> but it was convincing enough for me never to draw again until the ninth grade thanks to a really boring lecture i started caricaturing my teachers in school
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 56.65 64.27 <o,f0,female> and you know i got a lot of popularity i don't play sports i'm really bad at sports i don't have the fanciest gadgets at home
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 64.57 77.36 <o,f0,female> i'm not on top of the class so for me cartooning gave me a sense of identity i got popular but i was scared i'd get caught again so what i did was i quickly put together a collage of all the teachers i had drawn
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 78.14 86.71 <o,f0,female> glorified my school principal put him right on top and gifted it to him he had a good laugh at the other teachers and put it up on the notice board
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 89.39 90.26 <o,f0,female> this is a part of
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 92.14 100.34 <o,f0,female> i became a school hero all my seniors knew me i felt really special i have to tell you a little bit about my family that's my mother
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 100.75 108.96 <o,f0,female> i love her to bits she's the one who taught me how to draw and more importantly how to love she's a bit of a hippie she said don 't say that but i'm saying it anyway
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 110.32 123.51 <o,f0,female> the rest of my family are boring academics busy collecting ivy league decals for our classic ambassador car my father 's a little different my father believed in a holistic approach to living and you know every time he taught
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 125.31 138.23 <o,f0,female> these books because these books are hijacked by industrial revolution while he still held that worldview i was sixteen i got the best lawyer in town my older brother karthik and i sat him down and i said
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 152.26 159.07 <o,f0,female> he was very impressed he was all tearing up ready to hug me and i said hold that thought i said can i quite school then
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 161.11 173.16 <o,f0,female> but to cut a long story short i quit school to pursue a career as a cartoonist i must have done about thirty thousand caricatures i would do birthday parties weddings divorces anything for anyone who wanted to use my services
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 173.71 186.73 <o,f0,female> but most importantly while i was traveling i taught children cartooning and in exchange i learned how to be spontaneous and mad and crazy and fun when i started teaching them i said let me start doing this professionally
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 187.16 193.66 <o,f0,female> when i was eighteen i started my own school however an eighteen year old trying to start a school is not easy unless you have
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 194.13 202.51 <o,f0,female> a big patron or a big supporter so i was flipping through the pages of the times of india when i saw that the prime minister of india was visiting
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 202.82 204.44 <o,f0,female> my home town bangalore
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 205.34 216.82 <o,f0,female> and you know just like how every cartoonist knows bush here and if you had to meet bush it would be the funnest thing because his face was a cartoonist 's delight i had to meet my prime minister
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 217.32 226.69 <o,f0,female> i went to the place where his helicopter was about to land i saw layers of security i caricatured my way through three layers by just impressing the
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 245.05 247.42 <o,f0,female> i i hopped into his car and off we went through
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 252.95 264.38 <o,f0,female> i sat him down i caricatured him and since then i've caricatured hundreds of celebrities this is one i remember fondly salman rushdie was pissed off i think because i altered the map of new york
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 269.07 271.45 <o,f0,female> anyway the next slide i'm about to show you
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 277.27 285.45 <o,f0,female> the next slide i'm about to show you is a little more serious i was hesitant to include this in my presentation because this cartoon was published
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 286.11 292.29 <o,f0,female> soon after nine eleven what was for me a very naive observation turned out to be a disaster
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 292.85 301.72 <o,f0,female> that evening i came home to hundreds of hate mails hundreds of people telling me how they could have lived another day without seeing this i was also asked to leave
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 302.27 305.50 <o,f0,female> the organization a cartoonists organization in america
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 305.91 314.66 <o,f0,female> that for me was my lifeline that's when i realized you know cartoons are really powerful art comes with responsibility anyway what i did was i decided
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 314.98 324.56 <o,f0,female> that i need to take a break i quit my job at the papers i closed my school and i wrapped up my pencils and my brushes and inks and i decided to go traveling
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 324.93 333.22 <o,f0,female> when i went traveling i remember i met this fabulous old man who i met when i was caricaturing who turned out to be an artist
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 345.02 354.04 <o,f0,female> i said oh my god what is that and i asked him and he said oh that thing in the night i die in the morning i am born again
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 369.83 371.67 <o,f0,female> so i tried going to the art store
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 372.24 386.11 <o,f0,female> you know there are a hundred types of brushes forget it they will confuse you even if you know how to draw so i decided i'm going to learn to paint by myself i'm going to show you a very quick clip to show you how i painted and a little bit about my city bangalore
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 417.70 428.20 <o,f0,female> they had to be larger than life everything had to be larger the next painting was even bigger and even bigger and for me it was i had to dance while i painted it was so exciting except
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 435.45 443.22 <o,f0,female> i didn't know the dance form so i started following them and i made some money sold my paintings and would rush off to france or spain
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 443.61 451.51 <o,f0,female> and work with them that's pepe linares a renowned flamenco singer but i had one problem my paintings never danced
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 452.08 466.82 <o,f0,female> as much energy as i put into them while making them they never danced so i decided i had this crazy epiphany at two in the morning i called my friends painted on their bodies and had them dance in front of a painting and all of a sudden my paintings came alive
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 467.23 479.83 <o,f0,female> and then i was fortunate enough to actually perform this in california with velocity circus and i sat like you guys there in the audience and i saw my work come alive you know normally you work in isolation and
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 482.06 496.45 <o,f0,female> the work was coming alive and it had some other artists working with me the collaborative effort was fabulous i said i'm going to collaborate with anybody and everybody i meet i started doing fashion this is a fashion show we held in london
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 496.95 499.26 <o,f0,female> the best collaboration of course is with children
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 509.60 520.84 <o,f0,female> and i must say i spent time in the bronx working with these kids and in exchange for me working with them they taught me how to be cool i don't think i've succeeded but they've taught me they said stop
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 527.40 528.09 <o,f0,female> then i
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 528.98 531.09 <o,f0,female> all this is good but i want to paint like a
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 542.11 554.29 <o,f0,female> paint humongous paintings and they look really good and i wondered how they did it from so close so one day i had the opportunity to meet one of these guys and i said how do you paint like that who taught you
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 555.05 564.13 <o,f0,female> and he said oh it's very easy i can teach you but we're leaving the city because billboard painters are a dying extinct bunch of artists
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 593.57 603.29 <o,f0,female> i must have been nineteen and a half then and it was love at first sight i lived in india she lived in america she'd come every two months to visit me
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 603.88 615.68 <o,f0,female> and then i said i'm the man i'm the man and i have to reciprocate i have to travel seven oceans and i have to come and see you i did that twice and i went broke
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 617.24 625.34 <o,f0,female> so then i said nets what do i do she said why don't you send me your paintings my dad knows a bunch of rich guys we'll try and con them into buying it
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 630.91 631.82 <o,f0,female> dad 's friends
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 632.57 632.99 <o,f0,female> like most
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 640.85 648.59 <o,f0,female> no they were really big geeks and they didn't know much about art so netra was stuck with thirty paintings of mine
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 649.80 660.09 <o,f0,female> so what we did was we rented a little van and we drove all over the east coast trying to sell it she contacted anyone and everyone who was willing to buy my work
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 661.14 669.57 <o,f0,female> she made enough money she sold off the whole collection and made enough money to move me for four years with lawyers a company everything and she became my manager
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 670.19 673.07 <o,f0,female> that's us in new york notice one thing
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 681.35 693.86 <o,f0,female> but this brought me with netra managing my career it brought me a lot of success i was really happy i thought of myself as a bit of a rockstar i loved the attention this is all the press we got and we said
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 694.36 700.53 <o,f0,female> it's time to celebrate and i said that the best way to celebrate is to marry netra i said let 's get
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 701.44 710.79 <o,f0,female> and i said not just married let 's invite everyone who 's helped us all the people who bought our work and you won 't believe it we put together a list of seven thousand people who had made a
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 725.65 735.50 <o,f0,female> models we had makeup artists jewelry designers all kinds of people working with me to make my wedding an art installation and i had a special
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 740.43 751.06 <o,f0,female> on that for me but all this excitement led to the press writing about us we were in the papers we're still in the news three years later but unfortunately something tragic happened
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 753.14 753.73 <o,f0,female> my mother
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 761.92 764.35 <o,f0,female> you have to say bye to her you have to do what you have to do
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 764.92 778.82 <o,f0,female> and i was devastated i had shows booked up for another year i was on a high and i couldn 't i could not my life was not exuberant i could not live this larger than life person i started exploring the
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 781.66 784.32 <o,f0,female> of course my work turned ugly
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 786.41 789.77 <o,f0,female> another thing happened i lost all my audiences
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 790.04 794.36 <o,f0,female> the bollywood stars who i would party with and buy my work
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 814.24 818.14 <o,f0,female> none of them liked it my works also turned autobiographical
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 819.40 823.79 <o,f0,female> at this point something else happened a very very dear friend of mine
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 824.58 825.65 <o,f0,female> came out of the closet
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 826.33 836.41 <o,f0,female> and in india at that time it was illegal to be gay and it's disgusting to see how people respond to a gay person i was very upset i remember the time
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 836.92 840.72 <o,f0,female> when my mother used to dress me up as a little girl that's me there
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 851.55 852.64 <o,f0,female> anyway i don't know what my friends
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 860.34 869.86 <o,f0,female> my works turned a little violent i talked about this masculinity that one need not perform and i talked about the weakness of male sexuality
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 870.41 881.07 <o,f0,female> this time not only did my collectors disappear the political activists decided to ban me and to threaten me and to forbid me from showing
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 881.59 887.87 <o,f0,female> it turned nasty and i'm a bit of a chicken i can't deal with any threat this was a big threat so i decided
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 888.68 891.60 <o,f0,female> it was time to end and go back home
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 892.36 895.69 <o,f0,female> this time i said let 's try something different i need to be reborn again
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 896.53 908.25 <o,f0,female> and i thought the best way as most of you know who have children the best way to have a new lease on life is to have a child i decided to have a child and before i did that i quickly studied what can go wrong
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 909.13 920.66 <o,f0,female> a family get disfunctional and rudra was born that's my little son and two magical things happened after he was born my mother miraculously recovered after
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 922.82 930.66 <o,f0,female> and this man was elected president of this country you know i sat at home and i watched i teared up and i said that's where i want to be
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 931.40 939.92 <o,f0,female> and i wound up our life closed up everything we had and we decided to move to new york and this was just eight months ago
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 940.51 949.42 <o,f0,female> i moved back to new york my work has changed everything about my work has become more whimsical this one is called what the fuck was i thinking it
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 951.35 953.43 <o,f0,female> talks about mental incest you know
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 953.95 957.52 <o,f0,female> i may appear to be a very nice clean sweet boy but i'm not
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 965.45 970.71 <o,f0,female> these are just different cartoons and before i go want to tell you a little story
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 983.72 985.86 <o,f0,female> and that's an entirely different talk
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 986.53 991.11 <o,f0,female> i want to leave you with one story that really really inspired me i met belinda
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 991.49 996.01 <o,f0,female> when she was sixteen i was seventeen i was in australia and
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 997.68 1000.47 <o,f0,female> had cancer and i was told she's not going to live
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 1002.72 1004.14 <o,f0,female> they in fact told me three weeks
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 1004.63 1016.91 <o,f0,female> i walk into her room and there was a shy girl and she was bald and she was trying to hide her baldness i whipped out my pen and i started drawing on her head and i drew a crown for her and then we started talking
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 1017.42 1020.62 <o,f0,female> and we spent a lovely time i told her how i ended up in australia how
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 1021.44 1026.40 <o,f0,female> who i conned and how i got a ticket and all the stories and i drew it out for
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 1027.27 1028.31 <o,f0,female> and then i left
RaghavaKK_2010 1 RaghavaKK_2010 1033.97 1041.80 <o,f0,female> and within a few days of her death they published a book for her and she used my cartoon on the cover
