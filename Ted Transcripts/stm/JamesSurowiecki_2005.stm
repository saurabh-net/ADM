JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 16.22 24.66 <o,f0,male> this was in an area called wellawatta a prime residential area in colombo we stood on the railroad tracks that ran between my friend 's house and the beach
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 25.08 39.61 <o,f0,male> the tracks are elevated about eight feet from the waterline normally but at that point the water had receded to a level three or four feet below normal i'd never seen the reef here before there were fish caught in rock pools left behind by the receding water
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 40.11 48.93 <o,f0,male> some children jumped down and ran to the rock pools with bags they were trying to catch fish no one realized that this was a very bad idea
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 49.29 57.33 <o,f0,male> the people on the tracks just continued to watch them i turned around to check on my friend 's house then someone on the tracks screamed
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 66.11 73.24 <o,f0,male> the children managed to run back onto the tracks no one was lost there but the water continued to climb
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 73.61 84.58 <o,f0,male> in about two minutes it had reached the level of the railroad tracks and was coming over it we had run about one hundred meters by this time i continued to rise i saw an old man standing at his gate
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 84.94 92.13 <o,f0,male> knee deep in water refusing to move he said he'd lived his whole life there by the beach and that he would rather die there than
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 93.07 103.97 <o,f0,male> a boy broke away from his mother to run back into his house to get his dog who was apparently afraid an old lady crying was carried out of her house and up the road by her son
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 104.90 110.86 <o,f0,male> the slum built on the railroad reservation between the sea and the railroad tracks was completely swept away
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 111.26 120.09 <o,f0,male> since this was a high risk location the police had warned the residents and no one was there when the water rose but they had not had any time to evacuate any belongings
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 120.47 130.52 <o,f0,male> for hours afterwards the sea was strewn with bits of wood for miles around all of this was from the houses in the slum when the waters subsided it was as if it had never existed
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 134.04 141.24 <o,f0,male> this may seem hard to believe unless you've been reading lots and lots of news reports but in many places after the tsunami villagers were still terrified
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 141.58 153.41 <o,f0,male> when what was a tranquil sea swallows up people homes and long tail boats mercilessly without warning and no one can tell you anything reliable about whether another one is coming i'm not sure you'd want to calm down either
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 153.87 163.48 <o,f0,male> one of the scariest things about the tsunami that i've not seen mentioned is the complete lack of information this may seem minor but it is terrifying to hear rumor after rumor after rumor
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 163.96 174.83 <o,f0,male> another tidal wave bigger than the last will be coming at exactly one p m or perhaps tonight or perhaps you don't even know if it is safe to go back down to the water to catch a boat to the hospital
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 175.17 188.97 <o,f0,male> we think that phi phi hospital was destroyed we think this boat is going to phuket hospital but if it's too dangerous to land at its pier then perhaps it will go to krabi instead which is more protected we don't think another wave is coming right away
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 201.40 211.32 <o,f0,male> having this news was comforting in some small way to understand what had just happened to us however the report focused on what had already occurred and offered no information on what to expect now
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 211.69 219.97 <o,f0,male> in general everything was merely hearsay and rumor and not a single person i spoke to for over thirty six hours knew anything with any certainty
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 320.55 321.85 <o,f0,male> were both on this site
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 324.20 334.36 <o,f0,male> in the world of blogs there's going to be before the tsunami and after the tsunami because one of the things that happened in the wake of the tsunami was that although initially that is in that first day
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 334.61 343.56 <o,f0,male> there was actually a kind of dearth of live reporting there was a dearth of live video and some people complained about this they said sort of you know the blogsters let us down
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 344.13 351.68 <o,f0,male> what became very clear was that within a few days the outpouring of information was immense and we got a complete
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 352.21 360.95 <o,f0,male> and powerful picture of what had happened in a way that we never had been able to get before and what you had was a group of essentially unorganized
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 372.82 384.23 <o,f0,male> than the mainstream media could give us and so in some ways the tsunami can be seen as a sort of seminal moment a moment in which the blogosphere came to a certain degree of age
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 385.10 394.09 <o,f0,male> now i'm sort of going to move now from this kind of the sublime in the traditional sense of the word that is to say awe inspiring terrifying to the somewhat more mundane
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 394.62 403.27 <o,f0,male> because when we think about blogs i think for most of us who are concerned about them we're primarily concerned with things like politics technology
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 404.24 409.78 <o,f0,male> and i want to ask three questions in this talk in the ten minutes that remain about the blogosphere
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 410.17 420.07 <o,f0,male> the first one is what does it tell us about our ideas about what motivate people to do things the second is do blogs genuinely have the possibility of
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 421.11 434.45 <o,f0,male> accessing a kind of collective intelligence that has previously remained for the most part untapped and then the third part is what are the potential problems or the sort of dark side of blogs as we know them
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 435.26 448.04 <o,f0,male> ok the first question what do they tell us about why people do things one of the fascinating things about the blogosphere specifically and of course the internet more generally and it's going to seem like a very obvious point but i think it is an important one to think about
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 448.45 462.79 <o,f0,male> is that the people who are generating this enormous reams of content every day who are spending enormous amounts of time organizing linking commenting on the substance of the internet are doing so primarily for free
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 463.11 472.64 <o,f0,male> they are not getting paid for it in any way other than in the attention and to some extent the reputational capital that they gain from doing a good job
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 473.11 486.38 <o,f0,male> and this is at least to a traditional economist somewhat remarkable because sort of the traditional account of economic man would say that you know basically you do things for a concrete reward primarily financial
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 486.77 500.87 <o,f0,male> but instead what we're finding on the internet and one of the great geniuses of it is that people have found a way to work together without any money involved at all they have come up with in a sense a sort of different method for organizing activity
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 501.93 513.21 <o,f0,male> the yale law professor yochai benkler in an essay called coase 's penguin talks about this sort of open source model which we're familiar with from linux as being potentially applicable in a whole host of situations
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 513.88 521.97 <o,f0,male> you think about this with the tsunami what you have is essentially a kind of army of local journalists who are sort of producing enormous amounts of material
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 522.15 533.93 <o,f0,male> for no reason other than to tell their stories that's a very powerful idea and it's a very powerful reality and it's one that offers really interesting possibilities for organizing a whole host of activities
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 535.16 544.71 <o,f0,male> down the road so i think the first thing that the blogosphere tells us is that we need to expand our idea of what counts as rational and we need to expand our simple equation
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 545.40 554.47 <o,f0,male> value equals money or you have to pay for it to be good but that in fact you can end up with collectively really brilliant products without any money at all changing hands
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 554.73 562.80 <o,f0,male> there are a few bloggers somewhere maybe around twenty now who do in fact make some kind of money and a few who are actually trying to make a full time living out of it
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 563.08 572.43 <o,f0,male> but the vast majority of them are doing it because they love it or they love the attention or whatever it is so you know howard rheingold has written a lot about this and i think is writing about this more but this notion
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 588.87 599.51 <o,f0,male> and the premise of the wisdom of crowds is that under the right conditions groups can be remarkably intelligent and they can actually often be smarter than even the smartest person within them
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 600.04 608.03 <o,f0,male> the simplest example of this is that if you ask a group of people to do something like guess how many jelly beans are in a jar you know if i had a jar of jelly beans
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 608.29 617.25 <o,f0,male> and i asked you to guess how many jelly beans were in that jar your average guess would be remarkably good it would be somewhere probably within three and five percent of the number of
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 618.04 626.83 <o,f0,male> beans in the jar and it would be better than ninety to ninety five percent of you there may be one or two of you who are brilliant jelly bean guessers but
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 627.50 636.64 <o,f0,male> for the most part the group 's guess would be better than just about all of you and what's fascinating is that you can see this phenomenon at work in many more complicated situations
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 637.04 645.18 <o,f0,male> so for instance if you look at the odds on horses at a racetrack they predict almost perfectly how likely a horse is to win
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 645.95 652.13 <o,f0,male> in a sense the group of betters at the racetrack is forecasting the future in probabilistic terms
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 652.87 661.91 <o,f0,male> if you think about something like google which essentially is relying on the collective intelligence of the web to seek out those sites that have the most valuable information
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 662.41 674.56 <o,f0,male> we know that google does an exceptionally good job of doing that and it does that because collectively this disorganized thing we call the world wide web actually has a remarkable order or a remarkable intelligence in it
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 675.09 688.43 <o,f0,male> and this i think is one of the real promises of the blogosphere dan gillmor whose book we the media which is included in the gift pack has talked about it as saying that as a writer he 's recognized that his readers know more than he does
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 689.42 697.28 <o,f0,male> is a very challenging idea it's a very challenging idea to mainstream media it's a very challenging idea to anyone who has invested an enormous amount of time
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 697.97 705.32 <o,f0,male> expertise and who has a lot of energy invested in the notion that he or she knows better than everyone
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 706.08 713.96 <o,f0,male> what the blogosphere offers is the possibility of getting at the kind of collective distributive intelligence that is out there
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 714.42 725.09 <o,f0,male> and that we know is available to us if we can just figure out a way of accessing it each blog post each blog commentary may not in and of itself
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 725.62 738.95 <o,f0,male> be exactly what we're looking for but collectively the judgment of those people posting those people linking more often than not is going to give you a very interesting and enormously valuable picture of what's going on
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 739.58 745.82 <o,f0,male> so that's the positive side of it that's the positive side of what is sometimes called participatory journalism or citizen
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 747.90 759.85 <o,f0,male> et cetera that in fact we are sort of giving people who have never been able to talk before a kind of voice and we're able to access information that has always been there but has essentially gone untapped
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 760.30 770.28 <o,f0,male> but there is a dark side to this and that's what i want to spend the last part of my talk on one of the things that happens if you spend a lot of time on the internet and you spend a lot of time thinking about the internet
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 780.08 789.73 <o,f0,male> is very easy to think that networks are necessarily good things that being linked from one place to another that being tightly linked in a group is a very good thing
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 790.19 803.82 <o,f0,male> and much of the time it is but there's also a downside to this a kind of dark side in fact and that is that the more tightly linked we come to each other the harder it is for each of us to remain independent
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 804.36 814.72 <o,f0,male> one of the fundamental characteristics of a network is that once you are linked in the network the network starts to shape your views and starts to shape your interactions with everybody else
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 828.61 834.76 <o,f0,male> now this has all these benefits it's very beneficial in terms of the efficiency of communicating information it gives you access to
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 835.23 843.51 <o,f0,male> a whole host of people it allows people to coordinate their activities in very good ways but the problem is that groups are only smart
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 843.86 857.47 <o,f0,male> when the people in them are as independent as possible this is sort of the paradox of the wisdom of crowds or the paradox of collective intelligence that what it requires is actually a form of independent thinking
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 858.18 869.41 <o,f0,male> and networks make it harder for people to do that because they drive attention to the things that the network values so one of the phenomenons that's very clear in the blogosphere
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 870.00 877.61 <o,f0,male> is that once a meme once an idea gets going it is very easy for people to just sort of pile on because other people
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 878.30 886.01 <o,f0,male> a link people have linked to it and so other people in turn link to it et cetera et cetera and that phenomenon that phenomenon of kind of piling on
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 886.51 897.03 <o,f0,male> the existing links is one that is characteristic of the blogosphere particularly of the political blogosphere and it is one that essentially sort of throws off
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 907.27 917.00 <o,f0,male> a lot of people talk about ants you know this is a conference inspired by nature when we talk about bottom up decentralized phenomenons the sort of ant colony is the classic metaphor
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 917.29 929.67 <o,f0,male> because you know no individual ant knows what it's doing but collectively ants are able to reach incredibly intelligent decisions they're able to
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 930.49 939.02 <o,f0,male> guide their traffic with remarkable speed so the ant colony is a great model you have all these little parts that collectively add up to a great thing but
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 939.35 946.47 <o,f0,male> we know that occasionally ants go astray and what happens is that if army ants are sort of wandering around and they get lost
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 967.33 975.90 <o,f0,male> and that i think is a sort of thing to watch out for that's the thing we have to fear is that we're just going to keep marching around and around until we die
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 985.32 996.35 <o,f0,male> is that it really did represent a genuine bottom up phenomenon you saw sites that had never existed before getting huge amounts of traffic you saw people being able to offer uptheir independent points of view
JamesSurowiecki_2005 1 JamesSurowiecki_2005 996.60 1008.96 <o,f0,male> in a way that they hadn't before and there you really did see the intelligence of the web manifest itself so that's the upside the circular mill is the downside and i think that the former is what we really need to strive for
