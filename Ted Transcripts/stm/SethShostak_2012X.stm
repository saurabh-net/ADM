SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 33.57 52.94 <o,f0,male> now a lot of people think that this is kind of idealistic ridiculous maybe even hopeless but i just want to talk to you a little bit about why i think that the job i have is actually a privilege okay and give you a little bit of the motivation for my getting into this line of work if that 's what you call it this thing whoops can we go back
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 52.94 55.15 <o,f0,male> hello come in earth
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 55.15 64.12 <o,f0,male> there we go all right this is the owens valley radio observatory behind the sierra nevadas and in one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight i was working there
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 64.12 81.54 <o,f0,male> collecting data for my thesis now it 's kinda lonely it 's kinda tedious just collecting data so i would amuse myself by taking photos at night of the telescopes or even of myself because you know at night i would be the only hominid within about thirty miles
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 81.54 97.6 <o,f0,male> so here are pictures of myself the observatory had just acquired a new book written by a russian cosmologist by the name of joseph shklovsky and then expanded and translated and edited by a little known cornell astronomer by the name of carl sagan
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 97.6 113.73 <o,f0,male> and i remember reading that book and at three in the morning i was reading this book and it was explaining how the antennas i was using to measure the spins of galaxies could also be used to communicate to send bits of information from one star system to another
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 113.73 118.52 <o,f0,male> now at three o 'clock in the morning when you 're all alone haven 't had much sleep that was a very romantic idea
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 125.94 130 <o,f0,male> that appealed to me so much that twenty years later i took a job at the seti institute
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 147 165.23 <o,f0,male> so it was true all right now the idea for doing this it wasn 't very old at the time that i made that photo the idea dates from one thousand nine hundred and sixty when a young astronomer by the name of frank drake used this antenna in west virginia pointed it at a couple of nearby stars in the hopes of eavesdropping on e t
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 165.23 171.86 <o,f0,male> now frank didn 't hear anything actually he did but it turned out to be the u s air force which doesn 't count as extraterrestrial intelligence
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 171.86 190.89 <o,f0,male> but drake 's idea here became very popular because it was very appealing and i 'll get back to that and on the basis of this experiment which didn 't succeed we have been doing seti ever since not continuously but ever since we still haven 't heard anything we still haven 't heard anything in fact we don 't know about any life beyond earth but
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 190.89 204.37 <o,f0,male> i 'm going to suggest to you that that 's going to change rather soon and part of the reason in fact the majority of the reason why i think that 's going to change is that the equipment 's getting better this is the allen telescope array about three hundred and fifty miles from whatever seat you 're in right now
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 204.37 223.86 <o,f0,male> this is something that we 're using today to search for e t and the electronics have gotten very much better too this is frank drake 's electronics in one thousand nine hundred and sixty this is the allen telescope array electronics today some pundit with too much time on his hands has reckoned that the new experiments are approximately one hundred trillion times better
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 231.06 245.18 <o,f0,male> but something that 's not appreciated by the public is in fact that the experiment continues to get better and consequently tends to get faster this is a little plot and every time you show a plot you lose ten percent of the audience i have twelve of these laughter but
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 245.67 257.42 <o,f0,male> what i plotted here is just some metric that shows how fast we 're searching in other words we 're looking for a needle in a haystack we know how big the haystack is it 's the galaxy but
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 257.42 269.67 <o,f0,male> we 're going through the haystack no longer with a teaspoon but with a skip loader because of this increase in speed in fact those of you who are still conscious and mathematically competent will note that this is a semi log plot
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 269.67 281.52 <o,f0,male> in other words the rate of increase is exponential it 's exponentially improving now exponential is an overworked word you hear it on the media all the time they don 't really know what exponential means but this is
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 281.53 288.91 <o,f0,male> exponential in fact it 's doubling every eighteen months and of course every card carrying member of the digerati knows that that 's moore 's law
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 288.91 302.33 <o,f0,male> so this means that over the course of the next two dozen years we 'll be able to look at a million star systems a million star systems looking for signals that would prove somebody 's out there well a million star systems is that interesting i mean
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 302.33 304.78 <o,f0,male> how many of those star systems have planets
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 304.78 312.09 <o,f0,male> and the facts are we didn 't know the answer to that even as recently as fifteen years ago and in fact we really didn 't know it even as recently as six months ago
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 312.09 327.58 <o,f0,male> but now we do recent results suggest that virtually every star has planets and more than one they 're like you know kittens you get a litter you don 't get one kitten you get a bunch so in fact this is a pretty accurate estimate of the number of
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 327.58 331.85 <o,f0,male> planets in our galaxy just in our galaxy
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 349.54 358.62 <o,f0,male> of these planets are actually suitable for life we don 't know the answer to that either but we will learn that answer this year thanks to nasa 's kepler space telescope
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 358.62 370.42 <o,f0,male> and in fact the smart money which is to say the people who work on this project the smart money is suggesting that the fraction of planets that might be suitable for life is maybe one in a thousand
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 370.42 380.92 <o,f0,male> one in a hundred something like that well even taking the pessimistic estimate that it 's one in a thousand that means that there are at least a billion cousins of the earth
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 380.92 399.78 <o,f0,male> just in our own galaxy okay now i 've given you a lot of numbers here but they 're mostly big numbers okay so you know keep that in mind there 's plenty of real estate plenty of real estate in the universe and if we 're the only bit of real estate in which there 's some interesting occupants that makes you a miracle
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 399.78 401.97 <o,f0,male> and i know you like to think you 're a miracle
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 401.97 408.1 <o,f0,male> but if you do science you learn rather quickly that every time you think you 're a miracle you 're wrong so probably not the case
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 415.42 428.77 <o,f0,male> habitable real estate in the cosmos i figure we 're going to pick up a signal within two dozen years and i feel strongly enough about that to make a bet with you either we 're going to find e t in the next two dozen years or i 'll buy you a cup of coffee
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 436.55 452.95 <o,f0,male> let me tell you about some aspect of this that people don 't think about and that is what happens suppose that what i say is true i mean who knows but suppose it happens suppose some time in the next two dozen years we pick up a faint line that tells us we have some cosmic company
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 452.95 455.39 <o,f0,male> what is the effect what 's the consequence
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 455.39 460.77 <o,f0,male> now i might be at ground zero for this i happen to know what the consequence for me would be because we 've had false alarms
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 476.92 485.09 <o,f0,male> i kept waiting for my mom to call somebody to call the government to call nobody called nobody called i was so nervous
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 485.09 494.65 <o,f0,male> that i couldn 't sit down i just wandered around taking photos like this one just for something to do well at nine thirty in the morning with my head down on my desk because i obviously hadn 't slept all night
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 542.57 551.82 <o,f0,male> but it probably wouldn 't have been right and i think that to predict what finding e t s going to mean we can 't predict that either but here are a couple things i can say to begin with
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 551.82 567.24 <o,f0,male> it 's going to be a society that 's way in advance of our own you 're not going to hear from alien neanderthals they 're not building transmitters they 're going to be ahead of us maybe by a few thousand years maybe by a few millions years but substantially ahead of us and that means if you can understand anything that they 're going to say
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 567.24 587.2 <o,f0,male> then you might be able to short circuit history by getting information from a society that 's way beyond our own now you might find that a bit hyperbolic and maybe it is but nonetheless it 's conceivable that this will happen and you know you could consider this like i don 't know giving julius caesar english lessons and the key to the library of congress it would change his day
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 587.2 590.55 <o,f0,male> that 's one thing another thing that 's for sure going to happen
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 605.75 615.91 <o,f0,male> the third thing that it might tell you is somewhat vague but i think interesting and important and that is if you find a signal coming from a more advanced society because they will be
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 615.91 630.57 <o,f0,male> that will tell you something about our own possibilities that we 're not inevitably doomed to self destruction because they survived their technology we could do it too normally when you look out into the universe you 're looking back in time
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 649.99 655.04 <o,f0,male> seti i think is important because it 's exploration
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 655.04 672.16 <o,f0,male> and it 's not only exploration it 's comprehensible exploration now i gotta tell you i 'm always reading books about explorers i find exploration very interesting arctic exploration you know people like magellan amundsen shackleton you see franklin down there scott all these guys it 's really nifty
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 680.19 699.8 <o,f0,male> because i mean think of ants you know most ants are programmed to follow one another along in a long line but there are a couple of ants maybe one percent of those ants that are what they call pioneer ants and they 're the ones that wander off they 're the ones you find on the kitchen countertop you gotta get them with your thumb before they find the sugar or something but those ants even though most of them get wiped out
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 699.8 714.09 <o,f0,male> those ants are the ones that are essential to the survival of the hive so exploration is important i also think that exploration is important in terms of being able to address what i think is a critical
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 714.09 718.56 <o,f0,male> lack in our society and that is the lack of science literacy the lack
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 731.62 746.08 <o,f0,male> polls taken this poll was taken ten years ago it shows like roughly one third of the public thinks that aliens are not only out there we 're looking for them out there but they 're here right sailing the skies in their saucers and occasionally abducting people for experiments their parents wouldn 't approve of well
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 746.08 753.5 <o,f0,male> that would be interesting if it was true and job security for me but i don 't think the evidence is very good that 's more you know sad than significant
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 753.5 759.86 <o,f0,male> but there are other things that people believe that are significant like the efficacy of homeopathy or that
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 759.86 773.63 <o,f0,male> evolution is just you know sort of a crazy idea by scientists without any legs or you know evolution all that sort of thing or global warming these sorts of ideas don 't really have any validity that you can 't trust the scientists
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 773.63 778.75 <o,f0,male> now we 've got to solve that problem because that 's a critically important problem and you
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 795.75 813.47 <o,f0,male> and that 's the result of four hundred years of science right i mean in the eighteenth century in the eighteenth century you could become an expert on any field of science in an afternoon by going to a library if you could find the library right in the nineteenth century if you had a basement lab
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 813.47 822.06 <o,f0,male> you could make major scientific discoveries in your own home right because there was all this science just lying around waiting for somebody to pick it up
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 845.11 852.94 <o,f0,male> i bet the answer you 're going to get is well i don 't know what the higgs boson is and i don 't know if it 's important and probably most of the people wouldn 't even know the value of a swiss franc
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 870.4 886.23 <o,f0,male> so that 's one thing the other thing is it 's exciting science it 's exciting because we 're naturally interested in other intelligent beings and i think that 's part of our hardwiring i mean we 're hardwired to be interested in beings that might be if you will competitors or if you 're the romantic sort
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 886.23 891.57 <o,f0,male> possibly even mates okay i mean this is analogous to our interest in things that have big teeth
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 891.57 907.62 <o,f0,male> right we 're interested in things that have big teeth and you can see the evolutionary value of that and you can also see the practical consequences by watching animal planet you notice they make very few programs about gerbils it 's mostly about things that have big teeth okay so we 're interested in these sorts of things
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 907.62 925.22 <o,f0,male> and not just us it 's also kids this allows you to pay it forward by using this subject as a hook to science because seti involves all kinds of science obviously biology obviously astronomy but also geology also chemistry various scientific disciplines all can be
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 939.33 953.24 <o,f0,male> but if you give talks to kids you know one in fifty of them some light bulb goes off and they think gee i 'd never thought of that and then they go you know read a book or a magazine or whatever they get interested in something now it 's my
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 970.82 976.98 <o,f0,male> i remember when a guy came to our high school actually it was actually my junior high school i was in sixth grade
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 976.98 993.64 <o,f0,male> and he gave some talk all i remember from it was one word electronics it was like dustin hoffman in the graduate right when he said plastics whatever that means plastics all right so the guy said electronics i don 't remember anything else in fact i don 't remember anything that my sixth grade teacher said all year but i remember electronics
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 993.64 1007.2 <o,f0,male> and so i got interested in electronics and you know i studied to get my ham license i was wiring up stuff here i am at about fifteen or something doing that sort of stuff okay that had a big effect on me so that 's my point that you can have a big effect on these kids
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 1007.2 1012.1 <o,f0,male> in fact this reminds me i don 't know a couple years ago i gave a talk
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 1012.1 1014.55 <o,f0,male> at a school in palo alto
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 1014.55 1030 <o,f0,male> where there were about a dozen eleven year olds that had come to this talk i had been brought in to talk to these kids for an hour eleven year olds they 're all sitting in a little semi circle looking up at me with big eyes and i started there was a white board behind me and i started off by writing a one with twenty two zeroes after it and i said all right now look
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 1036.34 1048.32 <o,f0,male> and one of these kids shot up his hand and he said well actually there is a name for it it 's a sextra quadra hexa something or other right now that kid was wrong by four orders of magnitude
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 1048.32 1064.15 <o,f0,male> but there was no doubt about it these kids were smart okay so i stopped giving the lecture all they wanted to do was ask questions in fact my last comments to these kids at the end i said you know you kids are smarter than the people i work with now
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 1085.37 1098.79 <o,f0,male> so to me it is a privilege and when i look in the mirror the facts are that i really don 't see myself what i see is the generation behind me these are some kids from the huff school fourth graders i talked there what two weeks ago something like that
SethShostak_2012X 1 SethShostak_2012X 1098.79 1108.69 <o,f0,male> i think that if you can instill some interest in science and how it works well that 's a payoff beyond easy measure thank you very much
