SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 17.66 36.61 <o,f0,female> embryonic stem cells are really incredible cells they are our body 's own repair kits and they 're pluripotent which means they can morph into all of the cells in our bodies soon we actually will be able to use stem cells to replace cells that are damaged or diseased
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 36.61 54.83 <o,f0,female> but that 's not what i want to talk to you about because right now there are some really extraordinary things that we are doing with stem cells that are completely changing the way we look and model disease our ability to understand why we get sick and even develop drugs
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 54.83 71.14 <o,f0,female> i truly believe that stem cell research is going to allow our children to look at alzheimer 's and diabetes and other major diseases the way we view polio today which is as a preventable disease
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 71.14 78.96 <o,f0,female> so here we have this incredible field which has enormous hope for humanity
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 78.96 94.36 <o,f0,female> but much like ivf over thirty five years ago until the birth of a healthy baby louise this field has been under siege politically and financially critical research is being challenged instead of supported
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 94.36 105.06 <o,f0,female> and we saw that it was really essential to have private safe haven laboratories where this work could be advanced without interference
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 105.06 117.05 <o,f0,female> and so in two thousand and five we started the new york stem cell foundation laboratory so that we would have a small organization that could do this work and support it
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 117.05 124 <o,f0,female> what we saw very quickly is the world of both medical research but also developing drugs and treatments
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 124 127.69 <o,f0,female> is dominated by as you would expect large organizations
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 127.69 140 <o,f0,female> but in a new field sometimes large organizations really have trouble getting out of their own way and sometimes they can 't ask the right questions and there is an enormous gap that 's just gotten larger between
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 160.08 169.85 <o,f0,female> because if you don 't close that gap you really are exactly where we are today and that 's what i want to focus on we 've spent the last couple of years
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 169.85 187.82 <o,f0,female> pondering this making a list of the different things that we had to do and so we developed a new technology it 's software and hardware that actually can generate thousands and thousands of genetically diverse stem cell lines to create a global array essentially avatars of ourselves
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 199.95 215.34 <o,f0,female> to actually do clinical trials in a dish with human cells not animal cells to generate drugs and treatments that are much more effective much safer much faster and at a much lower cost
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 215.34 223.88 <o,f0,female> so let me put that in perspective for you and give you some context this is an extremely new field
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 223.97 238.29 <o,f0,female> in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight human embryonic stem cells were first identified and just nine years later a group of scientists in japan were able to take skin cells and reprogram them with very powerful viruses
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 247.55 265.89 <o,f0,female> this was really an extraordinary advance because although these cells are not human embryonic stem cells which still remain the gold standard they are terrific to use for modeling disease and potentially for drug discovery so a few months later in two thousand and eight one of our scientists built on that research
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 265.89 281.22 <o,f0,female> he took skin biopsies this time from people who had a disease als or as you call it in the u k motor neuron disease he turned them into the ips cells that i 've just told you about and then he turned those ips cells into the motor neurons that actually were dying in the disease
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 281.22 290.76 <o,f0,female> so basically what he did was to take a healthy cell and turn it into a sick cell and he recapitulated the disease over and over again in the dish
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 290.76 301.31 <o,f0,female> and this was extraordinary because it was the first time that we had a model of a disease from a living patient in living human cells and as he watched the disease unfold
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 301.31 320.18 <o,f0,female> he was able to discover that actually the motor neurons were dying in the disease in a different way than the field had previously thought there was another kind of cell that actually was sending out a toxin and contributing to the death of these motor neurons and you simply couldn 't see it until you had the human model so you could really say that
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 325.71 328.43 <o,f0,female> being able to have human stem cell models
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 346.17 351.04 <o,f0,female> and stem cells really have given us the black box
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 351.04 368.83 <o,f0,female> for diseases and it 's an unprecedented window it really is extraordinary because you can recapitulate many many diseases in a dish you can see what begins to go wrong in the cellular conversation well before you would ever see symptoms appear in a patient
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 368.83 380.99 <o,f0,female> and this opens up the ability which hopefully will become something that is routine in the near term of using human cells to test for drugs
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 387.27 392.36 <o,f0,female> to bring a successful drug to market it takes on average thirteen years that 's one drug
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 392.69 402.41 <o,f0,female> with a sunk cost of four billion dollars and only one percent of the drugs that start down that road are actually going to get there
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 402.41 417.5 <o,f0,female> you can 't imagine other businesses that you would think of going into that have these kind of numbers it 's a terrible business model but it is really a worse social model because of what 's involved and the cost to all of us
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 439.99 449.76 <o,f0,female> and you can 't go into a living person with an illness and just pull out a few brain cells or cardiac cells and then start fooling around in a lab to test
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 449.76 468.34 <o,f0,female> for you know a promising drug but what you can do with human stem cells now is actually create avatars and you can create the cells whether it 's the live motor neurons or the beating cardiac cells or liver cells or other kinds of cells and you can
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 478.03 481.34 <o,f0,female> absolutely extraordinary and you 're going to know
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 509.95 524.26 <o,f0,female> look around this room we are all different and a disease that i might have if i had alzheimer 's disease or parkinson 's disease it probably would affect me differently than if one of you had that disease
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 524.26 533.15 <o,f0,female> and if we both had parkinson 's disease and we took the same medication but we had different genetic makeup
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 533.33 541.53 <o,f0,female> we probably would have a different result and it could well be that a drug that worked wonderfully for me was actually
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 549.61 561.79 <o,f0,female> and you know this seems totally obvious but unfortunately it is not the way that the pharmaceutical industry has been developing drugs because until now it hasn 't had the tools
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 561.79 581.65 <o,f0,female> and so we need to move away from this one size fits all model the way we 've been developing drugs is essentially like going into a shoe store no one asks you what size you are or if you 're going dancing or hiking they just say well you have feet here are your shoes it doesn 't work with shoes
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 588.96 606.71 <o,f0,female> there was a very sad example of this in the last decade there 's a wonderful drug and a class of drugs actually but the particular drug was vioxx and for people who were suffering from severe arthritis pain the drug was an absolute lifesaver
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 606.71 622.9 <o,f0,female> but unfortunately for another subset of those people they suffered pretty severe heart side effects and for a subset of those people the side effects were so severe the cardiac side effects that they were fatal
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 623.38 625.81 <o,f0,female> but imagine a different
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 625.81 644.33 <o,f0,female> scenario where we could have had an array a genetically diverse array of cardiac cells and we could have actually tested that drug vioxx in petri dishes and figured out well okay people with this genetic type are going to have
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 656.81 671.94 <o,f0,female> the people for whom it was a lifesaver could have still taken their medicine the people for whom it was a disaster or fatal would never have been given it and you can imagine a very different outcome for the company who had to withdraw the drug
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 672.88 675.04 <o,f0,female> so that
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 680.15 693.45 <o,f0,female> clearly we have to think about genetics we have to think about human testing but there 's a fundamental problem because right now stem cell lines as extraordinary as they are and lines are just groups of cells
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 693.45 699.55 <o,f0,female> they are made by hand one at a time and it takes a couple of months
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 718.59 727.43 <o,f0,female> so we looked at this and we thought okay artisanal is wonderful in you know your clothing and your bread and
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 743.99 745.52 <o,f0,female> we 're all different
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 746.1 754.11 <o,f0,female> we know from the sequencing of the human genome that it 's shown us all of the a 's c 's g 's and t 's that make up our genetic code
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 758.71 775.73 <o,f0,female> is like looking at the ones and zeroes of the computer code without having a computer that can read it it 's like having an app without having a smartphone we needed to have a way of bringing the biology to that incredible data
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 775.73 793.6 <o,f0,female> and the way to do that was to find a stand in a biological stand in that could contain all of the genetic information but have it be arrayed in such a way as it could be read together and actually create this incredible avatar
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 793.6 799.07 <o,f0,female> we need to have stem cells from all the genetic sub types that represent who we are
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 827.75 836.99 <o,f0,female> that already exist all of the drugs that currently exist and in the future you 're going to be taking drugs and treatments that have been tested for side effects
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 836.99 852.82 <o,f0,female> on all of the relevant cells on brain cells and heart cells and liver cells it really has brought us to the threshold of personalized medicine it 's here now and in our family
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 852.99 869.29 <o,f0,female> my son has type one diabetes which is still an incurable disease and i lost my parents to heart disease and cancer but i think that my story probably sounds familiar to you because probably a version of it is your story
