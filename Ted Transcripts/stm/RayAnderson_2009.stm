RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 19.72 30.17 <o,f2,male> or not i come offering a solution to a very important part of this larger problem with the requisite focus on climate and the solution
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 31.06 32.69 <o,f2,male> is to the biggest culprit
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 33.17 44.14 <o,f2,male> in this massive mistreatment of the earth by humankind and the resulting decline of the biosphere that culprit is business and industry
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 66.00 73.68 <o,f2,male> for the business and institution markets and shepherding it through start up and survival to prosperity and global dominance
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 81.58 92.51 <o,f2,male> in his book paul charges business and industry as one the major culprit in causing the decline of the biosphere and two the only institution that is large enough
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 92.74 98.37 <o,f2,male> and pervasive enough and powerful enough to really lead humankind out of this mess
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 99.16 108.99 <o,f2,male> and by the way he convicted me as a plunderer of the earth and i then challenged the people of interface my company to lead our company and the entire industrial world
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 115.19 123.87 <o,f2,male> in such a way as to take from the earth only what can be renewed by the earth naturally and rapidly not another fresh drop of oil
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 124.29 126.77 <o,f2,male> to do no harm to the biosphere
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 127.48 129.53 <o,f2,male> take nothing do no harm
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 129.96 138.12 <o,f2,male> i simply said if hawkins is right and business and industry must lead who will lead business and industry unless somebody leads nobody will
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 138.68 146.40 <o,f2,male> it's axiomatic why not us and thanks to the people of interface i have become a recovering plunderer
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 153.26 155.66 <o,f2,male> i once told a fortune magazine writer
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 156.51 164.74 <o,f2,male> that someday people like me would go to jail and that became the headline of a fortune article they went on to describe me as america 's greenest
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 176.87 184.53 <o,f2,male> ninety nine asked later in the canadian documentary the corporation what i meant by the go to jail remark
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 195.18 203.55 <o,f2,male> for theft of our children 's future to be a crime there must be a clear demonstrable alternative to the take make waste
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 213.16 219.93 <o,f2,male> and converting it to products that quickly become waste in a landfill or an incinerator in short digging up the earth
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 220.33 222.29 <o,f2,male> and converting it to pollution
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 223.51 230.59 <o,f2,male> according to paul and anne ehrlich and a well known environmental impact equation impact a bad thing
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 230.85 242.93 <o,f2,male> is the product of population affluence and technology that is impact is generated by people what they consume in their affluence and how it is produced
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 243.53 255.33 <o,f2,male> and though the equation is largely subjective you can perhaps quantify people and perhaps quantify affluence but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify so the equation is conceptual
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 255.84 258.41 <o,f2,male> still it works to help us understand the problem
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 263.17 271.33 <o,f2,male> to create an example to transform the way we made carpet a petroleum intensive product for materials as well as energy
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 271.70 278.90 <o,f2,male> and to transform our technologies so they diminished environmental impact rather than multiplied it
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 279.67 293.78 <o,f2,male> paul and anne ehrlich 's environmental impact equation i is equal to p times a times t population affluence and technology i wanted interface to rewrite that equation so that it read
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 294.42 303.95 <o,f2,male> i equals p times a divided by t now the mathematically minded will see immediately that t in the numerator increases impact a bad thing but
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 304.18 311.14 <o,f2,male> t in the denominator decreases impact so i ask what would move t technology
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 311.73 324.16 <o,f2,male> from the numerator call it t one where it increases impact to the denominator call it t two where it reduces impact i thought about the characteristics of
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 325.64 332.65 <o,f2,male> first industrial revolution t one as we practiced it at interface and it had the following characteristics
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 336.13 338.08 <o,f2,male> taking raw materials from the earth
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 338.92 351.59 <o,f2,male> linear take make waste powered by fossil fuel derived energy wasteful abusive and focused on labor productivity more carpet per man hour thinking it through
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 351.93 357.14 <o,f2,male> i realized that all those attributes must be changed to move t to the denominator
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 358.43 369.07 <o,f2,male> in the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable linear by cyclical fossil fuel energy by renewable energy sunlight
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 369.83 379.56 <o,f2,male> wasteful by waste free and abusive by benign and labor productivity by resource productivity and i reasoned that if we could make
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 380.32 388.88 <o,f2,male> those transformative changes and get rid of t one altogether we could reduce our impact to zero including our impact on the climate
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 399.61 409.21 <o,f2,male> so i can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing twelve years net greenhouse gas emissions down eighty two percent in absolute tonnage
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 414.20 427.78 <o,f2,male> over the same span of time sales have increased by two thirds and profits have doubled so an eighty two percent absolute reduction translates into a ninety percent reduction in greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 428.30 440.67 <o,f2,male> this is the magnitude of the reduction the entire global technosphere must realize by two thousand and fifty to avoid catastrophic climate disruption so the scientists are telling us
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 441.51 453.60 <o,f2,male> fossil fuel usage is down sixty percent per unit of production due to efficiencies in renewables the cheapest most secure barrel of oil there is is the one not used through efficiencies
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 476.01 485.37 <o,f2,male> going for one hundred percent we have diverted one hundred and forty eight million pounds that's seventy four thousand tons of used carpet from landfills
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 485.91 496.07 <o,f2,male> closing the loop on material flows through reverse logistics and post consumer recycling technologies that did not exist when we started fourteen years ago
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 496.66 505.70 <o,f2,male> those new cyclical technologies have contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold eighty five million square yards of climate neutral carpet
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 506.11 515.78 <o,f2,male> since two thousand and four meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain from mine and well head
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 516.22 530.11 <o,f2,male> clear to end of life reclamation independent third party certified we call it cool carpet and it has been a powerful marketplace differentiator increasing sales and profits three years ago
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 530.89 534.41 <o,f2,male> we launched carpet tile for the home
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 537.41 545.28 <o,f2,male> you can point and click today at flor com and have cool carpet delivered to your front door in five days it is practical and pretty
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 553.72 559.89 <o,f2,male> reckon that we are a bit over halfway to our goal zero impact zero footprint
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 568.16 581.55 <o,f2,male> we call this mission zero and this is perhaps the most important facet we have found mission zero to be incredibly good for business a better business model a better way to bigger
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 583.10 595.02 <o,f2,male> is the business case for sustainability from real life experience costs are down not up reflecting some four hundred million dollars of avoided costs in pursuit of zero waste
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 595.28 601.92 <o,f2,male> the first face of mount sustainability this has paid all the costs for the transformation of interface
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 602.91 606.73 <o,f2,male> and this dispels a myth too this false choice between the environment
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 607.09 616.02 <o,f2,male> and the economy our products are the best they've ever been inspired by design for sustainability an unexpected wellspring of innovation
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 616.41 623.83 <o,f2,male> our people are galvanized around this shared higher purpose you can not beat it for attracting the best people and bringing them together
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 624.27 636.65 <o,f2,male> and the goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing no amount of advertising no clever marketing campaign at any price could have produced or created this much goodwill
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 637.49 646.47 <o,f2,male> costs products people marketplaces what else is there it is a better business model and here is our fourteen year record of sales
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 646.83 648.11 <o,f2,male> and profits
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 648.33 658.33 <o,f2,male> there is a dip there from two thousand and one to two thousand and three a dip when our sales over a three year period were down seventeen percent but the marketplace was down thirty six percent
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 658.72 665.80 <o,f2,male> we literally gained market share we might not have survived that recession but for the advantages of sustainability
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 666.40 677.86 <o,f2,male> if every business were pursuing interface plans would that solve all our problems i don't think so i remain troubled by the revised ehrlich equation
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 678.04 686.96 <o,f2,male> i equals p times a divided by t two that a is a capital a suggesting that affluence is an end in itself
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 688.38 699.00 <o,f2,male> but what if we reframed ehrlich further and what if we made a a lowercase a suggesting that it is a means to an end and that end
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 699.18 705.46 <o,f2,male> is happiness more happiness with less stuff you know
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 715.08 723.15 <o,f2,male> and our whole system of economics if not for our species then perhaps for the one that succeeds us
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 723.38 729.58 <o,f2,male> the sustainable species living on a finite earth ethically happily and ecologically
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 729.94 739.02 <o,f2,male> in balance with nature and all her natural systems for a thousand generations or ten thousand generations that is to say into the indefinite future
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 739.86 747.24 <o,f2,male> but does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species well maybe so but i don't think so
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 757.00 767.82 <o,f2,male> we can see our way now clear to the top of that mountain and now the challenge is in execution and as my good friend and adviser amory lovins says if something exists
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 768.49 769.71 <o,f2,male> it must be possible
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 773.18 784.14 <o,f2,male> if we can actually do it it must be possible if we a petro intensive company can do it anybody can and if anybody can it follows that everybody can
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 784.65 795.70 <o,f2,male> hawking fulfilled business and industry leading humankind away from the abyss because with continued unchecked decline
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 795.91 804.91 <o,f2,male> of the biosphere a very dear person is at risk here frankly an unacceptable risk who is that person not you not
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 805.20 812.80 <o,f2,male> but let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here and i myself met this person in the early days of this mountain climb on a
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 824.29 833.58 <o,f2,male> about five days later back in atlanta i received an email from glenn thomas one of my people in the california meeting he was sending me an original poem
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 833.87 840.66 <o,f2,male> that he had composed after our tuesday morning together and when i read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 841.15 851.19 <o,f2,male> because it told me by god one person got it here is what glenn wrote and here is that person most at risk please meet tomorrow 's child
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 852.35 862.02 <o,f2,male> without a name an unseen face and knowing not your time or place tomorrow 's child though yet unborn i met you first last tuesday morn
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 862.78 870.99 <o,f2,male> a wise friend introduced us two and through his sobering point of view i saw a day that you would see a day for you but not for me
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 871.64 880.22 <o,f2,male> knowing you has changed my thinking for i never had an inkling that perhaps the things i do might someday somehow threaten you
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 881.41 889.16 <o,f2,male> tomorrow 's child my daughter son i'm afraid i've just begun to think of you and of your good though always having known i should
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 889.93 898.94 <o,f2,male> begin i will the way the cost of what i squander what is lost if ever i forget that you will someday come and live
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 901.13 912.74 <o,f2,male> well every day of my life since tomorrow 's child has spoken to me with one simple but profound message which i presume to share with you we are each and every one a part of the web of life
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 913.33 924.42 <o,f2,male> the continuum of humanity sure but in a larger sense the web of life itself and we have a choice to make during our brief brief visit to this beautiful blue and green living
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 924.71 926.53 <o,f2,male> planet to hurt it
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 927.43 931.28 <o,f2,male> to help it for you it's your call
RayAnderson_2009 1 RayAnderson_2009 932.09 933.20 <o,f2,male> thank you
