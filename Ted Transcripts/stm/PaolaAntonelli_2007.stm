PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 16.01 23.37 <o,f0,female> us who believe in heaven have some sort of idea of what heaven would be and in my idea heaven is satisfied curiosity
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 23.68 32.78 <o,f0,female> i think of heaven as a really comfortable cloud where i can just lie down with my belly down like i was watching tv when i was a child and my elbows up and i can basically
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 33.17 48.28 <o,f0,female> look everywhere i want see every movie i've always wanted to see and in the same kind of trance that you can feel sometimes in the subway new york when you're reading there's something really soothing and easy well the funny thing is that i already have that kind of life in a way
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 49.10 59.66 <o,f0,female> because i discovered it took me a while to understand it but when i discovered around twenty four years of age that i was much more comfortable with objects than with people i finally
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 70.57 82.29 <o,f0,female> just to give you an example this is the exhibition humble masterpieces as it was at moma in two thousand and four we were in queens we were building the big big big big building in midtown so we were in the small small small
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 89.01 97.24 <o,f0,female> the typeface is helvetica it's its fiftieth anniversary this year and so i start thinking max miedinger and all those swiss designers together trying to
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 97.86 109.03 <o,f0,female> outdo akzidenz grotesk and come up with a new sans serif typeface and the movie starts playing in my head already and of course you can imagine with humble masterpieces it was the same thing
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 109.78 119.21 <o,f0,female> multiplied by a hundred and i do hope by the way that the real goal of the exhibition is going to have the same effect on you the exhibition was meant to be a way to
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 120.14 134.34 <o,f0,female> have children think of doing you know when they do homeworks at home instead of having a tray with two peas i was hoping that they would go into the kitchen cabinet or the mother 's handbag and do their museum quality design collection on a tray so
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 145.30 158.40 <o,f0,female> eighty percent porn and twenty percent real suggestions and instead it was all almost all good suggestions and a lot of nationalism came in for instance i didn't know that the spaniards invented the mop
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 158.50 169.57 <o,f0,female> but they were very proud so every spaniard said la frego and italians did the pizza and i wanted to show you also the suggestions from kentucky are pretty good they had moonshine laundry detergents and liquid nails
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 170.00 182.22 <o,f0,female> and i keep it going and i just got also this suggestion from milan it's our traffic divider which we call panettone and it's painted you know it's these beautiful concrete things that you
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 182.60 190.65 <o,f0,female> use around milan to define all the lanes of traffic so think of your own send them on if you want to they're always welcome
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 199.49 209.13 <o,f0,female> italian in italy design is normal you know different parts of the world have a knack for different things i was just recently in argentina and in
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 210.04 219.31 <o,f0,female> and the default way of building homes in the country is a beautiful modernism that you don't see elsewhere but the contemporary art was terrible
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 219.76 231.19 <o,f0,female> in italy in milan especially contemporary art really doesn't have that much of a place but design oh my god what you find at the store at the corner without going to any kind of fancy store
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 231.51 238.01 <o,f0,female> is the kind of refined design that makes everybody think that we are all so sophisticated it's just what you find at the store
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 238.58 246.12 <o,f0,female> and new york has another kind of knack for contemporary art i'm always amazed three year olds know who
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 246.99 259.63 <o,f0,female> richard serra is and take you to the galleries but design for some reason is still misunderstood for decoration it's really interesting what many people think when i say the word design is they think
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 260.13 273.45 <o,f0,female> this kind of overdesigned in this case it's overdesigned on purpose but decoration interior decoration they think of somebody choosing fabrics design can be that of course but it can also be this it can be
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 273.70 284.33 <o,f0,female> a school of design in jerusalem that tries to find a better way to design gas masks for people because as you know israel deploys one gas mask per person including babies
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 284.63 298.11 <o,f0,female> so what these designers do is they find a way to lower the neckline so that instead of being completely strangled a teenager can also sip a coke they tried to make a toddler 's
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 300.30 308.32 <o,f0,female> in such a way that the toddler can be held by the parent because proximity of the body is so important and then they make a little tent for the baby
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 308.80 322.46 <o,f0,female> however cruel however ruthless you can think this is it's a great design and it is miles away from the fancy furniture but still it's part of my same field of passion and what i've been doing at moma
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 323.18 335.53 <o,f0,female> since the beginning is to try to harness the power of moma because it's great to work there you really have power in that people usually tend to know about your exhibition or see the exhibitions
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 335.95 348.80 <o,f0,female> and that is power because in a design museum i wouldn't have as many visitors i'm very well aware that eighty percent of my public is there to see picasso and matisse and then they stumble upon my show and i keep them there
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 375.29 383.81 <o,f0,female> perplexed about the relation exactly but charles eames the first time and then charles and ray eames the second time were involved in two competitions
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 393.27 399.22 <o,f0,female> that then sparked a whole line of furniture and then there was good design for
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 399.52 409.25 <o,f0,female> very low price there were a lot of programs in architecture and design that were about pointing people in the direction of a better design for a better life
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 410.14 418.43 <o,f0,female> so i started out in ninety five with this exhibition that was called mutant materials in contemporary design it was about a new phase in my opinion
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 419.23 425.27 <o,f0,female> world of design in that materials could be customized by the designers themselves and that
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 426.09 437.05 <o,f0,female> put me in touch with such diverse design examples as the aerogels from the lawrence livermore lab in california at that time they were beginning to be
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 437.57 447.24 <o,f0,female> brought into the civilian market and at the same time the gorgeous work of takeshi ishiguro who did these beautiful salt and pepper containers that are made of rice dough
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 447.68 458.47 <o,f0,female> so you see it goes the range is really quite diverse and then for instance this other exhibition that was entitled workspheres in two thousand and one where i
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 467.15 474.83 <o,f0,female> and you see ideo there it was beautiful it was called personal skies the idea was that if you had a cubicle you could project a sky
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 475.35 481.17 <o,f0,female> on top of your head and have your own cielo in una stanza a sky in a room it's a very famous italian song
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 481.68 489.33 <o,f0,female> and other examples this was marti guixe about working on the go and hella jongerius my favorite about how to work at home
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 489.85 494.24 <o,f0,female> this lets me introduce a very important idea about design designers
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 494.94 500.85 <o,f0,female> the biggest synthesizers in the world what they do best is make a synthesis of human needs
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 501.43 512.51 <o,f0,female> current conditions in economy in materials in sustainability issues and then what they do at the end if they are good is much more than the sum of its parts and
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 513.19 522.80 <o,f0,female> is a person that is able to make a synthesis that is really quite amazing and also quite hilarious the idea behind her work was that you know at that time
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 534.23 539.69 <o,f0,female> there's been many other exhibitions in the meantime but i don't want to focus on my shows i would like instead to talk about
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 540.09 551.16 <o,f0,female> how great some designers are i've always had a hard time with the word maverick you know i came to the united states thirteen years ago and to this day i have to ask you know what does that mean so this morning i went to see on the dictionary
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 551.52 560.09 <o,f0,female> and it said that there was this gentleman that was not branding its cattle therefore he was not following everybody 's lead and therefore he was a maverick so
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 560.77 567.85 <o,f0,female> know designers do need to be mavericks because the best way to design a successful object and also an object that
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 568.52 579.72 <o,f0,female> we were missing before is to pretend that either it never existed or that people will be able to have a new behavior with it so safe is the last exhibition
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 580.11 594.54 <o,f0,female> that i did at moma and it ended at the beginning of last year and it was about design that deals with safety and deals with protection it's a long story because it started before two thousand and one and it was called emergency and then when nine eleven happened i
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 601.54 614.08 <o,f0,female> a half full glass instead of half empty and it was about protection and safety but it ranged from such items as a complete de mining equipment to these kind of
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 626.99 640.97 <o,f0,female> but what is interesting is that we don't need to talk about design and art anymore but design uses whatever tools it has at its disposal in order to make a point it's a sense of economy and a sense also of humor this is a beautiful
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 653.50 664.25 <o,f0,female> it has a loudspeaker over your heart so your heartbeat is amplified and the police is reminded it's like having a flower in front of the rifle and also you can imagine a whole
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 664.52 677.30 <o,f0,female> group of people with the same suit will have this mounting collective heartbeat that will be scary to the police you know so designers sometimes don't do things that are immediately functional but they're functional to our understanding of issues
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 677.85 691.84 <o,f0,female> dunne and raby tony dunne and fiona raby did this series of objects that are about our anguish and our paranoia like this hideaway furniture that's made in the same wood as your floor so it disappears completely and you can hide away
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 692.25 701.29 <o,f0,female> or even better the huggable atomic mushroom which got me an article on the bulletin of atomic scientists of the united states i don't think it ever happened before at moma
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 701.79 713.39 <o,f0,female> this faraday chair that is supposed to protect you from radiations but the interesting thing in the exhibition is that the discovery was that the ultimate shelter is your sense of self
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 734.61 741.17 <o,f0,female> sometimes by doing this kind of research you encounter such beautiful ideas of design twan verdonck is really
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 741.75 752.26 <o,f0,female> i think he 's twenty seven and working together with some psychologist he did a series of toys that are for sensorial stimulation for children that have psychological impairments they're quite beautiful
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 752.64 766.63 <o,f0,female> they range from this fluffy toy that is about hugging you because autistic children like to be hugged tight so it has a spring inside all the way to this doll with a mirror so the child can see him or herself in the mirror and regain a sense of self
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 782.80 797.84 <o,f0,female> and before me there were people that were really talking about luxury and i didn't want to be a party pooper but at the same time i felt that i had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality and the truth is that there's very different kinds of luxury and
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 801.91 808.89 <o,f0,female> that much and i want to make this point by showing to you two examples of design coming from
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 809.36 816.13 <o,f0,female> sense of economy very very clear limits this is cuba and this is the recycling of a squeaky toy
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 816.97 826.57 <o,f0,female> a bicycle bell and this is instead a raincoat that is made out of rice sacks so they're quite beautiful but they're beautiful because they're so smart
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 833.66 846.83 <o,f0,female> got inspired by the poverty and smartness that they saw around them to do pieces of furniture that now are selling for an enormous amount of money but that's because of the kind of strangeness of the market itself
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 847.35 854.92 <o,f0,female> so really design takes everything into account and the interesting thing is that as the technology advances as
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 855.55 865.91 <o,f0,female> we become more and more wireless and impalpable designers instead want us to be hands on sometimes hammer on you see this is a whole series of furniture that wants to engage you physically
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 866.35 874.45 <o,f0,female> and even this chair that you have to open up and then sit on so that it takes your imprint all the way to this beautiful series
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 875.17 883.01 <o,f0,female> objects that are considered design by ana mir in barcelona from this kind of bijou made with human hair to these chocolate nipples
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 883.28 891.24 <o,f0,female> to these intra toe candies that your lover is supposed to suck from your toes it's quite beautiful because somehow
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 891.83 897.61 <o,f0,female> this is a gorgeous moment for design many years ago i heard a mathematician from vienna
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 898.82 906.99 <o,f0,female> whose name was marchetti explain how the innovation in the military industry therefore a secret innovation
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 907.37 921.78 <o,f0,female> and the innovation in the civilian society are two sinosoids that are kind of opposed and that makes sense in moments of war there's great technological innovation and instead in the world you have to do without well during the second world war you had to do without steel you had to do without aluminum
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 922.17 930.10 <o,f0,female> and then as peace comes all of these technologies get all of a sudden available for the civilian market many of you might know that
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 930.46 939.29 <o,f0,female> the potato chip chair by charles and ray eames comes exactly from that kind of instance fiberglass was available for civilian use all of a sudden
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 939.73 953.81 <o,f0,female> i think that this is a strange moment the rhythm of the sinosoids has changed tremendously just like the rhythm of our life in the past twenty five years so i'm not sure anymore what the wavelength is but it surely is a very important moment for design
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 954.40 962.93 <o,f0,female> because not only is the technology proceeding not only is computing technology making open source possible also in the world of design
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 963.35 972.80 <o,f0,female> but also the idea of sustainability which is not only sustainability from the viewpoint of co two emissions and footprint but also sustainability
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 973.03 984.66 <o,f0,female> of human interrelationships is very much part of the work of so many designers and that's why designers more and more are working on behaviors rather than on objects especially the good ones not all of them
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 985.16 994.84 <o,f0,female> i wanted to show you for instance the work of mathieu lehanneur which is quite fantastic he 's another young designer from france who 's working and at this point he 's working also with pharmaceutical companies
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 995.29 1004.86 <o,f0,female> new ways to engage patients especially children in taking their medicines with constance and with certainty you know for instance this is a beautiful
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 1013.59 1024.23 <o,f0,female> the container itself and instead this other medicine is something that you can draw on your skin so intradermal delivery enables you to joyfully be involved in this particular kind
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 1034.38 1042.11 <o,f0,female> making everything pass through your mouth so that you learn from your mistakes or from your taste orally
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 1043.11 1045.83 <o,f0,female> the next show that i'm going to work on and i've been
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 1046.25 1056.03 <o,f0,female> a lot of you about this here is about the relationship between design and science i'm trying to find not the metaphors but rather the points in common the common gripes the common
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 1056.78 1065.08 <o,f0,female> issues the common preoccupations and i think that it will enable us to go a little further in this idea of design as
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 1066.11 1072.38 <o,f0,female> an instruction as a direction rather than a prescription of form and i am hoping that many of you
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 1072.48 1082.72 <o,f0,female> will respond to this i've sent an email already to quite a few of you but design and science and the possibility of visualizing different scales and therefore really work
PaolaAntonelli_2007 1 PaolaAntonelli_2007 1083.27 1087.87 <o,f0,female> the scale of the very small to make it very big and very meaningful thank you
