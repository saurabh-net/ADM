BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 17.25 28.45 <o,f0,male> i was four years old and my family moved to a new neighborhood in our hometown of savannah georgia and this was the nineteen sixties when actually all the streets in this neighborhood were named after confederate war generals
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 29.36 35.88 <o,f0,male> we lived on robert e lee blvd and when i was five my parents gave me an orange schwinn stingray bicycle
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 36.59 41.71 <o,f0,male> it had a swooping banana seat and those ape hanger handlebars that made the rider look like an
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 64.53 66.41 <o,f0,male> i was hit by a passing sedan
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 67.13 70.83 <o,f0,male> my mangled body flew in one direction my mangled bike flew in the other
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 81.65 84.01 <o,f0,male> bruce i said and promptly passed out
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 85.07 99.02 <o,f0,male> i broke my left femur that day it's the largest bone in your body and spent the next two months in a body cast that went from my chin to the tip of my toe to my right knee and a steel bar went from my right knee to my left ankle
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 111.54 121.08 <o,f0,male> wrote a series of books about my travels including walking the bible i hosted a television show by that name on pbs i was for all the world the walking guy
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 122.16 134.58 <o,f0,male> until in may two thousand and eight a routine visit to my doctor and a routine blood test produced evidence in the form of an alkaline phosphatase number that something might be wrong with my bones
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 135.43 141.69 <o,f0,male> and my doctor on a whim sent me to get a full body bone scan which showed that there was some growth in my left leg
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 141.84 147.72 <o,f0,male> that sent me to an x ray then to an mri and one afternoon i got a call from my doctor
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 148.36 156.42 <o,f0,male> the tumor in your leg is not consistent with a benign tumor i stopped walking and it took my mind a second to convert that
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 165.20 171.93 <o,f0,male> in the same place in my body as the accident thirty eight years earlier it seemed like too much of a coincidence
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 172.77 186.24 <o,f0,male> so that afternoon i went back to my house and my three year old identical twin daughters eden and tybee feiler came running to meet me they'd just turned three and they were into all things pink and purple in fact we called them pinkalicious and purplicious
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 187.07 195.17 <o,f0,male> although i must say our favorite nickname occurred on their birthday april fifteenth when they were born at six fourteen and six forty six on april fifteen
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 234.34 235.79 <o,f0,male> aisles i might not walk down
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 237.26 242.68 <o,f0,male> they wonder who i was i thought would they yearn for my approval my love my voice
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 244.33 251.14 <o,f0,male> few days later i woke with an idea of how i might give them that voice i would reach out to six men from all parts of my life
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 251.65 255.27 <o,f0,male> and ask them to be present in the passages of my daughters lives
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 256.42 262.50 <o,f0,male> i believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives i wrote these men they 'll have loving families and welcoming homes
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 263.07 265.79 <o,f0,male> but they may not have me they may not have their dad
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 266.67 268.15 <o,f0,male> will you help be their dad
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 285.15 296.46 <o,f0,male> in this culture i don't have to tell you that you sort of happy your way through a problem we should focus on the positive my wife as i said she grew up outside of boston she's got a big smile she's got a big personality she's got big hair
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 297.03 307.09 <o,f0,male> although she told me recently i can't say she has big hair because if i say she has big hair people will think she's from texas and it's apparently okay to marry a boy from georgia but not to have hair from texas
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 323.53 334.67 <o,f0,male> i said look in georgia at least we want to know in arkansas they don't even ask what i didn't tell her is if she said yes you could jump you don't need the thirty day waiting period because you don't need the get to know you session at that point
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 335.43 344.77 <o,f0,male> so i wasn't going to tell her about this idea but the next day i couldn't control myself i told her and she loved the idea but she quickly started rejecting my nominees
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 346.52 354.46 <o,f0,male> well i love him but i would never ask him for advice so it turned out that starting a council of dads was a very efficient way to find out what my wife really thought of my friends
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 356.48 364.72 <o,f0,male> so we decided that we needed a set of rules and we came up with a number and the first one was no family only friends we thought our family would already be there
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 365.20 375.55 <o,f0,male> second men only we were trying to fill the dad space in the girls lives and then third sort of a dad for every side we kind of went through my personality and tried to get a dad who represented each different thing
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 375.98 387.67 <o,f0,male> so what happened was i wrote a letter to each of these men and rather than send it i decided to read it to them in person linda my wife joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals i sort of friend married each of these guys
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 397.13 407.78 <o,f0,male> we were in this youth hostel in a castle and i snuck out behind and there was a moat a fence and a field of cows and jeff came up beside me and said so have you ever been cow tipping
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 417.36 426.21 <o,f0,male> so before i had a chance to determine whether this was right or not we had jumped the moat we climbed the fence we were tiptoeing through the dung and approaching some poor dozing cow
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 427.86 430.57 <o,f0,male> so a few weeks after my diagnosis we went up
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 455.07 464.63 <o,f0,male> and then i asked him a question which i ended up asking to all the dads and ended up really encouraging me to write this story down in a book and that was what 's the one piece of advice you would give to my girls
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 465.24 468.58 <o,f0,male> and jeff 's advice was be a traveller not a tourist
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 469.15 472.71 <o,f0,male> get off the bus seek out what's different approach the cow
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 473.64 479.94 <o,f0,male> so it's ten years from now i said and my daughters are about to take their first trip abroad and i'm not here what would you tell them
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 495.85 507.07 <o,f0,male> as he talked he had that glint in his eye that i first saw back in holland the glint that says let 's go cow tipping even though we never did tip the cow even though no one tips the cow
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 507.29 510.08 <o,f0,male> even though cows don't sleep standing up
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 511.20 515.22 <o,f0,male> he said i want to see you back here girls at the end of this experience covered in
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 518.57 529.52 <o,f0,male> two weeks after my diagnosis a biopsy confirmed i had a seven inch osteosarcoma in my left femur six hundred americans a year get an osteosarcoma eighty five percent are under twenty one
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 533.86 539.58 <o,f0,male> twenty years ago doctors would have cut off my leg and hoped and there was a fifteen percent survival rate
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 549.24 562.92 <o,f0,male> room i went through four and a half months of chemo actually i had cisplatin doxorubicin and very high dose methotrexate and then i had a fifteen hour surgery in which my surgeon doctor john healey at memorial sloan kettering hospital in new york
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 563.36 573.76 <o,f0,male> took out my left femur and replaced it with titanium and if you did see the sanjay special you saw these enormous screws that they screwed into my pelvis
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 574.18 583.37 <o,f0,male> then he took my fibula from my calf cut it out and then relocated it to my thigh where it now lives and what he actually did was he de vascularized it
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 595.37 598.62 <o,f0,male> this is a surgery so rare only two human beings have survived
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 600.53 608.23 <o,f0,male> and my reward for surviving it was to go back for four more months of chemo it was as we said in my house a lost year
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 618.96 627.05 <o,f0,male> and i remember a particular one night that when you told that story of i don't know where you are doctor nuland of william sloane coffin it made me think of it
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 627.37 637.08 <o,f0,male> i was in the hospital after i think it was my fourth round of chemo when my numbers went to zero and i had basically no immune system and they put me in an infectious disease ward at the hospital
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 637.35 647.76 <o,f0,male> and anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask and cover all of the extraneous parts of their body and one night i got a call from my mother in law that my daughters at that time three and a half
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 649.66 652.24 <o,f0,male> absence and i hung up the phone
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 652.80 657.66 <o,f0,male> and i put my face in my hands and i screamed this silent scream
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 658.67 668.10 <o,f0,male> and what you said doctor nuland i don't know where you are made me think of this today because the thought that came to my mind was that feeling that i had was like a primal scream
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 668.83 678.29 <o,f0,male> and what was so striking and one of the messages i want to leave you here with today is the experience as i became less and less human
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 687.38 694.70 <o,f0,male> at that moment i was less and less human i was also at the same time maybe the most human i've ever been
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 695.26 703.50 <o,f0,male> and what was so striking about that time was instead of repulsing people i was actually proving to be a magnet for people people were incredibly drawn
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 704.19 713.72 <o,f0,male> my wife and i had kids we thought it would be all hands on deck instead it was everybody running the other way and when i had cancer we thought it 'd be everybody running the other way instead it was all hands on deck
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 714.08 723.44 <o,f0,male> and when people came to me rather than being incredibly turned off by what they saw i was like a living ghost they were incredibly moved to talk about what was going on in their own lives
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 727.38 736.38 <o,f0,male> it is an invitation maybe even a mandate to enter the most vital arenas of human life the most sensitive and the most frightening the ones that we never want to go to
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 736.66 747.42 <o,f0,male> but when we do go there we feel incredibly transformed when we do and this also happened to my girls as they began to see and we thought maybe became an ounce more compassionate
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 782.28 791.18 <o,f0,male> one of the profound things that happened was this act of actually connecting to all these people and it made me think and i'll just note for the record one word that i've only heard once actually was when we were all doing
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 791.52 797.36 <o,f0,male> tony robbins yoga yesterday the one word that has not been mentioned in this seminar actually is the word friend
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 828.47 835.62 <o,f0,male> and no one captures this modern manhood to me more than david black now david is my literary agent he 's about five foot three and a half
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 835.78 845.71 <o,f0,male> on a good day standing fully upright in cowboy boots and on kind of the manly male front he answers the phone i can say this i guess because you've done it here he answers the phone yo motherfucker
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 846.81 854.76 <o,f0,male> he gives boring speeches about obscure bottles of wine and on his fiftieth birthday he bought a convertible sports car although like a lot of men he 's impatient he bought it on his forty
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 855.90 865.96 <o,f0,male> but like a lot of modern men he hugs he bakes he leaves work early to coach little league someone asked me if he cried when i asked him to be in the council of dads i was like david cries when you invite him to take a walk
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 887.40 900.15 <o,f0,male> he said i don't see the wall and i'm telling you the same don't see the wall you may encounter one from time to time but you've got to find a way to get over it around it or through it but whatever you do don't succumb to it don't give in to the wall
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 902.70 909.60 <o,f0,male> my home is not far from the brooklyn bridge and during the year and a half i was on crutches it became a sort of symbol to me
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 910.24 920.85 <o,f0,male> so one day near the end of my journey i said come on girls let 's take a walk across the brooklyn bridge we set out on crutches i was on crutches my wife was next to me my girls were doing these rockstar poses up ahead
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 922.58 928.42 <o,f0,male> because walking was one of the first things i lost i spent most of that year thinking about this most elemental of human acts
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 939.43 947.88 <o,f0,male> as my physical therapist likes to say every step is a tragedy waiting to happen you nearly fall with one leg then you catch yourself with the other
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 948.74 953.94 <o,f0,male> and the biggest consequence of walking on crutches as i did for a year and a half is that you walk slower
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 955.10 958.59 <o,f0,male> you hurry you get where you're going but you get there alone
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 959.47 964.47 <o,f0,male> you go slow you get where you're going but you get there with this community you built along the way
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 965.66 969.55 <o,f0,male> at the risk of admission i was never nicer than the year i was on crutches
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 970.55 977.71 <o,f0,male> two hundred years ago a new type of pedestrian appeared in paris he was called a flaneur one who wanders the arcades
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 978.41 987.01 <o,f0,male> and it was the custom of those flaneurs to show they were men of leisure by taking turtles for walks and letting the reptile set the pace
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 987.99 996.47 <o,f0,male> and i just love this ode to slow moving and it's become my own motto for my girls take a walk with a turtle behold the world in
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 1012.82 1022.07 <o,f0,male> and every seven sets of seven years the land gets an extra year of rest during which time all families are reunited and people surrounded with the ones they love
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 1023.68 1027.37 <o,f0,male> year is called the jubilee year and it's the origin of that term
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 1028.39 1033.74 <o,f0,male> and though i'm shy of fifty it captures my own experience my lost year was my jubilee year
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 1034.49 1041.32 <o,f0,male> by laying fallow i planted the seeds for a healthier future and was reunited with the ones i love
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 1042.44 1048.02 <o,f0,male> the one year anniversary of my journey i went to see my surgeon doctor john healey and by the way healey great name for a doctor
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 1049.62 1054.79 <o,f0,male> he 's the president of the international society of limb salvage which is the least euphemistic term i've ever heard
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 1056.16 1059.35 <o,f0,male> and i said doctor healey if my daughters come to you one day and say what should i
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 1063.07 1067.63 <o,f0,male> i would tell them what i know and that is everybody dies
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 1069.23 1070.57 <o,f0,male> but not everybody lives
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 1089.46 1096.75 <o,f0,male> as i looked at this list to me it was sort of like a psalm book of living i realized we may have done it for our girls but it really changed us
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 1097.71 1105.81 <o,f0,male> and that is the secret of the council of dads is that my wife and i did this in an attempt to help our daughters but it really changed us
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 1106.98 1108.36 <o,f0,male> so i stand here today
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 1108.95 1110.83 <o,f0,male> as you see now walking without crutches or
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 1112.89 1114.79 <o,f0,male> and last week i had my eighteen month scans
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 1122.31 1125.06 <o,f0,male> say can never find a solution for scan xiety
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 1126.02 1129.51 <o,f0,male> as i was going there i was wondering what would i say depending on what happened here
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 1152.05 1163.56 <o,f0,male> heard about our story and very quickly in a span of three weeks put the full resources of twenty three andme and we announced an initiative in july to get to decode the genome of
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 1164.44 1174.67 <o,f0,male> anybody a living person with a heart tissue bone sarcoma and she told me last night in the three months since we've done it we've gotten three hundred people who 've contributed to this program
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 1175.15 1186.56 <o,f0,male> and the epidemiologists here will tell you that's half the number of people who get the disease in one year in the united states so if you go to twenty three andme or if you go to councilofdads com you can click on a link and we encourage anybody
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 1190.87 1193.21 <o,f0,male> been talking about by leaving you with this message
BruceFeiler_2010P 1 BruceFeiler_2010P 1212.05 1214.33 <o,f0,male> and take a long slow walk
