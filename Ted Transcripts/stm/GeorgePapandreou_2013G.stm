GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 20.9 25.99 <o,f0,male> the failure of leadership in global politics
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 25.99 32.14 <o,f0,male> and in our globalizing economy and i won 't provide
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 32.14 49.62 <o,f0,male> feel good ready made solutions but i will in the end urge you to rethink actually take risks and get involved in what i see as a global evolution of democracy
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 49.62 58.33 <o,f0,male> failure of leadership what is the failure of leadership today and why is our democracy not working
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 58.33 62.9 <o,f0,male> well i believe that the failure of leadership is the fact that we have taken
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 62.9 81.73 <o,f0,male> you out of the process so let me from my personal experiences give you an insight so that you can step back and maybe understand why it is so difficult to cope with the challenges of today and why politics is going down a blind alley
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 81.73 84.49 <o,f0,male> let 's start from the beginning
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 84.49 97.45 <o,f0,male> let 's start from democracy well if you go back to the ancient greeks it was a revelation a discovery that we had the potential together
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 97.45 107.29 <o,f0,male> to be masters of our own fate to be able to examine to learn to imagine and then to design a better life
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 107.29 112.78 <o,f0,male> and democracy was the political innovation
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 112.78 129.1 <o,f0,male> which protected this freedom because we were liberated from fear so that our minds in fact whether they be despots or dogmas could be the protagonists
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 129.1 138.68 <o,f0,male> democracy was the political innovation that allowed us to limit the power whether it was of tyrants or of high priests
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 138.68 143.29 <o,f0,male> their natural tendency to maximize power and wealth
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 143.29 161.73 <o,f0,male> well i first began to understand this when i was fourteen years old i used to to try to avoid homework sneak down to the living room and listen to my parents and their friends debate heatedly you see then greece was under control of a very powerful
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 179.36 188.54 <o,f0,male> you can see me here next to him i 'm the younger one there to the side you may not recognize me because i used to part my hair differently there
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 203.98 223.61 <o,f0,male> then one night military trucks drive up to our house soldiers storm the door they find me up on the top terrace a sergeant comes up to me with a machine gun puts it to my head and says tell me where your father is or i will kill you
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 223.61 241.91 <o,f0,male> my father hiding nearby reveals himself and was summarily taken to prison well we survived but democracy did not seven brutal years of dictatorship which we spent in exile
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 250.83 260.94 <o,f0,male> brussels april two thousand and ten i 'm sitting with my counterparts in the european union i had just been elected prime minister
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 260.94 279.16 <o,f0,male> but i had the unhappy privilege of revealing a truth that our deficit was not six percent as had been officially reported only a few days earlier before the elections by the previous government but actually fifteen point six percent
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 279.16 294.85 <o,f0,male> but the deficit was only the symptom of much deeper problems that greece was facing and i had been elected on a mandate a mission actually to tackle these problems whether it was lack of transparency and accountability in governance
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 300.01 306.59 <o,f0,male> the powerful tax avoidance abetted and aided by a global tax evasion system
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 306.59 310.63 <o,f0,male> politics and media captured by special interests
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 310.64 316.28 <o,f0,male> but despite our electoral mandate the markets mistrusted us
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 316.28 324.84 <o,f0,male> our borrowing costs were skyrocketing and we were facing possible default so i went to brussels on a mission
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 324.84 338.43 <o,f0,male> to make the case for a united european response one that would calm the markets and give us the time to make the necessary reforms but time we didn 't get
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 338.43 351.51 <o,f0,male> picture yourselves around the table in brussels negotiations are difficult the tensions are high progress is slow and then ten minutes to two a prime minister shouts out we have to finish in ten minutes
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 359.25 372.57 <o,f0,male> no we have to have an agreement now because in ten minutes the markets are opening up in japan and there will be havoc in the global economy
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 372.57 384.94 <o,f0,male> we quickly came to a decision in those ten minutes this time it was not the military but the markets that put a gun to our collective heads
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 384.94 389.49 <o,f0,male> what followed were the most difficult decisions in my life
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 389.49 399.66 <o,f0,male> painful to me painful to my countrymen imposing cuts austerity often on those not to blame for the crisis
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 399.66 412.29 <o,f0,male> with these sacrifices greece did avoid bankruptcy and the eurozone avoided a collapse greece yes triggered the euro crisis and some people blame me for pulling the trigger
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 412.29 425.26 <o,f0,male> but i think today that most would agree that greece was only a symptom of much deeper structural problems in the eurozone vulnerabilities in the wider global economic system
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 425.26 435.49 <o,f0,male> vulnerabilities of our democracies our democracies are trapped by systems too big to fail or more accurately too big to control
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 435.49 447.91 <o,f0,male> our democracies are weakened in the global economy with players that can evade laws evade taxes evade environmental or labor standards our democracies are undermined
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 447.91 456.19 <o,f0,male> by the growing inequality and the growing concentration of power and wealth lobbies corruption
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 456.19 473.86 <o,f0,male> the speed of the markets or simply the fact that we sometimes fear an impending disaster have constrained our democracies and they have constrained our capacity to imagine and actually use the potential your potential in finding solutions
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 473.86 490.7 <o,f0,male> greece you see was only a preview of what is in store for us all i overly optimistically had hoped that this crisis was an opportunity for greece for europe for the world to make radical democratic transformations in our institutions
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 490.7 494.59 <o,f0,male> instead i had a very humbling experience
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 494.59 513.93 <o,f0,male> in brussels when we tried desperately again and again to find common solutions i realized that not one not one of us had ever dealt with a similar crisis but worse we were trapped by our collective ignorance we were led
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 513.93 520.21 <o,f0,male> by our fears and our fears led to a blind faith
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 520.21 526.1 <o,f0,male> in the orthodoxy of austerity instead of reaching out to the
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 526.1 536.18 <o,f0,male> common or the collective wisdom in our societies investing in it to find more creative solutions we reverted to political posturing
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 536.18 549.69 <o,f0,male> and then we were surprised when every ad hoc new measure didn 't bring an end to the crisis and of course that made it very easy to look for a whipping boy for our collective european failure and of course
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 549.69 559.61 <o,f0,male> that was greece those profligate idle ouzo swilling zorba dancing greeks they are the problem punish them
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 559.61 567.51 <o,f0,male> well a convenient but unfounded stereotype that sometimes hurt even more than austerity itself
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 567.51 573.82 <o,f0,male> but let me warn you this is not just about greece this could be the pattern
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 573.82 586.48 <o,f0,male> that leaders follow again and again when we deal with these complex cross border problems whether it 's climate change whether it 's migration whether it 's the financial system
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 586.48 595.34 <o,f0,male> that is abandoning our collective power to imagine our potential falling victims to our fears our stereotypes our dogmas
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 595.34 601.82 <o,f0,male> taking our citizens out of the process rather than building the process around our citizens
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 601.82 613.37 <o,f0,male> and doing so will only test the faith of our citizens of our peoples even more in the democratic process it 's no wonder that many political leaders and i don 't exclude myself
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 613.37 622.53 <o,f0,male> have lost the trust of our people when riot police have to protect parliaments a scene which is
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 622.53 629.05 <o,f0,male> increasingly common around the world then there 's something deeply wrong with our democracies
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 629.05 645.52 <o,f0,male> that 's why i called for a referendum to have the greek people own and decide on the terms of the rescue package my european counterparts some of them at least said you can 't do this there will be havoc in the markets again
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 645.52 655.13 <o,f0,male> i said we need to before we restore confidence in the markets we need to restore confidence and trust amongst our people
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 655.13 663.94 <o,f0,male> since leaving office i have had time to reflect we have weathered the storm in greece and in europe
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 679.02 684.25 <o,f0,male> so far we 've thrown economics at the problem actually mostly austerity
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 684.25 691.29 <o,f0,male> and certainly we could have designed alternatives a different strategy a green stimulus for green jobs or
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 691.29 700.01 <o,f0,male> mutualized debt eurobonds which would support countries in need from market pressures these would have been much more viable alternatives
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 713.88 732.44 <o,f0,male> again the ancient greeks with all their shortcomings believed in the wisdom of the crowd at their best moments in people we trust democracy could not work without the citizens deliberating debating taking on public responsibilities for public affairs
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 732.44 736.4 <o,f0,male> average citizens often were chosen for citizen juries to
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 736.4 739.43 <o,f0,male> decide on critical matters of the day
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 739.43 757.2 <o,f0,male> science theater research philosophy games of the mind and the body they were daily exercises actually they were an education for participation for the potential for growing the potential of our citizens and those who shunned politics well they were
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 757.2 769.27 <o,f0,male> idiots you see in ancient greece in ancient athens that term originated there idiot comes from the root idio oneself
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 769.27 776.73 <o,f0,male> a person who is self centered secluded excluded someone who doesn 't participate or even examine public affairs
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 776.73 786.72 <o,f0,male> and participation took place in the agora the agora having two meanings both a marketplace and a place where there was political deliberation
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 786.72 798.84 <o,f0,male> you see markets and politics then were one unified accessible transparent because they gave power to the people they serve the demos democracy
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 798.84 816.33 <o,f0,male> above government above markets was the direct rule of the people today we have globalized the markets but we have not globalized our democratic institutions so our politicians are limited to local politics
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 816.33 824.37 <o,f0,male> while our citizens even though they see a great potential are prey to forces beyond their control
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 824.37 842.55 <o,f0,male> so how then do we reunite the two halves of the agora how do we democratize globalization and i 'm not talking about the necessary reforms of the united nations or the g twenty i 'm talking about how do we secure the space the demos the platform of values so that we can tap into
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 842.55 845.46 <o,f0,male> all of your potential
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 845.46 864.12 <o,f0,male> well this is exactly where i think europe fits in europe despite its recent failures is the world 's most successful cross border peace experiment so let 's see if it can 't be an experiment in global democracy a new kind of democracy
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 879.01 892.12 <o,f0,male> come up with creative solutions let 's imagine that european citizens actually have the power to vote directly for a european president or citizen juries
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 892.12 904.92 <o,f0,male> chosen by lottery which can deliberate on critical and controversial issues a european wide referendum where our citizens as the lawmakers vote on future treaties
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 904.92 907.12 <o,f0,male> and here 's an idea
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 907.12 919.79 <o,f0,male> why not have the first truly european citizens by giving our immigrants not greek or german or swedish citizenship but a european citizenship
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 919.79 928.98 <o,f0,male> and make sure we actually empower the unemployed by giving them a voucher scholarship where they can choose to study anywhere in europe
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 928.98 932.32 <o,f0,male> where our common identity is
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 932.32 949.3 <o,f0,male> democracy where our education is through participation and where participation builds trust and solidarity rather than exclusion and xenophobia europe of and by the people a europe
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 949.3 958.58 <o,f0,male> an experiment in deepening and widening democracy beyond borders now some might accuse me of being naive
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 958.58 964.04 <o,f0,male> putting my faith in the power and the wisdom of the people
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 964.05 968.17 <o,f0,male> well after decades in politics i am also a pragmatist
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 968.17 979.28 <o,f0,male> believe me i have been i am part of today 's political system and i know things must change
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 979.28 988.63 <o,f0,male> we must revive politics as the power to imagine reimagine and redesign for a better world
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 988.63 994.84 <o,f0,male> but i also know that this disruptive force of change won 't be driven by the politics of today
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 994.84 1001.65 <o,f0,male> the revival of democratic politics will come from you and i mean all of you
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1001.65 1020.95 <o,f0,male> everyone who participates in this global exchange of ideas whether it 's here in this room or just outside this room or online or locally where everybody lives everyone who stands up to injustice and inequality everybody who stands up to those who preach racism rather than empathy
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1020.95 1034.79 <o,f0,male> dogma rather than critical thinking technocracy rather than democracy everyone who stands up to the unchecked power whether it 's authoritarian leaders plutocrats hiding their assets in tax havens
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1034.79 1038.29 <o,f0,male> or powerful lobbies protecting the powerful few
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1038.29 1046.5 <o,f0,male> it is in their interest that all of us are idiots let 's not be thank you
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1070.72 1082.13 <o,f0,male> help us understand how you felt after the decision it was not a good decision clearly but how do you feel after that not as the prime minister but as george
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1086.08 1103.14 <o,f0,male> me or others to make the types of decisions we would have wanted and obviously i had hoped that we would have the time to make the reforms which would have dealt with the deficit rather than trying to cut the deficit which was the symptom of the problem and that hurt that hurt because that first of all hurt the younger generation and not only
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1103.14 1108.62 <o,f0,male> many of them are demonstrating outside but i think this is one of our problems when we face these crises
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1108.62 1122.56 <o,f0,male> we have kept the potential the huge potential of our society out of this process and we are closing in on ourselves in politics and i think we need to change that to really find new participatory ways
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1122.56 1133.11 <o,f0,male> using the great capabilities that now exist even in technology but not only in technology the minds that we have and i think we can find solutions which are much better but we have to be open
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1166.38 1170.48 <o,f0,male> the paradox is that because we have this blame game
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1170.48 1175.1 <o,f0,male> we have less the potential to convince our citizens that we should work together
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1175.1 1188.14 <o,f0,male> while now is the time when we really need to bring our powers together now more europe for me is not simply giving more power to brussels it is actually giving more power to the citizens of europe that is
GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1 GeorgePapandreou_2013G 1188.14 1197.14 <o,f0,male> really making europe a project of the people so that i think would be a way to answer some of the fears that we have in our society
