MargaretStewart_2010U 1 MargaretStewart_2010U 16.42 23.78 <o,f0,female> so if you're in the audience today or maybe you're watching this talk in some other time or place you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem
MargaretStewart_2010U 1 MargaretStewart_2010U 24.22 34.94 <o,f0,female> whether you're an artist a technologist a lawyer or a fan the handling of copyright directly impacts your life now rights management is no longer simply a question of ownership
MargaretStewart_2010U 1 MargaretStewart_2010U 35.25 43.26 <o,f0,female> it's a complex web of relationships and a critical part of our cultural landscape youtube cares deeply about the rights of content owners
MargaretStewart_2010U 1 MargaretStewart_2010U 43.79 53.10 <o,f0,female> but in order to give them choices about what they can do with copies mash ups and more we need to first identify when copyrighted material is uploaded to our site
MargaretStewart_2010U 1 MargaretStewart_2010U 62.17 72.65 <o,f0,female> a fan saw it on tv recorded with her camera phone and uploaded it to youtube now because sony music had registered chris brown 's video in our content id system
MargaretStewart_2010U 1 MargaretStewart_2010U 83.82 92.65 <o,f0,female> well it starts with content owners delivering assets into our database along with a usage policy that tells us what to do when we find a match
MargaretStewart_2010U 1 MargaretStewart_2010U 99.03 107.74 <o,f0,female> now this heat map is going to show you how the brain of the system works here we can see the original reference file being compared to the user generated content
MargaretStewart_2010U 1 MargaretStewart_2010U 108.36 122.11 <o,f0,female> the system compares every moment of one to the other to see if there's a match now this means that we can identify a match even if the copy used is just a portion of the original file plays it in slow motion and has degraded audio and video quality
MargaretStewart_2010U 1 MargaretStewart_2010U 122.82 135.23 <o,f0,female> and we do this every time that a video is uploaded to youtube and that's over twenty hours of video every minute when we find a match we apply the policy that the rights owner has set down
MargaretStewart_2010U 1 MargaretStewart_2010U 136.09 143.63 <o,f0,female> and the scale and the speed of this system is truly breathtaking we're not just talking about a few videos
MargaretStewart_2010U 1 MargaretStewart_2010U 143.93 153.94 <o,f0,female> we're talking about over one hundred years of video every day between new uploads and the legacy scans we regularly do across all of the content on the site
MargaretStewart_2010U 1 MargaretStewart_2010U 172.07 180.78 <o,f0,female> well most rights owners instead of blocking will allow the copy to be published and then they benefit through the exposure advertising and linked sales
MargaretStewart_2010U 1 MargaretStewart_2010U 197.37 202.37 <o,f0,female> about this is if the processional of the wedding was this much fun can you imagine how much fun the reception must have been
MargaretStewart_2010U 1 MargaretStewart_2010U 202.93 206.11 <o,f0,female> i mean who are these people i totally want to go to that wedding
MargaretStewart_2010U 1 MargaretStewart_2010U 207.80 211.90 <o,f0,female> so their little wedding video went on to get over forty million views
MargaretStewart_2010U 1 MargaretStewart_2010U 212.73 219.07 <o,f0,female> and instead of sony blocking they allowed the upload to occur and
MargaretStewart_2010U 1 MargaretStewart_2010U 221.91 229.61 <o,f0,female> eighteen months old went back to number four on the itunes charts so sony is generating revenue from both of these
MargaretStewart_2010U 1 MargaretStewart_2010U 253.67 261.59 <o,f0,female> it's truly an ecosystem of culture because it's not just amateurs borrowing from big studios but sometimes big studios borrowing back
MargaretStewart_2010U 1 MargaretStewart_2010U 270.77 281.69 <o,f0,female> so why has no one ever solved this problem before it's because it's a big problem and it's complicated and messy it's not uncommon for a single video to have multiple rights owners
MargaretStewart_2010U 1 MargaretStewart_2010U 291.46 302.14 <o,f0,female> so we have to manage many claims to the same video youtube 's content id system addresses all of these cases but the system only works through the participation of rights owners
MargaretStewart_2010U 1 MargaretStewart_2010U 302.60 310.88 <o,f0,female> if you have content that others are uploading to youtube you should register in the content id system and then you'll have the choice about how your content is used
MargaretStewart_2010U 1 MargaretStewart_2010U 311.20 323.68 <o,f0,female> and think carefully about the policies that you attach to that content by simply blocking all reuse you'll miss out on new art forms new audiences new distribution channels and new revenue streams
