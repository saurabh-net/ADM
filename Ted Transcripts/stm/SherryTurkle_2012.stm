SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 24.57 26.14 <o,f0,female> you will rock
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 32.72 35.26 <o,f0,female> and so there you have it
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 35.67 38.55 <o,f0,female> i embody the central
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 43.26 46.69 <o,f0,female> who 's going to tell you that too many of them
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 58.92 73.57 <o,f0,female> rebecca was five years old and she was sitting right there in the front row i had just written a book that celebrated our life on the internet and i was about to be on the cover of wired magazine
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 74.07 86.02 <o,f0,female> in those heady days we were experimenting with chat rooms and online virtual communities we were exploring different aspects of ourselves and then we unplugged
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 86.6 102.41 <o,f0,female> i was excited and as a psychologist what excited me most was the idea that we would use what we learned in the virtual world about ourselves about our identity to live better lives in the real world
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 112.03 113.87 <o,f0,female> she sleeps with her
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 121.13 123.73 <o,f0,female> but this time it 's not one
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 123.74 127.44 <o,f0,female> that will get me on the cover of wired magazine
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 133.29 141.45 <o,f0,female> but i believe and i 'm here to make the case that we 're letting it take us places that we don 't want to go
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 141.8 153.51 <o,f0,female> over the past fifteen years i 've studied technologies of mobile communication and i 've interviewed hundreds and hundreds of people young and old about their plugged in lives
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 166.27 168.29 <o,f0,female> they change who we are
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 169.43 175.19 <o,f0,female> some of the things we do now with our devices are things that only a few years ago
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 175.23 177.04 <o,f0,female> we would have found odd
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 177.23 178.94 <o,f0,female> or disturbing
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 179.16 181.93 <o,f0,female> but they 've quickly come to seem familiar
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 182.19 198.42 <o,f0,female> just how we do things so just to take some quick examples people text or do email during corporate board meetings they text and shop and go on facebook during classes during presentations actually
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 198.42 204.85 <o,f0,female> during all meetings people talk to me about the important new skill of making eye contact
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 220.42 231.1 <o,f0,female> about not having their parents full attention but then these same children deny each other their full attention this is a recent shot of my daughter
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 237.56 241.53 <o,f0,female> and we even text at funerals i study this
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 241.7 248.2 <o,f0,female> we remove ourselves from our grief or from our revery and we go into our phones
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 256.2 259.92 <o,f0,female> trouble certainly in how we relate to each other
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 260.28 264.15 <o,f0,female> but also trouble in how we relate to ourselves
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 267.45 271.84 <o,f0,female> we 're getting used to a new way of being alone together
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 272.35 276.49 <o,f0,female> people want to be with each other but also elsewhere
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 276.56 288.11 <o,f0,female> connected to all the different places they want to be people want to customize their lives they want to go in and out of all the places they are because the thing that matters most to them
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 294.48 297.97 <o,f0,female> but you only want to pay attention to the bits that interest you
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 298.16 301.31 <o,f0,female> and some people think that 's a good thing
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 301.72 305.13 <o,f0,female> but you can end up hiding from each other
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 305.46 308.69 <o,f0,female> even as we 're all constantly connected to each other
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 326.98 333.5 <o,f0,female> but then he stops himself and he says you know i 'm not telling you the truth i 'm the one who doesn 't want to be interrupted
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 333.64 335.75 <o,f0,female> i think i should want to
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 335.83 339.52 <o,f0,female> but actually i 'd rather just do things on my blackberry
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 340.36 347.89 <o,f0,female> across the generations i see that people can 't get enough of each other if and only if
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 348.1 352.84 <o,f0,female> they can have each other at a distance in amounts they can control
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 353.26 355.34 <o,f0,female> i call it the goldilocks effect
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 379.49 382.15 <o,f0,female> someday but certainly not now
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 383.13 386.01 <o,f0,female> i 'd like to learn how to have a conversation
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 386.83 398.38 <o,f0,female> when i ask people what 's wrong with having a conversation people say i 'll tell you what 's wrong with having a conversation it takes place in real time
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 420.7 423.92 <o,f0,female> the face the voice the flesh the body
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 438.94 445.33 <o,f0,female> and when we do one of the things that can happen is that we sacrifice conversation
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 449.54 451.05 <o,f0,female> and over time
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 451.25 453.4 <o,f0,female> we seem to forget this
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 463.19 464.77 <o,f0,female> me a profound
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 466.96 468.93 <o,f0,female> question a profound question
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 475.49 481.49 <o,f0,female> don 't all those little sips of online communication
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 485.36 487.33 <o,f0,female> of real conversation
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 488.67 490.47 <o,f0,female> my answer was no
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 504.73 507.11 <o,f0,female> or even for saying i love you
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 507.16 511.54 <o,f0,female> i mean look at how i felt when i got that text from my daughter
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 512.04 519.28 <o,f0,female> but they don 't really work for learning about each other for really coming to know and understand each other
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 523.73 527.26 <o,f0,female> to learn how to have conversations with ourselves
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 527.66 531.63 <o,f0,female> so a flight from conversation can really matter
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 531.86 541.27 <o,f0,female> because it can compromise our capacity for self reflection for kids growing up that skill is the bedrock of development
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 542 552.88 <o,f0,female> over and over i hear i would rather text than talk and what i 'm seeing is that people get so used to being short changed out of real conversation
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 569.63 573.46 <o,f0,female> will be more like a best friend someone who will listen
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 573.56 575.15 <o,f0,female> when others won 't
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 575.66 578.05 <o,f0,female> i believe this wish reflects
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 599.39 607.74 <o,f0,female> and the feeling that no one is listening to me make us want to spend time with machines that seem to care about us
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 607.86 616.46 <o,f0,female> we 're developing robots they call them sociable robots that are specifically designed to be companions to the elderly
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 624.55 626.47 <o,f0,female> will be there for each other
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 627.97 634.31 <o,f0,female> during my research i worked in nursing homes and i brought in these sociable robots
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 634.62 639.66 <o,f0,female> that were designed to give the elderly the feeling that they were understood
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 639.93 644.15 <o,f0,female> and one day i came in and a woman who had lost a child
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 648.86 655.52 <o,f0,female> it seemed to be looking in her eyes it seemed to be following the conversation it comforted her
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 656.21 659.76 <o,f0,female> and many people found this amazing
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 660.8 663.61 <o,f0,female> but that woman was trying to make sense
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 671.33 673.91 <o,f0,female> that robot put on a great show
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 674.27 681.08 <o,f0,female> and we 're vulnerable people experience pretend empathy as though it were the real thing
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 695.95 697.7 <o,f0,female> it doesn 't know life
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 697.9 701.59 <o,f0,female> and as that woman took comfort in her robot companion
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 702.05 703.86 <o,f0,female> i didn 't find it amazing
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 704.43 710.83 <o,f0,female> i found it one of the most wrenching complicated moments in my fifteen years of work
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 720.55 726.14 <o,f0,female> we expect more from technology and less from each other
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 726.54 728.1 <o,f0,female> and i ask myself
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 728.17 730.63 <o,f0,female> why have things come to this
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 731.39 735.91 <o,f0,female> and i believe it 's because technology appeals to us most
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 736.35 738.44 <o,f0,female> where we are most vulnerable
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 738.99 740.65 <o,f0,female> and we are vulnerable
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 744.76 763.02 <o,f0,female> and so from social networks to sociable robots we 're designing technologies that will give us the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship we turn to technology to help us feel connected in ways we can comfortably control but we 're not so comfortable
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 780.03 791.84 <o,f0,female> that we will always be heard and three that we will never have to be alone and that third idea that we will never have to be alone is central to changing our psyches
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 791.9 808.34 <o,f0,female> because the moment that people are alone even for a few seconds they become anxious they panic they fidget they reach for a device just think of people at a checkout line or at a red light being alone feels like a problem
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 808.34 812.35 <o,f0,female> that needs to be solved and so people try to solve it by connecting
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 812.88 822.43 <o,f0,female> but here connection is more like a symptom than a cure it expresses but it doesn 't solve an underlying problem
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 822.71 836.11 <o,f0,female> but more than a symptom constant connection is changing the way people think of themselves it 's shaping a new way of being the best way to describe it is i share therefore i am
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 855.2 867.64 <o,f0,female> the problem with this new regime of i share therefore i am is that if we don 't have connection we don 't feel like ourselves we almost don 't feel ourselves so what do we do we connect
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 873.93 885.87 <o,f0,female> how do you get from connection to isolation you end up isolated if you don 't cultivate the capacity for solitude the ability to be separate to gather yourself
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 886.2 889.52 <o,f0,female> solitude is where you find yourself
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 894.32 897.72 <o,f0,female> when we don 't have the capacity for solitude
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 911.51 920.31 <o,f0,female> to support our fragile sense of self we slip into thinking that always being connected is going to make us feel
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 926.15 928.37 <o,f0,female> if we 're not able to be alone
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 938.22 949.7 <o,f0,female> when i spoke at ted in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six reporting on my studies of the early virtual communities i said those who make the most of their lives on the screen
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 949.84 952.69 <o,f0,female> come to it in a spirit of self reflection
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 952.78 955.52 <o,f0,female> and that 's what i 'm calling for here now
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 955.54 966.99 <o,f0,female> reflection and more than that a conversation about where our current use of technology may be taking us what it might be costing us we 're smitten
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 967.04 976.57 <o,f0,female> with technology and we 're afraid like young lovers that too much talking might spoil the romance but it 's time to talk
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 977.09 982.08 <o,f0,female> we grew up with digital technology and so we see it as all grown up
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 982.16 994.73 <o,f0,female> but it 's not it 's early days there 's plenty of time for us to reconsider how we use it how we build it i 'm not suggesting that we turn away from our devices
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 994.82 1001.7 <o,f0,female> just that we develop a more self aware relationship with them with each other and with ourselves
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 1002.65 1004.3 <o,f0,female> i see some first steps
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 1004.9 1008.36 <o,f0,female> start thinking of solitude as a good thing
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 1008.53 1010.28 <o,f0,female> make room for it
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 1011.05 1015.48 <o,f0,female> find ways to demonstrate this as a value to your children
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 1015.93 1029.78 <o,f0,female> create sacred spaces at home the kitchen the dining room and reclaim them for conversation do the same thing at work at work we 're so busy communicating that we often don 't have time to think
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 1030.33 1034.16 <o,f0,female> we don 't have time to talk about the things that really matter
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 1040.98 1043.69 <o,f0,female> including to the boring bits
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 1044.7 1049.52 <o,f0,female> because it 's when we stumble or hesitate or lose our words
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 1049.66 1051.46 <o,f0,female> that we reveal ourselves
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 1069.4 1070.98 <o,f0,female> i 'm optimistic
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 1071.04 1073.47 <o,f0,female> we have everything we need to start
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 1092.21 1096.04 <o,f0,female> so in my work i hear that life is hard
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 1096.24 1098.49 <o,f0,female> relationships are filled with risk
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 1098.74 1100.64 <o,f0,female> and then there 's technology
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 1118.79 1121.28 <o,f0,female> online and with avatars
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 1121.4 1130.1 <o,f0,female> we 're drawn to virtual romance to computer games that seem like worlds to the idea that robots robots
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 1130.46 1133.06 <o,f0,female> will someday be our true companions
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 1133.85 1137.2 <o,f0,female> we spend an evening on the social network instead of
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 1137.23 1139.58 <o,f0,female> going to the pub with friends
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 1140.24 1143.97 <o,f0,female> but our fantasies of substitution have cost us
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 1154.02 1160.08 <o,f0,female> our own bodies our own communities our own politics our own planet
SherryTurkle_2012 1 SherryTurkle_2012 1168.06 1172.59 <o,f0,female> the technology of our dreams to make this life
