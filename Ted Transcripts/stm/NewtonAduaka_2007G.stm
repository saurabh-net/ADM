NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 12.45 21.16 <o,f0,male> this is very strange for me because i a m not used to doing this i usually stand on the other side of the light and now i'm feeling the pressure i put other people into
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 25.57 30.88 <o,f0,male> and it's hard the previous speaker has been i think has really painted a very good background as to
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 32.17 44.78 <o,f0,male> what really the impulse behind my work and what drives me and my sense of loss and trying to find the answer to the big questions
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 45.97 55.76 <o,f0,male> but this for me i mean coming here to do this feels like feels like there a s this sculptor that i like very much
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 57.64 65.74 <o,f0,male> giacometti who after many years of living in france and learning you know studying and
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 66.32 78.82 <o,f0,male> working he returned home and he was asked what did you produce what have you done with so many years of being away and he sort of he showed a handful of figurines
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 79.63 87.46 <o,f0,male> and obviously they were is this what you spent years doing and we expected you know huge masterpieces
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 88.54 95.97 <o,f0,male> you know but what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces was the culmination of a man
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 96.91 102.74 <o,f0,male> life search thought and everything just in a reduced small version
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 103.28 111.93 <o,f0,male> in a way i feel like that i feel like i a m coming home to talk about what i a ve been out away doing for twenty years now
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 113.17 125.40 <o,f0,male> and i will start with a brief taster of what i a ve been about a handful of films nothing much two feature films and a handful of short films so we a ll go with the first
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 153.21 153.59 <o,f0,female> and
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 161.27 162.27 <o,f0,female> you
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 227.17 231.66 <o,f0,male> feed no one and it particularly don't feed your spliff habit it feeds my
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 232.80 236.15 <o,f0,male> my soul arguing with you is a waste of time
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 240.91 241.07 <o,f0,female> you
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 259.33 259.98 <o,f0,male> a
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 270.76 270.89 <o,f0,male> i
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 273.55 274.83 <o,f0,male> you recruited to fight this
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 282.62 283.55 <o,f0,male> to express
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 302.02 302.20 <o,f0,male> i
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 312.90 313.10 <o,f0,male> a
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 343.03 343.33 <o,f0,female> the
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 359.11 359.69 <o,f0,male> really
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 365.49 375.13 <o,f0,male> for me and where i'm coming from in terms of cinema the first piece was really there's a young woman talking about nigeria that she has a feeling she'll be happy there
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 376.43 382.17 <o,f0,male> the sentiments of someone that's been away from home and that was something that i went through you know and i'm still going through
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 382.53 387.93 <o,f0,male> been home for quite a while for about five years now i've been away twenty years in total
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 398.65 406.54 <o,f0,male> which is the time of abacha the military dictatorship the worst part of nigerian history this post colonial history
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 406.86 414.25 <o,f0,male> so for this girl to have these dreams is simply how we preserve a sense of what home is how
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 416.17 419.25 <o,f0,male> perhaps romantic but i think beautiful
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 419.40 419.89 <o,f0,male> because you
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 432.63 439.60 <o,f0,male> living as a black person in europe the glass ceiling that we all know about that we all talk about you know
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 440.60 447.53 <o,f0,male> and coming you know and his reality again this was my this was me talking about this was again the time of multiculturalism in
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 458.98 467.41 <o,f0,male> what does a child like jamie the young boy think i mean with all this anger that's built up inside of him and what does happens with that
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 467.71 481.16 <o,f0,male> what of course happens with that is violence which is which we see when we you know we talk about the ghettos and we talk about you know south central l a and this kind of stuff which eventually sometimes when channeled becomes
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 494.42 503.73 <o,f0,male> i lived in england for eighteen years i've lived in france for about four and i feel actually thrown back twenty years living in france
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 505.32 514.42 <o,f0,male> and then the third piece the third piece for me is the question what is cinema to you what do you do with cinema there's a young the
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 537.27 545.97 <o,f0,male> so that whole thing that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 671.84 672.69 <o,f0,female> and
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 696.76 697.41 <o,f0,male> ninety nine
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 727.40 727.53 <o,f0,female> a
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 757.77 758.02 <o,f0,male> that
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 850.18 852.02 <o,f0,male> more than that begin a healing process
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 876.10 876.85 <o,f0,male> my name is
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 883.72 883.97 <o,f0,male> she
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 895.56 897.45 <o,f0,male> trial here for any crimes you committed
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 897.70 899.45 <o,f0,male> we were fighting for our freedom
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 900.20 900.82 <o,f0,male> if killing
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 902.74 904.53 <o,f0,male> then you have to charge every soldier
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 907.17 908.93 <o,f0,male> crime yes but i did not
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 910.26 912.27 <o,f0,male> you too are a retired general not so
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 916.53 916.72 <o,f0,male> so
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 920.16 921.48 <o,f0,male> our government was
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 922.79 925.29 <o,f0,male> lack of education was their way to
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 927.02 930.02 <o,f0,male> if i may ask do you pay for school in your country
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 938.31 938.49 <o,f0,male> we
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 942.16 942.59 <o,f0,male> about
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 944.40 948.82 <o,f0,male> you support corrupt governments like my own why because
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 950.84 951.81 <o,f0,male> anyone in this room
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 954.80 955.02 <o,f0,male> no
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 966.52 967.43 <o,f0,male> i can't do that
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 969.05 969.54 <o,f0,male> so you are
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 972.84 974.28 <o,f0,female> thank you just very quickly
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 974.98 985.96 <o,f0,male> my point really here is that while we a re making all these huge advancements what we're doing which for me you know i think we should africa should move forward but
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 986.15 989.17 <o,f0,male> we should remember so we do not go back
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 996.65 1005.47 <o,f0,male> of the themes that comes through very strongly in the piece we just watched is this sense of
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 1005.95 1015.93 <o,f0,male> the psychological trauma of the young that have to play this role of child being child soldiers and
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 1017.40 1028.35 <o,f0,male> considering where you are coming from and when we consider the extent to which it a s not taken as seriously as it should be what would you have to say about that
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 1029.79 1042.20 <o,f0,male> in the process of my research i went i actually spent a bit of time in sierra leone researching this and i met i remember i met a lot of child soldiers ex combatants as
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 1044.09 1051.17 <o,f0,male> like to be called i met psychosocial workers who worked with them
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 1053.76 1064.78 <o,f0,male> time with them aid workers ngos the whole lot but i remember on the flight back on my last trip i remember breaking down in tears and thinking to myself
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 1065.89 1071.31 <o,f0,male> if these kids if any kid in the west in the western world
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 1073.11 1082.16 <o,f0,male> of what any of those kids have gone through they will be on therapy for the rest of their natural lives
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 1083.16 1085.16 <o,f0,male> so for me the thought
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 1085.82 1095.95 <o,f0,male> we have all these children it a s a generation we have a whole generation of children who have been put through so much psychological trauma
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 1096.35 1110.62 <o,f0,male> damage and africa has to live with that but i a m just saying to factor that in factor that in with all this great advancement all this pronouncement of great achievement that a s really my thinking eo well
NewtonAduaka_2007G 1 NewtonAduaka_2007G 1111.32 1116.56 <o,f0,male> thank you again for coming to the ted stage that was a very moving piece na thank you eo thank you
