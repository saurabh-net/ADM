DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 13.55 14.84 <o,f0,male> a medical illustrator
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 15.72 24.17 <o,f0,male> and i come from a slightly different point of view i've been watching since i grew up the expressions of truth and beauty
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 24.55 34.09 <o,f0,male> in the arts and truth and beauty in the sciences and while these are both wonderful things in their own right they both have very wonderful things going for them truth and beauty
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 34.54 45.79 <o,f0,male> as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences and by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twins that a scientist would want to date
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 49.37 51.13 <o,f0,male> are expressions of
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 52.42 66.73 <o,f0,male> as awe ful things by meaning they are things you can worship they are ideals that are powerful they are irreducible they are unique they are useful sometimes often a long time after the fact
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 67.10 72.04 <o,f0,male> and you can actually roll some of the pictures now because i don't want to look at me on the screen
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 73.20 83.92 <o,f0,male> truth and beauty are things that are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences they are things that describe
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 85.68 92.48 <o,f0,male> beauty in a way that is often only accessible if you understand the language and the syntax
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 92.90 101.96 <o,f0,male> of the person who studies the subject in which truth and beauty is expressed if you look at the math e equal mc squared if you look at the cosmological constant
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 102.28 110.14 <o,f0,male> where there's an anthropic ideal where you see that life had to evolve from the numbers that describe the universe
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 110.44 122.44 <o,f0,male> these are things that are really difficult to understand and what i've tried to do since i had my training as a medical illustrator since i was taught animation by my father who was a sculptor and my visual mentor
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 123.25 130.48 <o,f0,male> i wanted to figure out a way to help people understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 130.83 139.12 <o,f0,male> by using animation by using pictures by telling stories so that the things that are not necessarily evident to people
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 149.55 151.44 <o,f0,male> they learn is
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 161.18 172.35 <o,f0,male> drawn down to the point where the truth and beauty are not always evident it's almost like that old recipe for chicken soup where you boil the chicken until the flavor is just
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 173.96 181.05 <o,f0,male> want to do that to our students so we have an opportunity to really open up education and i had a telephone call
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 181.29 190.82 <o,f0,male> from robert lue at harvard in the molecular and cellular biology department a couple of years ago he asked me if my team and i would be interested and willing to
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 191.33 200.50 <o,f0,male> really change how medical and scientific education is done at harvard so we embarked on a project that would explore the cell that would
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 208.76 218.11 <o,f0,male> that they could hang all of these facts on they could have a mental image of the cell as a large bustling
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 218.88 232.26 <o,f0,male> hugely complicated city that's occupied by micro machines and these micro machines really are at the heart of life these micro machines which are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over are
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 235.79 244.09 <o,f0,male> powerful precise accurate devices that are made out of strings of amino acids and these micro machines
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 244.55 251.80 <o,f0,male> power how a cell moves they power how a cell replicates they power our hearts they power
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 252.39 263.68 <o,f0,male> minds and so what we wanted to do was to figure out how we could make this story into an animation that would be the center piece of biovisions at harvard
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 263.99 271.52 <o,f0,male> which is a website that harvard has for its molecular and cellular biology students that will
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 272.73 285.95 <o,f0,male> in addition to all the textual information in addition to all the didactics stuff put everything together visually so that these students would have an internalized view of what a cell really is in all of its truth and beauty
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 286.54 299.55 <o,f0,male> and be able to study with this view in mind so that their imaginations would be sparked so that their passions would be sparked and so that they would be able to go on and use these visions in their head
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 299.89 307.69 <o,f0,male> to make new discoveries and to be able to find out really how life works so we set out by looking at
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 308.61 311.13 <o,f0,male> how these molecules are put together
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 311.54 315.20 <o,f0,male> we worked with a theme which is you've got
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 326.05 336.24 <o,f0,male> and they are given this information that there's an inflammation somewhere outside where they can't see and sense but they get the information that causes them to stop
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 336.80 344.54 <o,f0,male> causes them to internalize that they need to make all of the various parts that will cause them to change their shape
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 345.10 346.32 <o,f0,male> and try to get out of
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 347.62 354.83 <o,f0,male> and find out what's going on so these molecular motors we had to work with the harvard scientists and
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 357.55 367.33 <o,f0,male> models of the atomically accurate molecules and figure out how they moved and figure out what they did and figure out how to do this in a way
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 367.97 378.82 <o,f0,male> that was truthful in that it imparted what was going on but not so truthful that the compact crowding in a cell would
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 389.72 396.37 <o,f0,male> it's an ongoing project that's going to go another four or five years and i want you to look at this and
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 396.67 410.85 <o,f0,male> see the paths that the cell manufactures these little walking machines they're called kinesins that take these huge loads that would challenge an ant in relative size run the movie please
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 413.11 422.28 <o,f0,male> but these machines that power the inside of the cells are really quite amazing and they really are the basis of all life because all of these machines
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 423.82 431.34 <o,f0,male> interact with each other they pass information to each other they cause different things to happen inside the cell and the cell will actually
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 441.56 454.66 <o,f0,male> no life from the smallest life to everybody here would be possible without these little micro machines in fact it would really in the absence of these machines have made the attendance here chris really quite sparse
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 470.23 472.49 <o,f0,male> this is the fedex delivery guy of the cell
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 473.79 482.15 <o,f0,male> this little guy is called the kinesin and he pulls a sack that's full of brand new manufactured proteins to wherever it's needed in the cell
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 482.41 488.83 <o,f0,male> whether it's to a membrane whether it's to an organelle whether it's to build something or repair something and each of us
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 489.13 501.35 <o,f0,male> has about one hundred thousand of these things running around right now inside each one of your one hundred trillion cells so no matter how lazy you feel you're not really intrinsically doing nothing
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 505.73 513.02 <o,f0,male> so what i want you to do when you go home is think about this and think about how powerful our cells are and think about some of the things that
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 513.60 522.79 <o,f0,male> we're learning about cellular mechanics once we figure out all that's going on and believe me we know almost a percent of what's going on
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 523.15 530.65 <o,f0,male> once we figure out what's going on we're really going to be able to have a lot of control over what we do with our health with what we do with
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 530.88 538.97 <o,f0,male> future generations how long we're going to live and hopefully we'll be able to use this to discover more truth and more beauty
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 554.41 555.10 <o,f0,male> these cells
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 555.72 557.01 <o,f0,male> these micro machines
DavidBolinsky_2007 1 DavidBolinsky_2007 559.88 567.96 <o,f0,male> aware enough of what the cell needs that they do their bidding they work together they make the cell do what it needs to do and
