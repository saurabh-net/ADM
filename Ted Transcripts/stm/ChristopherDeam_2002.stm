ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 13.29 23.30 <o,f0,male> i was asked by wilsonart international a plastic laminate company which is the largest plastic laminate company in the world they asked me to
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 24.58 33.83 <o,f0,male> design a trade show booth for exhibition at the international contemporary furniture fair in new york in two thousand
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 35.71 45.47 <o,f0,male> so looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically transportation design interiors and furniture
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 46.90 59.91 <o,f0,male> we came up with the solution of taking an old airstream trailer and gutting it and trying to portray laminate and a trailer in kind of a fresh new contemporary look when this trailer
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 60.32 72.19 <o,f0,male> showed up at my shop in berkeley i'd actually never stepped foot in an airstream trailer or any other trailer so i can be somebody that can look at this in a totally fresh perspective and see if i can optimize it
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 72.67 85.32 <o,f0,male> in its most idealistic fashion i decided i had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong somewhere along the history of airstream what i discovered in these interiors is that
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 85.54 94.47 <o,f0,male> there was a disconnect between the exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces in that the shell was originally conceived as a
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 95.08 102.29 <o,f0,male> lightweight modern futuristic high tech pod for hurtling down the freeway
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 103.37 115.82 <o,f0,male> the interiors were completely out of sync with that in fact it appeared like they referenced a mountain cabin that seemed really like a crisis to me that they had never been able to
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 124.56 137.93 <o,f0,male> we really needed to do some archeology in the trailer itself to figure out what's authentic in an airstream trailer and what feels like it has true purpose and utility we stripped out all the vinyl and zolatone paint
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 138.25 147.81 <o,f0,male> that was covering up this just fantastic aluminum shell we took off all the visible hardware and trim that was kind of doing the country cabin thing
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 148.05 154.75 <o,f0,male> i literally drew on the walls of the trailer mocked it up in cardboard we'd come in and cut
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 155.27 169.75 <o,f0,male> decide things were wrong pull it out put it back in the main goal was to smooth out the interior and begin to speak about motion and mobility and independence the biggest difficulty
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 170.07 178.12 <o,f0,male> on one of these trailers is that when you're designing there's actually no logical place to stop and start materials
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 178.34 185.30 <o,f0,male> because of the continuous form of the trailer there's no such things as two walls and a ceiling coming together where you can change
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 197.75 202.01 <o,f0,male> curve interior what i had to devise was a way
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 202.65 215.54 <o,f0,male> of fooling the eye into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell what i came up with was a series of second skins that basically float
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 216.21 227.45 <o,f0,male> over the aluminum shell and what i was trying to do there was direct your eye in the space so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way and that the casework
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 228.63 239.47 <o,f0,male> break up the space they also gave us a way to run power and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin so they function as an electrical chase that's the trailer pretty much finished
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 239.88 250.03 <o,f0,male> that trailer led to another commission to participate in whats called tokyo designers block its a week of furniture design events in tokyo in october
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 250.44 257.16 <o,f0,male> teruo kurosaki who owns a furniture company called idee he asked me
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 259.64 269.55 <o,f0,male> he said one he would like to make a real trailer functioning and we would sell that one trailer number two you have a blank slate you can to anything you want we came up with a fantasy scenario
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 270.27 280.13 <o,f0,male> dj traveling around the states that would collect records and go on tours this trailer housed two turntables mixer wet bar
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 282.05 290.25 <o,f0,male> it's got a huge couch fits quite a few people and basically we'd had a great time with this and so in this trailer i took it upon myself to think about
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 300.04 307.71 <o,f0,male> this brings us up to the time that i started consulting to airstream they came to me and said well what can we do to freshen this thing
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 308.32 315.88 <o,f0,male> do you think kids you know skateboarders surfers rock climbers would use these things and i said well not in that interior
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 325.04 339.66 <o,f0,male> i thought finally oh yeah great big company i'm gonna work with somebody with money for tooling and molding and i walked in their prototype facility and it's exactly like my shop only bigger same tools same things so
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 340.08 351.05 <o,f0,male> the problem became and they set this dilemma to me that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology and there's no money for tooling or molding
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 351.32 359.07 <o,f0,male> the trailers themselves are actually hand built all the casework is hand scribed in uniquely so you can't just cut
ChristopherDeam_2002 1 ChristopherDeam_2002 360.43 371.40 <o,f0,male> you have to cut them big and every single one is hand fit they didn't want to go to a componentized system and there it is that's the bambi sixteen
