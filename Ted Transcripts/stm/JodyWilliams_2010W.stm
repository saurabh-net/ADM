JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 27.08 29.91 <o,f0,female> what peace really means
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 30.31 34.38 <o,f0,female> peace is not kumbaya my lord peace is not
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 34.88 38.03 <o,f0,female> the dove and the rainbow as lovely as they are
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 38.77 44.65 <o,f0,female> when i see the symbols of the rainbow and the dove i think of personal serenity
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 45.33 50.97 <o,f0,female> i think of meditation i do not think about what i
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 51.51 55.29 <o,f0,female> to be peace which is sustainable peace
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 55.94 65.22 <o,f0,female> with justice and equality it is a sustainable peace in which the majority of people on this planet
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 66.00 67.90 <o,f0,female> have access to enough
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 68.60 71.58 <o,f0,female> resources to live dignified lives
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 72.39 75.06 <o,f0,female> where these people have enough access to
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 76.61 78.01 <o,f0,female> and health care
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 78.71 83.45 <o,f0,female> so that they can live in freedom from want and freedom from fear
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 84.50 87.02 <o,f0,female> this is called human security
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 87.75 97.24 <o,f0,female> and i am not a complete pacifist like some of my really really heavy duty non violent friends like mairead mcguire
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 97.93 100.26 <o,f0,female> i understand that humans are so
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 103.37 112.42 <o,f0,female> a nice word because i promised my mom i'd stop using the f bomb in public and i'm trying harder and harder mom i'm really
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 114.47 115.91 <o,f0,female> we need a little bit of police
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 115.99 118.33 <o,f0,female> we need a little bit of military but for
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 119.86 128.41 <o,f0,female> we need to redefine what makes us secure in this world it is not arming our country to
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 130.51 138.34 <o,f0,female> it is not getting other countries to arm themselves to the teeth with the weapons that we produce and we sell them
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 139.73 144.49 <o,f0,female> it is using that money more rationally to make the countries
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 144.73 149.88 <o,f0,female> of the world secure to make the people of the world secure
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 157.84 161.57 <o,f0,female> the president is offering eight point four billion
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 162.22 166.99 <o,f0,female> to try to get the start vote i certainly support the start vote
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 167.29 172.07 <o,f0,female> but he 's offering eighty four billion dollars for the modernizing
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 172.63 173.74 <o,f0,female> of nuclear weapons
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 180.69 184.03 <o,f0,female> is eighty billion dollars
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 185.96 194.55 <o,f0,female> just that little bit of money which to me i wish it was in my bank account it's not but in global terms it's a little bit of money
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 196.28 204.86 <o,f0,female> but it's going to modernize weapons we do not need and will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime unless we get up off our
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 205.73 207.62 <o,f0,female> and take action to make it happen
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 219.48 226.70 <o,f0,female> it is saving the tigers it is stopping the tar sands it is
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 227.33 238.13 <o,f0,female> having access to medical equipment that can actually tell who does have cancer it is all of those things it is using our money for all of those things
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 238.95 240.71 <o,f0,female> it is about action
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 241.34 242.89 <o,f0,female> i was in hiroshima
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 243.01 245.57 <o,f0,female> a couple of weeks ago and his holiness
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 246.24 251.25 <o,f0,female> sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city and there were about eight of us nobel
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 277.39 285.65 <o,f0,female> good that's good we need that in the world i don't follow that but that's cool and he says but i have become skeptical
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 286.46 292.77 <o,f0,female> i do not believe that meditation and prayer will change this world
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 293.80 296.66 <o,f0,female> i think what we need is action
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 297.58 306.77 <o,f0,female> his holiness in his robes is my new action hero i spoke with aung sun suu kyi a couple of days ago
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 314.60 324.05 <o,f0,female> the last twenty years imprisoned for her efforts to bring about democracy she was just released a couple of weeks ago and we're very
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 324.74 337.24 <o,f0,female> to see how long she will be free because she is already out in the streets in rangoon agitating for change she is already out in the streets working with the party to try to rebuild it but i talked to her for a range of
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 338.35 340.58 <o,f0,female> but one thing that i want to say because it's
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 344.63 349.35 <o,f0,female> she said you know we have a long road to go to finally get democracy in my country
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 350.61 352.60 <o,f0,female> but i don't believe in hope
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 353.48 354.64 <o,f0,female> without endeavor
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 355.72 361.75 <o,f0,female> i don't believe in the hope of change unless we take action to make it so
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 362.83 367.05 <o,f0,female> here 's another woman hero of mine she's my friend
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 377.77 382.12 <o,f0,female> where she lives where does she live in exile she says the airports of the world
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 382.75 396.75 <o,f0,female> she is traveling because she was out of the country at the time of the elections and instead going home she conferred with all the other women that she works with who said to her stay out we need you out we need to be able to talk to you
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 396.94 401.10 <o,f0,female> out there so that you can give the message of what's happening here
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 402.29 407.59 <o,f0,female> a year and a half she's out speaking on behalf of the other women in her country
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 408.91 409.99 <o,f0,female> wangari maathai
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 411.01 412.75 <o,f0,female> two thousand and four peace laureate
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 413.17 416.11 <o,f0,female> they call her the tree lady but she's more than the tree lady
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 416.95 418.27 <o,f0,female> working for peace
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 418.61 420.14 <o,f0,female> is very creative
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 420.90 422.70 <o,f0,female> it's hard work every day
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 423.14 430.85 <o,f0,female> she was planting those trees i don't think most people understand that at the same time she was using the
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 431.67 440.25 <o,f0,female> of getting people together to plant those trees to talk about how to overcome the authoritarian government in her country
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 440.80 446.44 <o,f0,female> people could not gather without getting busted and taken to jail but if they were together planting
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 446.64 448.08 <o,f0,female> trees for the environment
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 449.30 452.73 <o,f0,female> it was okay creativity
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 454.06 456.76 <o,f0,female> but it's not just iconic women
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 467.61 475.34 <o,f0,female> to change this world the women 's league of burma eleven individual organizations of burmese women came together because there's strength
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 475.64 485.12 <o,f0,female> in numbers working together is what changes our world the million signatures campaign of women inside burma working together
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 485.33 496.01 <o,f0,female> to change human rights to bring democracy to that country when one is arrested and taken to prison another one comes out and joins the movement recognizing that if
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 496.10 500.82 <o,f0,female> they work together they will ultimately bring change in their own country
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 515.79 520.19 <o,f0,female> there was a mother and three children the children were killed on the spot it was mairead 's sister
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 521.85 525.85 <o,f0,female> instead of giving in to grief depression defeat
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 526.91 538.69 <o,f0,female> in the face of that violence mairead hooked up with betty a staunch protestant and a staunch catholic and they took to the streets to say no more violence
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 539.89 545.69 <o,f0,female> and they were able to get tens of thousands of primarily women some men in the streets
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 546.22 547.63 <o,f0,female> to bring about change
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 548.57 554.16 <o,f0,female> and they have been part of what brought peace to northern ireland and they're still working on it
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 561.97 576.40 <o,f0,female> now running for president she is educating the indigenous people of her country about what it means to be about a democracy about how you bring democracy to the country about educating about how to vote but that democracy is not just
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 576.91 579.60 <o,f0,female> about voting it's about being an active citizen
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 580.62 589.79 <o,f0,female> that's what i got stuck doing the landmine campaign one of the things that made this campaign work is because we grew from two ngo 's
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 590.34 596.95 <o,f0,female> to thousands in ninety countries around the world working together in common cause to ban landmines
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 597.41 606.52 <o,f0,female> some of the people who worked in our campaign could only work maybe an hour a month they could maybe volunteer that much there were others like myself who were full time
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 607.02 611.77 <o,f0,female> but it was the actions together of all of us that brought about that
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 612.09 621.54 <o,f0,female> change in my view what we need today is people getting up and taking action to reclaim the meaning of peace it's not
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 621.62 631.90 <o,f0,female> a dirty word it's hard work every single day and if each of us who cares about the different things we care about got up off our butts and volunteered
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 632.90 634.64 <o,f0,female> as much time as we could
JodyWilliams_2010W 1 JodyWilliams_2010W 635.87 643.27 <o,f0,female> we would change this world we would save this world and we can't wait for the other guy we have to do it ourselves thank you
