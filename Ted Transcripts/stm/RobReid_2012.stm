RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 15.82 21.6 <o,f0,male> recent debate over copyright laws like sopa in the united states and the acta agreement in europe
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 21.72 38.69 <o,f0,male> has been very emotional and i think some dispassionate quantitative reasoning could really bring a great deal to the debate i 'd therefore like to propose that we employ we enlist the cutting edge field of copyright math whenever we approach this subject for instance just recently
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 38.91 45.75 <o,f0,male> the motion picture association revealed that our economy loses fifty eight billion dollars a year to copyright theft
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 46.5 58.82 <o,f0,male> now rather than just argue about this number a copyright mathematician will analyze it and he 'll soon discover that this money could stretch from this auditorium all the way across ocean boulevard to the westin
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 59.38 60.9 <o,f0,male> and then to mars
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 66.38 70.86 <o,f0,male> now this is obviously a powerful some might say dangerously powerful insight
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 80.18 92.24 <o,f0,male> this is the equivalent to the entire american corn crop failing along with all of our fruit crops as well as wheat tobacco rice sorghum whatever sorghum is
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 113.98 120.88 <o,f0,male> and tv satellite and cable revenues are way up other content markets like book publishing and radio are also up
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 120.91 124.43 <o,f0,male> so this small missing chunk here is puzzling
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 181.45 190.57 <o,f0,male> theft which is quite a lot when you consider that back in ninety eight the bureau of labor statistics indicated that the motion picture and video industries were employing two hundred and seventy thousand people
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 191.58 209.27 <o,f0,male> other data has the music industry at about forty five thousand people and so the job losses that came with the internet and all that content theft have therefore left us with negative employment in our content industries and this is just one of the many mind blowing statistics that copyright mathematicians have to deal with every day and some people think that string theory is tough
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 230.89 240.19 <o,f0,male> some people think this number 's a little bit large but copyright mathematicians who are media lobby experts are merely surprised that it doesn 't get compounded for inflation every year
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 240.7 252.07 <o,f0,male> now when this law first passed the world 's hottest mp three player could hold just ten songs and it was a big christmas hit because what little hoodlum wouldn 't want a million and a half bucks worth of stolen goods in his pocket
