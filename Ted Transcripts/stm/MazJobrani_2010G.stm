MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 56.14 61.90 <o,f0,male> but i was born in iran i'm now an american citizen which means i have the american passport which means i can travel
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 63.38 70.93 <o,f0,male> because if you only have the iranian passport you're kind of limited to the countries you can go to with open arms you know syria venezuela north korea
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 85.74 87.06 <o,f0,male> i'm like oh come on man
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 88.84 90.20 <o,f0,male> trying to go places
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 104.54 115.43 <o,f0,male> and so i was in kuwait recently doing a comedy show with some other american comedians they all went through and then the border patrol saw my american passport ah ha american great then he opened it up born in iran wait
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 118.15 126.78 <o,f0,male> asking me questions he said what is your father 's name i said well he 's passed away but his name was khosro he goes what is your grandfather 's name
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 141.43 142.99 <o,f0,male> been looking for you for two hundred years
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 147.64 150.29 <o,f0,male> your grandfather has a parking violation it's way overdue
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 151.15 153.05 <o,f0,male> you owe us two billion dollars
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 154.62 155.99 <o,f0,male> but as you can see when i talk
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 156.09 170.61 <o,f0,male> i speak with an american accent which you would think as an iranian american actor i should be able to play any part good bad what have you but a lot of times in hollywood when casting directors find out you're of middle eastern descent they go oh you're iranian great can you say i will kill you in the name of
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 172.54 175.70 <o,f0,male> i could say that but what if i were to say hello i'm your doctor
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 176.46 178.48 <o,f0,male> go great and then you hijack the hospital
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 184.59 186.14 <o,f0,male> i think you're missing the point here
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 187.85 196.80 <o,f0,male> i don't mind playing bad guys i want to play a bad guy i want to rob a bank i want to rob a bank in a film i want to rob a bank in a film but do it with a gun with a gun not with a bomb strapped around
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 198.32 202.93 <o,f0,male> i imagine the director maz i think your character would rob the bank with a bomb around
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 215.68 217.35 <o,f0,male> gimme all your money or i'll blow myself
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 222.01 223.53 <o,f0,male> well then blow yourself up
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 224.93 226.52 <o,f0,male> just do it outside please
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 230.44 239.08 <o,f0,male> but the fact is there's good people everywhere that's what i try and show in my stand up there's good people everywhere all it takes in one person to mess it up like a couple months ago in times square in new york
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 246.30 254.91 <o,f0,male> and a few months before that there was a white american guy in austin texas who flew his airplane into the irs building and i happened to be in austin that day
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 256.04 261.23 <o,f0,male> doing a stand up comedy show now i'll tell you as a middle eastern male when you show up around a lot of these activities
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 262.23 264.03 <o,f0,male> you start feeling guilty at one point
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 265.03 266.79 <o,f0,male> i was watching the news i'm like am i involved
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 273.32 275.26 <o,f0,male> i didn't get the memo what's going on
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 277.33 289.55 <o,f0,male> but what was interesting was the pakistani muslim guy see he gives a bad name to muslims and middle easterners and pakistanis from all over the world and one thing that happened there was also the pakistani taliban took credit for that failed car bombing
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 290.40 293.79 <o,f0,male> my question is why would you take credit for a failed car bombing
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 294.77 297.68 <o,f0,male> we just wanted to say we tried
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 302.59 303.88 <o,f0,male> and furthermore
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 305.21 306.23 <o,f0,male> it is the thought that
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 319.61 327.33 <o,f0,male> what happened was when the white guy flew his plane into the building i know all my middle eastern and muslim friends in the states were watching tv going please don't be middle eastern don't
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 329.19 330.86 <o,f0,male> and the name came out jack i'm like
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 334.63 337.42 <o,f0,male> but i kept watching the news in case they came back they were like before he did it he
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 340.69 341.23 <o,f0,male> why
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 343.97 351.88 <o,f0,male> but the fact is i've been lucky to get a chance to perform all over the world and i did a lot of shows in the middle east i just did a seven country solo tour i was in
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 352.35 362.07 <o,f0,male> oman and i was in saudi arabia i was in dubai and it's great there's good people everywhere and you learn great things about these places i encourage people always to go visit these places for example dubai

MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 415.15 423.87 <o,f0,male> the other thing you learn sometimes when you travel to these countries in the middle east sometimes in latin american countries south american countries a lot of times when they build stuff there's no rules and regulations
MazJobrani_2010G 1 MazJobrani_2010G 424.28 431.82 <o,f0,male> for example i took my two year old son to the playground at the dubai mall and i've taken my two year old son to playgrounds all over the united states and when you put your two year old
