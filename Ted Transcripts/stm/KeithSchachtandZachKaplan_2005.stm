KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 12.86 17.96 <o,f0,male> and i lead a research team we investigate materials and technologies that have unexpected properties
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 18.48 27.20 <o,f0,male> over the last three years we found over two hundred of these things and so we looked back into our library and selected six we thought would be most surprising for ted
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 29.67 38.64 <o,f0,male> of these six the first one that we're going to talk about is in the black envelope you're holding it comes from a company in japan called geltech now go
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 44.85 46.75 <o,f0,male> be sure and take the two pieces apart
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 64.99 79.40 <o,f0,male> when we see something unexpected it changes our understanding of the way things work as you're seeing this gel magnet for the first time if you assume that all magnets had to be hard then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding of the way magnets could work
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 81.49 90.97 <o,f0,male> now it's important to understand what the unexpected properties are but to really think about the implications of what this makes possible we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 92.36 105.43 <o,f0,male> so first idea is to use it on cabinet doors if you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material if a cabinet slams shut it wouldn't make a loud noise and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 110.45 117.74 <o,f0,male> this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door in your closet and you could literally stick
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 118.25 121.33 <o,f0,male> shoes up instead of using as shelf for me
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 122.43 123.86 <o,f0,male> i really love this idea
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 126.29 129.82 <o,f0,male> come to my apartment and see my closet i'm sure you'd figure out why it's a
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 142.16 153.01 <o,f0,male> it was like six months ago that keith and i were out in la and we were at starbucks having coffee with roman coppola he works on mostly music videos and commercials with his company the directors bureau
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 153.65 161.82 <o,f0,male> but like as we were talking roman told us that he 's kind of an inventor on the side and we were showing him the same gel magnet that you're holding in your hand and you know we shared the same ideas
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 162.64 170.26 <o,f0,male> and you could see it in his face roman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder he opens it up and keith and i look in
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 180.57 190.45 <o,f0,male> just like whoa this guy 's good because like the way that he presented the concept his approach was totally different than ours he sold it to you
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 190.74 199.33 <o,f0,male> as if it was for sale right now when we were going in the car back to the airport we were thinking like why was this so powerful
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 208.21 218.04 <o,f0,male> so for ted we decided to take our favorite idea for the gel magnet and work with roman and his team at the directors bureau to create a commercial for a product from the future
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 229.78 230.07 <o,f0,female> the
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 249.97 256.82 <o,f0,male> we showed the concept to a few people before this and they asked us when it's coming out so i just wanted to let you know it's not actually coming out just the
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 258.86 266.49 <o,f0,male> so now when we dream up these concepts it's important for us to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint so i just want to quickly explain how this would work
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 279.66 287.16 <o,f0,male> in addition you can see from the diagram on the right the under part of the slide would be an electromagnet so this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you're going down
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 287.33 296.48 <o,f0,male> the force of the water rushing down in addition to that repulsion force would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market it's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system when you
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 296.58 297.77 <o,f0,male> get to the very bottom
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 304.39 309.64 <o,f0,male> so i'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is a metal it's not a magnetic material
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 337.43 338.96 <o,f0,male> i'm not going to get into the physics of it
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 339.37 343.54 <o,f0,male> but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet 's falling the greater the stopping force
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 343.85 348.91 <o,f0,male> next technology is actually a ten foot pole and i have it right here in my pocket
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 371.41 379.49 <o,f0,male> now as we were talking to the vendor to try to learn about how you could apply these or how they're being applied currently he was telling us that in the military
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 379.83 388.36 <o,f0,male> they use this one so soldiers can keep it on their chests very concealed and then when they're out on the field erect it as an antenna to clearly send signals back to the base
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 408.05 413.61 <o,f0,male> so we decided to go out onto the streets of chicago and ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 414.05 418.26 <o,f0,male> my ceiling fans with that and i get the spider webs off my house i do it that way
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 418.82 423.92 <o,f0,female> i'd make my very own walking stick i would create a ladder to use to get up on top of
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 432.00 439.72 <o,f0,female> that when you went deep sea diving you could catch the fish really fast and then roll it back up and you could swim easier
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 444.39 450.65 <o,f0,male> now for our next technology we're going to do a little demonstration and so we need a volunteer from the audience you sir come on up
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 462.17 463.99 <o,f0,male> we need you to stand right in front of the ted sign
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 465.82 467.02 <o,f0,male> and hold onto this
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 485.61 485.74 <o,f0,male> now
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 499.21 501.12 <o,f0,male> right so now if you'll see here
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 503.74 506.13 <o,f0,male> so describe to the audience
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 510.13 519.89 <o,f0,male> now the reason it's cold is that's it's not actually water loaded into these squirt guns it's a dry liquid developed by three m it's perfectly clear it's odorless it's colorless
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 520.63 522.80 <o,f0,male> it's so safe you could drink this
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 526.30 530.24 <o,f0,male> it feels cold is because it evaporates twenty five times faster than water
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 534.82 535.28 <o,f0,male> coming up
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 543.43 543.77 <o,f0,male> a big
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 548.21 555.06 <o,f0,male> the significance of this dry liquid early versions of the fluid were actually used on a cray supercomputer
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 556.04 567.97 <o,f0,male> now the unexpected thing about this is that zach could stand up on stage and drench a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern that we'd damage the electronics that we'd get him wet that we'd hurt the books or the computers
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 568.42 576.36 <o,f0,male> it works because it's non conductive so you can see here you can immerse a whole circuit board in this and it wouldn't cause any damage you can circulate it to draw the heat away
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 595.04 598.89 <o,f0,male> our next technology comes to us from a company in japan called sekisui chemical
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 599.35 603.15 <o,f0,male> one of their r d engineers was working on a way to make plastic stiffer
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 603.84 607.59 <o,f0,male> while he was doing this he noticed an unexpected thing we have a video to show you
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 633.28 634.75 <o,f0,male> you see there it didn't bounce back
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 635.35 643.86 <o,f0,male> this was an unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing it's technically called shape retaining property now think about your interactions with aluminum foil
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 644.28 653.43 <o,f0,male> shape retaining is common in metal you bend a piece of aluminum foil and it holds its place and contrast that with like a plastic garbage can and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 655.30 659.23 <o,f0,male> for example you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist but doesn't use a
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 661.43 674.59 <o,f0,male> taking it a little further if you wove those strips together kind of like a little basket you could make a shape retaining sheet and then you could embed it in a cloth so you could make a picnic table that wraps around the table so that way on a windy day it wouldn't blow away
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 687.52 695.13 <o,f0,male> as this paper is bending the resistance of the ink changes so with simple electronics you can detect how much the page is being bent
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 695.68 697.36 <o,f0,male> now to think about the potential for this
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 697.86 705.90 <o,f0,male> think of all the places ink is supplied on business cards on the back of cereal boxes board games any place you use ink you could change the way you interact with it
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 706.81 720.70 <o,f0,male> so my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book this could totally change the way that you interface with paper you see the dark line on the side and the top as you turn the pages of the book the book can actually detect what page you're on based on the curvature of the pages
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 721.97 728.78 <o,f0,male> in addition if you were to fold in one of the corners then you could program the book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 730.39 736.40 <o,f0,male> for our last technology we worked again with roman and his team at the directors bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 746.72 749.37 <o,f0,male> oh yeah it smells good
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 774.31 777.40 <o,f0,male> now the way it works there's a matrix of color dyes
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 777.98 785.46 <o,f0,male> these dyes change color in response to odors so the smell of vanilla that might change the four on the left brown and the one on the right yellow
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 785.83 797.17 <o,f0,male> so that this matrix can produce thousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells but like in the milk commercial if you know what odor you want to detect then they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 797.82 808.89 <o,f0,male> right it was that started a conversation with professor suslick and myself and he was explaining to me the things that this is making possible beyond just detecting spoiled food is really where the significance of it lies
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 809.42 818.43 <o,f0,male> his company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene and
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 831.07 833.86 <o,f0,male> i mean this is a true story they're using policemen as canaries
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 836.15 843.05 <o,f0,male> but more seriously they determined that you could develop a device that can smell better than the humans and say if it's safe or the firemen
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 844.76 857.57 <o,f0,male> in addition he 's spun off a company from the university called chemsensing where they're working on medical equipment so a patient can come in and actually blow into their device by detecting the odor of particular bacteria or
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 858.70 859.83 <o,f0,male> or even lung cancer
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 860.69 872.79 <o,f0,male> the dots will change and they can use software to analyze the results this can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients currently they're using a method of trial and error but this could tell you precisely what disease you have
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 894.28 901.39 <o,f0,male> this is something that keith and i really enjoy doing i'm sure it's obvious to you now but it was actually yesterday that i was reminded of why
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 901.67 908.91 <o,f0,male> i was having a conversation with steve jurvetson over downstairs by the escalators and he was telling me that when chris sent out that little box
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 909.26 920.22 <o,f0,male> one of the items in it was the hydrophobic sand the sand that doesn't get wet he said that he was playing with it with his son and you know his son was mesmerized because he would dunk it in the water he would take it out and it was bone dry
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 920.91 929.83 <o,f0,male> a few weeks later he said his son was playing with a lock of his mother 's hair and he noticed that there were some drops of water on the hair and he took the thing and he looked up to steve and he said
