MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 19.43 27.54 <o,f0,male> so what i'd like to talk about is something that was very dear to karen 's heart which is how do we discover what is really particular
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 29.17 39.14 <o,f0,male> how do you discover the uniqueness of a project as unique as a person because it seems to me that finding this uniqueness has to do with
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 42.63 44.33 <o,f0,male> dealing with the whole
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 51.65 64.80 <o,f0,male> to finding the uniqueness of place and the uniqueness of a program in a building and so i'll take you to wichita kansas where i was asked some years ago to do a science museum on a site
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 65.28 73.19 <o,f0,male> right downtown by the river and i thought the secret of the site is to make the building of the river
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 73.60 75.72 <o,f0,male> part of the river unfortunately though
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 77.31 86.07 <o,f0,male> separated from the river by mclean 's boulevard so i suggested let 's reroute mclean 's and that gave birth instantly to friends of mclean 's boulevard
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 91.65 93.33 <o,f0,male> and it took six months to
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 94.44 101.95 <o,f0,male> the first image i showed the building committee was this astronomic observatory
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 104.18 109.13 <o,f0,male> in jaipur because i talked about what makes a building
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 110.14 117.16 <o,f0,male> building of science and it seemed to me that this structure complex rich and yet
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 125.65 134.90 <o,f0,male> and so my first sketch after i left was to say let 's cut the channel and make an island and make an island building and i got all excited and came back
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 148.06 156.67 <o,f0,male> and so the process began and they said you can't put it all on an island some of it has to be on the mainland because we don't want to turn our back to the community
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 158.51 164.25 <o,f0,male> there emerged a design the gallery sort of forming an island and you could walk through them or on the roof
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 164.89 176.52 <o,f0,male> and there were all kinds of exciting features you could come in through the landside buildings walk through the galleries into playgrounds there's a landscape if you were cheap you could walk on top of a bridge to the roof
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 177.34 182.94 <o,f0,male> the exhibits and then get totally seduced come back and pay the five dollars admission
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 183.84 195.00 <o,f0,male> and the client was happy well sort of happy because we were four million dollars over the budget but essentially happy but i was still troubled and i was troubled because i felt this was
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 207.07 211.89 <o,f0,male> if i had to fulfill what i talked about a building for science there had to be some kind of a
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 237.89 243.49 <o,f0,male> out of this idea started spinning off many many kinds of variations of different
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 258.56 267.55 <o,f0,male> and when there were complaints about budget i said well it's worth doing the island because you get twice for your money reflections and here 's the building as it
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 269.14 271.47 <o,f0,male> with a channel overlooking downtown
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 273.01 274.77 <o,f0,male> and as seen from downtown
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 275.04 282.46 <o,f0,male> and the bike route 's going right through the building so those traveling the river would see the exhibits and be drawn to the building
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 286.17 292.55 <o,f0,male> the toroidal geometry made for very efficient building every beam in this building is the same radius
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 293.33 296.27 <o,f0,male> all laminated wood every wall every concrete
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 314.88 316.53 <o,f0,male> going back to
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 331.25 339.44 <o,f0,male> which you see here the campus and i was asked to do a building and i was given all the artifacts of clothing and
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 341.89 351.38 <o,f0,male> drawings and i felt very troubled i worked on it for months and i couldn't deal with it because i felt people were coming out of the historic museum they are totally saturated
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 351.75 358.56 <o,f0,male> with information and to see yet another museum with information it would make them just unable to
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 359.23 368.02 <o,f0,male> digest and so i made a counter proposal i said no building there was a cave on the site we tunnel into the hill
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 384.75 385.93 <o,f0,male> flickering in the center
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 386.46 387.76 <o,f0,male> by an arrangement of
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 388.71 395.50 <o,f0,male> reflective glasses it reflects into infinity in all directions you walk through the space
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 397.13 407.71 <o,f0,male> voice reads the names ages and place of birth of the children this voice does not repeat for six months and then you descend to light and to the north and to life
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 408.70 421.45 <o,f0,male> well they said people won 't understand they'll think it's a discotheque you can't do that and they shelved the project and it sat there for ten years and then one day ed spiegel from los angeles who had lost his three year
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 422.49 427.00 <o,f0,male> at auschwitz came saw the model wrote the check and it got built ten years later
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 438.12 443.78 <o,f0,male> i got a call from the foreign ministry saying we've got the chief minister
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 444.86 448.99 <o,f0,male> of the punjab here he is on a state visit we took him on
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 461.59 471.04 <o,f0,male> chief minister badal said to me we sikhs have suffered a great deal as you have jews i was very moved by what i saw
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 471.92 478.92 <o,f0,male> we are going to build our national museum to tell the story of our people we're about to embark on that i'd like you to come and design
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 480.37 488.08 <o,f0,male> and so you know it's one of those things that you don't take too seriously but two weeks later i was in
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 488.64 498.76 <o,f0,male> this little town anandpur sahib outside chandigarh the capital of the punjab and the temple and also next to it the fortress
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 510.45 520.26 <o,f0,male> i got to work and they took me somewhere down there nine kilometers away from the town and the temple and said that's where we have chosen the location and i said
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 520.70 530.49 <o,f0,male> this just doesn't make any sense the pilgrims come here by the hundreds and thousands they're not going to get into trucks and buses and go down there let 's get back to the
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 530.73 539.24 <o,f0,male> town and walk to the site and i recommended they do it right there on that hill and this hill and bridge all the way into the town
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 539.82 546.85 <o,f0,male> and as things are a little easier in india the site was purchased within a week and we were working
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 548.54 552.33 <o,f0,male> and my proposal was to split the museum into two
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 553.88 561.74 <o,f0,male> the permanent exhibits at one end the auditorium library and changing exhibitions on the other to flood the valley into a
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 562.24 574.94 <o,f0,male> series of water gardens and to link it all to the fort and to the downtown and the structures rise from the sand cliffs they're built in concrete and sandstones the roofs are
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 575.64 584.80 <o,f0,male> stainless steel they are facing south and reflecting light towards the temple itself pedestrians criss cross from one side to the other
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 585.08 590.87 <o,f0,male> and as you come from the north it is all masonry growing out of the sand cliffs as you come from
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 608.13 610.38 <o,f0,male> and the bridge was built
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 617.15 618.47 <o,f0,male> within the working drawings
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 620.89 623.70 <o,f0,male> a million people gathered for the celebrations
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 654.66 661.90 <o,f0,male> so much more comprehensive in terms of information and yad vashem needs to deal with three million visitors a year at this point they said
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 662.09 669.79 <o,f0,male> let 's rebuild the museum but of course the sikhs might give you a job on a platter the jews make it hard international competition phase
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 674.43 682.18 <o,f0,male> and again i felt kind of uncomfortable with the notion that a building the size of the washington building
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 683.09 695.36 <o,f0,male> fifty thousand square feet will sit on that fragile hill and that we will go into galleries rooms with doors and sort of familiar rooms to tell the story of the holocaust
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 695.93 704.03 <o,f0,male> and i proposed that we cut through the mountain that was my first sketch just cut the whole museum through the mountain enter from one side of the mountain
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 704.35 710.39 <o,f0,male> come out from the other side of the mountain and then bring light through the mountain into the chambers
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 712.16 719.83 <o,f0,male> here you see the model a reception building and some underground parking you cross a bridge you enter this triangular
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 720.41 724.12 <o,f0,male> room sixty feet high which cuts right into the hill
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 724.65 727.34 <o,f0,male> and extends right through as you go
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 735.78 740.68 <o,f0,male> and at night just one line of light cuts through the mountain which is a skylight on top of that
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 744.03 748.15 <o,f0,male> all the galleries as you move through them and so on
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 748.47 749.36 <o,f0,male> below grade
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 752.31 760.73 <o,f0,male> there are chambers carved in the rock concrete walls stone the natural rock when possible with the light shafts this is actually a spanish
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 761.98 769.61 <o,f0,male> quarry which sort of inspired the kind of spaces that these galleries could be and then coming towards the north
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 770.32 776.54 <o,f0,male> opens up it bursts out of the mountain into again a view of the light and of the city and
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 778.47 779.72 <o,f0,male> jerusalem hills
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 781.90 790.34 <o,f0,male> i'd like to conclude with a project i've been working on for two months it's the headquarters for the institute of peace
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 791.11 799.31 <o,f0,male> in washington the us institute of peace the site chosen is across from the lincoln memorial
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 799.59 809.48 <o,f0,male> you see it there directly on the mall it's the last building on the mall on access of the roosevelt bridge that comes in from virginia that too was a competition
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 811.49 814.46 <o,f0,male> it is something i'm just beginning to work on
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 816.49 828.84 <o,f0,male> but one recognizes the kind of uniqueness of the site if they were to be anywhere in washington they would be an office building a conference center a place for negotiating peace and so on all of which the building is
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 829.38 842.47 <o,f0,male> but by virtue of the choice of putting it on the mall and by the lincoln memorial this becomes the structure that is the symbol of peace on the mall and that was a lot of heat to deal with
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 843.26 850.87 <o,f0,male> the first sketch recognizes that the building is many spaces spaces where research goes on
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 851.26 860.39 <o,f0,male> conference centers a public building because it will be a museum devoted to peace making and these are the drawings that we submitted for the competition
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 860.71 864.43 <o,f0,male> the plans showing the spaces which radiate outwards from the entry
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 865.57 872.20 <o,f0,male> you see the structure as in the sequence of structures on the mall very transparent and inviting and looking in
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 874.05 877.92 <o,f0,male> and then as you enter it again looking in all directions towards the city
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 878.81 886.22 <o,f0,male> and what i felt about that building is that it really was a building that had to do with a lightness of being
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 898.87 900.72 <o,f0,male> this is where it is it's sort of
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 901.51 909.29 <o,f0,male> evolving studies for the structure of the roof which demands maybe new materials
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 909.45 915.84 <o,f0,male> how to make white how to make it translucent how to make it glowing how to make it not capricious
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 919.13 932.69 <o,f0,male> here studying in three dimensions how to give some kind again of an order a structure not something you feel you could just change because you stop the design of that particular process
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 938.05 939.09 <o,f0,male> and so it goes
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 943.27 945.16 <o,f0,male> i'd like to conclude by saying something
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 953.15 961.72 <o,f0,male> i'd like to conclude by relating all of what i've said to the term beauty and i know it is not a fashionable term these
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 962.66 973.88 <o,f0,male> and certainly not fashionable in the discourse of architectural schools but it seems to me that all this in one way or the other is a search for beauty beauty in the most profound
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 974.62 977.58 <o,f0,male> of fit i have a quote that
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 984.59 997.53 <o,f0,male> theodore cook who said beauty connotes humanity we call a natural object beautiful because we see that its form expresses fitness the perfect fulfillment of function
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 998.05 1006.03 <o,f0,male> well i would have said the perfect fulfillment of purpose nevertheless beauty as the kind of fit something that tells us
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 1006.26 1012.73 <o,f0,male> that all the forces that have to do with our natural environment have been fulfilled and our human environment
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 1014.28 1023.38 <o,f0,male> twenty years ago in a conference richard and i were at together i wrote a poem which seems to me to still hold for me
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 1024.74 1034.62 <o,f0,male> he who seeks truth shall find beauty he who seeks beauty shall find vanity he who seeks order shall find gratification
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 1041.27 1052.89 <o,f0,male> the servant of his fellow beings shall find the joy of self expression he who seeks self expression shall fall into the pit of arrogance arrogance is incompatible with nature
MosheSafdie_2002 1 MosheSafdie_2002 1053.40 1055.77 <o,f0,male> through nature the nature of the universe and the nature of
