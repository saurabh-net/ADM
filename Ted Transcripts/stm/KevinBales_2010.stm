KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 16.16 16.85 <o,f0,male> you know for me
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 24.58 28.60 <o,f0,male> and i was at a public event and i saw this leaflet and it said
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 29.40 33.12 <o,f0,male> there are millions of slaves in the world today and i thought
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 39.29 42.45 <o,f0,male> because i also i'm going to admit to you i also thought
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 42.76 49.44 <o,f0,male> how can i be like a hot shot young full professor who teaches human rights and not know this so it can't be true
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 50.24 56.15 <o,f0,male> well if you teach if you worship in the temple of learning do not mock the gods
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 56.77 62.46 <o,f0,male> because they will take you fill you with curiosity and desire and drive you
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 64.00 66.47 <o,f0,male> you with a passion to change things
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 67.75 74.89 <o,f0,male> i went out and did a lit review three thousand articles on the key word slavery two turned out to be about contemporary only
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 75.96 85.14 <o,f0,male> all the rest were historical they were press pieces and they were full of outrage they were full of speculation they were anecdotal no solid information
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 85.57 93.14 <o,f0,male> so i began to do a research project of my own i went to five countries around the world i looked at slaves i met slaveholders
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 93.37 100.96 <o,f0,male> and i looked very deeply into slave based businesses because this is an economic crime people do not
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 103.43 105.37 <o,f0,male> to be mean to them they do it to make a profit
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 109.86 113.32 <o,f0,male> four different continents was depressingly familiar
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 120.46 123.35 <o,f0,male> showing us how they were
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 125.53 126.75 <o,f0,male> and met up with our film
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 128.77 129.92 <o,f0,male> it was mind blowing
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 132.41 133.70 <o,f0,male> and i want to be very clear
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 134.26 143.34 <o,f0,male> i'm talking about real slavery this is not about lousy marriages this is not about jobs that suck this is about people who can not walk away
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 153.35 158.84 <o,f0,male> it's real slavery in exactly the same way that slavery would be recognized throughout all of human history
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 160.35 162.19 <o,f0,male> now where is it well
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 162.77 176.53 <o,f0,male> this map in the sort of redder yellower colors are the places with the highest densities of slavery but in fact that kind of bluey color are the countries where we can't find any cases of slavery and you might notice that it's only iceland and greenland
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 176.90 186.43 <o,f0,male> where we can't find any cases of enslavement around the world we're also particularly interested and looking very carefully at places where
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 188.41 192.87 <o,f0,male> slaves are being used to perpetrate extreme environmental destruction
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 194.25 199.51 <o,f0,male> around the world slaves are used to destroy the environment cutting down trees in the amazon destroying
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 210.94 217.04 <o,f0,male> it's a pretty harrowing linkage between what's happening to our environment and what's happening to our human rights
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 225.51 227.69 <o,f0,male> that's double the number that came out of
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 228.19 230.59 <o,f0,male> africa in the entire transatlantic slave
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 231.87 242.52 <o,f0,male> well it builds up with these factors they are not causal they are actually supporting factors one is we all know about the population explosion the world goes from two billion people to almost seven billion people in the last
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 244.55 246.57 <o,f0,male> being numerous does not make you a slave
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 248.02 252.48 <o,f0,male> the increased vulnerability of very large numbers of people in the developing world
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 253.48 263.32 <o,f0,male> caused by civil wars ethnic conflicts kleptocratic governments disease you name it you know it we understand how that works in some countries all of those things happen at once
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 263.73 265.37 <o,f0,male> like sierra leone a few years ago
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 265.90 274.85 <o,f0,male> and push enormous parts about a billion people in the world in fact as we know live on the edge live in situations where they don't have
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 276.38 280.85 <o,f0,male> any opportunity and are usually even destitute but that doesn't make you a slave either
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 281.58 285.45 <o,f0,male> what it takes to turn a person who is destitute and vulnerable into a slave
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 285.99 287.98 <o,f0,male> is the absence of the rule of law
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 288.77 292.69 <o,f0,male> if the rule of law is sound it protects the poor and it protects the vulnerable
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 293.04 306.61 <o,f0,male> but if corruption creeps in and people don't have the opportunity to have that protection of the rule of law then if you can use violence if you can use violence with impunity you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable into slavery
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 307.95 310.28 <o,f0,male> well that is precisely what has happened around the world
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 316.11 323.78 <o,f0,male> the way they come into slavery today the people who step into slavery today don't usually get kidnapped or knocked over the head
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 324.51 328.03 <o,f0,male> they come into slavery because someone has asked them this question
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 353.35 358.46 <o,f0,male> i knew i had to do anything i could to earn some money to support the people i care
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 359.26 362.66 <o,f0,male> they climb into the back of the truck they go off with the person who recruits them
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 363.18 365.78 <o,f0,male> ten miles one hundred miles one thousand miles later
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 366.27 369.04 <o,f0,male> they find themselves in dirty dangerous demeaning work
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 374.35 376.79 <o,f0,male> the hammer comes down and they discover
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 380.67 391.05 <o,f0,male> that kind of slavery is again pretty much what slavery has been all through human history but there is one thing that is particularly remarkable and novel about slavery today
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 392.10 395.06 <o,f0,male> and that is a complete collapse
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 395.63 397.00 <o,f0,male> the price of human beings
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 401.69 406.39 <o,f0,male> even the business programs have started picking up on this i just want to share a little clip for
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 407.50 418.20 <o,f0,female> okay lively discussion guaranteed here as always as we get macro and talk commodities continuing here in the studio with our guest michael o 'donohue head of commodities at four continents capital management
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 430.77 440.84 <o,f0,male> well daphne we've been going short on gas and oil recently and casting our net just a little bit wider we really like the human being story a lot if you look at a long term chart
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 479.72 489.23 <o,f0,male> we're recommending to our clients a buy and hold strategy there is no need to play the market there is a lot of vulnerable people out there it's very exciting
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 494.20 495.20 <o,f0,male> figured it out that's a
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 496.26 500.10 <o,f0,male> i enjoyed watching your jaws drop drop drop
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 500.30 509.44 <o,f0,male> until you got it mtv europe worked with us and made that spoof and they've been slipping it in between music videos without any introduction which i think is kind of fun
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 516.67 528.35 <o,f0,male> thousand capital purchase items you can see that the lines cross when the population explodes the average price of a human being today around the world is about dollar ninety
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 542.43 544.33 <o,f0,male> key here is that
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 551.24 553.48 <o,f0,male> you use them you crumple them up
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 557.04 559.11 <o,f0,male> these young boys are in nepal
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 559.98 572.40 <o,f0,male> they are basically the transport system on a quarry run by a slaveholder there are no roads there so they carry loads of stone on their backs often of their own weight up and down the himalayan mountains
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 579.65 593.25 <o,f0,male> it's a horrible situation and if there is anything that makes me feel very positive about this it's that there are also in addition to young men like this who are still enslaved there are ex slaves who are now working to free others
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 593.64 608.02 <o,f0,male> or we say frederick douglass is in the house i don't know if you've ever had a daydream about wow what would it be like to meet harriet tubman what would it be like to meet frederick douglass i've got to say one of the most exciting parts about my job is that i get to
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 608.43 619.75 <o,f0,male> and i want to introduce you to one of those his name is james kofi annan he was a slave child in ghana enslaved in the fishing industry and he now after escape and building a new life has
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 620.16 627.34 <o,f0,male> an organization that we work closely with to go back and get people out of slavery this is not james this is one of the kids that he works with
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 630.70 632.81 <o,f0,male> and this reminds me of
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 636.19 637.54 <o,f0,male> james and our
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 660.51 666.17 <o,f0,male> a very positive side to this and that is this the twenty seven million people who are in slavery today
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 672.99 684.50 <o,f0,male> and likewise the forty billion dollars that they generate into the global economy each year is the tiniest proportion of the global economy to ever be represented by slave labor
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 685.55 690.49 <o,f0,male> slavery illegal in every country has been pushed to the edges of our
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 693.60 699.42 <o,f0,male> in a way without us even noticing has ended up standing on the precipice of its own extinction
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 700.01 701.51 <o,f0,male> waiting for us to give it a big
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 702.85 704.43 <o,f0,male> and knock it over and get rid of it
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 706.78 709.99 <o,f0,male> if we do that if we put the resources and the focus to it
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 714.85 718.31 <o,f0,male> first before i even tell you the cost i've got to be absolutely clear
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 718.80 721.97 <o,f0,male> we do not buy people out of slavery
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 747.13 750.53 <o,f0,male> amazingly in places like india where costs are very low
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 789.84 791.59 <o,f0,male> live in those places where
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 793.70 797.06 <o,f0,male> and in fact the global average is about what it is for
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 799.61 802.01 <o,f0,male> and that means when you multiply it up
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 814.49 817.08 <o,f0,male> what americans spend on potato chips and pretzels
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 821.27 824.45 <o,f0,male> usually the annual expenditure in this country on blue jeans
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 831.88 833.24 <o,f0,male> ten point eight billion dollars
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 834.04 836.84 <o,f0,male> intel 's fourth quarter earnings ten point eight billion
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 837.39 851.63 <o,f0,male> it's not a lot of money at the global level in fact it's peanuts and the great thing about it is that it's not money down a hole there is a freedom dividend when you let people out of slavery to work for themselves are they motivated
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 852.38 859.75 <o,f0,male> they take their kids out of the workplace they build a school they say we 're gonna have stuff we've never had before like three squares
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 863.57 869.23 <o,f0,male> they become consumers and producers and local economies begin to spiral up very rapidly
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 881.86 885.18 <o,f0,male> four million people were lifted up out of slavery and
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 887.29 890.97 <o,f0,male> dumped without political participation decent education
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 906.58 916.29 <o,f0,male> we have made a commitment that we will never let people come out of slavery on our watch and end up as second class citizens it's just not going
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 918.15 918.66 <o,f0,male> this is
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 947.73 949.49 <o,f0,male> a village in nepal
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 949.99 951.43 <o,f0,male> been working there about a month
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 952.86 956.21 <o,f0,male> they had just begun to come out of a hereditary kind of slavery
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 957.10 963.40 <o,f0,male> just begun to light up a little bit open up a little bit but when we went to speak with her when we took this photograph
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 964.08 970.27 <o,f0,male> the slaveholders were still menacing us from the sidelines they hadn't been really pushed back
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 971.02 972.68 <o,f0,male> i was frightened we were frightened
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 973.40 977.74 <o,f0,male> we said to her are you worried are you upset she said no
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 978.65 979.88 <o,f0,male> because we've got hope now
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 983.41 984.36 <o,f0,male> succeed she said
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 984.98 989.73 <o,f0,male> when people like you from the other side of the world are coming here to stand beside us
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 993.01 994.34 <o,f0,male> we have to ask ourselves
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 995.52 997.63 <o,f0,male> are we willing to live in a world with slavery
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 1011.03 1021.70 <o,f0,male> if there is one thing that every human being can agree on i think it's that slavery should end and if there is a fundamental violation of our human dignity
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 1028.86 1037.70 <o,f0,male> got to say what good is all of our intellectual and political and economic power and i'm really thinking intellectual power in this room
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 1038.40 1040.41 <o,f0,male> if we can't use it to bring slavery to
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 1045.87 1047.95 <o,f0,male> and you know what if we can't do that
KevinBales_2010 1 KevinBales_2010 1056.83 1058.18 <o,f0,male> okay thank you so much
