BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 16.41 27.73 <o,f0,male> i'm going to read a few strips these are most of these are from a monthly page i do in and architecture and design magazine
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 28.06 42.01 <o,f0,male> called metropolis and the first story is called the faulty switch another beautifully designed new building ruined by the sound of a common wall light switch
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 42.53 53.47 <o,f0,male> it's fine during the day when the main rooms are flooded with sunlight but at dusk everything changes the
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 54.69 59.94 <o,f0,male> hundreds of hours designing the burnished brass switchplates
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 60.21 70.56 <o,f0,male> for his new office tower and then left it to a contractor to install these seventy nine cent switches behind them we know
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 71.49 83.36 <o,f0,male> where to reach when we enter a dark room we automatically throw the little nub of plastic upward but the sound we are greeted with as the room is bathed
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 83.60 94.35 <o,f0,male> in the simulated glow of late afternoon light recalls to mind a dirty men 's room in the rear of a greek coffee shop
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 96.43 107.37 <o,f0,male> this sound colors our first impression of any room it can't be helped but where does this sound commonly described as a click
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 107.76 113.91 <o,f0,male> come from is is simply the byproduct of a crude mechanical action
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 114.10 126.90 <o,f0,male> or is it an imitation of one half a set of sounds we make to express disappointment the often dedental consonant of no indo european language
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 127.42 133.82 <o,f0,male> or is it the amplified sound of a synapse firing in the brain of a cockroach
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 134.99 142.81 <o,f0,male> in the nineteen fifties they tried their best to muffle this sound with mercury switches
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 143.07 150.72 <o,f0,male> and silent knob controls but today these improvements seem somehow inauthentic
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 151.51 162.32 <o,f0,male> the click is the modern triumphal clarion proceeding us through life announcing our entry into every lightless room
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 162.72 169.79 <o,f0,male> the sound made flicking a wall switch off is of a completely different nature
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 170.07 179.54 <o,f0,male> it has a deep melancholy ring children don't like it it's why they leave lights on around the house
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 180.49 194.96 <o,f0,male> adults find it comforting but wouldn't it be an easy matter to wire a wall switch so that it triggers the muted horn of a steam ship or the recorded crowing of a rooster

BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 201.27 211.34 <o,f0,male> edison went through thousands of unlikely substances before he came upon the right one for the filament of his electric lightbulb
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 212.48 218.90 <o,f0,male> why have we settled so quickly for the sound of its switch that's the end
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 225.68 239.51 <o,f0,male> praise of the taxpayer that so many of the city 's most venerable taxpayers have survived yet another commercial building boom is cause for celebration
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 239.98 253.75 <o,f0,male> these one or two story structures designed to yield only enough income to cover the taxes on the land on which they stand were not meant to be permanent buildings
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 254.52 266.52 <o,f0,male> yet for one reason or another they have confounded the efforts of developers to be combined into lots suitable for high rise construction
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 267.48 275.01 <o,f0,male> although they make no claim to architectural beauty they are in their perfect temporariness
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 275.29 283.31 <o,f0,male> a delightful alternative to the large scale structures that might someday take their place
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 283.99 289.12 <o,f0,male> the most perfect examples occupy corner lots
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 289.42 300.17 <o,f0,male> they offer a pleasant respite from the high density development around them a break of light and air an architectural biding of time
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 300.89 313.44 <o,f0,male> so buried in signage are these structures that it often takes a moment to distinguish the modern specially constructed taxpayer from its neighbor
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 313.94 326.95 <o,f0,male> the small commercial building from an earlier century whose upper floors have been sealed and whose groundfloor space now functions as a taxpayer
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 327.20 338.13 <o,f0,male> the few surfaces not covered by signs are often clad in a distinctive dark green gray striated aluminum siding

BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 346.96 357.03 <o,f0,male> now these provisional structures have in some cases remained standing for the better part of a human lifetime
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 357.76 368.17 <o,f0,male> the temporary building is a triumph of modern industrial organization a healthy sublimation of the urge to build
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 368.98 377.13 <o,f0,male> and proof that not every architectural idea need be set in stone that's the end
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 386.31 396.37 <o,f0,male> the lap was a platform upon which to place the earthly possessions of the dead thirty cubits from foot to knee
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 396.72 409.12 <o,f0,male> it was not until the fourteenth century that an italian painter recognized the lap as a grecian temple upholstered in flesh and cloth
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 409.83 421.60 <o,f0,male> over the next two hundred years we see the infant christ go from a sitting to a standing position on the virgin 's lap and then back again
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 422.24 432.69 <o,f0,male> every child recapitulates this ascension straddling one or both legs sitting sideways or leaning against the body
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 433.40 443.03 <o,f0,male> from there to the modern ventriloquist 's dummy is but a brief moment in history you were late for school again this morning
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 443.55 455.20 <o,f0,male> the ventriloquist must first make us believe that a small boy is sitting on his lap the illusion of speech follows incidentally
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 455.71 464.40 <o,f0,male> what have you got to say for yourself jimmy as adults we admire the lap from a nostalgic distance
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 465.33 475.90 <o,f0,male> we have fading memories of that provisional temple erected each time an adult sat down on a crowded bus there was always a
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 476.27 476.91 <o,f0,male> to sit
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 479.55 486.72 <o,f0,male> children and teenage girls who are most keenly aware of its architectural beauty
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 487.46 499.93 <o,f0,male> they understand the structural integrity of a deep avuncular lap as compared to the shaky arangement of a neurotic niece in high heels
BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 501.70 514.66 <o,f0,male> the relationship between the lap and its owner is direct and intimate i envision a thirty six story four hundred and fifty unit residential high

BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 529.17 542.02 <o,f0,male> the lap of luxury is an architectural construct of childhood which we seek in vain as adults to employ that's the end

BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 579.97 589.18 <o,f0,male> do you remember wandering as a child through those dark wooden storefront galleries where everything was displayed

BenKatchor_2002 1 BenKatchor_2002 645.91 657.55 <o,f0,male> the rest of the collection remains here stored in plain brown paper bags until funds can be raised to build a permanent museum
