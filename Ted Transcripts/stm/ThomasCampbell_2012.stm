ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 16.37 20.52 <o,f0,male> considering a career in the art world
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 20.62 22.95 <o,f0,male> i took a course in london
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 23.44 29.19 <o,f0,male> and one of my supervisors was this irascible italian called pietro
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 29.8 32.15 <o,f0,male> who drank too much
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 37.05 39.64 <o,f0,male> but he was a passionate teacher
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 40.37 48.28 <o,f0,male> and i remember one of our earlier classes with him he was projecting images on the wall asking us to think about them
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 48.94 51.44 <o,f0,male> and he put up an image of a painting
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 65.19 66.86 <o,f0,male> and he said what is this
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 82.37 83.98 <o,f0,male> he said it 's a what
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 85.08 87.99 <o,f0,male> i said it 's a bacchanal by titian
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 96.89 108.57 <o,f0,male> as i said he swore too much there was an important lesson for me in that pietro was suspicious of formal art training art history training
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 108.85 113.64 <o,f0,male> because he feared that it filled people up with jargon
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 113.75 118.69 <o,f0,male> and then they just classified things rather than looking at them
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 119.09 123.75 <o,f0,male> and he wanted to remind us that all art was once contemporary
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 124 126.62 <o,f0,male> and he wanted us to use our eyes
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 127.04 132.84 <o,f0,male> and he was especially evangelical about this message because he was losing his sight
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 133.12 142.51 <o,f0,male> he wanted us to look and ask basic questions of objects what is it how is it made why was it made how is it used
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 143.58 148.32 <o,f0,male> and these were important lessons to me when i subsequently became a professional art historian
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 149.39 153.77 <o,f0,male> my kind of eureka moment came a few years later
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 153.92 158.77 <o,f0,male> when i was studying the art of the courts of northern europe
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 159.25 167.98 <o,f0,male> and of course it was very much discussed in terms of the paintings and the sculptures and the architecture of the day
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 168.63 177.97 <o,f0,male> but as i began to read historical documents and contemporary descriptions i found there was a kind of a missing component
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 178.6 182.58 <o,f0,male> for everywhere i came across descriptions of tapestries
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 183.44 185.84 <o,f0,male> tapestries were ubiquitous
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 185.92 190.14 <o,f0,male> between the middle ages and really well into the eighteenth century
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 190.3 192.41 <o,f0,male> and it was pretty apparent why
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 192.79 194.45 <o,f0,male> tapestries were portable
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 194.59 197.29 <o,f0,male> you could roll them up send them ahead of you
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 197.44 205.36 <o,f0,male> and in the time it took to hang them up you could transform a cold dank interior into a richly colored setting
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 206.51 216.98 <o,f0,male> tapestries effectively provided a vast canvas on which the patrons of the day could depict the heroes with whom they wanted to be associated
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 217.39 219.08 <o,f0,male> or even themselves
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 219.59 221.51 <o,f0,male> and in addition to that
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 225.01 231.16 <o,f0,male> they required scores of highly skilled weavers working over extended periods of time
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 231.43 237.36 <o,f0,male> with very expensive materials the wools the silks even gold and silver thread
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 238.58 244.86 <o,f0,male> so all in all in an age when the visual image of any kind was rare
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 245.36 248.75 <o,f0,male> tapestries were an incredibly potent
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 248.75 250.42 <o,f0,male> form of propaganda
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 260.94 272.08 <o,f0,male> because i saw the met as one of the few places where i could organize really big exhibitions about the subject i cared so passionately about
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 277.44 282.51 <o,f0,male> gave me the go ahead to organize an exhibition for two thousand and two
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 282.62 285.54 <o,f0,male> we normally have these very long lead in times
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 286.53 291.38 <o,f0,male> it wasn 't straightforward it 's no longer a question of chucking a tapestry
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 296.91 300.31 <o,f0,male> shipped in oversized freighters
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 300.71 306.81 <o,f0,male> some of them are so big we had to get them into the museum we had to take them up the great steps at the front
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 308.88 315.5 <o,f0,male> we thought very hard about how to present this unknown subject to a modern audience
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 315.98 321.28 <o,f0,male> the dark colors to set off the colors that remained in objects that were often faded
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 322.12 326.1 <o,f0,male> the placing of lights to bring out the silk and the gold thread
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 335.53 338.32 <o,f0,male> these were big complex things
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 350.03 356.71 <o,f0,male> there was a lot of skepticism on the opening night i overheard one of the senior members of staff saying
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 357.38 359.39 <o,f0,male> this is going to be a bomb
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 364.44 366.7 <o,f0,male> hundreds of thousands of people
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 366.75 368.55 <o,f0,male> came to see the show
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 369.81 377.39 <o,f0,male> the exhibition was designed to be an experience and tapestries are hard to reproduce in photographs
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 377.93 385.99 <o,f0,male> so i want you to use your imaginations thinking of these wall high objects some of them ten meters wide
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 386.34 395.51 <o,f0,male> depicting lavish court scenes with courtiers and dandies who would look quite at home in the pages of the fashion press today
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 396.01 402.31 <o,f0,male> thick woods with hunters crashing through the undergrowth in pursuit of wild boars and deer
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 403.04 407.73 <o,f0,male> violent battles with scenes of fear and heroism
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 408.91 414.66 <o,f0,male> i remember taking my son 's school class he was eight at the time and all the little boys
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 421.63 434.29 <o,f0,male> there was a dog pooping in the foreground laughter kind of an in your face joke by the artist and you can just imagine them but it brought it alive to them i think they suddenly
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 451.38 458.38 <o,f0,male> through this experience that could only be created in a museum i 'd opened up the eyes of my audience
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 458.74 465.17 <o,f0,male> historians artists press the general public to the beauty of this lost medium
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 467.01 471.84 <o,f0,male> a few years later i was invited to be the director of the museum
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 472.33 474.21 <o,f0,male> and after i got over that
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 474.89 476.9 <o,f0,male> who me the tapestry geek
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 477.16 488.12 <o,f0,male> i don 't wear a tie i realized the fact i believe passionately in that curated museum experience
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 488.15 495.37 <o,f0,male> we live in an age of ubiquitous information and sort of just add water expertise
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 495.56 501.55 <o,f0,male> but there 's nothing that compares with the presentation of significant objects
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 501.55 518.49 <o,f0,male> in a well told narrative what the curator does the interpretation of a complex esoteric subject in a way that retains the integrity of the subject that makes it unpacks it for a general audience
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 518.7 526.74 <o,f0,male> and that to me today is now the challenge and the fun of my job supporting the vision of my curators
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 526.81 538.74 <o,f0,male> whether it 's an exhibition of samurai swords early byzantine artifacts renaissance portraits or the show we heard mentioned earlier
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 544.79 550.95 <o,f0,male> that was an interesting case in the late spring early summer of two thousand and ten
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 551.14 554.59 <o,f0,male> shortly after mcqueen 's suicide
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 593.33 598.09 <o,f0,male> and we proceeded to do something at the museum i think we 've never done before
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 598.12 601.14 <o,f0,male> it wasn 't just your standard installation
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 601.35 612.95 <o,f0,male> in fact we ripped down the galleries to recreate entirely different settings a recreation of his first studio a hall of mirrors
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 613.46 615.34 <o,f0,male> a curiosity box
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 616.54 626.26 <o,f0,male> a sunken ship a burned out interior with videos and soundtracks that ranged from operatic arias to pigs fornicating
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 627.49 631.66 <o,f0,male> and in this extraordinary setting the costumes
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 636.8 639.15 <o,f0,male> it could have been a train wreck
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 639.2 640.71 <o,f0,male> it could have looked like
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 641.18 644.86 <o,f0,male> shop windows on fifth avenue at christmas
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 645.04 649.49 <o,f0,male> but because of the way that andrew connected with the mcqueen team
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 649.64 666.19 <o,f0,male> he was channeling the rawness and the brilliance of mcqueen and the show was quite transcendant and it became a phenomenon in its own right by the end of the show we had people queuing for four or five hours to get into the show
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 676.31 687.53 <o,f0,male> now i 've described two very immersive exhibitions but i also believe that collections individual objects can also have that same power
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 688.03 696.1 <o,f0,male> the met was set up not as a museum of american art but of an encyclopedic museum
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 696.23 698.69 <o,f0,male> today one hundred and forty years later
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 698.81 702.5 <o,f0,male> that vision is as prescient as ever
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 702.6 711.96 <o,f0,male> because of course we live in a world of crisis of challenge and we 're exposed to it through the twenty four seven newsreels
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 712.25 714.23 <o,f0,male> it 's in our galleries
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 714.36 723.29 <o,f0,male> that we can unpack the civilizations the cultures that we 're seeing the current manifestation of whether it 's libya
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 723.51 725.6 <o,f0,male> egypt syria
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 725.78 733.54 <o,f0,male> it 's in our galleries that we can explain and give greater understanding i mean our new islamic galleries are a case in point
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 733.81 738.72 <o,f0,male> opened ten years almost to the week after nine eleven
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 739.49 741.42 <o,f0,male> i think for most americans
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 741.52 748.48 <o,f0,male> knowledge of the islamic world was pretty slight before nine eleven and then it was thrust upon us
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 748.88 756.7 <o,f0,male> in one of america 's darkest hours and the perception was through the polarization of that terrible event
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 757.69 763.39 <o,f0,male> now in our galleries we show fourteen centuries of the development
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 763.55 765.37 <o,f0,male> of different islamic
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 765.38 768.79 <o,f0,male> cultures across a vast geographic spread
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 769.5 777.41 <o,f0,male> and again hundreds of thousands of people have come to see these galleries since they opened last october
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 783.14 785.11 <o,f0,male> replacing the museum
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 785.25 790.95 <o,f0,male> and i think those numbers are a resounding rejection of that notion
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 791.15 795.58 <o,f0,male> i mean don 't get me wrong i 'm a huge advocate of the web
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 796.2 800.65 <o,f0,male> it gives us a way of reaching out to audiences around the globe
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 801.12 810.24 <o,f0,male> but nothing replaces the authenticity of the object presented with passionate scholarship
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 811.99 815.49 <o,f0,male> bringing people face to face with our objects
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 815.8 819.29 <o,f0,male> is a way of bringing them face to face with people
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 819.95 825.68 <o,f0,male> across time across space whose lives may have been very different to our own
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 830.82 834.78 <o,f0,male> frustrations and achievements in their lives
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 834.91 839.75 <o,f0,male> and i think this is a process that helps us better understand ourselves
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 840.15 843.88 <o,f0,male> helps us make better decisions about where we 're going
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 846 851.21 <o,f0,male> the great hall at the met is one of the great portals of the world
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 855.19 857.55 <o,f0,male> from there you can walk in any direction
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 858.06 859.98 <o,f0,male> to almost any culture
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 860.95 865.61 <o,f0,male> i frequently go out into the hall and the galleries and i watch our visitors coming in
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 872.94 877.43 <o,f0,male> others are very uneasy it 's an intimidating place
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 877.58 880.48 <o,f0,male> they feel that the institution is elitist
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 886.83 891.65 <o,f0,male> i want to put people in a contemplative frame of mind where
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 892.21 893.89 <o,f0,male> they 're prepared to be
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 894.1 896.5 <o,f0,male> a little bit lost to explore
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 897.53 900.37 <o,f0,male> to see the unfamiliar in the familiar
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 905.1 908.02 <o,f0,male> because for us it 's all about bringing them
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 912.9 916.46 <o,f0,male> capturing them at that moment of discomfort
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 917.68 921.81 <o,f0,male> when the inclination is kind of to reach for your iphone your blackberry
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 923.09 927.67 <o,f0,male> but to create a zone where their curiosity
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 936.68 940.14 <o,f0,male> or a dog pooping in the corner of a tapestry
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 940.89 944.03 <o,f0,male> or to bring it back to my tutor pietro
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 944.52 949.28 <o,f0,male> those dancing figures who are indeed knocking back the wine
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 949.66 952.5 <o,f0,male> and that nude figure in the left foreground
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 957.12 959.29 <o,f0,male> of youthful sexuality
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 961.86 963.65 <o,f0,male> in that moment
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 964.24 966.78 <o,f0,male> our scholarship can tell you
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 967.4 969.24 <o,f0,male> that this is a bacchanal
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 970.69 972.7 <o,f0,male> but if we 're doing our job right
ThomasCampbell_2012 1 ThomasCampbell_2012 973.38 976.3 <o,f0,male> and you 've checked the jargon at the front door
