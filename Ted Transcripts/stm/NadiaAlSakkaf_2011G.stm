NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 1 NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 106.58 110.09 <o,f0,female> to tell the world and each other about what 's going on
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 1 NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 110.09 120.3 <o,f0,female> obviously there 's always the dark side of it and this is just one of the less gruesome pictures of the revolution and the cost that we have to pay
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 1 NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 120.3 131.68 <o,f0,female> the solidarity of millions of yemenis across the country just demanding the one thing and finally lots of people are saying that yemen 's revolution is going to break the country

NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 1 NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 156.06 161.34 <o,f0,female> characterizations so let 's talk about the personal story for a moment
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 1 NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 198.68 205.32 <o,f0,female> but there 's so much potential i wish i could show you my yemen i wish you could see
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 1 NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 224.54 234.13 <o,f0,female> and even my mother i owe it to my family a story i studied in india and in my third year i started becoming confused
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 1 NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 234.13 250.11 <o,f0,female> because i was yemeni but i was also mixing up with a lot of my friends in college and i went back home and i said daddy i don 't know who i am i 'm not a yemeni i 'm not an indian and he said you are the bridge and
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 1 NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 304.72 307.31 <o,f0,female> a woman 's got to do what a woman 's got to do
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 1 NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 373.39 380.03 <o,f0,female> but in assuming this responsibility and going about it as you have you have become a bridge between
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 1 NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 380.03 398.06 <o,f0,female> an older and traditional society and the one that you are now creating at the paper and so along with changing who worked there you must have come up against another positioning that we always run into in particular with women and it has to do with outside image
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 1 NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 398.06 406.31 <o,f0,female> dress the veiled woman so how have you dealt with this on a personal level as well as the women who worked for you
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 1 NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 436.98 448.79 <o,f0,female> and the more empowered the women become the more they are able to remove the veil for example or to drive their own car or to have a job or to be able to travel so
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 1 NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 477.58 496.04 <o,f0,female> and so on it 's just a movement and i am a role model in yemen a lot of people look up to me a lot of young girls look up to me and i need to prove to them that yes you can still be married you can still be a mother and you can still be respected within the society but at the same time that doesn 't mean you should just be one of the crowd
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 1 NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 496.05 498.91 <o,f0,female> you can be yourself and have your face
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 1 NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 528 546.43 <o,f0,female> tell that to the people in charge they think that if there 's anything against them then we are being an opposition newspaper and very very difficult times some of my reporters were arrested we had some court cases my father was assassinated
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 1 NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 562.66 575.16 <o,f0,female> and it 's very important to listen to our voice and this is probably something i 'm going to share with you in western media probably and how
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 1 NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 575.32 592.58 <o,f0,female> there 's a lot of stereotypes thinking of yemen in one single frame this is what yemen is all about and that 's not fair it 's not fair for me it 's not fair for my country a lot of reporters come to yemen and they want to write a story on al qaeda or terrorism
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 1 NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 655.42 671.55 <o,f0,female> certainly when we look at the ways in which we have separated ourselves from others and we 've created fear and danger often from lack of knowledge lack of real understanding how do you see the way that
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 1 NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 671.55 678.46 <o,f0,female> western press in particular is covering this and all other stories out of the region but in particular in your country
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 1 NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 700.47 711.01 <o,f0,female> think that you 've done your homework and a story so i wish that the world would know my yemen my country my people
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 1 NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G 776.18 778.45 <o,f0,female> you yourself and what you do
