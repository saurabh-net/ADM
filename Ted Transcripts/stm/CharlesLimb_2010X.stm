CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 16.25 23.88 <o,f0,male> so i am a surgeon who studies creativity and i have never had a patient tell me that i really want you to be creative during surgery
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 24.43 29.50 <o,f0,male> and so i guess there's a little bit of irony to it i will say though that after having done surgery
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 59.02 71.02 <o,f0,male> start off by playing a video for you and this video is a video of keith jarrett who 's a well know jazz improviser and probably the most well known iconic example of someone who takes improvisation to a really higher level and he'll improvise entire concerts
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 71.30 79.68 <o,f0,male> off the top of his head and he'll never play it exactly the same way again and so as a form of intense creativity i think this is a great example and so why don't we go and click the video
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 141.49 149.45 <o,f0,male> just as a listener as just a fan i listen to that and i'm just astounded i think how can this possibly be how can the brain generate that much information that much music
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 181.24 189.48 <o,f0,male> very dense and when you go through them it's very hard to recognize the music in it in fact they seem to be very unmusical entirely and to miss the whole point of the music
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 197.19 207.20 <o,f0,male> but i will say that from a scientific perspective we talked a lot about innovation today the science of innovation how much we understand about how the brain is able to innovate is in its infancy
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 207.63 218.68 <o,f0,male> truly we know very little about how we are able to be creative and so i think that we're going to see over the next ten twenty thirty years a real science of creativity that's burgeoning and is going to flourish because we now have new methods that can
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 219.36 231.25 <o,f0,male> us to take this process of something like this complex jazz improvisation and study it rigorously and so it gets down to the brain and so all of us have this remarkable brain which is poorly understood to say the least i think that
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 233.65 245.80 <o,f0,male> much more questions than answers and i myself i'm not going to give you many answers today just ask a lot of questions and fundamentally that's what i do in my lab i ask questions about what is this brain doing to enable us to do this this is the main method that i use this is called functional mri
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 246.17 255.47 <o,f0,male> if you've been in an mri scanner it's very much the same but this one is outfitted in a special way to not just take pictures of your brain but to also take pictures of active areas of the brain now
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 255.91 267.12 <o,f0,male> the way that's done is by the following there's something called bold imaging which is blood oxygen level imaging now when you're in an fmri scanner you're in a big magnet that's aligning your molecules in certain areas
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 267.79 275.68 <o,f0,male> when an area of the brain is active meaning a neural area is active it gets blood flow shunted to that area that blood flow causes an increase
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 276.44 284.68 <o,f0,male> in local blood to that area with a deoxyhemoglobin change in concentration deoxyhemoglobin can be detected by mri whereas oxyhemoglobin can
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 285.23 299.17 <o,f0,male> so through this method of inference and we're measuring blood flow not neural activity we say that an area of the brain that's getting more blood was active during a particular task and that's the crux of how fmri works and it's been used since the nineties to study really complex processes
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 299.58 308.31 <o,f0,male> now i'm going to review a study that i did which was jazz in an fmri scanner and this was done with a colleague of mine alan braun at the nih this is a short video of how we did this project
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 370.18 375.70 <o,f0,male> so it works and so through this piano keyboard we now have the means to take a musical process and
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 376.17 385.78 <o,f0,male> so what do you do now that you have this cool piano keyboard you can't just sort of it 's great we've got this keyboard we actually have to come up with a scientific experiment and so the experiment really rests on the following
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 386.37 398.83 <o,f0,male> what happens in the brain during something that's memorized and over learned and what happens in the brain during something that is spontaneously generated or improvised in a way that's matched motorically and in terms of lower level sensory motor features
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 399.18 408.27 <o,f0,male> and so i have here what we call the paradigms there's a scale paradigm which is just playing a scale up and down memorized and then there's improvising on a scale quarter notes metronome right hand
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 457.99 464.31 <o,f0,male> it's not the most natural environment but they're able to play real music and i've listened to that solo two hundred times and i still like it and
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 477.29 490.14 <o,f0,male> these are contrast maps that are showing subtractions between what changes when you're improvising versus when you're doing something memorized in red is an area that active in the prefrontal cortex the frontal lobe of the brain and in blue is this area that was deactivated
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 505.69 513.50 <o,f0,male> do a whole host of things that have to do with self reflection introspection working memory and so forth really consciousness is seated in the frontal lobe
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 514.14 527.96 <o,f0,male> but we have this combination of an area that's thought to be involved in self monitoring turning off and this area that's thought to be autobiographical or self expressive turning on and we think at least in this preliminary it's one study it's probably wrong but it's one study
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 528.64 536.67 <o,f0,male> we think that at least a reasonable hypothesis is that to be creative you have to have this weird dissociation in your frontal lobe one area turns on
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 536.94 546.35 <o,f0,male> and a big area shuts off so that you're not inhibited so that you're willing to make mistakes so that you're not constantly shutting down all of these new generative impulses now
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 546.84 558.97 <o,f0,male> a lot of people know that music is not always a solo activity sometimes it's done communicatively and so the next question was what happens when musicians are trading back and forth something called trading fours which is something they do normally in a jazz experiment so
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 559.57 572.83 <o,f0,male> this is a twelve bar blues and i've broken it down into four bar groups here so you would know how you would trade now what we did was we brought a musician into the scanner same way had them memorize this melody and then had another musician out in the control room trading back and forth interactively
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 585.08 588.81 <o,f0,male> now playing the piece that we just
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 606.22 607.46 <o,f0,male> the right attitude to agree to it
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 613.80 615.07 <o,f0,male> we're playing back and forth
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 619.12 620.45 <o,f0,male> and
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 634.15 646.59 <o,f0,male> is a pretty good representation of what it's like and it's good that it's not too quick the fact that we do it over and over again lets you acclimate to your surroundings so
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 680.93 689.27 <o,f0,male> this is in fact mike pope 's data so what am i showing you here when he was trading fours with me improvising versus memorized his language areas
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 689.72 697.29 <o,f0,male> his broca 's area which is inferior frontal gyrus on the left he actually had it also homologous on the right this is an area thought to be involved in expressive communication
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 697.73 705.42 <o,f0,male> this whole notion that music is a language well maybe there's a neurologic basis to it in fact after all and we can see it when two musicians are having a musical conversation
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 717.70 722.36 <o,f0,male> free style and so i've always been fascinated by free style and let 's go ahead and play this video here
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 725.58 731.24 <o,f0,female> it when i be in your vicinity a a whole style synergy recognize symmetry a a go and try to
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 793.67 804.43 <o,f0,male> of the beat in a known repeat a a rhythm and rhyme they make me complete a a the climb is sublime when i'm on the mic a a spittin rhymes that hit you like a lightning strike a a i search for
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 820.03 825.14 <o,f0,male> all of these words keep pouring out like rain a a i need a mad scientist to check my brain
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 835.09 837.60 <o,f0,male> i guarantee you that will never happen again
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 886.16 896.56 <o,f0,male> it's an incredible thing that's taking place it's doing something that neurologically is remarkable whether or not you like the music is irrelevant creatively speaking it's just a phenomenal thing this is a short video of how we actually do this in a scanner
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 901.78 905.85 <o,f0,male> that was recorded in the scanner by the way that's emmanuel in the scanner he
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 907.50 909.38 <o,f0,male> just memorized a rhyme for us
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 941.73 951.63 <o,f0,male> you've got major visual areas lighting up you've got major cerebellar activity which is involved in motor coordination you have heightened brain activity when you're doing a comparable task when that one task is creative and the other
