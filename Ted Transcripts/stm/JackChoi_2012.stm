JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 24.96 28.14 <o,f0,male> but for a school it could be very difficult
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 51.15 53.36 <o,f0,male> virtual dissection table
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 63.61 66.97 <o,f0,male> the dissection without a human cadaver
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 67.22 69.96 <o,f0,male> and the table form is important
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 89.79 95.81 <o,f0,male> so this is exactly the way students will see the real anatomy
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 102.01 103.83 <o,f0,male> as you can see
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 112.9 115.51 <o,f0,male> so i cut right here
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 116.85 120.1 <o,f0,male> then it 's going to show inside
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 121.38 123.38 <o,f0,male> and i can change my cut
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 137.14 139.52 <o,f0,male> you can see some internal organs
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 141.94 144.81 <o,f0,male> so we call this the slicer mode
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 169.04 173.12 <o,f0,male> so if i want to see the back side i can flip
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 174.42 176.11 <o,f0,male> and see from behind
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 185.17 188.67 <o,f0,male> uncomfortable to you or disturbing to you
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 196.95 212.75 <o,f0,male> so instead of just butchering the body i 'd like to do more clinically meaningful dissections what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to peel off all the skin muscles and bones just to see a few internal organs
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 242.48 245.95 <o,f0,male> you don 't want to hear oops in real surgery
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 269.55 271.59 <o,f0,male> i 'm going to make a cut right there
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 298.49 302.05 <o,f0,male> so let me show you i 'm going to start with the skeletal structure
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 302.76 306.13 <o,f0,male> and i can add a few internal organs
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 315.54 318.66 <o,f0,male> and i can build muscles
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 337.35 339.58 <o,f0,male> another thing i can show you
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 359.62 362.46 <o,f0,male> and also if you want you can compare
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 375.25 378.41 <o,f0,male> and then it 's ready for another session
