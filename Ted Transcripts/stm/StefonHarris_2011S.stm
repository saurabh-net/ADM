StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 16.38 27.01 <o,f0,male> i have no idea what we 're going to play i won 't be able to tell you what it is until it happens i didn 't realize there was going to be a little music before so i think i 'm going to start with what i just heard
StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 121.37 127.14 <o,f0,male> heard
StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 148.84 155.02 <o,f0,male> okay
StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 351.8 355.35 <o,f0,female> okay
StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 373.11 375.35 <o,f0,male> let 's welcome mr jamire williams on the drums
StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 399.98 409.97 <o,f0,male> or the past you really are alive right here in this moment there are so many decisions being made when you walk on the bandstand we had no idea what key we were going to play

StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 443.82 454.18 <o,f0,male> is an opportunity in jazz so it 's hard to even describe what a funny note would be so for example if i played a color like we were playing on a palette that sounded like
StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 606.66 618.19 <o,f0,male> so you see he played this note i ended up creating a melody out of it the texture changed in the drums this time it got a little bit more rhythmic a little bit more intense in response to
StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 627.99 646.35 <o,f0,male> fellow band member to incorporate the idea and we don 't allow for creativity so jazz this bandstand is absolutely amazing it 's a very purifying experience and i know that i speak for all of us when i tell you that we don 't take it for granted we know that to be able to come on the bandstand and play music is a blessing so
