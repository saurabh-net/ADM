RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 16.09 20.88 <o,f0,female> seventy five years ago my grandfather a young man
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 20.91 26.11 <o,f0,female> walked into a tent that was converted into a movie theater like that
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 72.43 84.6 <o,f0,female> you know my grandfather died many years ago when i was little but his love for mae west lives on as a misspelling in the dna of his progeny that for me is successful legacy
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 101.21 109.8 <o,f0,female> because you know we both come from families that really look up to humility and wisdom but we both like to live larger than life
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 109.8 118.9 <o,f0,female> i believe in the concept of a raja yogi be a dude before you can become an ascetic this is me being a rock star even if it 's in my own house
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 118.9 124.13 <o,f0,female> you know so when netra and i sat down to make our first plan ten years ago
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 139.98 145.96 <o,f0,female> will ever live beyond two hundred years so we thought that 's a perfect place where we should situate our plan
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 146.08 148.38 <o,f0,female> and let our imagination take flight
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 148.66 153.58 <o,f0,female> you know i never really believed in legacy what am i going to leave behind i 'm an artist
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 154.18 157.08 <o,f0,female> until i made a cartoon about nine eleven
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 165.77 168.59 <o,f0,female> ended up staying so much longer
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 168.75 188.55 <o,f0,female> now i 'm in the business of creating art that will definitely even outlive me and i think about what i want to leave behind through those paintings you know the nine eleven cartoon upset me so much that i decided i 'll never cartoon again i said i 'm never going to make any honest public commentary again
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 193.5 201.68 <o,f0,female> because i forgot about how people reacted to my work you know sometimes forgetting is so important to remain idealistic
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 202.54 207.54 <o,f0,female> perhaps loss of memory is so crucial for our survival as human beings
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 250.94 265.02 <o,f0,female> i really make decisions all the time about how i want to remember myself and that 's the most important kind of decisions i make and this directly translates into my paintings but like my friends i can
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 287.51 298.43 <o,f0,female> and i rather think of our brains as biased curators of our memory you know and if technology is not a metaphor for memory what is it
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 309.21 317.55 <o,f0,female> is a picture of my mother and she recently got a facebook account you know where this is going and i 've been very supportive until
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 330.73 336.2 <o,f0,female> and she said why you look so cute darling i said you just don 't understand
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 336.22 353.92 <o,f0,female> maybe we are among the first generation that really understands this digital curating of ourselves maybe we are the first to even actively record our lives you know whether you agree with you know legacy or not we are actually leaving behind digital traces all the time
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 353.92 357.05 <o,f0,female> so netra and i really wanted to use our two hundred year plan
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 368.61 377.21 <o,f0,female> when i think of the future i never see myself moving forward in time i actually see time moving backward towards me
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 377.21 395.42 <o,f0,female> i can actually visualize my future approaching i can dodge what i don 't want and pull in what i want it 's like a video game obstacle course and i 've gotten better and better at doing this even when i make a painting i actually imagine i 'm behind the painting it already exists and someone 's looking at it
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 395.42 409.17 <o,f0,female> and i see whether they 're feeling it from their gut are they feeling it from their heart or is it just a cerebral thing and it really informs my painting even when i do an art show i really think about what should people walk away with
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 409.37 415.11 <o,f0,female> i remember when i was nineteen i did i wanted to do my first art exhibition
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 415.11 429.53 <o,f0,female> and i wanted the whole world to know about it i didn 't know ted then but what i did was i closed my eyes tight and i started dreaming i could imagine people coming in dressed up looking beautiful my paintings with all the light
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 429.53 448.5 <o,f0,female> and in my visualization i actually saw a very famous actress launching my show giving credibility to me and i woke up from my visualization and i said who was that i couldn 't tell if it was shabana azmi or rekha two very famous indian actresses like the meryl streeps of india
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 448.5 452.56 <o,f0,female> as it turned out next morning i wrote a letter to both of them
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 453.18 459.33 <o,f0,female> and shabana azmi replied and came and launched my very first show twelve years ago
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 459.4 468.69 <o,f0,female> and what a bang it started my career with you know when we think of time in this way we can curate not only the future
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 468.73 470.6 <o,f0,female> but also the past
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 470.72 489.72 <o,f0,female> this is a picture of my family and that is netra my wife she 's the co creator of my two hundred year plan netra 's a high school history teacher i love netra but i hate history i keep saying nets you live in the past while i 'll create the future
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 489.78 493.27 <o,f0,female> and when i 'm done you can study about it
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 493.43 496.47 <o,f0,female> she gave me an indulgent smile
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 496.48 508.25 <o,f0,female> and as punishment she said tomorrow i 'm teaching a class on indian history and you are sitting in it and i 'm grading you i 'm like oh god i went i actually went and sat in on her class
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 508.3 510.68 <o,f0,female> she started by giving students
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 510.68 521.25 <o,f0,female> primary source documents from india pakistan from britain and i said wow then she asked them to separate fact from bias
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 529.34 534.05 <o,f0,female> an image of your own story of dignity
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 534.3 536.85 <o,f0,female> history as an imaging tool
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 536.98 540.45 <o,f0,female> i was so inspired i went and created my own version of
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 560.24 573.91 <o,f0,female> you know if this is so it occurred to me that maybe just maybe the primary objective of our brains is to serve our dignity
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 577.5 579.17 <o,f0,female> don 't write our two hundred year
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 588.45 594.66 <o,f0,female> no we actually write it only to set our attitudes right you know
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 595.54 615.32 <o,f0,female> i used to believe that education is the most important tool to leave a meaningful legacy education is great it really teaches us who we are and helps us contextualize ourselves in the world but it 's really my creativity that 's taught me that i can be much more than what my education told me i am
RaghavaKK_2012S 1 RaghavaKK_2012S 616.2 634.3 <o,f0,female> i 'd like to make the argument that creativity is the most important tool we have it lets us create who we are and curate what is to come i like to think thank you i like to think of myself as a storyteller where my past and my future
