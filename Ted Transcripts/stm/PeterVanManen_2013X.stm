PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 17.19 21.8 <o,f0,male> and then we spend the rest of the season trying to understand what it is we 've built
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 22.05 41.36 <o,f0,male> to make it better to make it faster and then the next year we start again now the car you see in front of you is quite complicated the chassis is made up of about eleven thousand components the engine another six thousand the electronics about eight and a half thousand
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 41.73 50.94 <o,f0,male> so there 's about twenty five thousand things there that can go wrong so motor racing is very much about attention to detail
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 51.11 54.25 <o,f0,male> the other thing about formula one in particular
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 54.27 71.16 <o,f0,male> is we 're always changing the car we 're always trying to make it faster so every two weeks we will be making about five thousand new components to fit to the car five to ten percent of the race car will be different every two weeks of the year
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 71.16 90.03 <o,f0,male> so how do we do that well we start our life with the racing car we have a lot of sensors on the car to measure things on the race car in front of you here there are about one hundred and twenty sensors when it goes into a race it 's measuring all sorts of things around the car
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 90.03 104.03 <o,f0,male> that data is logged we 're logging about five hundred different parameters within the data systems about thirteen thousand health parameters and events to say when things are not working the way they should do
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 104.03 117.72 <o,f0,male> and we 're sending that data back to the garage using telemetry at a rate of two to four megabits per second so during a two hour race each car will be sending seven hundred and fifty million numbers
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 117.72 124.36 <o,f0,male> that 's twice as many numbers as words that each of us speaks in a lifetime it 's a huge amount of data
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 124.36 139.59 <o,f0,male> but it 's not enough just to have data and measure it you need to be able to do something with it so we 've spent a lot of time and effort in turning the data into stories to be able to tell what 's the state of the engine how are the tires degrading
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 149.3 152.33 <o,f0,male> okay so let 's have a look at a little bit of data
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 152.66 158.97 <o,f0,male> let 's pick a bit of data from another three month old patient this is a child
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 159.37 176.63 <o,f0,male> and what you 're seeing here is real data and on the far right hand side where everything starts getting a little bit catastrophic that is the patient going into cardiac arrest it was deemed to be an unpredictable event this was a heart attack that no one could see coming
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 176.63 194.74 <o,f0,male> but when we look at the information there we can see that things are starting to become a little fuzzy about five minutes or so before the cardiac arrest we can see small changes in things like the heart rate moving these were all undetected by normal thresholds which would be applied to data
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 194.74 200.6 <o,f0,male> so the question is why couldn 't we see it was this a predictable event
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 200.98 205.91 <o,f0,male> can we look more at the patterns in the data to be able to do things better
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 206.34 208.18 <o,f0,male> so
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 208.68 225.3 <o,f0,male> this is a child about the same age as the racing car on stage three months old it 's a patient with a heart problem now when you look at some of the data on the screen above things like heart rate pulse oxygen respiration rates
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 225.59 231.71 <o,f0,male> they 're all unusual for a normal child but they 're quite normal for the child there
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 231.71 238.48 <o,f0,male> and so one of the challenges you have in health care is how can i look at the patient in front of me
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 238.48 253.64 <o,f0,male> have something which is specific for her and be able to detect when things start to change when things start to deteriorate because like a racing car any patient when things start to go bad you have a short time to make a difference
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 254.16 260.17 <o,f0,male> so what we did is we took a data system which we run every two weeks of the year in formula one
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 260.4 275.4 <o,f0,male> and we installed it on the hospital computers at birmingham children 's hospital we streamed data from the bedside instruments in their pediatric intensive care so that we could both look at the data in real time and more importantly
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 275.51 284.03 <o,f0,male> to store the data so that we could start to learn from it and then we applied an application on top
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 284.32 294.34 <o,f0,male> which would allow us to tease out the patterns in the data in real time so we could see what was happening so we could determine when things started to change
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 294.39 310.75 <o,f0,male> now in motor racing we 're all a little bit ambitious audacious a little bit arrogant sometimes so we decided we would also look at the children as they were being transported to intensive care why should we wait until they arrived in the hospital before we started to look
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 310.75 324.23 <o,f0,male> and so we installed a real time link between the ambulance and the hospital just using normal three g telephony to send that data so that the ambulance became an extra bed in intensive care
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 326.84 337.9 <o,f0,male> and then we started looking at the data so the wiggly lines at the top all the colors this is the normal sort of data you would see on a monitor heart rate pulse
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 337.94 339.91 <o,f0,male> oxygen within the blood
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 340.24 342.54 <o,f0,male> and respiration
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 342.54 361.12 <o,f0,male> the lines on the bottom the blue and the red these are the interesting ones the red line is showing an automated version of the early warning score that birmingham children 's hospital were already running they 'd been running that since two thousand and eight and already have stopped cardiac arrests and distress within the hospital
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 376.32 385.53 <o,f0,male> the plot with the red and the green blobs this is plotting different components of the data against each other
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 385.53 398.98 <o,f0,male> the green is us learning what is normal for that child we call it the cloud of normality and when things start to change when conditions start to deteriorate we move into the red line
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 398.98 410.88 <o,f0,male> there 's no rocket science here it is displaying data that exists already in a different way to amplify it to provide cues to the doctors to the nurses so they can see what 's happening
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 410.88 425.94 <o,f0,male> in the same way that a good racing driver relies on cues to decide when to apply the brakes when to turn into a corner we need to help our physicians and our nurses to see when things are starting to go wrong
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 433.97 444.48 <o,f0,male> we are thinking big it 's the right thing to do we have an approach which if it 's successful there 's no reason why it should stay within a hospital it can go beyond the walls
PeterVanManen_2013X 1 PeterVanManen_2013X 444.48 455.58 <o,f0,male> with wireless connectivity these days there is no reason why patients doctors and nurses always have to be in the same place at the same time and meanwhile
