DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 13.09 19.72 <o,f0,male> going around the world giving talks about darwin and usually what i a m talking about is darwin a s strange inversion of reasoning
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 20.45 29.83 <o,f0,male> now that title that phrase comes from a critic an early critic and this is a passage that i just love and would like to read for you
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 30.19 44.42 <o,f0,male> in the theory with which we have to deal absolute ignorance is the artificer so that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system that in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine it is not requisite to know how to make it
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 45.40 53.64 <o,f0,male> this proposition will be found on careful examination to express in condensed form the essential purport of the theory
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 54.15 61.58 <o,f0,male> to express in a few words all mister darwin a s meaning who by a strange inversion of reasoning
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 62.08 71.59 <o,f0,male> seems to think absolute ignorance fully qualified to take the place of absolute wisdom in the achievements of creative skill exactly
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 73.54 76.77 <o,f0,male> exactly and it is a strange inversion
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 77.81 79.06 <o,f0,male> a creationist
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 82.43 89.63 <o,f0,male> test two do you know of any building that didn a t have a builder yes no do you know of any painting that didn a t have a painter
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 90.10 98.86 <o,f0,male> yes no do you know of any car that didn a t have a maker yes no if you answered yes for any of the above give details
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 100.90 105.21 <o,f0,male> i mean it really is a strange inversion of reasoning
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 105.82 111.82 <o,f0,male> you would have thought it stands to reason that design requires an intelligent designer
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 113.62 123.00 <o,f0,male> but darwin shows that it a s just false today though i a m going to talk about darwin a s other strange inversion which is equally puzzling at first
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 126.24 132.20 <o,f0,male> it stands to reason that we love chocolate cake because it is sweet
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 133.76 137.63 <o,f0,male> guys go for girls like this because they are sexy
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 139.42 142.15 <o,f0,male> we adore babies because they a re so cute
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 143.70 147.84 <o,f0,male> and of course we are amused by jokes because they are
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 152.90 154.04 <o,f0,male> this is all backwards
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 157.62 163.19 <o,f0,male> darwin shows us why let a s start with sweet our sweet tooth
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 163.90 172.95 <o,f0,male> is basically an evolved sugar detector because sugar is high energy and it a s just been wired up to the preferer to put it very crudely
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 173.54 178.93 <o,f0,male> and that a s why we like sugar honey is sweet because we like it not
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 180.07 181.29 <o,f0,male> we like it because
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 187.37 188.38 <o,f0,male> about honey if you
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 189.24 194.50 <o,f0,male> glucose molecules till you were blind you wouldn a t see why they tasted sweet
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 195.51 198.60 <o,f0,male> you have to look in our brains to understand why
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 208.76 212.27 <o,f0,male> the other way round sweetness was born with the wiring
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 212.89 219.42 <o,f0,male> which evolved and there a s nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies and it a s a good thing
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 220.01 224.44 <o,f0,male> that there isn a t because of there were then mother nature would have a problem
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 225.82 227.77 <o,f0,male> how on earth do you get chimps to
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 242.24 245.19 <o,f0,male> that would be one way of doing it but there a s a quicker way
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 246.38 249.10 <o,f0,male> the chimps up to love that look
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 250.30 251.36 <o,f0,male> and apparently they do
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 256.60 263.89 <o,f0,male> over six million years we and the chimps evolved our different ways we became bald bodied
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 264.36 272.28 <o,f0,male> oddly enough for one reason or another they didn a t if we hadn a t then probably this would be the height of sexiness
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 279.48 280.86 <o,f0,male> our sweet tooth
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 281.21 290.64 <o,f0,male> is an evolved and instinctual preference for high energy food it wasn a t designed for chocolate cake chocolate cake is a supernormal stimulus
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 290.86 302.27 <o,f0,male> the term is owed to niko tinbergen who did his famous experiments with gulls where he found that that orange spot on the gull a s beak if he made a bigger oranger spot the gull chicks would peck at it even harder
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 313.73 322.36 <o,f0,male> wiring and there are lots of supernormal stimuli chocolate cake is one there's lots of supernormal stimuli for sexiness and there's even supernormal
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 323.12 331.14 <o,f0,male> for cuteness here a s a pretty good example it a s important that we love babies and that we not be put off by say messy diapers
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 331.99 344.36 <o,f0,male> so babies have to attract our affection and our nurturing and they do and by the way a recent study shows that mothers prefer the smell of the dirty diapers of their own baby
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 345.49 352.34 <o,f0,male> so nature works on many levels here but now if babies didn a t look the way they do if babies looked like this
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 353.27 360.59 <o,f0,male> what we would find adorable that a s what we would find we would think oh my goodness do i ever want to hug that
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 362.08 363.88 <o,f0,male> this is the strange inversion
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 364.35 366.04 <o,f0,male> well now finally what about
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 367.88 377.58 <o,f0,male> my answer is it a s the same story the same story this is the hard one the one that isn a t obvious that a s why i leave it to the end and i won a t be able to say too much about it
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 378.07 385.61 <o,f0,male> but you have to think evolutionarily you have to think what hard job that has to be done it a s dirty work somebody a s got to do it
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 386.45 387.79 <o,f0,male> is so important
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 388.10 392.93 <o,f0,male> to give us such a powerful inbuilt reward for it when we succeed
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 394.11 401.60 <o,f0,male> now i think we've found the answer i and a few of my colleagues it a s a neural system that a s wired up
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 401.82 410.35 <o,f0,male> to reward the brain for doing a grubby clerical job our bumper sticker for this
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 427.20 436.29 <o,f0,male> as a sort of neuroscientific probe by switching humor on and off by turning the knob on a joke now it a s not funny oh now it a s funnier
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 443.67 458.05 <o,f0,male> the functional architecture of the brain matthew hurley is the first author of this we call it the hurley model he a s a computer scientist reginald adams a psychologist and there i am and we a re putting this together into a book thank you very much
