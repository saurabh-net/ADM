JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 16.47 25.91 <o,f0,male> i'm an ecologist mostly a coral reef ecologist i started out in chesapeake bay and went diving in the winter and became a tropical ecologist
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 27.51 32.86 <o,f0,male> and it was really a lot of fun for about ten years i mean
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 33.48 42.94 <o,f0,male> somebody pays you to go around and travel and look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet and that was what i did
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 43.37 56.75 <o,f0,male> and i ended up in jamaica in the west indies where the coral reefs were really among the most extraordinary structurally that i ever saw in my life and this picture here
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 56.92 66.33 <o,f0,male> it's really interesting it shows two things first of all it's in black and white because the water was so clear and you could see so far and film was so slow
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 66.55 78.82 <o,f0,male> in the nineteen sixties and the early seventies you took pictures in black and white the other thing it shows you is that although there's this beautiful forest of coral there are no fish in that picture
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 79.32 86.27 <o,f0,male> those reefs at discovery bay jamaica were the most studied coral reefs in the world for twenty years
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 86.62 95.57 <o,f0,male> we were the best and the brightest people came to study our reefs from australia which is sort of funny because now we go to theirs and
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 96.43 105.08 <o,f0,male> the view of scientists about how coral reefs work how they ought to be was based on these reefs without any fish
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 118.31 125.88 <o,f0,male> twenty five to fifty feet high and the reefs disappeared and new islands formed and we thought well
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 126.36 135.67 <o,f0,male> real smart we know that hurricanes have always happened in the past and we
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 153.52 161.05 <o,f0,male> died and within a few months after that sea urchin dying the seaweed started to grow and that is the same
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 162.24 172.07 <o,f0,male> that's the same reef fifteen years ago that's the same reef today the coral reefs of the north coast of jamaica have a few percent live coral cover
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 172.34 181.41 <o,f0,male> and a lot of seaweed and slime and that's more or less the story of the coral reefs of the caribbean and increasingly tragically
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 181.74 193.90 <o,f0,male> the coral reefs worldwide now that's my little depressing story all of us in our sixties and seventies have comparable depressing stories there are tens of thousands
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 194.26 205.53 <o,f0,male> of those stories out there and it's really hard to conjure up much of a sense of well being because it just keeps getting worse and the reason it keeps getting worse is that after
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 205.71 208.77 <o,f0,male> a natural catastrophe like a
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 211.73 222.50 <o,f0,male> it used to be that there was some kind of successional sequence of recovery but what's going on now is that overfishing and pollution and climate change
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 222.84 230.83 <o,f0,male> are all interacting in a way that prevents that and so i'm going to sort of go through and talk about those three
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 231.38 242.19 <o,f0,male> kinds of things we hear a lot about the collapse of cod it's difficult to imagine that two or some historians would say three world wars
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 242.54 252.05 <o,f0,male> were fought during the colonial era for the control of cod cod fed most of the people of western europe it fed the slaves brought
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 252.65 262.48 <o,f0,male> to the antilles the song jamaica farewell aki rice salt fish are nice is an emblem of the importance of salt cod
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 262.86 274.23 <o,f0,male> from northeastern canada it all collapsed in the eighties and the nineties thirty five thousand people lost their jobs and that was the beginning of a kind of serial depletion
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 274.60 284.29 <o,f0,male> from bigger and tastier species to smaller and not so tasty species from species that were near to home to species that were all around the world
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 285.17 298.71 <o,f0,male> and what have you it's a little hard to understand that because you can go to a costco in the united states and buy cheap fish you ought to read the label to find out where it came from but it's still cheap and everybody thinks it's
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 299.51 307.54 <o,f0,male> and it's hard to communicate this and so one way that i think is really interesting is to talk about sport fish
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 307.95 315.28 <o,f0,male> because people like to go out and catch fish it's one of those things this picture here shows the trophy fish
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 315.73 328.77 <o,f0,male> the biggest fish caught by people who pay a lot of money to get on a boat go to a place off of key west in florida drink a lot of beer throw a lot of hooks and lines into the water
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 329.08 341.25 <o,f0,male> come back with the biggest and the best fish and the champion trophy fish are put on this board where people take a picture and this guy is obviously really excited about that fish
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 341.63 351.22 <o,f0,male> well that's what it's like now but this is what it was like in the nineteen fifties from the same boat in the same place on the same board on the same dock
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 352.05 362.14 <o,f0,male> and the trophy fish were so big that you couldn't put any of those small fish up on it and the average size trophy fish weighed two hundred and fifty to three hundred
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 362.83 371.33 <o,f0,male> goliath groper and if you wanted to go out and kill something you could pretty much count on being able to catch one of those fish and they tasted really good
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 382.08 391.53 <o,f0,male> and that's everywhere it's not just the fish though that are disappearing industrial fishing uses big stuff big machinery
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 391.83 399.20 <o,f0,male> we use nets that are twenty miles long we use long lines that have one million or two million
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 400.20 408.39 <o,f0,male> and we trawl which means to take something the size of a tractor trailer truck that weighs thousands and thousands of pounds
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 408.74 415.54 <o,f0,male> put it on a big chain and drag it across the sea floor to stir up the bottom and catch the fish
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 416.32 428.10 <o,f0,male> and think of it as being kind of the bulldozing of a city or of a forest because it clears it away and the habitat destruction is unbelievable
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 428.55 436.24 <o,f0,male> this is photograph a typical photograph of what the continental shelves of the world look like
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 436.55 446.33 <o,f0,male> you can see the rows in the bottom the way you can see the rows in a field that has just been plowed to plant corn what that was
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 446.61 454.35 <o,f0,male> was a forest of sponges and coral which is a critical habitat for the development of fish what it is now is mud
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 454.91 464.80 <o,f0,male> and the area of the ocean floor that has been transformed from forest to level mud to parking lot is equivalent
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 465.05 479.74 <o,f0,male> to the entire area of all the forests that have ever been cut down on all of the earth in the history of humanity and we've managed to do that in the last one hundred to one hundred and fifty years
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 480.30 493.63 <o,f0,male> we tend to think of oil spills and mercury and we hear a lot about plastic these days and all of that stuff is really disgusting but what's really insidious is the biological pollution that happens
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 494.20 500.93 <o,f0,male> because of the magnitude of the shifts that it causes to entire ecosystems and
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 501.55 510.45 <o,f0,male> just talk very briefly about two kinds of biological pollution one is introduced species and the other is what comes from nutrients
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 510.93 518.99 <o,f0,male> so this is the infamous caulerpa taxifolia the so called killer algae a book was written about it
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 519.28 526.29 <o,f0,male> it's a bit of an embarrassment it was accidentally released from the aquarium in monaco it was
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 527.01 536.21 <o,f0,male> to be cold tolerant to have in peoples aquaria it's very pretty and it has rapidly started to overgrow
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 538.21 548.53 <o,f0,male> very rich biodiversity of the northwestern mediterranean i don't know how many of you remember the movie the little shop of horrors but this is the plant of the little
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 548.87 559.59 <o,f0,male> shop of horrors but instead of devouring the people in the shop what it's doing is overgrowing and smothering virtually all of the bottom dwelling life
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 559.91 568.76 <o,f0,male> of the entire northwestern mediterranean sea we don't know anything that eats it we're trying to do all sorts of genetics
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 569.09 577.42 <o,f0,male> and figure out something that could be done but as it stands it's the monster from hell about which nobody knows what to do
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 577.77 591.51 <o,f0,male> now another form of pollution that's biological pollution is what happens from excess nutrients the green revolution all of this artificial nitrogen fertilizer we used too much of it it's subsidized which is one of the reasons
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 591.82 605.10 <o,f0,male> we used too much of it it runs down the rivers and it feeds the plankton the little microscopic plant cells in the coastal water but since we ate all the oysters and we ate all the fish that would eat the plankton there's nothing
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 606.00 619.67 <o,f0,male> the plankton and there's more and more of it so it dies of old age which is unheard of for plankton and when it dies it falls to the bottom and then it rots which means that bacteria break it down and in the
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 620.40 630.45 <o,f0,male> process they use up all the oxygen and in using up all the oxygen they make the environment utterly lethal for anything that can't swim away and so what we end up with
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 630.84 642.21 <o,f0,male> a microbial zoo dominated by bacteria and jellyfish as you see on the left in front of you and the only fishery left and it is a commercial fishery
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 642.53 653.02 <o,f0,male> is the jellyfish fishery you see on the right where there used to be prawns even in newfoundland where we used to catch cod we now have a jellyfish fishery
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 653.54 664.37 <o,f0,male> and another version of this sort of thing is what is often called red tides or toxic blooms that picture is just staggering to me i have talked about it a million times
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 664.82 671.63 <o,f0,male> it's unbelievable in the upper right of that picture on the left is almost the mississippi delta and the lower left
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 671.94 684.97 <o,f0,male> of that picture is the texas mexico border you're looking at the entire northwestern gulf of mexico your looking at one toxic dinoflagellate bloom that can kill fish made by that beautiful little creature
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 685.22 693.78 <o,f0,male> on the lower right and in the upper right you see this black sort of cloud moving to shore that's the same species
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 694.30 705.80 <o,f0,male> and as it comes to shore and the wind blows and little droplets of the water get into the air the emergency rooms of all the hospitals fill up with people with acute respiratory distress
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 706.09 716.44 <o,f0,male> and that's retirement homes on the west coast of florida a friend and i did this thing in hollywood we called hollywood ocean night and i was trying to figure out how to explain to actors
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 717.07 726.48 <o,f0,male> what's going and i said so imagine you're in a movie called escape from malibu because all the beautiful people have moved to north dakota where it's clean and safe
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 738.66 750.29 <o,f0,male> and then this is amazing it was when i was on holiday last early autumn in france this is from the coast of brittany which is being enveloped in this green algal slime
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 750.51 758.74 <o,f0,male> the reason that it attracted so much attention besides the fact that it's disgusting is that sea birds flying over it
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 760.13 765.84 <o,f0,male> by the smell and die and a farmer died of it and you can imagine the scandal that happened
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 766.16 778.69 <o,f0,male> and so there's this war between the farmers and the fishermen about it all and the net result is that the beaches of brittany have to be bulldozed of this stuff on a regular basis
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 779.00 787.83 <o,f0,male> and then of course there's climate change and we all know about climate change and i guess the iconic figure of it is the melting of the ice in the arctic sea
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 788.23 802.71 <o,f0,male> think about the thousands and thousands of people who died trying to find the northwest passage well the northwest is already there i think it's sort of funny it's on the siberian coast maybe the russians will charge tolls
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 803.80 817.15 <o,f0,male> the governments of the world are taking this really seriously the military of the arctic nations is taking it really seriously for all the denial of climate change by government leaders
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 817.45 825.61 <o,f0,male> the c i a and the navies of norway and the u s and canada whatever are busily
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 825.84 836.82 <o,f0,male> thinking about how they will secure their territory in this inevitability from their point of view and of course arctic communities are toast
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 837.16 850.72 <o,f0,male> the other kinds of effects of climate change this is coral bleaching it's a beautiful picture right all that white coral except it's supposed to be brown and what happens is that the corals are a symbiosis and they have these little
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 851.59 859.79 <o,f0,male> algal cells that live inside them and the algae give the corals sugar and the corals give the algae nutrients and protection
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 860.05 867.33 <o,f0,male> but when it gets too hot the algae can't make the sugar the corals say you cheated you didn't pay your rent they kick them out and then
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 868.94 882.03 <o,f0,male> not all of them die some of them survive some more are surviving but it's really bad news to try and give you a sense of this imagine you go camping in july somewhere in europe or in north america
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 882.34 891.12 <o,f0,male> and you wake up the next morning and you look around you and you see that eighty percent of the trees as far as you can see have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 891.47 904.42 <o,f0,male> and you come home and you discover that eighty percent of all the trees in north america and in europe have dropped their leaves and then you read in the paper a few weeks later oh by the way a quarter of those died
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 919.34 929.61 <o,f0,male> and then the really scary thing about all of this the overfishing the pollution and the climate change is that each thing doesn't happen in a vacuum
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 929.93 941.28 <o,f0,male> but there are these what we call positive feedbacks the synergies among them that make the whole vastly greater than the sum of the parts and the great scientific challenge
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 941.72 953.94 <o,f0,male> for people like me in thinking about all this is do we know how to put humpty dumpty back together again i mean because we at this point we can protect it but what does that mean we
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 954.45 963.33 <o,f0,male> really don't know so what are the oceans going to be like in twenty or fifty years
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 977.51 987.19 <o,f0,male> and dead zones will get bigger and bigger and they'll start to merge and we can imagine something like the dead zonification of the global
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 987.65 1000.55 <o,f0,male> coastal ocean then you sure won 't want to eat fish that were raised in it because would be a kind of gastronomic russian roulette sometimes you have a toxic bloom sometimes you don 't that doesn't
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 1001.93 1012.03 <o,f0,male> the really scary things though are the physical chemical oceanographic things that are happening as the surface of the ocean gets warmer
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 1012.72 1022.11 <o,f0,male> water is lighter when it's warmer it becomes harder and harder to turn the ocean over we say it becomes more strongly stratified
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 1022.34 1032.13 <o,f0,male> the consequence of that is that all those nutrients that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries of the sardines of california or in
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 1033.53 1045.31 <o,f0,male> or whatever those slow down and those fisheries collapse and at the same time water from the surface which is rich in oxygen doesn't make it down and
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 1048.12 1058.00 <o,f0,male> ocean turns into a desert so the question is how are we all going to respond to this and we can do all sorts of things to fix it
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 1058.42 1071.08 <o,f0,male> but in the final analysis the thing we really need to fix is ourselves it's not about the fish it's not about the pollution it's not about the climate change it's about us
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 1071.45 1081.30 <o,f0,male> and our greed and our need for growth and our inability to imagine a world which is different from the selfish world we live in today
JeremyJackson_2010Z 1 JeremyJackson_2010Z 1081.57 1091.15 <o,f0,male> so the question is will we respond to this or not i would say that the future of life and the dignity of human beings depends on our doing that thank you
