DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 16.33 24.45 <o,f0,female> i'm the weekly tech critic for the new york times i review gadgets and stuff and mostly what good dads should be doing this time of year
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 24.83 34.84 <o,f0,female> is nestling with their kids and decorating the christmas tree what i'm mostly doing this year is going on cable tv and answering the same question what are the tech trends for next year
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 35.45 45.50 <o,f0,female> like didn 't we just go through this last year but i'm going to pick the one that interests me most and that is the completed marriage of the cell phone and the internet you know i found that
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 45.94 51.51 <o,f0,female> volcano on google images not realizing how much it makes me look like the cover of dianetics
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 76.13 87.43 <o,f0,female> but its just a fake out it's a wav file of a dial tone just to reassure you that the world hasn't ended it could be anything it could be salsa music or a comedy routine it doesn't matter
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 88.65 101.45 <o,f0,female> the little box has your phone number so that's really cool you can take it to london or siberia and your next door neighbor can dial your home number and your phone will ring because it's got everything in the box they've got every feature known to man in there
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 113.51 123.11 <o,f0,female> the last three years i mean no self respecting college kid has home phone service anymore this is what college kids are more likely to have it's the most popular voip service in the world it's skype
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 123.32 133.91 <o,f0,female> it's a free program you download for your mac or pc and you make free phone calls anywhere in the world the downside is that you have to wear a headset like a nerd it's not your phone it's your computer
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 134.96 143.80 <o,f0,female> but nonetheless if you're a college kid and you have no money believe me this is better than trying to use your cellphone it's really cute seeing middle aged people like me
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 144.09 150.96 <o,f0,female> try out skype for the first time which is usually when their kid goes away for a semester abroad they don't want to pay the international fees
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 153.21 153.82 <o,f0,female> is that you
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 154.21 156.07 <o,f0,male> it's really cute
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 158.43 170.16 <o,f0,female> but i at least it was when i did it i think where voip is really going to get interesting is when they start putting it on cellphones imagine if you had an ordinary cellphone and any time you were in a wireless hotspot
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 170.54 179.52 <o,f0,female> free calls anywhere in the world never pay the cellular company a nickle it 'd be really really cool and yet even though the technology for this has been available
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 179.77 187.71 <o,f0,female> for five years incredibly the number of standard cellphones offered by us carriers with free voip
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 189.18 189.76 <o,f0,female> zero
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 190.44 192.24 <o,f0,female> i can't figure out why
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 203.05 212.35 <o,f0,male> i am not paid by t mobile i'm not plugging t mobile the new york times has very rigid policies about that ever since that jayson blair jerk ruined it for all of us
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 214.04 223.67 <o,f0,male> basically the reason you haven't heard about this program is because it was introduced last year on june twenty nine does anyone remember what else happened on june twenty nine last year
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 223.99 231.74 <o,f0,male> it was the iphone the iphone came out that day i'm like can you imagine being the t mobile pr lady you know hi we
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 238.72 239.20 <o,f0,male> but
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 254.41 263.14 <o,f0,female> and when you're out of the hotspot you're on the regular cellular network your 'e thinking well how often am i in a hotspot the answer is all the time because they give you
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 276.18 284.36 <o,f0,female> it's a hundred million dollars to put up one of those towers right they don't have that kind of money instead they give each of us a seven dollar and ninety five cent box
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 285.07 293.73 <o,f0,female> like a stealth tower installation program we're putting it in our homes for them anyway they have wi fi phones in europe
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 294.09 304.51 <o,f0,female> but the thing that t mobile did that nobody 's done before is when you're on a call an you move from wi fi into cellular range the call is handed off in mid syllable seamlessly
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 305.13 313.00 <o,f0,female> i'll show you the advanced technologies we use at the new york times to test this gear this is me with a camcorder on a phone going like this
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 314.10 322.80 <o,f0,female> as i walk out of the house from my wi fi hotspot into the cellular network on a call with my wife look at the upper left that's the wi fi signal
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 330.17 330.36 <o,f0,female> sound
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 340.05 341.58 <o,f0,female> doing right
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 353.04 361.95 <o,f0,female> the bottom line is that the boundaries because of the internet plus cellphone are melting the cool thing about the t mobile phones is that although switching technologies is very advanced
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 376.09 377.02 <o,f0,male> and
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 378.27 385.27 <o,f0,male> the call will continue to be free because they don 't they haven't well no wait not so fast it also works the other way
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 386.14 396.05 <o,f0,male> if you start a call on your cellular network and you come home you keep being billed which is why most people with this service get into the habit of saying hey i just got home can i call you right back
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 396.76 404.15 <o,f0,male> now you get it it's also true that if you use one of these phones overseas it doesn't know what internet hotspot
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 404.94 411.68 <o,f0,male> on the internet nobody knows you're a dog right nobody knows you're in pakistan you can make free unlimited calls home to the
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 434.93 437.10 <o,f0,female> i have two cellphones so this going to be very odd
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 473.83 474.78 <o,f0,male> made the point
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 476.12 483.64 <o,f0,female> ringer off everyone wants in on the action this is grand central at work it's a oh for
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 487.63 492.23 <o,f0,male> i have your numbers now you will pay
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 494.43 506.40 <o,f0,male> is this really brilliant idea where they give you a new phone number and then at that point one phone number rings all your phones at once your home phone your work phone your cellphone your yacht phone this is the eg
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 519.01 526.01 <o,f0,male> you can say i want these people to be able to call me only during these hours and i want these people to hear this greeting
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 526.53 534.60 <o,f0,male> hi boss i'm out making us both some money leave a message and then your wife calls and hi honey leave me a message very customizable
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 535.09 544.96 <o,f0,male> google bought it and they've been working on it for a year they're supposed to come out with it very shortly in a public method by the way this is something that really bothers me
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 556.41 565.64 <o,f0,male> i'm going to tell you how to avoid that now what you're going to use is google cellular it's totally free there's not even ads if you know how to send a text message you can get the same information for
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 573.77 580.91 <o,f0,male> the last e for savings anyway so lets say you need a drugstore near chicago you type pharmacy chicago or the
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 582.60 590.18 <o,f0,male> in five seconds they will send you back the two closest drugstores complete with name address and phone number
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 592.04 595.11 <o,f0,male> it's already written down so like if you're driving you don't have to do
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 608.04 608.71 <o,f0,male> why i was in
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 610.91 617.43 <o,f0,male> and those are just the beginning these are all the different things that you can text to google and they will yeah you're all trying to write this
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 641.03 651.33 <o,f0,male> i want what i want to find what bagels ok google say the business and the city and state dp bagels monterey california
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 655.34 656.49 <o,f0,female> i got the chinese line
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 674.15 677.99 <o,f0,male> number two number two
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 693.84 695.42 <o,f0,male> or say details or go back
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 696.08 702.11 <o,f0,female> he 's connecting me he doesn't even tell me the phone number he 's just connecting me directly it's like having a personal valet
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 775.06 777.78 <o,f0,female> one they have ten thousand
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 778.57 784.47 <o,f0,female> who are being paid twenty cents per answer as you can imagine it's college kids and old people
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 785.30 795.71 <o,f0,male> that's who can afford to do that but it's a human being on the line and it's gotten me out of so many tough positions like when 's the last flight out of chicago you know it's just absolutely amazing
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 797.02 804.35 <o,f0,male> another thing that really bothers me about cellphones today this is probably my biggest pet peeve in all of technology when i
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 804.61 806.20 <o,f0,female> call to leave you a message
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 807.56 814.59 <o,f0,female> i get fifteen seconds of instructions from a third grade teacher on ambien
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 837.69 848.46 <o,f0,female> and then it gets worse when i call to retrieve my messages first of all you have eighty seven messages to listen to your messages
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 853.60 854.17 <o,f0,male> i
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 862.58 870.99 <o,f0,female> so last year i went to milan italy and i got to speak to an audience of cellular executives from two hundred countries around the world
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 871.46 879.74 <o,f0,female> and i said as a joke as a joke i said i did the math verizon has seventy million customers if you check your voicemail twice a day
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 880.21 890.55 <o,f0,female> that's one hundred million dollars a year i bet you guys are doing this just to run up our airtime aren't you no chuckle they're like this
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 893.97 895.83 <o,f0,female> the outrage people
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 909.21 919.08 <o,f0,female> so now i'm going to tell you how to get out of that there are these services that transcribe your voicemail into text and they send it to either your email or as
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 927.71 936.61 <o,f0,male> the audio file at the bottom of the email so you can listen to double check the services are called things like spinvox phonetag this is the one i use callwave a lot of people say how
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 936.82 946.14 <o,f0,male> are they doing this i don't really want people listening in to my calls the executives at these companies told me well we use a proprietary b to b best of breed peer to peer soluti
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 947.49 957.89 <o,f0,male> i think basically it's like these guys in india with headsets you know listening in the reason i think that is that on the first day i tried one of these services i got two voicemail messages one
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 976.04 976.22 <o,f0,male> you
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 994.92 998.78 <o,f0,male> i thought i'd see how that goes this is me testing it out
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 999.20 1010.13 <o,f0,female> this is micheal hope you're doing well i'm fine here everything 's good hey i was walking along the street and the sky was blue
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1010.99 1017.92 <o,f0,female> and your daughter broke her leg at soccer practice i'm going to have a sandwich for lunch
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1019.25 1023.88 <o,f0,female> in in room emergency room fifty three w
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1031.99 1033.09 <o,f0,male> i love my job
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1065.99 1066.96 <o,f0,male> i guess that was the
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1079.11 1086.82 <o,f0,male> or a potentially bad meeting so you go and you type in your phone number and at the exact minute where you want to be called
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1087.74 1096.73 <o,f0,male> and at that moment your phone will ring and you're like i 'm sorry i've got to take this the really beautiful thing is you know when somebody 's sitting next to you sometimes they can sort of
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1098.19 1106.29 <o,f0,male> hear a little bit of the caller so they give you a choice of what you want to hear on the other end here 's the girlfriend hey
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1106.92 1114.83 <o,f0,female> what's going on dp i'm kinda like giving a talk right now well that's good dp what are you doing i was just wondering what you were up to
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1129.26 1129.59 <o,f0,female> sorry
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1130.81 1139.88 <o,f0,male> so when was the last time you used the photocopier dp it was like three weeks ago well i don't know if you heard you might have heard from lenny but
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1144.20 1156.73 <o,f0,male> i think the biggest change when internet met phone was with the iphone not my finest moment in new york times journalism it was when in the fall of two thousand and six i explained why apple would never do a cellphone
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1157.60 1164.42 <o,f0,female> i looked like a moron however my logic was good because i don't know if you realize this but until the iphone came along the
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1207.05 1217.05 <o,f0,male> you can see what i said about it it's a flawed masterpiece it's got bad things and good things lets all acknowledge that right now but it did change a few things the first thing it changed was that
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1217.22 1226.53 <o,f0,female> all those carriers saw that they sold ten million of these things in a year and they said oh my gosh maybe we've been doing it wrong maybe we should let phone designers design the phones
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1231.40 1241.45 <o,f0,male> another thing was that it let ten million people for the first time experience being online all the time not using these sixty dollar a month cellular cards for their laptops
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1250.45 1250.74 <o,f0,female> a
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1258.16 1259.12 <o,f0,male> we had
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1266.32 1272.59 <o,f0,female> it's absurd we have power outlets in every room of every building we have running water what's the problem
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1272.88 1280.58 <o,f0,male> anyway but this teaches people what it's like you have to go to youtube and type in iphone shuffle this guy did a mock
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1280.95 1290.23 <o,f0,male> video of one that's one inch square like the real ipod shuffle it's like it only has one button touch it and it dials a number at random
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1293.84 1303.74 <o,f0,female> but the other thing it did is it opened up this idea of an app store it downloads right to the phone and you can use the tilt sensor
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1304.01 1314.79 <o,f0,female> to steer this car using this game these programs can use all the components of the iphone the touch screen this is the etch a sketch prgram the theme of eg two thousand and eight you know how you erase it
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1315.66 1322.10 <o,f0,female> of course you shake it right of course we shake it to erase like this they have ten thousand of these programs
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1331.02 1337.05 <o,f0,male> this is amazing this is midomi a song is running through your head you sing it into the thing do
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1340.02 1340.26 <o,f0,female> do
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1342.58 1345.95 <o,f0,female> done and it will find out the song and play it for you
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1355.93 1363.15 <o,f0,female> this is pandora free internet radio not just free internet radio you type in a band or a song name it will immediately play you that song
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1371.24 1372.65 <o,f0,female> from a different band with the same
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1373.90 1379.68 <o,f0,female> vocals theme and tempo if you like that one or don't like it you do thumbs up and thumbs down over time
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1395.91 1398.61 <o,f0,female> it gives you the price and the location and
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1426.94 1431.46 <o,f0,female> the most calcified corporate conservative carrier of all
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1432.30 1441.20 <o,f0,female> said you can use any phone you want on our network i love the wired headline pigs fly hell freezes over and verizon opens up its network no really
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1441.54 1450.37 <o,f0,female> so everything is changing we've entered at new world of innovation where the cellphone becomes your laptop customized the way you want it every
DavidPogue_2008P 1 DavidPogue_2008P 1450.69 1455.40 <o,f0,male> is unique there is software that you can add on can i do one more one minute song
