JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 26.51 34.35 <o,f0,male> with a little experiment could you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 34.68 43.39 <o,f0,male> or you've had laser refractive surgery now unfortunately there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 44.29 50.66 <o,f0,male> but it looks like i'm guessing that it'll be about sixty percent of the room because that's
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 51.10 59.01 <o,f0,male> roughly the fraction of developed world population that have some sort of vision correction
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 59.89 72.00 <o,f0,male> the world health organization estimates well they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses the lowest estimate is one hundred and fifty million people
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 72.66 80.10 <o,f0,male> they also have an estimate of around a billion but in fact i would argue that we've just done an experiment here and now
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 80.52 88.06 <o,f0,male> which shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear is around half of any population
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 89.12 95.59 <o,f0,male> and the problem of poor vision is actually not just a health problem
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 95.92 103.15 <o,f0,male> it's also an educational problem and it's an economic problem and it's a quality of life
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 105.89 114.94 <o,f0,male> not very expensive they're quite plentiful the problem is there aren't enough eye care professionals
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 115.35 121.85 <o,f0,male> in the world to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear that we have in the developed world
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 123.01 135.10 <o,f0,male> just way too few eye care professionals so this little slide here shows you an optometrist and the little blue person represents about ten thousand people and that's the ratio in the u k
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 135.82 144.84 <o,f0,male> this is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub saharan africa in fact there are some countries in sub saharan africa where there's one optometrist for
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 145.81 152.52 <o,f0,male> eight million of the population how do you do this how do you solve this problem i
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 153.52 161.99 <o,f0,male> with a solution to this problem and i came up with a solution based on adaptive optics for this and the idea is you make eye glasses and you adjust them yourself
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 162.96 170.00 <o,f0,male> and that solves the problem what i want to do is to show you that one can make
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 170.44 182.76 <o,f0,male> a pair of glasses i shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses i shall put this in my pocket i'm short sighted i look at the signs at the end i can hardly see them
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 183.20 189.38 <o,f0,female> so okay i can now see that man running out there and i
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 203.78 205.35 <o,f0,male> okay so i've made these
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 206.85 208.34 <o,f0,male> and
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 210.74 217.47 <o,f0,male> made the glasses to my prescription and i've just
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 226.09 229.38 <o,f0,male> and i've now
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 240.82 246.99 <o,f0,male> the only pair in the world in fact this technology 's been evolving i started working on it in
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 257.88 264.58 <o,f0,male> and i have a vision which i'll share with you i have a global vision for vision and that vision
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 273.42 282.15 <o,f0,male> to do that this is an early example of the technology the technology is being further developed the cost has to be brought down this pair in fact these
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 283.52 296.45 <o,f0,male> cost about nineteen dollars but the cost has to be brought right down it has to be brought down because we're trying to serve populations who live on a dollar a day how do you solve this problem you start to get into detail
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 296.91 309.92 <o,f0,male> and on this slide i'm basically explaining all the problems you have how do you distribute how do you work out how to fit the thing how do you have people realizing that they have a vision problem how
