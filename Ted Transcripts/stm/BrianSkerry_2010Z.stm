BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 16.14 25.81 <o,f0,male> i would like to share with you this morning some stories about the ocean through my work as a still photographer for national geographic magazine
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 26.58 37.06 <o,f0,male> i guess i became an underwater photographer and a photojournalist because i fell in love with the sea as a child and i wanted to tell stories about all the amazing things i was seeing underwater
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 49.71 55.85 <o,f0,male> but more and more frequently these days i'm seeing terrible things underwater as well things that i don't think most people realize
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 56.21 65.72 <o,f0,male> and i've been compelled to turn my camera towards these issues to tell a more complete story i want people to see what's happening underwater both the horror and the magic
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 66.19 75.85 <o,f0,male> the first story that i did for national geographic where i recognized the ability to include environmental issues within a natural history coverage was a story i proposed on harp seals
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 76.14 84.61 <o,f0,male> now the story i wanted to do initially was just a small focus to look at the few weeks each year where these animals migrate down from the canadian arctic
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 85.06 94.72 <o,f0,male> to the gulf of st lawrence in canada to engage in courtship mating and to have their pups and all of this is played out against the backdrop of transient pack ice that moves with wind and tide
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 103.75 113.31 <o,f0,male> the icy twenty nine degree water but as i got more involved in the story i realized that there were two big environmental issues i couldn't ignore the first was that these animals continue to be hunted
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 113.64 123.44 <o,f0,male> killed with hakapiks at about eight fifteen days old it actually is the largest marine mammal slaughter on the planet with hundreds of thousands of these seals being killed every year
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 134.76 141.79 <o,f0,male> and even though we see a lot of ice in this picture there's a lot of water as well which wasn't there historically and the ice that is there is quite
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 142.35 153.95 <o,f0,male> the problem is that these pups need a stable platform of solid ice in order to nurse from their moms they only need twelve days from the moment they're born until their on their own but if they don't get twelve days they can fall into the ocean and die
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 154.42 167.52 <o,f0,male> a photo that i made showing one of these pups that's only about five or seven days old still has a little bit of the umbilical cord on its belly that has fallen in because of the thin ice and the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe and to get it back to stable purchase
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 167.88 178.50 <o,f0,male> this problem has continued to grow each year since i was there i read that last year the pup mortality rate was one hundred percent in parts of the gulf of st lawrence so clearly this species has a lot of problems going forward
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 178.76 187.53 <o,f0,male> this ended up becoming a cover story at national geographic and it received quite a bit of attention and with that i saw the potential to begin doing other stories about ocean problems
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 187.80 197.57 <o,f0,male> so i proposed a story on the global fish crisis in part because i had personally witnessed a lot of degradation in the ocean over the last thirty years but also because i read a scientific paper
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 198.16 204.88 <o,f0,male> stated ninety percent of the big fish in the ocean have disappeared in the last fifty or sixty years these are the tuna the billfish and the sharks
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 205.45 214.86 <o,f0,male> and when i read that i was blown away by those numbers i thought this was going to be headline news in every media outlet but it really wasn 't so i wanted to do a story that was a very different kind of
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 224.70 232.54 <o,f0,male> the first component of the story that i thought was essential however was to give readers a sense of appreciation for the ocean animals that they were eating
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 232.88 240.20 <o,f0,male> i think people go into a restaurant and somebody orders a steak and we all know where steak comes from and somebody orders a chicken and we know what a chicken is
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 248.54 258.65 <o,f0,male> in reality these animals have no terrestrial counterpart they're unique in the world these are animals that can practically swim from the equator to the poles and can crisscross entire oceans in the course of a year
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 259.11 267.30 <o,f0,male> if we weren't so efficient at catching them because they grow their entire life would have thirty year old bluefin out there that weigh a ton but the truth is we're way too efficient at catching them
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 278.92 289.29 <o,f0,male> just warehouse after warehouse and as i wandered around and made these pictures it sort of occurred to me that the ocean 's not a grocery store you know we can't keep taking without expecting serious consequences as a result
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 290.20 298.56 <o,f0,male> i also with the story wanted to show readers how fish are caught some of the methods that are used to catch fish like a bottom trawler which is one of the most common methods in the world
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 298.89 308.55 <o,f0,male> this was a small net that was being used in mexico to catch shrimp but the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world you have a large net in the middle with two steal doors on either end and
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 308.81 320.29 <o,f0,male> as this assembly is towed through the water the doors meet resistance with the ocean and it opens the mouth of the net and they place floats at the top and a lead line on the bottom and this just drags over the bottom in this case to catch shrimp
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 320.55 330.65 <o,f0,male> but as you can imagine it's catching everything else in its path as well and it's destroying that precious benthic community on the bottom things like sponges and corals that critical habitat for other animals
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 345.61 359.38 <o,f0,male> so this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner maybe seven or eight shrimp and ten lbs of other animals that had to die in the process and to make that point even more visual i swam under the shrimp boat and made the this picture of the guy shoveling this bycatch into the sea as trash
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 359.77 371.38 <o,f0,male> and photographed this cascade of death you know animals like guitarfish bat rays flounder pufferfish that only an hour before were on the bottom of the ocean alive but now being thrown back as trash
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 371.74 380.33 <o,f0,male> i also wanted to focus on the shark fishing industry because currently on planet earth we're killing over one hundred million sharks every single year
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 380.58 391.21 <o,f0,male> but before i went out to photograph this component i sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark that will resonate with readers you know i think there's still a lot of people out there who think the only good shark is a dead shark
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 391.71 401.49 <o,f0,male> but this one morning i jumped in and found this thresher that had just recently died in the gill net and with its huge pectoral fins and eyes still very visible it struck me as sort of a crucifixion if you will
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 411.11 424.02 <o,f0,male> because i love sharks i'm somewhat obsessed with sharks i wanted to do another more celebratory story about sharks as a way of talking about the need for shark conservation so i went to the bahamas because there's very few places in the world where sharks are doing well these days but
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 424.31 436.15 <o,f0,male> the bahamas seem to be a place where stocks were reasonably healthy largely due to the fact that the government there had outlawed longlining several years ago and i wanted to show several species that we hadn't shown much in the magazine
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 436.58 450.87 <o,f0,male> and worked in a number of locations one of the locations was this place called tiger beach in the northern bahamas where tiger sharks aggregate in shallow water this is a low altitude photograph that i made showing our diving boat with about a dozen of these big old tiger sharks sort of just swimming around behind
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 451.30 460.30 <o,f0,male> but the one thing i definitely didn't want to do with this coverage was to continue to portray sharks as something like monsters i didn't want them to be overly threatening or scary
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 460.73 467.67 <o,f0,male> and with this photograph of a beautiful fifteen ft probably fourteen ft i guess female tiger shark i sort of think
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 468.07 478.86 <o,f0,male> got to that goal where she was swimming with these little barjacks off her nose and my strobe created a shadow on her face and i think it's a gentler picture a little less threatening a little more respectful of the species
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 488.42 499.33 <o,f0,male> creature but this an animal that's considered data deficient by science in both florida and in the bahamas you know we know almost nothing about them we don't know where they migrate to or from where they mate where they have their pups
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 499.59 507.70 <o,f0,male> and yet hammerhead populations in the atlantic have declined about eighty percent in the last twenty to thirty years you know we're losing them faster than we can possibly find them
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 508.20 517.08 <o,f0,male> this is the oceanic whitetip shark an animal that is considered the fourth most dangerous species if you pay attention to such lists but it's an animal that's about ninety eight percent
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 517.39 525.07 <o,f0,male> in decline throughout most of its range because this is a pelagic animal and it lives out in the deeper water and because we weren't working on the bottom i brought along
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 525.63 535.95 <o,f0,male> shark cage here and my friend shark biologist wes pratt is inside the cage you'll see that the photographer of course was not inside the cage here so clearly the biologist is a little smarter than the photographer i guess
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 536.35 545.64 <o,f0,male> and lastly with this story i also wanted to focus on baby sharks nurseries and i went to the island of bimini in the bahamas to work with lemon shark pups
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 545.95 552.60 <o,f0,male> this is a photo of a lemon shark pup and it shows these animals where they live for the first two to three years of their lives in these protective mangroves
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 568.27 576.24 <o,f0,male> on the rest of the reef after i left bimini i actually learned that this habitat was being bulldozed to create a new golf course and resort
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 576.97 588.33 <o,f0,male> and other recent stories have looked at single flagship species if you will that are at risk in the ocean as a way of talking about other threats one such story i did documented the leatherback sea turtle
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 588.64 598.83 <o,f0,male> this is the largest widest ranging deepest diving and oldest of all turtle species here we see a female crawling out of the ocean under moonlight on the island of trinidad
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 599.22 610.55 <o,f0,male> these are animals whose lineage dates back about one hundred million years and there was a time in their lifespan where they were coming out of the water to nest and saw tyrannosaurus rex running by and today they crawl out and see condominiums
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 611.07 622.33 <o,f0,male> but despite this amazing longevity they're now considered critically endangered in the pacific where i made this photograph their stocks have declined about ninety percent in the last fifteen years
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 622.79 631.24 <o,f0,male> this is a photograph that shows a hatchling about to taste saltwater for the very first time beginning this long and perilous journey only one in a thousand
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 667.55 678.00 <o,f0,male> another charismatic megafauna species that i worked with is the story i did on the right whale and essentially the story is this with right whales that about a million years ago there was one species of right whale on the planet
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 678.30 687.84 <o,f0,male> but as land masses moved around and oceans became isolated the species sort of separated and today we have essentially two distinct stocks we have the southern right whale that we see here
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 688.14 701.85 <o,f0,male> the north atlantic right whale that we see here with a mom and calf off the coast of florida now both species were hunted to the brink of extinction by the early whalers but the southern right whales have rebounded a lot better because they're located in places farther away from human activity
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 702.18 713.95 <o,f0,male> the north atlantic right whale is listed as the most endangered species on the planet today because they are urban whales they live along the east coast of north america united states and canada and they have to deal with these urban ills
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 714.24 726.53 <o,f0,male> this photo shows an animal popping its head out at sunset off the coast of florida you can see the coal burning plant in the background they have to deal with things like toxins and pharmaceuticals that are flushed out into the ocean and may be even affecting their reproduction
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 726.80 734.91 <o,f0,male> they also get entangled in fishing gear this is picture that shows the tail of a right whale and those white markings are not natural markings these are entanglement scars
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 744.30 752.77 <o,f0,male> the other problem is they get hit by ships and this was an animal that was struck by a ship in nova scotia canada being towed in where they did a necropsy to
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 770.04 776.70 <o,f0,male> sub antarctic of of new zealand a place called the auckland islands i went down there in the winter time and these are animals that had never seen humans before
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 785.49 798.58 <o,f0,male> and one of these amazingly beautiful forty five ft seventy ton whales like a city bus just swimming up you know they were in perfect condition very fat and healthy robust no entanglement scars the way they're suppose to
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 821.40 836.65 <o,f0,male> i settled on working in the country of new zealand because new zealand was rather progressive and is rather progressive in terms of protecting their ocean and i really wanted this story to be about three things i wanted it to be about abundance about diversity and about resilience and one of the first places i worked was
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 860.38 874.38 <o,f0,male> these fish predate on sea urchins and when the fish were all gone all anyone ever saw underwater was just acres and acres of sea urchins but when the fish came back and began predating and controlling the urchin population low and behold
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 874.82 881.89 <o,f0,male> kelp forests emerged in shallow water and that's because the urchins eat kelp so when the fish control the urchin population
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 882.21 889.38 <o,f0,male> the ocean was restored to its natural equilibrium you know this is probably how the ocean looked here one or two hundred years ago but nobody was around to tell us
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 890.02 900.31 <o,f0,male> i worked in other parts of new zealand as well in beautiful fragile protected areas like in fiordland where this sea pen colony was found little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 901.00 909.47 <o,f0,male> in the northern part of new zealand i dove in the blue water where the water 's a little warmer and photographed animals like this giant sting ray swimming through an underwater canyon
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 910.03 917.22 <o,f0,male> every part of the ecosystem in this place seems very healthy from tiny little animals like a nudibrank crawling over encrusting
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 918.03 924.39 <o,f0,male> or a leatherjacket that is a very important animal in this ecosystem because it grazes on the bottom and allows new life to take
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 925.29 938.27 <o,f0,male> i wanted to finish with this photograph a picture i made on a very stormy day in new zealand when i just laid on the bottom amidst a school of fish swirling around me and i was in a place that had only been protected about twenty years ago
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 938.61 948.77 <o,f0,male> and i talked to divers that had been diving there for many years and they said that the marine life was better here today than it was in the nineteen sixties and that's because it's been protected that it has come back
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 957.22 966.15 <o,f0,male> i became an underwater photographer because i fell in love with the sea and i make pictures of it today because i want to protect it and i don't think it's too late thank you very much
