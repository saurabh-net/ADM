CamilleSeaman_2011U 1 CamilleSeaman_2011U 28.56 34.23 <o,f0,female> i first went to antarctica almost ten years ago where i saw my first icebergs
CamilleSeaman_2011U 1 CamilleSeaman_2011U 34.23 53.22 <o,f0,female> i was in awe my heart beat fast my head was dizzy trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me the icebergs around me were almost two hundred feet out of the water and i could only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake
CamilleSeaman_2011U 1 CamilleSeaman_2011U 53.22 55.85 <o,f0,female> year after year
CamilleSeaman_2011U 1 CamilleSeaman_2011U 65.84 69.76 <o,f0,female> each iceberg has its own individual personality
CamilleSeaman_2011U 1 CamilleSeaman_2011U 69.76 86.44 <o,f0,female> they have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end while others can 't take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion
CamilleSeaman_2011U 1 CamilleSeaman_2011U 86.44 104.57 <o,f0,female> it 's easy to think when you look at an iceberg that they 're isolated that they 're separate and alone much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves but the reality is far from it as an iceberg melts i am breathing in its ancient atmosphere
CamilleSeaman_2011U 1 CamilleSeaman_2011U 104.57 114.22 <o,f0,female> as the iceberg melts it is releasing mineral rich fresh water that nourishes many forms of life
CamilleSeaman_2011U 1 CamilleSeaman_2011U 114.22 127.68 <o,f0,female> i approach photographing these icebergs as if i 'm making portraits of my ancestors knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again
CamilleSeaman_2011U 1 CamilleSeaman_2011U 127.68 136.3 <o,f0,female> it is not a death when they melt it is not an end but a continuation of their path through the cycle of life
CamilleSeaman_2011U 1 CamilleSeaman_2011U 141.17 151.65 <o,f0,female> some of the ice in the icebergs that i photograph is very young a couple thousand years old and some of the ice is over one hundred thousand years old
CamilleSeaman_2011U 1 CamilleSeaman_2011U 162.03 174.45 <o,f0,female> the last pictures i 'd like to show you are of an iceberg that i photographed in qeqetarsuaq greenland it 's a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling
CamilleSeaman_2011U 1 CamilleSeaman_2011U 174.45 189.15 <o,f0,female> so here it is you can see on the left side a small boat that 's about a fifteen foot boat and i 'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline
CamilleSeaman_2011U 1 CamilleSeaman_2011U 189.15 203.64 <o,f0,female> you can see here it begins to roll and the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there this is an average size greenlandic iceberg it 's about one hundred and twenty feet above the water or forty meters and this video is real time
