SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 16.52 33.3 <o,f0,male> grew up in bihar india 's poorest state and i remember when i was six years old i remember coming home one day to find a cart full of the most delicious sweets at our doorstep
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 33.3 52.18 <o,f0,male> my brothers and i dug in and that 's when my father came home he was livid and i still remember how we cried when that cart with our half eaten sweets was pulled away from us
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 52.18 68.92 <o,f0,male> later i understood why my father got so upset those sweets were a bribe from a contractor who was trying to get my father to award him a government contract my father
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 68.98 80.79 <o,f0,male> was responsible for building roads in bihar and he had developed a firm stance against corruption even though he was harassed and threatened
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 80.79 94.91 <o,f0,male> his was a lonely struggle because bihar was also india 's most corrupt state where public officials were enriching themselves rather than serving the poor who had
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 95.03 113.98 <o,f0,male> no means to express their anguish if their children had no food or no schooling and i experienced this most viscerally when i traveled to remote villages to study poverty
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 113.98 117.89 <o,f0,male> and as i went village to village
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 117.89 136.31 <o,f0,male> i remember one day when i was famished and exhausted and i was almost collapsing in a scorching heat under a tree and just at that time one of the poorest men in that village
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 136.31 139.27 <o,f0,male> invited me into his hut
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 139.27 152.81 <o,f0,male> and graciously fed me only i later realized that what he fed me was food for his entire family for two days
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 152.87 165.3 <o,f0,male> this profound gift of generosity challenged and changed the very purpose of my life i resolved to give back
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 165.3 175.64 <o,f0,male> later i joined the world bank which sought to fight such poverty by transferring aid from rich to poor countries
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 175.64 179.64 <o,f0,male> my initial work focused on uganda
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 194.21 201.63 <o,f0,male> newly built schools without textbooks or teachers new health clinics without drugs
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 208.77 218.37 <o,f0,male> all over again bihar represents the challenge of development abject poverty surrounded by corruption
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 218.37 225.77 <o,f0,male> globally one point three billion people live on less than dollar one point two five a day
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 239.73 252.99 <o,f0,male> five hundred founding fathers and one lonely founding mother gathered in new hampshire usa to establish the bretton woods institutions including the world bank
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 252.99 272.8 <o,f0,male> and that traditional approach to development had three key elements first transfer of resources from rich countries in the north to poorer countries in the south accompanied by reform prescriptions second the development institutions that channeled these transfers
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 279.77 294.21 <o,f0,male> and third the engagement in developing countries was with a narrow set of government elites with little interaction with the citizens who are the ultimate beneficiaries of development assistance
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 294.21 309.64 <o,f0,male> today each of these elements is opening up due to dramatic changes in the global environment open knowledge open aid open governance and together they represent three key shifts
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 320.31 329.29 <o,f0,male> the first key shift is open knowledge you know developing countries today will not simply accept solutions that
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 343.5 359.18 <o,f0,male> they want to know how china lifted five hundred million people out of poverty in thirty years how mexico 's oportunidades program improved schooling and nutrition for millions of children
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 359.18 377.34 <o,f0,male> this is the new ecosystem of open knowledge flows not just traveling north to south but south to south and even south to north with mexico 's oportunidades today inspiring new york city
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 377.34 390.5 <o,f0,male> and just as these north to south transfers are opening up so too are the development institutions that channeled these transfers this is the second shift open aid
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 390.5 402.96 <o,f0,male> recently the world bank opened its vault of data for public use releasing eight thousand economic and social indicators for two hundred countries over fifty years
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 402.96 411.03 <o,f0,male> and it launched a global competition to crowdsource innovative apps using this data
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 411.03 428.81 <o,f0,male> development institutions today are also opening for public scrutiny the projects they finance take geomapping in this map from kenya the red dots show where all the schools financed by donors are located
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 428.81 434.58 <o,f0,male> and the darker the shade of green the more the number of out of school children
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 434.58 451.82 <o,f0,male> so this simple mashup reveals that donors have not financed any schools in the areas with the most out of school children provoking new questions is development assistance targeting those who most need our help
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 451.82 466.16 <o,f0,male> in this manner the world bank has now geomapped thirty thousand project activities in one hundred and forty three countries and donors are using a common platform to map all their projects
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 466.16 474.03 <o,f0,male> this is a tremendous leap forward in transparency and accountability of aid
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 474.03 489.54 <o,f0,male> and this leads me to the third and in my view the most significant shift in development open governance governments today are opening up just as citizens are demanding voice and accountability from the
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 498.22 516.32 <o,f0,male> but also for development accountability are governments delivering services to the citizens so for instance several governments in africa and eastern europe are opening their budgets to the public
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 516.32 527.27 <o,f0,male> but you know there is a big difference between a budget that 's public and a budget that 's accessible this is a public budget
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 538.77 549.38 <o,f0,male> to tackle this problem governments are using new tools to visualize the budget so it 's more understandable to the public
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 563.08 582.64 <o,f0,male> tools like this help turn a shelf full of inscrutable documents into a publicly understandable visual and what 's exciting is that with this openness there are today new opportunities for citizens to give feedback
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 582.77 587.44 <o,f0,male> and engage with government so in the philippines today
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 605.95 623.05 <o,f0,male> and the government is responsive so for instance when it was reported on this website that eight hundred students were at risk because school repairs had stalled due to corruption the department of education in the philippines took swift action
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 623.05 635.79 <o,f0,male> and you know what 's exciting is that this innovation is now spreading south to south from the philippines to indonesia kenya moldova and beyond
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 666.39 683.08 <o,f0,male> and what is very exciting is that citizens were then able to give feedback as to which health or water points were not working aggregated in the red bubbles that you see which together
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 683.1 690.16 <o,f0,male> provides a graphic visual of the collective voices of the poor
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 690.16 703.66 <o,f0,male> today even bihar is turning around and opening up under a committed leadership that is making government transparent accessible and responsive to the poor
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 703.66 711.17 <o,f0,male> but you know in many parts of the world governments are not interested in opening up or
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 711.24 712.82 <o,f0,male> in serving the poor
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 712.85 724.98 <o,f0,male> and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system these are the lonely warriors like my father
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 725.14 731.17 <o,f0,male> and many many others and a key frontier of development work is to help
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 780.62 794.2 <o,f0,male> it was very late at night and at age eighty he was typing a seventy page public interest litigation against corruption in a road project
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 794.2 798.88 <o,f0,male> though he was no lawyer he argued the case
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 798.88 809.53 <o,f0,male> court himself the next day he won the ruling but later that very evening he fell and he died
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 809.53 817.17 <o,f0,male> he fought till the end increasingly passionate that to combat corruption
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 817.17 833.5 <o,f0,male> and poverty not only did government officials need to be honest but citizens needed to join together to make their voices heard these became the two bookends of his life
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 833.5 840.7 <o,f0,male> and the journey he traveled in between mirrored the changing development landscape
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 840.7 845.83 <o,f0,male> today i 'm inspired by these changes and i
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 845.83 856.31 <o,f0,male> excited that at the world bank we are embracing these new directions a significant departure from my work in uganda twenty years ago
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 856.31 869.65 <o,f0,male> we need to radically open up development so knowledge flows in multiple directions inspiring practitioners so aid becomes transparent accountable and effective
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 869.65 879.49 <o,f0,male> so governments open up and citizens are engaged and empowered with reformers in government we need to accelerate these shifts
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 879.49 885.92 <o,f0,male> if we do we will find that the collective voices
SanjayPradhan_2012G 1 SanjayPradhan_2012G 899.5 910.57 <o,f0,male> we will find that these children too have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty thank you
