RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 16.78 26.17 <o,f0,male> really want to understand the problem that we're facing with the oceans you have to think about the biology at the same time you think about the physics
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 26.67 34.72 <o,f0,male> we can't solve the problems unless we start studying the ocean in a very much more interdisciplinary way so i'm going to demonstrate that
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 35.06 45.22 <o,f0,male> through discussion of some of the climate change things that are going on in the ocean we'll look at sea level rise we'll look at ocean warming and then the last thing on the list there ocean acidification
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 45.58 56.91 <o,f0,male> if you were to ask me you know what do you worry about the most what frightens you for me it's ocean acidification and this has come onto the stage pretty recently so i will spend a little time at the end
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 57.52 68.28 <o,f0,male> i was in copenhagen in december like a number of you in this room and i think we all found it simultaneously an eye opening and a very frustrating experience
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 68.64 77.00 <o,f0,male> i sat in this large negotiation hall at one point for three or four hours without hearing the word oceans one time
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 77.65 89.27 <o,f0,male> it really wasn't on the radar screen the nations that brought it up when we had the speeches of the national leaders it tended to be the leaders of the small island states the low lying island states
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 89.74 96.43 <o,f0,male> and by this weird quirk of alphabetical order of the nations a lot of the low lying states like
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 98.21 109.20 <o,f0,male> they were seated at the very end of these immensely long rows you know they were marginalized in the negotiation room one of the problems is coming up with the right target
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 109.80 123.53 <o,f0,male> it's not clear what the target should be and how can you figure out how to fix something if you don't have a clear target now you've heard about two degrees that we should limit temperature rise to no more than two degrees but there's not a lot of science behind that number
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 173.89 184.60 <o,f0,male> now why is this so complicated why don't we know some of these things a little bit better well the problem is that we've got very complicated forces in the climate system there's all kinds of natural causes of climate change
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 185.43 192.32 <o,f0,male> air sea interactions here in galapagos we're affected by el ninos and la nina but the entire planet warms up when there's a big
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 208.61 221.84 <o,f0,male> and we know the solar output 's not constant through time so those are all natural causes of climate change and then we have the human induced causes of climate change as well we're changing the characteristics of the surface of the land the reflectivity
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 222.46 231.04 <o,f0,male> we inject our own aerosols into the atmosphere and we have trace gases and not just carbon dioxide it's methane ozone oxides of sulfur and nitrogen
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 231.46 242.81 <o,f0,male> so here 's the thing it sounds like a simple question is co two produced by man 's activities causing the planet to warm up but to answer that question to make a clear attribution to carbon dioxide
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 243.27 253.29 <o,f0,male> you have to know something about all of these other agents of change but the fact is we do know a lot about all of those things you know thousands of scientists have been working on
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 265.82 273.94 <o,f0,male> now we have many ways to study natural variability i'll show you a few examples of this now this is the ship that i spent the last three months on in the antarctic
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 274.42 283.50 <o,f0,male> a scientific drilling vessel we go out for months at a time and drill into the sea bed to recover sediments that tell us stories of climate change
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 284.10 295.85 <o,f0,male> like one of the ways to understand our greenhouse future is to drill down in time to the last period where we had co two double what it is today and so that's what we've done with this ship this was
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 296.77 307.40 <o,f0,male> this is south of the antarctic circle it looks downright tropical there one day where we had calm seas and sun which was the reason i could get off the ship most of the time it looked like this we
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 308.98 318.13 <o,f0,male> waves up to fifty ft and winds averaging about forty knots for most of the voyage and up to seventy or eighty knots so that trip just ended
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 318.49 326.20 <o,f0,male> and i can't show you too many results from that right now but we'll go back one more year to another drilling expedition i've been involved in this was led by
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 327.56 333.11 <o,f0,male> tim naish it's the andrill project and we made the very first bore hole through the largest
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 342.11 351.90 <o,f0,male> and we drilled in the ross sea that's the ross sea ice shelf on the right there so this huge floating ice shelf the size of alaska comes from west antarctica
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 352.27 365.39 <o,f0,male> now west antarctica is the part of the continent where the ice is grounded on sea floor as much as two thousand meters deep so that ice sheet is partly floating and it's exposed to the ocean to the ocean heat
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 366.20 372.16 <o,f0,male> this is the part of antarctica that we worry about because it's partly floating you can imagine is sea level rises a little bit
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 372.45 385.51 <o,f0,male> the ice lifts off the bed and then it can break off and float north when that ice melts sea level rises by six meters so we drill back in time to see how often that's happened and exactly how fast that ice can melt
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 396.54 402.26 <o,f0,male> the deepest geological bore hole ever drilled it took about ten years to put this project together
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 402.70 410.90 <o,f0,male> and here 's what we found now there's forty scientists working on this project and people are doing all kinds of really complicated and expensive analyses
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 411.60 419.73 <o,f0,male> but it turns out you know the thing that told the best story was this simple visual description you know we saw this in the core samples as they came up
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 421.52 426.77 <o,f0,male> between sediments that look like this there's gravel and cobbles in there and a bunch of sand
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 427.40 437.07 <o,f0,male> that's the kind of material in the deep sea it can only get there if it's carried out by ice so we know there's an ice shelf overhead and that alternates with a sediment that looks like this
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 437.32 444.64 <o,f0,male> this is absolutely beautiful stuff this sediment is one hundred percent made up of the shells of microscopic plants
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 445.13 458.54 <o,f0,male> and these plants need sunlight so we know when we find that sediment there's no ice overhead and we saw about thirty five alternations between open water and ice covered water between gravels and these plant sediments
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 458.85 471.89 <o,f0,male> so what that means is what it tells us is that the ross sea region this ice shelf melted back and formed anew about thirty five times and this is in the past four million years
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 472.87 480.68 <o,f0,male> this was completely unexpected nobody imagined that the west antarctic ice sheet was this dynamic in fact the lore for many years has been
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 480.98 487.68 <o,f0,male> the ice formed many tens of millions of years ago and it's been there ever since and now we know that in our recent past
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 487.90 496.58 <o,f0,male> it melted back and formed again and sea level went up and down six meters at a time what caused it well we're pretty sure that it's very small changes
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 504.28 515.20 <o,f0,male> the other thing we found out is that the ice sheet passed a threshold that the planet warmed up enough and the number 's about one degree to one and a half degrees centigrade the planet warmed up enough that it became
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 515.75 525.92 <o,f0,male> that ice sheet became very dynamic and was very easily melted and you know what we've actually changed the temperature in the last century just the right amount so
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 526.32 539.94 <o,f0,male> many of us are convinced now that west antarctica the west antarctic ice sheet is starting to melt we do expect to see a sea level rise on the order of one to two meters by the end of this century and it could be larger than that
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 540.36 548.40 <o,f0,male> this is a serious consequence for nations like kiribati you know where the average elevation is about a little over a meter above sea level
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 562.00 570.81 <o,f0,male> and it's covered with algae that's what happens when these things die immediately organisms come in and encrust and live on that dead surface
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 571.27 581.41 <o,f0,male> and so when a coral colony is killed by an el nino event it leaves this indelible record you can go then and study corals and figure out how often do you see this
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 581.90 591.23 <o,f0,male> so one of the things thought of in the eighties was to go back and take cores of coral heads throughout the galapagos and find out how often was there a devastating event and just
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 601.50 612.99 <o,f0,male> what we found after drilling back in time two to four hundred years was that these were unique events we saw no other mass mortality events so these events in our recent past really are unique
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 613.27 623.88 <o,f0,male> so they're either just truly monster el ninos or they're just very strong el ninos that occurred against a backdrop of global warming either case it's bad news for the corals
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 627.19 637.36 <o,f0,male> here 's how we sample the corals this is actually easter island look at this monster this coral is eight meters tall right and it been growing for about six hundred years
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 652.35 660.53 <o,f0,male> so we have a diamond drill we're not killing the colony we're taking a small core sample out of the top the core comes up as these cylindrical tubes of limestone
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 661.06 672.04 <o,f0,male> and that material then we take back to the lab and analyze it you can see some of the coral cores there on the right so we've done that all over the eastern pacific we're starting to do it in the western pacific as well
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 726.93 741.09 <o,f0,male> then their other attribute is that they have this great chemistry we can analyze the carbonate that makes up the coral and there's a whole bunch of things we can do but in this case we measured the different isotopes of oxygen their ratio tells us the water temperature
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 741.47 749.57 <o,f0,male> in this example here we had monitored this reef in galapagos with temperature recorders so we know the temperature of the water the coral 's growing
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 750.16 762.91 <o,f0,male> then after we harvest a coral we measure this ratio and now you can see those curves match perfectly in this case at these islands you know corals are instrumental quality recorders of change in the water
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 763.26 770.80 <o,f0,male> and of course our thermometers only take us back fifty years or so here the coral can take us back hundreds and thousands of years
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 771.26 779.50 <o,f0,male> so what we do we've merged a lot of different data sets it's not just my group there's maybe thirty groups worldwide doing this but
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 779.80 786.36 <o,f0,male> we get these instrumental and near instrumental quality records of temperature change that go back hundreds of years and we put them together
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 786.77 800.16 <o,f0,male> here 's a synthetic diagram there's a whole family of curves here but what's happening we're looking at the last thousand years of temperature on the planet and there's five or six different compilations there but each one of those compilations reflects
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 800.82 808.42 <o,f0,male> input from hundreds of these kinds of records from corals we do similar things with ice cores we work with tree rings
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 808.85 815.80 <o,f0,male> and that's how we discover what is truly natural and how different is the last century right
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 816.22 824.41 <o,f0,male> and i chose this one because it's complicated and messy looking right this is as messy as it gets you can see there's some
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 825.45 833.85 <o,f0,male> signals there some of the records show lower temperatures than others some of them show greater variability but they all
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 834.22 840.42 <o,f0,male> tell us what the natural variability is some of them are from the northern hemisphere some are from the entire globe
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 849.60 861.45 <o,f0,male> and there is natural variability caused by the sun caused by el ninos a century scale decadal scale variability and we know the magnitude it's about two tenths to four tenths of a degree centigrade
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 861.96 870.55 <o,f0,male> but then at the very end is where we have the instrumental record in black and there's the temperature up there in two thousand and nine you know we've warmed the globe
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 871.02 883.79 <o,f0,male> about a degree centigrade in the last century and there's nothing in the natural part of that record that resembles what we've seen in the last century you know that's the strength of our argument that we are doing something that's truly
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 884.00 891.23 <o,f0,male> different so i'll close with a short discussion of ocean acidification
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 891.47 904.53 <o,f0,male> i like it as a component of global change to talk about because even if you are a hard bitten global warming skeptic and i talk to that community fairly often you cannot deny the simple physics
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 905.13 917.12 <o,f0,male> of co two dissolving in the ocean you know we're pumping out lots of co two into the atmosphere from fossil fuels from cement production right now about a third of that carbon dioxide is dissolving straight into the sea
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 918.22 923.32 <o,f0,male> it does so it makes the ocean more acidic so
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 923.45 935.34 <o,f0,male> you cannot argue with that that is what's happening right now and it's a very different issue than the global warming issue it has many consequences there's consequences for carbonate organisms
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 936.34 948.91 <o,f0,male> many organisms that build their shells out of calcium carbonate plants and animals both the main framework material of coral reefs is calcium carbonate that material is more soluble
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 950.09 955.59 <o,f0,male> acidic fluid so one of the things we're seeing is organisms are having to
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 956.26 964.36 <o,f0,male> more metabolic energy to build and maintain their shells at some point as this transience as this co two uptake in the ocean continues
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 964.78 975.54 <o,f0,male> that material 's actually going to start to dissolve and on coral reefs where some of the main framework organisms disappear we will see a major loss of marine biodiversity
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 975.91 980.75 <o,f0,male> but it's not just the carbonate producers that are affected there's many physiological
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 992.64 1006.61 <o,f0,male> greater metabolic demands reduced reproductive success changes in respiration and metabolism you know these are things that we have good physiological reasons to expect to see stressed caused by this transience so
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 1007.08 1016.76 <o,f0,male> we figured out some pretty interesting ways to track co two levels in the atmosphere going back millions of years we used to do it just with ice cores but in this case we're going back
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 1017.16 1026.72 <o,f0,male> twenty million years and we take samples of the sediment and it tells us the co two level of the ocean and therefore the co two level of the atmosphere and here 's the thing
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 1027.09 1040.63 <o,f0,male> you have to go back about fifteen million years to find a time when co two levels were about what they are today you have to go back about thirty million years to find a time when co two levels were double what they are today
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 1050.26 1058.35 <o,f0,male> that's the reason that they're not able to respond or adapt to this rapid acidification that's going on right now
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 1058.82 1067.03 <o,f0,male> so charlie veron came up with this statement last year the prospect of ocean acidification may well be the most serious
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 1067.26 1076.34 <o,f0,male> of all of the predicted outcomes of anthropogenic co two release and i think that may very well be true so i'll close with this
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 1076.76 1087.69 <o,f0,male> you know we do need the protected areas absolutely but for the sake of the oceans we have to cap or limit co two emissions as soon as possible thank you very much
