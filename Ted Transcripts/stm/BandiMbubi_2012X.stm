BandiMbubi_2012X 1 BandiMbubi_2012X 22.02 34.48 <o,f0,male> i came to the u k twenty one years ago as an asylum seeker i was twenty one i was forced to leave the democratic republic of the congo
BandiMbubi_2012X 1 BandiMbubi_2012X 34.51 38.01 <o,f0,male> my home where i was a student activist
BandiMbubi_2012X 1 BandiMbubi_2012X 40.52 44.28 <o,f0,male> i would love my children to be able to meet my family in the congo
BandiMbubi_2012X 1 BandiMbubi_2012X 70.21 73.4 <o,f0,male> how naturally your finger slides towards the buttons
BandiMbubi_2012X 1 BandiMbubi_2012X 91.22 96.45 <o,f0,male> but what you hold in your hand leaves a bloody trail

BandiMbubi_2012X 1 BandiMbubi_2012X 166.43 183.03 <o,f0,male> rape is used as a weapon of war instilling fear and depopulating whole areas the quest for extracting this mineral has not only aided but it has fueled
BandiMbubi_2012X 1 BandiMbubi_2012X 183.03 189.06 <o,f0,male> the ongoing war in the congo
BandiMbubi_2012X 1 BandiMbubi_2012X 189.06 200.14 <o,f0,male> but don 't throw away your phones yet thirty thousand children are enlisted and are made to fight
BandiMbubi_2012X 1 BandiMbubi_2012X 202.11 209.72 <o,f0,male> the congo consistently scores dreadfully in global health and poverty rankings
BandiMbubi_2012X 1 BandiMbubi_2012X 209.72 222.87 <o,f0,male> but remarkably the u n environmental programme has estimated the wealth of the country to be over twenty four trillion dollars
BandiMbubi_2012X 1 BandiMbubi_2012X 227.99 239.41 <o,f0,male> the state regulated mining industry has collapsed and control over mines has splintered coltan is easily controlled by armed groups

BandiMbubi_2012X 1 BandiMbubi_2012X 278.48 295.97 <o,f0,male> as with the arab spring during the recent elections in the congo voters were able to send text messages of local polling stations to the headquarters in the capital kinshasa
BandiMbubi_2012X 1 BandiMbubi_2012X 295.97 307.11 <o,f0,male> and in the wake of the result the diaspora has joined with the carter center the catholic church
BandiMbubi_2012X 1 BandiMbubi_2012X 313.19 318.66 <o,f0,male> the mobile phone has given people around the world
BandiMbubi_2012X 1 BandiMbubi_2012X 334.85 352.03 <o,f0,male> so we are faced with a paradox the mobile phone is an instrument of freedom and an instrument of oppression
BandiMbubi_2012X 1 BandiMbubi_2012X 368.12 374.38 <o,f0,male> who makes it and for what
BandiMbubi_2012X 1 BandiMbubi_2012X 374.38 380.13 <o,f0,male> here i am speaking directly to you the ted community and

BandiMbubi_2012X 1 BandiMbubi_2012X 401.83 406.65 <o,f0,male> there is no clear fair trade solution
BandiMbubi_2012X 1 BandiMbubi_2012X 406.65 422.79 <o,f0,male> but there has been a huge amount of progress the u s has recently passed legislation to target bribery and misconduct in the congo recent u k legislation could be used in the same way
BandiMbubi_2012X 1 BandiMbubi_2012X 437.5 451.55 <o,f0,male> there are campaigns spreading across university campuses to make their colleges conflict free but we 're not there yet we need to continue mounting pressure
BandiMbubi_2012X 1 BandiMbubi_2012X 451.56 457.62 <o,f0,male> on phone companies to change their sourcing processes
BandiMbubi_2012X 1 BandiMbubi_2012X 457.62 476.34 <o,f0,male> when i first came to the u k twenty one years ago i was homesick i missed my family and the friends i left behind communication was extremely difficult sending and receiving letters took months
BandiMbubi_2012X 1 BandiMbubi_2012X 476.34 481.76 <o,f0,male> if you were lucky
BandiMbubi_2012X 1 BandiMbubi_2012X 509.22 525.98 <o,f0,male> why should we allow such a wonderful brilliant and necessary product to be the cause of unnecessary suffering for human beings
