SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 16.14 20.55 <o,f0,female> happy most of the time because i think this is the happiest species on the planet
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 21.39 25.59 <o,f0,female> it's kind of a well kept secret this species lives only in the congo
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 26.10 30.55 <o,f0,female> and they're not in too many zoos because of their sexual behavior
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 39.74 47.44 <o,f0,female> actually we have a lot to learn from them because they're a very egalitarian society and they're a very empathetic society
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 56.62 58.71 <o,f0,female> and it's used for communication
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 72.40 74.68 <o,f0,female> and so everything sort of has a place that it has to
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 75.89 78.64 <o,f0,female> but i don't think that we were that way initially
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 87.68 90.74 <o,f0,female> maybe it's his ability to have causal thought
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 91.78 96.34 <o,f0,female> maybe it's something special in his brain that allows him to have language
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 97.34 99.52 <o,f0,female> maybe it's something special in his brain
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 99.89 101.94 <o,f0,female> that allows him to make tools
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 106.86 108.88 <o,f0,female> there were tasmanians
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 109.64 112.32 <o,f0,female> who were discovered around the sixteen hundreds and they had
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 117.50 119.22 <o,f0,female> to our knowledge they had no music
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 121.50 123.43 <o,f0,female> so when you compare them to the
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 126.36 126.65 <o,f0,female> the
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 130.04 131.37 <o,f0,female> he doesn't stand quite
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 143.01 144.32 <o,f0,female> how we got to where we are
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 145.87 147.87 <o,f0,female> i don't really think it's in our biology
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 148.26 150.21 <o,f0,female> i think we've attributed it to our biology
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 150.77 152.34 <o,f0,female> but i don't really think it's there
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 153.14 156.59 <o,f0,female> so what i want to do now is introduce you to a species called the bonobo
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 170.88 172.64 <o,f0,female> and she came to us when she was a
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 173.24 176.34 <o,f0,female> just at puberty about six or seven years of age
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 177.32 180.99 <o,f0,female> now this shows a bonobo on your right and a chimpanzee on your left
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 186.69 189.45 <o,f0,female> although shorter than us and their arms still longer
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 190.01 192.80 <o,f0,female> is more upright just as we are
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 215.10 220.57 <o,f0,female> have to rotate quite so much from side to side so the the bipedal gait is a little easier
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 220.79 229.15 <o,f0,female> and now we see all four the wild bonobo lives in central africa in the jungle encircled by the congo
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 233.52 239.50 <o,f0,female> trees as tall as forty meters one hundred and thirty feet grow densely in the area
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 240.88 249.10 <o,f0,female> it was a japanese scientist who first undertook serious field studies of the bonobo almost three decades
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 253.40 257.08 <o,f0,female> bonobos are built slightly smaller than the
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 259.51 261.93 <o,f0,female> by nature very gentle creatures
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 263.79 267.78 <o,f0,female> long and careful studies have reported many new findings on
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 270.76 272.61 <o,f0,female> one discovery was that
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 283.82 286.99 <o,f0,female> to walk upright for long distances
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 295.66 296.17 <o,f0,female> and then go to the
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 301.57 303.73 <o,f0,female> you will see in this particular video
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 334.89 336.00 <o,f0,female> more sticks too
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 343.20 345.19 <o,f0,female> i have a lighter in my pocket if you need one
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 354.11 356.86 <o,f0,female> i hope i have a lighter you can use the lighter to start the fire
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 359.67 363.82 <o,f0,female> very interested in fire he doesn't do it yet without a lighter
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 367.29 368.05 <o,f0,female> might be able to do
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 390.73 392.10 <o,f0,female> is a smile on the face of
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 398.68 400.57 <o,f0,female> some water on the fire you see the water
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 425.31 426.88 <o,f0,female> this is his sister this is her
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 454.96 457.99 <o,f0,female> she knows that that individual in the mirror is her
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 461.48 472.63 <o,f0,female> by raising bonobos in a culture that is both bonobo and human and documenting their development across two decades scientists are exploring how
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 481.30 482.98 <o,f0,female> it means star in
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 493.86 494.77 <o,f0,female> is trying to
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 499.60 508.92 <o,f0,female> in the wild the parent bonobo is known to groom its offspring here panbanisha uses scissors instead of her hands to
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 533.90 537.75 <o,f0,female> tries to imitate panbanisha by using the scissors himself
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 540.77 549.13 <o,f0,female> realizing that nyota might get hurt panbanisha like any human mother carefully tugs to get the scissors back
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 564.97 566.70 <o,f0,female> cut through tough animal
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 573.01 579.22 <o,f0,female> have made them two and a half million years ago by holding the rocks in both hands to strike one against
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 580.91 591.16 <o,f0,female> he has learnt that by using both hands and aiming his glancing blows he can make much larger sharper flakes kanzi chooses a flake he
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 597.47 606.75 <o,f0,female> the tough hide is difficult to cut even with a knife the rock that kanzi is using is extremely hard and ideal for stone tool making
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 606.91 615.28 <o,f0,female> but difficult to handle requiring great skill kanzi 's rock is from gona ethiopia and is identical to that used by our
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 616.10 618.60 <o,f0,female> ancestors two and a half million years ago
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 621.92 629.08 <o,f0,female> these are the rocks kanzi used and these are the flakes he made the flat sharp edges are like knife
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 631.48 637.99 <o,f0,female> compare them to the tools our ancestors used they bear a striking resemblance to kanzi 's
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 655.46 658.04 <o,f0,female> this is let me show you something we didn't think they would do
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 669.79 673.34 <o,f0,female> but since i'm advised not to do what i normally do i haven't told you that
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 680.32 680.88 <o,f0,female> she
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 690.75 694.06 <o,f0,female> now she comes up to doctor sue and starts writing again
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 694.94 696.36 <o,f0,female> these are her symbols on
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 727.43 728.12 <o,f0,female> very
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 738.38 739.84 <o,f0,female> place in the woods the
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 741.49 742.26 <o,f0,female> similar to
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 746.89 749.47 <o,f0,female> the next symbol panbanisha writes represents
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 753.16 754.47 <o,f0,female> when she goes out
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 757.30 764.04 <o,f0,female> this symbol is not as clear as the others but one can see panbanisha is trying to produce
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 764.77 766.15 <o,f0,female> line and several straight
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 768.29 774.69 <o,f0,female> researchers began to record what panbanisha said by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 782.97 784.75 <o,f0,male> stunned scientists around
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 794.66 796.53 <o,f0,female> it's simply to use language around
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 797.67 805.13 <o,f0,female> because the driving force in language acquisition is to understand what others that are important to you are saying to you
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 814.74 822.62 <o,f0,female> so we want to create an environment in which bonobos like all of the individuals with whom they are interacting we want to create an environment
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 831.58 836.07 <o,f0,female> this environment brings out unexpected potential in kanzi and panbanisha
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 849.17 856.04 <o,f0,female> until nyota now one year old steals it then he peers eagerly into his mother 's mouth
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 856.67 858.92 <o,f0,female> looking for where the sound came from
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 859.51 863.28 <o,f0,female> doctor sue thinks it's important to allow such curiosity
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 874.43 883.93 <o,f0,female> this time panbanisha is playing the electric piano she wasn't forced to learn the piano she saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 935.14 936.86 <o,f0,female> which promotes the emergence
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 960.54 965.83 <o,f0,female> stay away from them now now you can chase them again time to
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 985.16 988.02 <o,f0,female> very good thank you so much
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1013.99 1017.17 <o,f0,female> learning how to communicate with them in really high pitched tones
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1018.11 1020.88 <o,f0,female> we're learning that they probably have a language in the wild
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1 SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004 1027.19 1031.86 <o,f0,female> so we're sharing tools and technology and language with another species
