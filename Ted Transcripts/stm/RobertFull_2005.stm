RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 12.91 13.77 <o,f0,male> you to imagine
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 15.40 17.55 <o,f0,male> you're a student in my lab
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 25.20 28.88 <o,f0,male> you to help me create a fully three d dynamic parameterized contact model
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 33.55 37.44 <o,f0,male> and it is a true challenge and i do want you to help me of course in the challenge there is a prize
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 41.32 46.16 <o,f0,male> but it is an exclusive t shirt from our lab so please send me your ideas
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 48.51 50.20 <o,f0,male> how to design a foot
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 59.13 69.32 <o,f0,male> the lower extremity of a leg that is in direct contact with the ground in standing or walking that's the traditional definition but if you wanted to really do research what do you have to do you have to go to the literature and look up what's known about feet
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 75.60 76.95 <o,f0,male> there are many many feet
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 79.21 87.87 <o,f0,male> need to survey all feet and extract principles of how they work and i want you to help me do that in this next clip as you see this clip look for principles
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 91.97 93.41 <o,f0,male> in order to understand
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 94.08 95.08 <o,f0,male> how a foot works
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 223.10 227.94 <o,f0,male> it's a design inspired by nature but it's not a copy of any specific foot you just looked at
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 228.24 229.54 <o,f0,male> but it's a synthesis of the
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 233.46 241.87 <o,f0,male> it turns out that animals can go anywhere they can locomote on substrates that vary as you saw in the probability of contact the movement of that surface
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 242.06 251.15 <o,f0,male> and the type of footholds that are present if you want to study how a foot works we're going to have to simulate those surfaces or simulate that debris
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 251.52 253.95 <o,f0,male> when we did that here 's a new experiment that we did
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 254.96 265.20 <o,f0,male> we put an animal and had it run this grass spider on a surface with ninety nine percent of the contact area removed but it didn't even slow down the animal it's still running at the human equivalent of three hundred miles per hour
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 267.47 279.81 <o,f0,male> well look more carefully when we slow it down fifty times we see how the leg is hitting that simulated debris the leg is acting as a foot and in fact the animal contacts other parts of its leg
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 279.93 286.52 <o,f0,male> more frequently than the traditionally defined foot the foot is distributed along the whole leg
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 293.46 296.67 <o,f0,male> passing some cockroaches around take a look at their feet
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 298.50 300.07 <o,f0,male> here 's what it does it doesn't even slow
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 301.30 305.35 <o,f0,male> can run the same speed without even that segment no problem for the cockroach they can grow them back if you care
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 318.15 323.80 <o,f0,male> very effective now the question we had is how general is a distributed foot
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 324.90 328.97 <o,f0,male> and the next behavior i'll show you of this animal just
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 329.61 331.30 <o,f0,male> stunned us the first time
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 341.15 343.00 <o,f0,male> that's a bipedal octopus
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 344.17 346.14 <o,f0,male> that's disguised as a rolling coconut
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 349.39 354.34 <o,f0,male> it was discovered by christina huffard and filmed by sea studios right here from monterey
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 356.47 357.60 <o,f0,male> we've also described
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 358.20 359.65 <o,f0,male> another species of
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 365.30 368.05 <o,f0,male> walks on two legs and it holds the other arms up in the air
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 368.80 370.19 <o,f0,male> so that it can't be seen
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 375.74 376.86 <o,f0,male> to get over
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 380.85 382.96 <o,f0,male> uses that beautiful distributed foot
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 385.55 387.17 <o,f0,male> those obstacles are not even there
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 395.28 397.71 <o,f0,male> he thought he created an animal fantasy
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 398.76 407.61 <o,f0,male> but we know that art imitates life and it turns out nature three million years ago evolved the next animal it's a shrimp like animal called the stomatopod and here 's how it moves on the beaches of
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 424.33 434.20 <o,f0,male> if we want to then to our blueprint add the first important feature we want to add distributed foot contact not just with the traditional foot but also the leg and even of the body
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 434.74 442.90 <o,f0,male> can this help us inspire the design of novel robots we biologically inspired this robot named rhex built by these extraordinary
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 443.68 451.94 <o,f0,male> engineers over the last few years rhex 's foot started off to be quite simple then it got tuned over time and ultimately resulted in this half circle
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 453.35 462.22 <o,f0,male> why is that the video will show you watch where the robot now contacts its leg in order to deal with this very difficult terrain
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 470.15 471.72 <o,f0,male> over this you can see it here well on this
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 480.10 491.77 <o,f0,male> really simple but beautiful now you might have noticed something else about the animals when they were running over the rough terrain and my assistant 's going to help me here when you touched the cockroach leg can you
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 498.67 505.93 <o,f0,male> it's spiny right it's really spiny isn't it it sort of hurts maybe we could give it to our curator and see if he'd be brave enough to touch the
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 512.44 522.81 <o,f0,male> that they have spines and until a few weeks ago no one knew what they did they assumed that they were for protection and for sensory structures we found that they're for something else here 's a segment of
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 523.97 533.89 <o,f0,male> tuned such that they easily collapse in one direction to pull the leg out from debris but they're stiff in the other direction so they capture disparities in the surface
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 534.44 538.49 <o,f0,male> now crabs don't miss footholds because they normally move on sand until they come to our lab
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 540.26 543.96 <o,f0,male> a problem with this kind of mesh because they don't have spines
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 545.00 549.23 <o,f0,male> the crabs are missing spines so they have a problem in this kind of rough terrain
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 549.59 551.58 <o,f0,male> but of course we can deal with that
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 552.30 563.59 <o,f0,male> because we can produce artificial spines we can make spines that catch on simulated debris and collapse on removal to easily pull them out we did that by putting these artificial spines on
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 566.97 575.07 <o,f0,male> do we really understand that principle of tuning the answer is yes this is slowed down twenty fold and the crab just zooms across that simulated debris
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 580.55 583.07 <o,f0,male> so to our blueprint we need to add tuned spines
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 596.28 605.76 <o,f0,male> my colleagues did this at u penn dan koditschek put some steel nails very simple version on the robot and here 's rhex now going over those steel those rails
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 606.61 612.96 <o,f0,male> no problem how does it do it let 's slow it down and you can see the spines in action watch the leg come around and you'll see it grab on right there
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 614.13 617.92 <o,f0,male> do that before it would just slip and get stuck and tip over and watch again right there
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 621.21 625.85 <o,f0,male> just because we have a distributed foot and spines doesn't mean you can climb vertical surfaces
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 626.63 628.49 <o,f0,male> this is really really difficult
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 644.02 652.99 <o,f0,male> the animal effectively climbs by slipping and look and doing actually terribly with respect to grabbing on the surface it looks in fact like it's swimming up the surface
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 653.41 660.91 <o,f0,male> can actually model that behavior better as a fluid if you look at it the distributed foot actually is working more like a paddle
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 662.02 665.58 <o,f0,male> the same is true when we looked at this lizard running on fluidized sand
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 666.34 675.54 <o,f0,male> watch its feet it's actually functioning as a paddle even though it's interacting with a surface that we normally think of as a solid
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 700.47 703.10 <o,f0,male> now converted into an incredibly maneuverable
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 716.67 728.69 <o,f0,male> at stanford university one of my collaborators is an extraordinary engineer who developed this technique called shape deposition manufacturing where he can imbed claws right into an artificial foot and here 's the simple version
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 728.85 730.83 <o,f0,male> of a foot for a new robot that i'll show you
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 731.72 733.64 <o,f0,male> so to our blueprint let 's attach claws
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 735.48 741.41 <o,f0,male> look at animals though to be really maneuverable in all surfaces the animals use hybrid mechanisms that include claws and spines and
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 752.54 757.35 <o,f0,male> you see the hairs and the claws and this thing here this is when its foot is is in the air
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 765.34 767.71 <o,f0,male> pad comes out and that's where the glue is
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 770.07 777.05 <o,f0,male> here from underneath is an ant foot and when the claws don't dig in that pad automatically comes out without the ant doing anything
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 777.96 780.46 <o,f0,male> it just extrudes and this was a hard shot to get i think this is
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 781.23 783.04 <o,f0,male> the ant foot on the superstrings
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 785.66 788.00 <o,f0,male> this is what it looks like close up here 's the ant foot
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 801.04 803.69 <o,f0,male> now you might think for smooth surfaces we get inspiration here
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 804.37 806.03 <o,f0,male> now we have something better here
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 806.76 815.36 <o,f0,male> the gecko 's a really great example of nanotechnology in nature these are its feet they're almost look alien and the secret which they stick on with
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 819.70 830.23 <o,f0,male> they can run up a surface at a meter per second take thirty steps in that one second you can hardly see them if we slow it down they attach their feet at eight milliseconds and detach them in sixteen milliseconds
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 838.29 841.40 <o,f0,male> peel away from the surface like you'd peel away a piece of tape
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 842.66 843.72 <o,f0,male> very strange
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 846.21 851.84 <o,f0,male> if you look at their feet they have leaf like structures called linalae with millions of hairs and each hair has the worst case
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 852.42 862.33 <o,f0,male> ends possible it has a hundred to a thousand split ends and that's the secret because it allows intimate contact the gecko has a billion of these two hundred nanometer sized split ends
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 871.63 873.74 <o,f0,male> so to our blueprint we split some hairs
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 879.29 891.75 <o,f0,male> patent issued we're happy to say and here 's the simplest version in nature and here 's my collaborator ron fearing 's attempt at an artificial version of this dry adhesive made from polyurethane and here 's the first
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 892.94 900.98 <o,f0,male> have it work on some load there's enormous interest in this in a variety of different fields you could think of a thousand possible uses i'm sure
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 901.83 908.03 <o,f0,male> lots of people have and we're excited about realizing this as a product we have imagined products for example this one
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 908.71 917.41 <o,f0,male> we imagined a bio inspired band aid where we took the glue off the band aid we took some hairs from a molting gecko put three rolls of them on here and then made
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 919.58 924.16 <o,f0,male> this is an undergraduate volunteer we have thirty thousand undergraduates so we can choose among them
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 926.05 927.50 <o,f0,male> actually just a red pen mark
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 938.05 948.81 <o,f0,male> i think this is an extraordinary example of how curiosity based research we just wondered how they climbed up something can lead to things that you could never imagine it's just an example of why we need to
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 954.65 956.33 <o,f0,male> we've redefined now what a foot is
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 957.08 964.21 <o,f0,male> the question is can we use these secrets then to inspire the design of a better foot better than one we see in nature here 's the new project
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 965.55 967.08 <o,f0,male> we're trying to create the first
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 973.28 974.89 <o,f0,male> i call the new robot rise
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 986.55 989.62 <o,f0,male> it's six legged and has a tail here it is on a fence and a tree
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1021.55 1032.80 <o,f0,male> try to add spines and claws and set it for dry adhesives so the idea is to first get the toes and a foot right attempt to make that climb and ultimately put it on the robot and that's exactly what he 's done he 's built
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1044.43 1046.84 <o,f0,male> so these are tuned toes there are six of them
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1048.30 1051.90 <o,f0,male> and they use the principles that i just talked about collectively
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1056.40 1061.28 <o,f0,male> so this is not using any suction any glue and it will ultimately when it's attached to the robot
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1062.09 1066.15 <o,f0,male> as biologically inspired as the animal hopefully be able to
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1066.49 1068.94 <o,f0,male> climb any kind of a surface
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1069.66 1075.03 <o,f0,male> here you see it next going up the side of a building at stanford
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1075.74 1090.13 <o,f0,male> it's sped up again it's a foot climbing it's not the whole robot yet we're working on it now you can see how it's attaching these tuned structures allow the spines friction pads and ultimately the adhesive hairs to grab on to very challenging difficult surfaces
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1097.59 1100.95 <o,f0,male> ok you can visualize this now it's not impossible it's a very challenging
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1102.10 1106.24 <o,f0,male> but more to come later to finish we've gotten design secrets from nature by looking at how
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1107.98 1115.15 <o,f0,male> learned we should distribute control to smart parts don't put it all in the brain but put some of the control in tuned feet legs and even body
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1115.66 1121.61 <o,f0,male> nature uses hybrid solutions not a single solution to these problems and they're integrated and beautifully robust
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1122.19 1130.93 <o,f0,male> and third we believe strongly that we do not want to mimic nature but instead be inspired by biology and use these novel principles
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1131.36 1136.78 <o,f0,male> the best engineering solutions that are out there to make potentially something better than nature
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1138.02 1140.21 <o,f0,male> so there's a clear message whether you care about
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1140.39 1151.81 <o,f0,male> a fundamental basic research of really interesting bizarre wonderful animals or you want to build a search and rescue robot that can help you in an earthquake or to save someone in a fire or you care about medicine
