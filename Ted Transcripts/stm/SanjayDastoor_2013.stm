SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 20.5 23.76 <o,f0,male> that you can carry with you anywhere
SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 28.45 35.33 <o,f0,male> and you can run it for one thousand kilometers on about a dollar of electricity but when i say the word electric vehicle
SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 35.41 50.99 <o,f0,male> people think about vehicles they think about cars and motorcycles and bicycles and the vehicles that you use every day but if you come about it from a different perspective you can create some more interesting more novel concepts so we built something
SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 51.24 55.8 <o,f0,male> i 've got some of the pieces in my pocket here so this is the motor
SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 55.92 63.11 <o,f0,male> this motor has enough power to take you up the hills of san francisco at about twenty miles per hour about thirty kilometers an hour
SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 63.11 64.64 <o,f0,male> and this battery
SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 65.64 68.35 <o,f0,male> this battery right here has about
SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 68.35 71.2 <o,f0,male> six miles of range or ten kilometers
SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 71.41 75.57 <o,f0,male> which is enough to cover about half of the car trips in the u s alone
SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 76.31 80.34 <o,f0,male> but the best part about these components is that we bought them at a toy store
SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 80.5 92.62 <o,f0,male> these are from remote control airplanes and the performance of these things has gotten so good that if you think about vehicles a little bit differently you can really change things so today we 're going to show you one example of how you can use this
SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 92.62 102.37 <o,f0,male> pay attention to not only how fun this thing is but also how the portability that comes with this can totally change the way you interact with a city like san francisco
SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 183.91 192.28 <o,f0,male> it 's really maneuverable you have a hand held remote so you can pretty easily control acceleration braking go in reverse if you like
SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 192.39 194.05 <o,f0,male> also have braking
SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 201.53 206.83 <o,f0,male> it 's incredible just how light this thing is i mean this is something you can pick up and carry with you anywhere you go
SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 217.87 221.01 <o,f0,male> for every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car
SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 221.42 226.31 <o,f0,male> which means not only is this thing fast to charge and really cheap to build
