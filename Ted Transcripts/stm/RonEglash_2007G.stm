RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 16.28 21.51 <o,f0,male> want to start my story in germany in one thousand eight hundred and seventy seven with a mathematician named georg cantor
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 44 52.06 <o,f0,male> so he realized he had a set whose number of elements was larger than infinity and this blew his mind literally he checked into a sanitarium
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 65.26 82.06 <o,f0,male> and other mathematicians did the same sort of thing a swedish mathematician von koch decided that instead of subtracting lines he would add them and so he came up with this beautiful curve and there 's no particular reason why we have to start with this seed shape we can use any seed shape we like
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 82.06 87.06 <o,f0,male> and i 'll rearrange this and i 'll stick this somewhere down there ok
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 87.06 104.73 <o,f0,male> and now upon iteration that seed shape sort of unfolds into a very different looking structure so these all have the property of self similarity the part looks like the whole it 's the same pattern at many different scales now mathematicians thought this was very strange because as you shrink a ruler
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 110.56 115.52 <o,f0,male> as the ruler shrinks down to infinity the length goes to infinity
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 115.52 123.53 <o,f0,male> this made no sense at all so they consigned these curves to the back of the math books they said these are pathological curves and we don 't have to discuss them
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 173.25 182.38 <o,f0,male> so here 's the second iteration and the third fourth and so on so nature has this self similar structure nature uses self organizing systems
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 189.99 206.06 <o,f0,male> and i thought this is fabulous i wonder why and of course i had to go to africa and ask folks why so i got a fulbright scholarship to just travel around africa for a year asking people why they were building fractals which is a great job if you can get it
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 225.24 227.59 <o,f0,male> but he was really cool about it and he took me up
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 253.96 272.67 <o,f0,male> this is a village in southern zambia the ba ila built this village about four hundred meters in diameter you have a huge ring the rings that represent the family enclosures get larger and larger as you go towards the back and then you have the chief 's ring here towards the back
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 272.67 289.13 <o,f0,male> and then the chief 's immediate family in that ring so here 's a little fractal model for it here 's one house with the sacred altar here 's the house of houses the family enclosure with the humans here where the sacred altar would be and then here 's the village as a whole a ring of ring
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 296.99 305.47 <o,f0,male> now you might wonder how can people fit in a tiny village only this big that 's because they 're spirit people it 's the ancestors and of course the spirit people
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 305.47 311.13 <o,f0,male> have a little miniature village in their village right so it 's just like georg cantor said the recursion continues forever
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 311.13 326.15 <o,f0,male> this is in the mandara mountains near the nigerian border in cameroon mokoulek i saw this diagram drawn by a french architect and i thought wow what a beautiful fractal so i tried to come up with a seed shape which upon iteration would unfold into this thing
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 326.15 332.84 <o,f0,male> i came up with this structure here let 's see first iteration second third fourth now
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 332.85 348.52 <o,f0,male> after i did the simulation i realized the whole village kind of spirals around just like this and here 's that replicating line a self replicating line that unfolds into the fractal well i noticed that line is about where the only square building in the village is at
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 348.52 354.95 <o,f0,male> so when i got to the village i said can you take me to the square building i think something 's going on there and they said
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 374.89 378.29 <o,f0,male> in mali and you can see you go inside the family enclosure
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 378.29 397.79 <o,f0,male> you go inside and here 's pots in the fireplace stacked recursively here 's calabashes that issa was just showing us and they 're stacked recursively now the tiniest calabash in here keeps the woman 's soul and when she dies they have a ceremony where they break this stack called the zalanga and her soul goes off to eternity once again
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 400.66 405.16 <o,f0,male> now you might ask yourself three questions at this point
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 419.78 425.32 <o,f0,male> architecture but that turns out not to be true i started collecting aerial photographs of native american
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 434.21 453.58 <o,f0,male> so native americans use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry you can see on the pottery and the baskets here 's an aerial photograph of one of the anasazi ruins you can see it 's circular at the largest scale but it 's rectangular at the smaller scale right it is not the same pattern at two different scales
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 453.58 461.68 <o,f0,male> second you might ask well dr eglash aren 't you ignoring the diversity of african cultures and three times the answer is no
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 461.68 478.24 <o,f0,male> first of all i agree with mudimbe 's wonderful book the invention of africa that africa is an artificial invention of first colonialism and then oppositional movements no because a widely shared design practice doesn 't necessarily give you a unity of culture and it definitely is not in the dna
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 478.24 488.7 <o,f0,male> and finally the fractals have self similarity so they 're similar to themselves but they 're not necessarily similar to each other you see very different uses for fractals it 's a shared technology in africa
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 488.7 496.84 <o,f0,male> and finally well isn 't this just intuition it 's not really mathematical knowledge africans can 't possibly really be using
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 496.84 514.66 <o,f0,male> fractal geometry right it wasn 't invented until the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s well it 's true that some african fractals are as far as i 'm concerned just pure intuition so some of these things i 'd wander around the streets of dakar asking people what 's the algorithm what 's the rule for making this and they 'd say well we just make it that way because it looks pretty stupid
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 526.09 530.43 <o,f0,male> in ethiopian crosses you see this wonderful unfolding of the shape
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 530.43 544.77 <o,f0,male> in angola the chokwe people draw lines in the sand and it 's what the german mathematician euler called a graph we now call it an eulerian path you can never lift your stylus from the surface and you can never go over the same line twice
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 544.77 561.86 <o,f0,male> but they do it recursively and they do it with an age grade system so the little kids learn this one and then the older kids learn this one then the next age grade initiation you learn this one and with each iteration of that algorithm you learn the iterations of the myth you learn the next level of knowledge
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 561.86 575.14 <o,f0,male> and finally all over africa you see this board game it 's called owari in ghana where i studied it it 's called mancala here on the east coast bao in kenya sogo elsewhere well you see self organizing patterns
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 575.15 590.34 <o,f0,male> that spontaneously occur in this board game and the folks in ghana knew about these self organizing patterns and would use them strategically so this is very conscious knowledge here 's a wonderful fractal anywhere you go in the sahel you 'll see this windscreen
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 590.34 601.38 <o,f0,male> and of course fences around the world are all cartesian all strictly linear but here in africa you 've got these nonlinear scaling fences so i tracked down one of the folks who makes these things this guy in
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 617.38 629.04 <o,f0,male> he said but wind and dust goes through pretty easily now the tight rows up at the very top they really hold out the wind and dust but it takes a lot of time and it takes a lot of straw because they 're really tight
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 629.04 632.1 <o,f0,male> now he said we know from experience
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 632.1 634.78 <o,f0,male> that the farther up from the ground you go
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 634.78 649.05 <o,f0,male> the stronger the wind blows right it 's just like a cost benefit analysis and i measured out the lengths of straw put it on a log log plot got the scaling exponent and it almost exactly matches the scaling exponent for the relationship between wind speed and height in the wind engineering handbook
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 649.05 662.04 <o,f0,male> so these guys are right on target for a practical use of scaling technology the most complex example of an algorithmic approach to fractals that i found was actually not in geometry it was in a symbolic code
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 662.04 679.44 <o,f0,male> and this was bamana sand divination and the same divination system is found all over africa you can find it on the east coast as well as the west coast and often the symbols are very well preserved so each of these symbols has four bits it 's a four bit
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 689.35 692.48 <o,f0,male> and they did this very rapidly
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 692.48 704.74 <o,f0,male> and i couldn 't understand where they were getting they only did the randomness four times i couldn 't understand where they were getting the other twelve symbols and they wouldn 't tell me they said no no i can 't tell you about this and i said well look i 'll pay you you can be my teacher and
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 704.74 716.29 <o,f0,male> i 'll come each day and pay you they said it 's not a matter of money this is a religious matter and finally out of desperation i said well let me explain georg cantor in one thousand eight hundred and seventy seven and i started explaining why i was there in
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 726.25 745.35 <o,f0,male> for a bamana priest and of course i was only interested in the math so the whole time he kept shaking his head going you know i didn 't learn it this way but i had to sleep with a kola nut next to my bed buried in sand and give seven coins to seven lepers and so on and finally he revealed the truth of the matter
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 745.35 749.93 <o,f0,male> and it turns out it 's a pseudo random number generator using deterministic chaos
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 749.93 766.45 <o,f0,male> when you have a four bit symbol you then put it together with another one sideways so even plus odd gives you odd odd plus even gives you odd even plus even gives you even odd plus odd gives you even it 's addition modulo two just like in the parity bit check on your computer
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 766.45 776.08 <o,f0,male> and then you take this symbol and you put it back in so it 's a self generating diversity of symbols they 're truly using a kind of deterministic chaos in doing this
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 776.08 794.32 <o,f0,male> now because it 's a binary code you can actually implement this in hardware what a fantastic teaching tool that should be in african engineering schools and the most interesting thing i found out about it was historical in the twelfth century hugo of santalla brought it from islamic mystics into spain
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 822.51 830.35 <o,f0,male> right ones and zeros the binary code george boole took leibniz 's binary code and created boolean algebra and john von neumann took boolean algebra and created the digital computer
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 830.35 833.64 <o,f0,male> so all these little pdas and laptops every
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 859.7 875.71 <o,f0,male> the national science foundation 's broadening participation in computing program recently awarded us a grant to make a programmable version of these design tools so hopefully in three years anybody 'll be able to go on the web and create their own simulations and their own
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 875.71 884.17 <o,f0,male> artifacts we 've focused in the u s on african american students as well as native american and latino we 've found statistically significant improvement
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 884.17 890.71 <o,f0,male> with children using this software in a mathematics class in comparison with a control group that did not have the software
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 890.71 898.72 <o,f0,male> so it 's really very successful teaching children that they have a heritage that 's about mathematics that it 's not just about singing and dancing
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 898.72 902.23 <o,f0,male> we 've started a pilot program
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 916.52 933.88 <o,f0,male> kenya has come up with this great idea for using fractal structure for postal address in villages that have fractal structure because if you try to impose a grid structure postal system on a fractal village it doesn 't quite fit bernard tschumi at columbia university has finished using this in a design for a museum of african art
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 933.88 936.19 <o,f0,male> david hughes at
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 961.98 966.48 <o,f0,male> it 's in ecological sustainability it 's in the developmental power of entrepreneurship
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 966.48 968.36 <o,f0,male> the ethical power of democracy
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 968.36 973.55 <o,f0,male> it 's also in some bad things self organization is why the aids virus is spreading
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 973.55 988.79 <o,f0,male> so fast and if you don 't think that capitalism which is self organizing can have destructive effects you haven 't opened your eyes enough so we need to think about as was spoken earlier the traditional african methods for doing self organization these are robust algorithms
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 988.79 994.67 <o,f0,male> these are ways of doing self organization of doing entrepreneurship that are gentle that are egalitarian
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 994.67 1004.77 <o,f0,male> so if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work we need look only no farther than africa to find these robust self organizing algorithms thank you
