JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 17.23 31.52 <o,f0,male> after having served four years in the united states marine corps and deployments to both iraq and afghanistan i found myself in port au prince leading a team of veterans and medical professionals in some of the hardest hit areas of that city three days after the earthquake
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 31.52 42.42 <o,f0,male> we were going to the places that nobody else wanted to go the places nobody else could go and after three weeks we realized something military veterans are very very good at disaster response
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 69.22 82.67 <o,f0,male> and we sat here and we looked at these two problems and finally we came to a realization these aren 't problems these are actually solutions and what do i mean by that well we can use disaster response as an opportunity for service for the veterans coming home
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 82.85 89.34 <o,f0,male> recent surveys show that ninety two percent of veterans want to continue their service when they take off their uniform and we can use veterans
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 89.59 103.56 <o,f0,male> to improve disaster response now on the surface this makes a lot of sense and in two thousand and ten we responded to the tsunami in chile the floods in pakistan we sent training teams to the thai burma border but it was earlier this year
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 103.56 110.04 <o,f0,male> when one of our original members caused us to shift focus in the organization this is clay hunt
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 117.44 120.35 <o,f0,male> earlier this year in march clay took his own life
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 120.44 124.4 <o,f0,male> this was a tragedy but it really forced us
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 124.52 133.14 <o,f0,male> to refocus what it is that we were doing you know clay didn 't kill himself because of what happened in iraq and afghanistan clay killed himself
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 133.34 143.98 <o,f0,male> because of what he lost when he came home he lost purpose he lost his community and perhaps most tragically he lost his self worth
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 143.98 152.44 <o,f0,male> and so as we evaluated and as the dust settled from this tragedy we realized that of those two problems
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 152.44 164.3 <o,f0,male> in the initial iteration of our organization we were a disaster response organization that was using veteran service we had a lot of success and we really felt like we were changing the disaster response paradigm
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 164.45 174.6 <o,f0,male> but after clay we shifted that focus and suddenly now moving forward we see ourselves as a veteran service organization that 's using disaster response
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 174.6 180.78 <o,f0,male> because we think that we can give that purpose and that community and that self worth back to the veteran
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 180.78 199.64 <o,f0,male> and tornadoes in tuscaloosa and joplin and then later hurricane irene gave us an opportunity to look at that now i want you to imagine for a second an eighteen year old boy who graduates from high school in kansas city missouri he joins the army the army gives him a rifle they send him to iraq every day he leaves the wire with a mission
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 199.64 213.99 <o,f0,male> that mission is to defend the freedom of the family that he left at home it 's to keep the men around him alive it 's to pacify the village that he works in he 's got a purpose but he comes home to kansas city missouri maybe he goes to college maybe he 's got a job
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 214.05 220.42 <o,f0,male> but he doesn 't have that same sense of purpose you give him a chainsaw you send him to joplin missouri after a tornado he regains that
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 220.51 227.95 <o,f0,male> going back that same eighteen year old boy graduates from high school in kansas city missouri joins the army the army gives him a rifle they send him to iraq
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 228.02 239.2 <o,f0,male> every day he looks into the same sets of eyes around him he leaves the wire he knows that those people have his back he 's slept in the same sand they 've lived together they 've eaten together they 've bled together
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 239.62 251.09 <o,f0,male> he goes home to kansas city missouri he gets out of the military he takes his uniform off he doesn 't have that community anymore but you drop twenty five of those veterans in joplin missouri they get that sense of community back
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 251.2 259.09 <o,f0,male> again you have an eighteen year old boy who graduates high school in kansas city he joins the army the army gives him a rifle they send him to iraq
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 259.1 270.85 <o,f0,male> they pin a medal on his chest he goes home to a ticker tape parade he takes the uniform off he 's no longer sergeant jones in his community he 's now dave from kansas city he doesn 't have that same self worth
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 270.85 279.91 <o,f0,male> but you send him to joplin after a tornado and somebody once again is walking up to him and shaking their hand and thanking them for their service now they have self worth again
