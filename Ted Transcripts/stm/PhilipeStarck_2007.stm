PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 80.64 82.35 <o,f0,male> about something
PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 107.11 121.46 <o,f0,male> and why not a toothbrush i don 't try to design the toothbrush i don 't try to say oh that will be a beautiful object or something like that that doesn 't interest me because there is different types of design
PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 141.04 153.21 <o,f0,male> for producer to make product more sexy like that they sell more it 's shit it 's obsolete it 's ridiculous i call that the cynical design
PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 165.98 172.23 <o,f0,male> is people like me who try to deserve to exist
PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 196.64 213.14 <o,f0,male> what will be the effect of the brush in the mouth and to understand what will be the effect of the toothbrush in the mouth i must imagine who owns this mouth what is the life of the owner of this mouth
PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 213.14 221.1 <o,f0,male> in what society does this guy live what civilization creates this society
PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 266.32 271.66 <o,f0,male> because there is not a human production which exists
PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 327.11 338.78 <o,f0,male> some million years after pshoo shoo bloop bloop ah wake up at the end finally that succeeds and life appears we was so
PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 364.14 372.39 <o,f0,male> and the fun is the super monkey we are today is at half of the story
PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 398.7 400.45 <o,f0,male> yes she said something like that
PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 414.88 425.61 <o,f0,male> and today we have no idea of what we shall be in four billion years and this territory is fantastic that is our poetry
PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 425.61 442.76 <o,f0,male> that is our beautiful story it 's our romanticism mu ta tion we are mutants and if we don 't deeply understand if we don 't integrate that we are mutants we completely miss the story
PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 489.57 508.76 <o,f0,male> but everybody is obliged to participate and to participate for a mutant there is a minimum of exercise a minimum of sport we can say that the first if you want there is so many but one which is very easy to do is the duty of vision
PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 509.63 512 <o,f0,male> i can explain you i shall try
PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 521.82 527.55 <o,f0,male> but perhaps because you walk with the eyes like that you will not see oh there is a hole
PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 527.62 533.69 <o,f0,male> and you will fall and you will die dangerous that 's why perhaps you will try
PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 544.89 546.9 <o,f0,male> the angle of vision
PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 546.96 554.91 <o,f0,male> but it 's still very selfish selfish egoiste yes selfish you you survive it 's ok
PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 667.28 685 <o,f0,male> because after there is another trap if you look like that you look to the past or you look inside if you are very flexible inside yourself it 's called schizophrenia and you are dead also that 's why every morning now because you are a good mutant you will
PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 701.35 715.97 <o,f0,male> what else we can say about that why do that it 's because we if we look from far we see
PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 716.37 722.66 <o,f0,male> line of evolution this line of evolution is clearly positive
PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 722.74 729.31 <o,f0,male> from far this line looks very smooth like that but if you take a lens
PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 862.03 865.74 <o,f0,male> it 's nothing because it 's not the right time
PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 915.85 920.31 <o,f0,male> we are it 's almost done we have just to finish the story
PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 920.31 931.77 <o,f0,male> that is very very important and when you don 't understand really what 's happened you cannot go and fight and work and build and things like that you
PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 949.3 957.01 <o,f0,male> in perhaps fifty years sixty years we can finish completely this civilization
PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 985.15 1002.64 <o,f0,male> done that was our story that passed now you have a duty invent a new story invent a new poetry the only rule is we have not to have any idea about the next story
PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 1015.5 1018.41 <o,f0,male> that 's why i continue
PhilipeStarck_2007 1 PhilipeStarck_2007 1018.44 1022.9 <o,f0,male> to work even if it 's for toilet brush
