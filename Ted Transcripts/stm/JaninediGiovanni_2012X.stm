JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 13.18 25.93 <o,f0,female> is how war starts one day you 're living your ordinary life you 're planning to go to a party you 're taking your children to school you 're making a dentist appointment
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 25.93 42.29 <o,f0,female> the next thing the telephones go out the tvs go out there 's armed men on the street there 's roadblocks your life as you know it goes into suspended animation it stops
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 42.29 52.53 <o,f0,female> i 'm going to steal a story from a friend of mine a bosnian friend about what happened to her because i think it will illustrate for you exactly what it feels like
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 52.53 65.36 <o,f0,female> she was walking to work one day in april one thousand nine hundred and ninety two in a miniskirt and high heels she worked in a bank she was a young mother she was someone who liked to party great person
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 65.36 80.29 <o,f0,female> and suddenly she sees a tank ambling down the main road of sarajevo knocking everything out of its path she thinks she 's dreaming but she 's not and she
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 80.29 88.96 <o,f0,female> runs as any of us would have done and takes cover and she hides behind a trash bin in her high heels and her miniskirt
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 88.96 100.43 <o,f0,female> and as she 's hiding there she 's feeling ridiculous but she 's seeing this tank go by with soldiers and people all over the place and chaos and she thinks
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 100.9 112.68 <o,f0,female> i feel like alice in wonderland going down the rabbit hole down down down into chaos and my life will never be the same again
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 131.14 143.78 <o,f0,female> and she remembers struggling with her mother to the front crowds and crowds of people take my child take my child and passing her son to someone through a window
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 143.78 147.07 <o,f0,female> and she didn 't see him for years
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 166.31 179.95 <o,f0,female> being one of those reporters that lived through that siege and i say i have the honor and the privilege of being there because it 's taught me everything not just about being a reporter but about being a human being
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 179.95 192.54 <o,f0,female> i learned about compassion i learned about ordinary people who could be heroes i learned about sharing i learned about camaraderie most of all i learned about love
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 192.56 198.74 <o,f0,female> even in the midst of terrible destruction and death and chaos
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 198.75 214.57 <o,f0,female> i learned how ordinary people could help their neighbors share food raise their children drag someone who 's being sniped at from the middle of the road even though you yourself were endangering your life helping people get into taxis who were injured to try to take
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 219.73 236.89 <o,f0,female> martha gellhorn who 's one of my heroes once said you can only love one war the rest is responsibility i went on to cover many many many wars after that so many that i lost count but there was nothing like sarajevo
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 236.89 241.14 <o,f0,female> last april i went back to a very strange
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 241.35 251.37 <o,f0,female> what i called a deranged high school reunion what it was was the twentieth anniversary of the siege the beginning of the siege of sarajevo
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 251.37 268.67 <o,f0,female> and i don 't like the word anniversary because it sounds like a party and this was not a party it was a very somber gathering of the reporters that worked there during the war humanitarian aid workers and of course the brave and courageous people of sarajevo themselves
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 268.67 279.69 <o,f0,female> and the thing that struck me the most that broke my heart was walking down the main street of sarajevo where my friend aida saw the tank coming twenty years ago
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 279.69 286.3 <o,f0,female> and in that road were more than twelve thousand red chairs
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 286.31 293.43 <o,f0,female> empty and every single one of them symbolized a person who had died during the siege
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 293.43 308.41 <o,f0,female> just in sarajevo not in all of bosnia and it stretched from one end of the city to a large part of it and the saddest for me were the tiny little chairs for the children
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 308.41 314.74 <o,f0,female> i now cover syria and i started reporting it
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 314.74 324.63 <o,f0,female> because i believed that it needs to be done i believe a story there has to be told i see again a template of the war in bosnia
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 324.63 337.04 <o,f0,female> and when i first arrived in damascus i saw this strange moment where people didn 't seem to believe that war was going to descend and it was exactly the same in bosnia and nearly every other country i 've seen
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 337.04 340.39 <o,f0,female> where war comes people don 't want to believe it 's coming
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 340.39 357.08 <o,f0,female> so they don 't leave they don 't leave before they can they don 't get their money out they stay because you want to stay in your home and then war and chaos descend rwanda is a place that haunts me a lot
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 357.11 363.44 <o,f0,female> in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four i briefly left sarajevo to go report the genocide in rwanda
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 363.44 375.77 <o,f0,female> between april and august one thousand nine hundred and ninety four one million people were slaughtered now if those twelve thousand chairs
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 375.77 387.04 <o,f0,female> freaked me out with the sheer number i want you just for a second to think of a million people and to give you some example i remember
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 387.04 398.87 <o,f0,female> standing and looking down a road as far as i could see at least a mile and there were bodies piled twice my height of the dead
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 398.87 401.84 <o,f0,female> and that was just a small percentage of the dead
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 401.84 406.93 <o,f0,female> and there were mothers holding their children who had been caught in their last death throes
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 406.93 421.2 <o,f0,female> so we learn a lot from war and i mention rwanda because it is one place like south africa where nearly twenty years on there is healing
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 428.46 441.9 <o,f0,female> there 's also within the national constitution now you 're actually not allowed to say hutu or tutsi you 're not allowed to identify anyone by ethnicity which is of course what started the slaughter in the first place
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 441.9 458.67 <o,f0,female> and an aid worker friend of mine told me the most beautiful story or i find it beautiful there was a group of children mixed hutus and tutsis and a group of women who were adopting them and they lined up and one was just given to the next
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 458.67 475.35 <o,f0,female> there was no kind of compensation for you 're a tutsi you 're a hutu you might have killed my mother you might have killed my father they were just brought together in this kind of reconciliation and i find this remarkable
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 475.35 480.61 <o,f0,female> so when people ask me how i continue to cover war and why i continue to do it
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 480.61 496.14 <o,f0,female> this is why when i go back to syria next week in fact what i see is incredibly heroic people some of them fighting for democracy for things we take for granted every single day
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 496.14 501.74 <o,f0,female> and that 's pretty much why i do it in two thousand and four
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 501.81 514.11 <o,f0,female> i had a little baby boy and i call him my miracle child because after seeing so much death and destruction and chaos and darkness in my life
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 526.35 532.19 <o,f0,female> but i 'm talking about him because when he was four months old my foreign editor
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 532.33 541.58 <o,f0,female> forced me to go back to baghdad where i had been reporting all throughout the saddam regime and during the fall of baghdad and afterwards
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 572.28 582.14 <o,f0,female> because if you miss his first tooth if you miss his first step you 'll never forgive yourself but there will always be another war
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 582.14 589.28 <o,f0,female> and there sadly will always be wars and i am deluding myself
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 589.46 596.71 <o,f0,female> if i think as a journalist as a reporter as a writer what i do can stop them i can
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 606.89 618.81 <o,f0,female> i 'm not even a humanitarian aid doctor and i can 't tell you the times of how helpless i 've felt to have people dying in front of me and i couldn 't save them all i am is a witness
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 618.81 630.44 <o,f0,female> my role is to bring a voice to people who are voiceless a colleague of mine described it as to shine a light in the darkest corners of the world
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 630.44 642.77 <o,f0,female> and that 's what i try to do i 'm not always successful and sometimes it 's incredibly frustrating because you feel like you 're writing into a void or you feel like no one cares
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 658.01 664.86 <o,f0,female> is to bear witness and that is the crux the heart of the matter for us reporters who do this
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 664.86 678.45 <o,f0,female> and all i can really do is hope not to policymakers or politicians because as much as i 'd like to have faith that they read my words and do something i don 't delude myself
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 678.45 681.09 <o,f0,female> but what i do hope
JaninediGiovanni_2012X 1 JaninediGiovanni_2012X 681.1 690.3 <o,f0,female> is that if you remember anything i said or any of my stories tomorrow morning over breakfast if you can remember the story of sarajevo
