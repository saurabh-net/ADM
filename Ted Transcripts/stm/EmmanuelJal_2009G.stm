EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 13.53 21.46 <o,f0,male> say my name is emmanuel jal and i come from a long way i've been telling a story that has been
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 22.01 28.85 <o,f0,male> so painful for me it's been a tough journey for me traveling the world telling my story in form of a
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 28.96 41.82 <o,f0,male> book and also telling it like now and also the easiest one was when i was doing it in form of a music so i have branded myself as a war child
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 45.04 48.03 <o,f0,male> doing this because of
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 49.47 62.35 <o,f0,male> lady in my village now who have lost her children there is no newspaper to cover her pain and what she wants to change in this society and i'm doing it for a young man
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 62.97 73.90 <o,f0,male> who want to create a change and has no way to project his voice because he can't write or there is no internet like facebook myspace youtube for them to
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 78.44 84.71 <o,f0,male> also one thing that kept me pushing this story this painful stories out the dreams
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 86.18 88.35 <o,f0,male> is like the voices of the
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 89.35 90.30 <o,f0,male> that i have seen
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 102.03 108.75 <o,f0,male> well i was born in the most difficult time when my country was at war
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 135.54 141.48 <o,f0,male> seeing people die every day my mother crying it's like i was raised in a violence
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 145.76 154.94 <o,f0,male> that made me call myself a war child and not only that when i was eight i became a child soldier
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 155.87 163.59 <o,f0,male> i didn't know what was the war for but one thing i knew was an image that i saw that stuck in my head
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 164.18 171.03 <o,f0,male> when i went to the training camp i say i want to kill as many muslims and as many arabs as possible
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 171.49 178.83 <o,f0,male> the training wasn't easy but that was the driving force because i wanted to revenge for my family i wanted to revenge for my
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 189.84 198.89 <o,f0,male> what was actually killing us wasn't the muslims wasn't the arabs it was somebody sitting somewhere manipulating the system
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 200.35 209.88 <o,f0,male> and using religion to get what they want to get out of us which is the oil the diamond the gold and the land
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 211.22 218.68 <o,f0,male> so realizing the truth give me a position to choose should i continue to hate or let it go
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 219.30 227.73 <o,f0,male> so i happened to forgive now i sing music with the muslims i dance with them i even had a movie out called war child funded by
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 229.58 230.49 <o,f0,male> so
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 231.49 242.02 <o,f0,male> that pain has gone out but my story is huge so i'm just going to go into a different step now which is easier for me i'm going to give you
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 245.76 254.11 <o,f0,male> to sin which is from my album war child i talk about my story one of the journey that i tread when i was tempted to eat
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 254.26 263.02 <o,f0,male> my friend because we had no food and we were like around four hundred and only sixteen people survived that journey so i hope you're going to hear this
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 263.58 273.68 <o,f0,male> my dreams are like torment my every moment voices in my brain of friends that was slain
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 274.07 282.78 <o,f0,female> friends like lual who died by my side of starvation in the burning jungle and the desert plain
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 283.46 291.61 <o,f0,female> next was i but jesus heard my cry as i was tempted to eat the rotten flesh of my
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 292.49 298.19 <o,f0,female> he gave me comfort we used to raid villages stealing chickens goats and
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 300.98 308.02 <o,f0,female> i knew it was rude but was needed food and therefore i was forced to sin forced to
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 310.45 318.98 <o,f0,female> to sin to make a living sometimes you gotta lose to win never give up never give
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 319.96 331.49 <o,f0,female> left home at the age of seven one year later live with an ak forty seven by my side slept with one eye open wide run duck play dead and hide
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 332.24 341.91 <o,f0,female> seen my people die like flies but i've never seen a dead body at least one that i've killed but still as i wonder
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 342.66 351.79 <o,f0,female> go under guns barking like lightning and thunder as a child so young and tender words i can't forget i still remember
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 352.35 361.64 <o,f0,female> i saw sergeant command raising his hand no retreat no surrender i carry the banner of the trauma war child child without a
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 362.60 369.24 <o,f0,female> still fighting in the saga yet as i wage this new war i'm not alone in this drama no sit or stop
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 370.06 379.80 <o,f0,female> for the top i'm fully dedicated like a patriotic cop i'm on a fight day and night sometime i do wrong in order to make things right
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 381.18 386.92 <o,f0,male> it's like i'm living a dream first time i'm feeling like a human being
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 387.86 392.82 <o,f0,female> the children of darfur your empty bellies on the telly and it's you
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 397.79 411.64 <o,f0,male> don't even know the day i'll ever return my country is war torn music i used to hear was bombs and fire of guns so many people die that i don't even cry no more
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 413.08 424.11 <o,f0,male> question what am i here for and why are my people poor and why why when the rest of the children were learning how to read and write i was learning how to fight
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 452.52 464.55 <o,f0,male> what energized me and kept me going is the music i do i never saw anybody to tell my story to them so they could advise me or do therapy so the music
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 465.48 476.52 <o,f0,male> been my therapy for me it's been where i actually see heaven where i can be happy where i can be a child again in dances through music
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 477.24 490.94 <o,f0,male> so one thing i know about music music is the only thing that has power to enter your cell system your mind your heart influence your soul and your spirit and can even
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 491.95 501.13 <o,f0,male> the way you live without even you knowing music is the only thing that can make you want to wake up your bed and shake your leg
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 501.98 509.94 <o,f0,male> without even wanting to do it and so the power music has i normally compare to the power love
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 510.52 518.38 <o,f0,male> love doesn't see a color you know if you fall in love with a frog that's it one testimony about how i find music is powerful is when
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 519.21 529.03 <o,f0,male> i was still a soldier back then i hated the people in the north but i don't know why i don't hate
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 537.61 546.79 <o,f0,male> to come and entertain the soldiers and i almost broke my leg dancing to his music but i had this question so now i'm doing music so i know what the power of music
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 548.52 561.22 <o,f0,male> so what's happening here i've been in a painful journey today is day number two hundred and thirty three in which i only eat dinner i don't eat breakfast no lunch
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 561.84 571.27 <o,f0,male> and i've done a campaign called lose to win where i'm losing so that i could win the battle that i'm fighting now so my breakfast my
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 573.05 580.71 <o,f0,male> i donate it to a charity that i founded because we want to build a school in sudan and i'm doing this because also
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 581.29 590.38 <o,f0,male> it's a normal thing in my home people eat one meal a day here i am in the west i choose not to so in my village now kids
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 590.80 599.12 <o,f0,male> they normally listen to bbc or any radio and they are waiting to know the day emmanuel will eat his breakfast it means he got the money to build our school
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 599.59 609.86 <o,f0,male> and so i made a commitment i say i 'm gonna not eat my breakfast i thought i was famous enough that i would raise the money within one month but i've been humbled so
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 611.88 622.08 <o,f0,male> it's taken me two hundred and thirty two days and i said no stop until we get it and like it's been done on facebook myspace the people are giving three dollars
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 622.73 629.80 <o,f0,male> the lowest amount we ever got was twenty cents somebody donated twenty cents online i don't know how they did it but
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 631.28 634.69 <o,f0,male> moved me and so
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 635.91 645.04 <o,f0,male> the importance of education to me is what i'm willing to die for i'm willing to die for this because i know what it can do
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 645.65 652.81 <o,f0,male> to my people education enlighten your brain give you so many chances and you're able to survive
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 662.97 671.45 <o,f0,male> get the food that drops from the sky from the u n so these people you're killing a whole generation if you just give them
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 673.04 683.76 <o,f0,male> if anybody want to help us this is what we need give us tools give the farmers tools it's rain africa is fertile they can grow
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 687.90 690.99 <o,f0,female> invest in education
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 699.59 709.67 <o,f0,male> all those old men that are creating wars in africa they will die soon but if you invest in education then we'll be able to change africa that's what i'm asking
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 716.83 724.79 <o,f0,male> in order to do that i founded a charter called gua africa where we put kids in school and
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 725.03 735.11 <o,f0,male> now we have a couple in university we have like forty kids ex child soldiers mixed with anybody we feel like we want to support and i said i 'm going to put it in practice
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 735.77 745.94 <o,f0,male> and with the people that are going to follow me and help me do things that's what i want to do to change to make a difference in the world well now my time is going so i want to sing a song
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 746.24 755.86 <o,f0,male> but i'll ask you guys to stand up so we celebrate the life of a british aid worker called emma mccune that made it possible for me to be here
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 756.57 766.27 <o,f0,male> i'm gonna sing this song just to inspire you how this woman has made a difference she came to my country and saw the importance
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 767.64 776.00 <o,f0,male> of education she said the only way to help sudan is to invest in the women educating them educating the children
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 776.39 785.47 <o,f0,male> so that they could come and create a revolution in this complex society so she even ended up marrying a commander from
EmmanuelJal_2009G 1 EmmanuelJal_2009G 787.83 799.28 <o,f0,male> and she rescued over one hundred and fifty child soldiers one of them happened to be me and so at this moment i want to ask to celebrate emma with me are you guys ready to celebrate emma
