HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 19.09 23.5 <o,f0,female> but it 's a broad and very delicate
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 23.62 33.11 <o,f0,female> subject so i have to limit myself and therefore i will limit myself to only talk about the links between religion and sexuality
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 38.39 46.61 <o,f0,female> so i will talk of what i remember as the most wonderful it 's when the young couple whisper tonight we are going to make a baby
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 46.89 50.69 <o,f0,female> my talk will be about the impact
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 50.9 54.43 <o,f0,female> of religions on the number of babies
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 65.32 82.61 <o,f0,female> and there are some people who say that the world population is growing like this three billion in one thousand nine hundred and sixty seven billion just last year and it will continue to grow because there are religions that stop women from having few babies and it may continue like this
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 83.24 86.71 <o,f0,female> to what extent are these people right
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 87.09 96.86 <o,f0,female> when i was born there was less than one billion children in the world and today two thousand there 's almost two billion what has happened since
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 96.86 105.68 <o,f0,female> and what do the experts predict will happen with the number of children during this century this is a quiz what do you think
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 105.68 118.24 <o,f0,female> do you think it will decrease to one billion will it remain the same and be two billion by the end of the century will the number of children increase each year up to fifteen years or will it continue in the same
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 118.24 130.23 <o,f0,male> fast rate and be four billion children up there i will tell you by the end of my speech but now what does religion have to do with it
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 144.4 161.48 <o,f0,female> so we went on and we looked in wikipedia we found this map but that subdivides christianity islam and buddhism into many subgroups which was too detailed therefore at gapminder we made our own map and it looks like this
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 172.77 181.6 <o,f0,female> it 's the religion where more than fifty percent of the people say that they belong it 's eastern religion in india and china and neighboring asian countries
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 181.6 192.26 <o,f0,female> islam is the majority religion all the way from the atlantic ocean across the middle east southern europe and through asia all the way to indonesia
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 192.3 194.99 <o,f0,female> that 's where we find islamic
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 195 207.42 <o,f0,female> and christian majority religions we see in these countries they are blue and that is most countries in america and europe many countries in africa and a few in asia
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 207.42 218.28 <o,f0,female> the white here are countries which cannot be classified because one religion does not reach fifty percent or there is doubt about the data or there 's some other reason so we were careful with that
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 218.28 230.48 <o,f0,female> so bear with our simplicity now when i take you over to this shot this is in one thousand nine hundred and sixty and now i show the number of babies per woman here two four or six
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 230.63 241.61 <o,f0,female> many babies few babies and here the income per person in comparable dollars the reason for that is that many people say you have to get rich first before you get few babies
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 241.61 257.12 <o,f0,female> so low income here high income there and indeed in one thousand nine hundred and sixty you had to be a rich christian to have few babies the exception was japan japan here was regarded as an exception otherwise it was only christian countries but
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 304.54 318.1 <o,f0,female> and when we enter into this century you 'll find more than half of mankind down here and by two thousand and ten we are actually eighty percent of humans who live in countries with about two children per woman
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 322.79 327.99 <o,f0,female> it 's a quite amazing development which has happened
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 334.89 338.98 <o,f0,female> russia iran mexico turkey
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 352.24 369.18 <o,f0,female> i can tell you that the data on the number of children per woman is surprisingly good in all countries we get that from the census data it 's not one of these statistics which is very doubtful so what we can conclude is you don 't have to get rich to have few children it has happened across the world
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 369.18 380.15 <o,f0,female> and then when we look at religions we can see that the eastern religions indeed there 's not one single country with a majority of that religion that has more than three children whereas with
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 380.15 387.52 <o,f0,female> islam as a majority religion and christianity you see countries all the way but there 's no major difference
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 409 416 <o,f0,female> like yemen and afghanistan many think that afghanistan here and congo
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 416 429.86 <o,f0,female> which have suffered severe conflicts that they don 't have fast population growth it 's the other way around in the world today it 's the countries that have the highest mortality rates that have the fastest population growth
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 429.86 447.54 <o,f0,female> because the death of a child is compensated by one more child these countries have six children per woman they have a sad death rate of one to two children per woman but thirty years from now afghanistan will go from thirty million to sixty million congo will go from sixty to one hundred and twenty
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 447.82 451.09 <o,f0,female> that 's where we have the fast population growth
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 500.07 515.81 <o,f0,female> but let me illustrate that fourth factor by looking at qatar here we have qatar today and there we have bangladesh today if i take these countries back to the years of their independence which is almost the same year seventy one seventy two
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 515.81 526.48 <o,f0,female> it 's a quite amazing development which had happened look at bangladesh and qatar with so different incomes it 's almost the same drop in number of babies per woman
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 526.64 536.41 <o,f0,female> and what is the reason in qatar well i do as i always do i went to the statistical authority of qatar to their webpage it 's a very good webpage i recommend it
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 536.41 543.6 <o,f0,female> and i looked up oh yeah you can have lots of fun here and provided
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 543.6 562.04 <o,f0,female> free of charge i found qatar 's social trends very interesting lots to read i found fertility at birth and i looked at total fertility rate per woman these are the scholars and experts in the government agency in qatar and they say the most important factors are increased age at first marriage
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 562.04 569.91 <o,f0,female> increased educational level of qatari woman and more women integrated in the labor force i couldn 't agree more
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 569.91 574.79 <o,f0,female> science couldn 't agree more this is a country that indeed has gone through
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 589.2 597.36 <o,f0,female> now look again at this the average number of children in the world is like in colombia it 's two point four today
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 619.52 624.79 <o,f0,female> we have reached peak child the number of children is not growing any longer in the world
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 624.79 640.67 <o,f0,female> we are still debating peak oil but we have definitely reached peak child and the world population will stop growing the united nations population division has said it will stop growing at ten billion but why do they grow if the number of children doesn 't grow
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 654.09 659.15 <o,f0,male> and there are two billion children in the world there are two billion
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 659.6 670.04 <o,f0,female> young people between fifteen and thirty these are rounded numbers then there is one billion between thirty and forty five
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 670.39 676.95 <o,f0,female> almost one between forty five and sixty and then it 's my box this is me sixty plus
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 684.21 690.98 <o,f0,female> you can see that it 's like three billion missing here they are not missing because they 've died they were never born
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 691.45 698.56 <o,f0,female> because before one thousand nine hundred and eighty there were much fewer people born than there were during the last thirty years
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 699.14 711.67 <o,f0,female> so what will happen now is quite straightforward the old sadly we will die the rest of you you will grow older and you will get two billion children then the old will die
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 711.9 721.46 <o,f0,female> the rest will grow older and get two billion children and then again the old will die and you will get two billion children
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 737.69 739.64 <o,f0,female> religion
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 748.38 751.44 <o,f0,female> and adapt to this new world
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 751.63 770.59 <o,f0,female> and we will be just ten billion in this world if the poorest people get out of poverty their children survive they get access to family planning that is needed but it 's inevitable that we will be two to three billion more
HansRosling_2012S 1 HansRosling_2012S 771.06 783.22 <o,f0,female> so when you discuss and when you plan for the resources and the energy needed for the future for human beings on this planet you have to plan for ten billion thank you very much
