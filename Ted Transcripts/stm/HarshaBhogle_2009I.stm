HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 16.45 22.28 <o,f0,male> what i'm going to is just give you the latest episode of india 's maybe the world 's longest running soap opera
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 23.10 28.21 <o,f0,male> which is cricket and may it run forever because it gives people like me a living
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 28.77 36.60 <o,f0,male> it's got everything that you'd want a normal soap opera to want it's got love joy happiness sadness tears laughter
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 37.03 48.38 <o,f0,male> lots of deceit intrigue and like all good soaps it jumps twenty years when the audience interest changes and that's exactly what cricket has done it's jumped twenty years into twenty over game
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 48.95 57.89 <o,f0,male> and that's what i'm going to talk about how a small change leads to a very big revolution but it wasn't always like that cricket wasn't always this
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 75.57 81.64 <o,f0,male> and it only ended because the english cricketers had to go from durban to cape town which is a two hour train journey
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 81.92 92.37 <o,f0,male> to catch the ship that left on the seventeenth because the next ship wasn't around for a long time so the match was ended in between and one of the english batsmen said you know what another half an hour and
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 98.13 101.89 <o,f0,male> days there were two sundays in between but of course sundays are church days
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 114.73 122.75 <o,f0,male> the mahabharata was like that as well wasn't it you fought by day then it was sunset so everyone went back home
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 123.92 133.41 <o,f0,male> and then you worked out your strategy and you came in for it the next day and you went back home again the only difference between the mahabharata and our cricket was that in cricket everybody was alive to come back and fight the next
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 134.93 140.16 <o,f0,male> the game not because the love the game but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves to the british rulers
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 175.65 186.31 <o,f0,male> as you can see you can play anywhere but slowly the game moved on you know finally you don't always have five days so we moved on and we started playing fifty over cricket and then
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 196.83 204.80 <o,f0,male> and suddenly we fell in love with the fifty over game and we played in virtually every day there was more fifty over cricket than anywhere but there was another big
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 227.93 237.87 <o,f0,male> looked at per capita income and got very excited about the possibilities in india and were looking for a vehicle to reach every indian and there are only two vehicles in india one real one scripted
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 238.36 245.68 <o,f0,male> the scripted one is what you see in the movies the real one was cricket and so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me ravi tarival from pepsi decided he 's going to
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 247.01 260.74 <o,f0,male> all over the world and pepsi was this big revolution because they started taking cricket all over and so cricket started becoming big cricket started bringing riches in television started covering cricket for a long time television said we won 't cover cricket unless you pay us to
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 261.73 273.18 <o,f0,male> then they said okay the next rights are sold for fifty five million dollars the next rights are sold for six hundred and twelve million dollars so it's a bit of a curve that and then another big accident happened in our cricket
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 283.60 291.62 <o,f0,male> and so india had to go and play the t twenty world cup you see india didn't want to play the t twenty world cup but we were forced to play it by an eight one margin
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 292.06 299.21 <o,f0,male> and then something very dramatic happened we got to the final and then this moment that will remain enshrined forever for everybody take a look
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 307.90 308.13 <o,f0,female> and
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 324.11 324.74 <o,f0,male> india
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 339.42 345.93 <o,f0,male> have gone where it was meant to go but it didn't go and we suddenly discovered that we could be good at this game and
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 346.17 356.37 <o,f0,male> what it also did was it lead to a certain pride in the fact that india could be the best in the world it was a time when investment was coming in india was feeling a little more confident about itself and so there was a feeling that
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 356.89 366.67 <o,f0,male> great pride in what we can do and thankfully for all of us the english are very good at inventing things and then the gracious people that they are they let the world become very good at it
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 368.71 368.88 <o,f0,male> and
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 409.48 417.44 <o,f0,male> build some glitzy leagues here in india but was india ready for it because cricket for a long time in india was always organized it was never promoted
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 454.68 469.15 <o,f0,male> so it was a different india but it was also a slightly more orthodox india that was very happy to be modern but didn't want to say that to people and so they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived everyone secretly watched them but everyone claimed not
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 469.25 472.03 <o,f0,male> to
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 493.25 502.13 <o,f0,male> new owners of indian cricket were not the old princes they were not bureaucrats who were forced into sport because the didn't actually love it these were people who ran serious companies
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 522.95 530.00 <o,f0,male> and then they had to appeal to their cities but they had to do it like the west right because we are setting up leagues but what they were very good at doing was
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 530.51 540.54 <o,f0,male> making it very localized so just to give you an example of how they did it not manchester united style promotion but very mumbai style promotion take a look
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 585.45 587.51 <o,f0,male> of course a lot of people said maybe they dance better than
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 591.72 599.51 <o,f0,male> what it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket all along if you wanted a young cricketer you picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality your own city
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 599.97 612.80 <o,f0,male> and you were very proud of the system that produced those cricketers now all of the sudden if you were to bowl a shot if mumbai were to bowl a shot for example they needn't go to kalbadevi or shivaji park or somewhere to source them they could go to trinidad
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 619.54 629.65 <o,f0,male> and all of the sudden indian sport had awakened to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world so the mumbai indians flew in dwayne bravo from trinidad and tobago overnight
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 630.09 641.89 <o,f0,male> and when he had to go back to represent the west indies they asked him when do you have to reach he said i have to be there by a certain time so i have to leave today we said no no no it's not about when you have to leave it's about when do you have to
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 653.53 659.80 <o,f0,male> sat in a private corporate jet first refueling in portugal second refueling in brasil he was in west indies in time
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 660.64 672.32 <o,f0,male> never would india have thought on this scale before never would india have said i want a player to play one game for me and i will use a corporate jet to send him all the way back to kingston jamaica
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 672.83 686.55 <o,f0,male> to play a game and i just thought to myself wow we've arrived somewhere in the world you know we have arrived somewhere we are thinking big but what this also did was it started marrying the two most important things in indian cricket which is cricket and the movies in indian entertainment
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 713.53 715.53 <o,f0,male> that was the ultimate reason to do
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 778.82 779.35 <o,f0,male> i was playing
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 802.66 806.48 <o,f0,male> was criticism too because they said players are being bought and sold
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 811.83 823.94 <o,f0,male> because we had this auction you see how do you fix a price for a player and so the auction that followed literally had people saying bang so many million dollars for so and so player there it is
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 834.11 834.55 <o,f0,female> thousand
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 843.34 843.95 <o,f0,male> thousand dollars
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 853.96 867.91 <o,f0,male> the best indian players who played every test match every one of the internationals the top of the line players standard contracts are two hundred and twenty thousand dollars in a whole year now they were getting five hundred thousand for six days work then andrew flintoff came by from england he got a one and a half million dollars and he went back and said
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 885.37 893.41 <o,f0,male> so at two point three billion dollars before the first ball was bowled what india was do though was benchmarking itself against the best in the world and it became a huge brand
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 923.24 933.92 <o,f0,male> our population which for a long time we thought was a problem suddenly became our biggest asset because there were more people watching the huge consuming class everybody came to watch the cricket
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 944.62 951.84 <o,f0,male> this last minute before i go there's a couple of side effects of all this for a long time india was this country of poverty dust
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 962.27 969.86 <o,f0,male> all over the world said you know we love india we love to play in india and that felt good you know we said the dollar 's quite powerful actually
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 984.02 990.11 <o,f0,male> right so finally an english game that india usurped a little bit
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 990.90 1000.52 <o,f0,male> t twenty is going to be the next missionary in the world if you want to take the game around the world it's got to be the shortest form of the game you can't take a timeless test to china and sit through fourteen days with no result in the end
HarshaBhogle_2009I 1 HarshaBhogle_2009I 1000.85 1010.84 <o,f0,male> or you can't take it all over the world so that's what t twenty is doing hopefully it'll make everyone richer hopefully it'll make the game bigger and hopefully it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business thank you very much
