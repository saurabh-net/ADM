Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 16.72 22.70 <o,f0,female> used to be a lot easier to be from iceland because until a couple of years ago people knew hardly anything about us
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 22.90 32.16 <o,f0,female> and i could basically come out here and say only good things about us but in the last couple of years we've become infamous for a couple of things first
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 32.38 38.65 <o,f0,female> of course the economic meltdown it actually got so bad that somebody put our country up for sale
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 47.51 57.40 <o,f0,female> was the volcano that interrupted the travel plans of almost all of you and many of your friends including president obama by the way the pronunciation is
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 60.15 61.57 <o,f0,female> of your media got it right
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 63.37 73.82 <o,f0,female> but i'm not here to share these stories about these two things exactly i'm here to tell you the story of audur capital which is a financial firm founded by me and kristin who you see in the picture
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 74.15 84.95 <o,f0,female> in the spring of two thousand and seven just over a year before the economic collapse hit why would two women who were enjoying successful careers in investment banking in the corporate sector
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 85.32 90.33 <o,f0,female> leave to found a financial services firm well let it suffice to say
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 91.60 93.12 <o,f0,female> that we felt a bit
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 108.11 118.43 <o,f0,female> men were at the helm of the game of the financial sector and that kind of lack of diversity and sameness leads to disastrous problems
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 122.23 130.55 <o,f0,female> we decided a bit fed up with this world and also with the strong feeling in our stomach that this wasn't sustainable to found a
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 132.07 139.54 <o,f0,female> based on our values and we decided to incorporate feminine values into the world of finance
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 139.84 147.09 <o,f0,female> raised quite a few eyebrows in iceland we weren't known as the typical women women in iceland up until then
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 147.51 152.34 <o,f0,female> it was almost like coming out of the closet to actually talk about the fact that we were
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 152.55 162.24 <o,f0,female> women and that we believed that we had a set of values and a way of doing business that would be more sustainable than what we had experienced until then
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 163.90 171.22 <o,f0,female> and we got a great group of people to join us principled people with great skills and investors with a vision and values to
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 172.62 184.63 <o,f0,female> and together we got through the eye of the financial storm in iceland without taking any direct losses to our equity or to the funds of our clients and although i want to thank the talented people of our company
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 185.54 197.11 <o,f0,female> foremost for that and also there's a factor of luck and timing we are absolutely convinced that we did this because of our values so let me share with you our values
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 197.47 208.62 <o,f0,female> we believe in risk awareness what does that mean we believe that you should always understand the risks that you're taking and we will not invest in things we don't understand
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 209.20 217.82 <o,f0,female> not a complicated thing but in two thousand and seven it was at the height of the sub prime and all the complicated financial structures
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 218.21 223.70 <o,f0,female> it was quite opposite to the reckless risk taking behaviors that we saw on the market
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 224.52 228.24 <o,f0,female> we also believe in straight talking telling it as it is
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 228.72 231.46 <o,f0,female> using simple language that people understand
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 247.63 250.28 <o,f0,female> and although we do work in the financial
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 250.88 259.45 <o,f0,female> where excel is king we believe in emotional capital and we believe that doing emotional due diligence
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 260.11 263.91 <o,f0,female> is just as important as doing financial due diligence
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 277.51 284.27 <o,f0,female> we believe in profit with principles we care how we make our profit so while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 285.26 295.94 <o,f0,female> we are willing to do it with a long term view and we like to have a wider definition of profits than just the economic profit in the next quarter so we like to see profits plus
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 296.60 300.20 <o,f0,female> positive social and environmental benefits when we invest
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 301.23 319.52 <o,f0,female> but it wasn't just about the values although we are convinced that they matter it was also about a business opportunity it's the female trend and it's the sustainability trend that are going to create some of the most interesting investment opportunities in the years to come the whole thing about the female trend is not about women being better than men
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 320.12 329.15 <o,f0,female> it is actually about women being different from men bringing different values and different ways to the table so what do you get you get better decision making
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 329.61 336.28 <o,f0,female> and you get less herd behavior and both of those things hit your bottom line with very positive results
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 337.85 349.85 <o,f0,female> but one has to wonder now that we've had this financial sector collapse upon us in iceland and by the way europe looks pretty bad right now and many would say that you in america are heading for some more trouble as well
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 350.80 362.84 <o,f0,female> now that we've had all that happen and we have all this data out there telling us that it's much better to have diversity around the decision making tables will we see business and finance change will government change
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 363.88 377.17 <o,f0,female> well i'll give you my straight talk about this i have days that i believe but i have days that i'm full of doubt have you seen the incredible urge out there to rebuild the very things that failed us
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 380.09 383.71 <o,f0,female> einstein said that this was the definition of insanity
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 384.36 387.87 <o,f0,female> to do the same things over and over again
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 388.77 390.24 <o,f0,female> hoping for a different outcome
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 391.83 399.42 <o,f0,female> so i guess the world is insane because i see entirely too much of doing the same things over and over again hoping that this time
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 399.65 401.13 <o,f0,female> not going to collapse upon us
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 401.96 412.54 <o,f0,female> i want to see more revolutionary thinking and i remain hopeful like ted i believe in people and i know that consumers are becoming more conscious
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 412.79 421.00 <o,f0,female> and they are going to start voting with their wallets and they are going to change the face of business and finance from the outside if they don't do it from the inside
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 422.93 433.64 <o,f0,female> but i'm more of the revolutionary and i should be i'm from iceland we have a long history of strong courageous independent women ever since the viking
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 446.13 453.91 <o,f0,female> women in iceland took the day off from work or from home they took the day off and nothing worked in iceland
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 456.55 459.89 <o,f0,female> they marched into the center of reykjavik and they put women
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 460.49 469.47 <o,f0,female> the agenda and some say this was the start of a global movement for me it was the start of a long journey but i decided that day to
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 470.78 483.76 <o,f0,female> five years later iceland elected vigdis finnbogadottir as their president first female to become head of state single mom a breast cancer survivor who had had one of her breast removed
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 484.49 494.88 <o,f0,female> and at one of the campaign sessions one of her male contenders alluded to the fact that she couldn't become president she was a woman and even half a woman
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 496.17 499.57 <o,f0,female> that night she won the election because she came back
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 500.15 504.11 <o,f0,female> not just because of his crappy behavior but she came back and said
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 505.48 509.95 <o,f0,female> well i'm actually not going to breastfeed the icelandic nation i'm going to lead it
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 515.14 515.76 <o,f0,female> so i've had
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 518.57 530.15 <o,f0,female> role models that have influences who i am and where i am today but in spite of that i went through the first ten or fifteen years of my career mostly in denial of being a woman started in corporate america
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 530.56 544.28 <o,f0,female> and i was absolutely convinced that it was just about the individual that women and men would have just the same opportunities but i've come to conclude lately that it isn't like that we are not the same and it's great because
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 559.27 567.23 <o,f0,female> we need to start embracing the beauty of balance so let 's move away from thinking about business here and philanthropy there
Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 1 Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W 567.48 575.48 <o,f0,female> let 's start thinking about doing good business that's how we change the world that's the only sustainable future thank you
