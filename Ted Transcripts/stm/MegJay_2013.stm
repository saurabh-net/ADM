MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 26.1 30.67 <o,f0,female> now alex walked into her first session wearing jeans and a big slouchy top
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 30.85 38.14 <o,f0,female> and she dropped onto the couch in my office and kicked off her flats and told me she was there to talk about guy problems
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 38.57 44.15 <o,f0,female> now when i heard this i was so relieved my classmate
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 66.7 79.24 <o,f0,female> and as far as i could tell she was right work happened later marriage happened later kids happened later even death happened later twentysomethings like alex and i had nothing but time
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 80.29 87.62 <o,f0,female> but before long my supervisor pushed me to push alex about her love life i pushed back
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 88.03 90.1 <o,f0,female> i said sure she 's dating down
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 90.4 95.23 <o,f0,female> she 's sleeping with a knucklehead but it 's not like she 's going to marry
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 96.32 99.72 <o,f0,female> and then my supervisor said not yet
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 99.86 101.97 <o,f0,female> but she might marry the next one
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 109.54 116.65 <o,f0,female> that 's what psychologists call an aha moment that was the moment i realized thirty is not the new twenty
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 129.88 146.39 <o,f0,female> that was when i realized that this sort of benign neglect was a real problem and it had real consequences not just for alex and her love life but for the careers and the families and the futures of twentysomethings everywhere
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 146.87 155.61 <o,f0,female> there are fifty million twentysomethings in the united states right now we 're talking about fifteen percent of the population
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 155.7 163.03 <o,f0,female> or one hundred percent if you consider that no one 's getting through adulthood without going through their twenty s first
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 163.03 179.99 <o,f0,female> raise your hand if you 're in your twenty s i really want to see some twentysomethings here oh yay y 'all 's awesome if you work with twentysomethings you love a twentysomething you 're losing sleep over twentysomethings i want to see okay awesome twentysomethings really matter
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 197.14 204.7 <o,f0,female> that claiming your twenty s is one of the simplest yet most transformative things you can do for work for love
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 204.7 207.87 <o,f0,female> for your happiness maybe even for the world
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 208.4 212.17 <o,f0,female> this is not my opinion these are the facts
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 249.37 261.54 <o,f0,female> we know that the brain caps off its second and last growth spurt in your twenty s as it rewires itself for adulthood which means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 270.27 277.73 <o,f0,female> and we know that female fertility peaks at age twenty eight and things get tricky after age thirty five
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 277.74 283.63 <o,f0,female> so your twenty s are the time to educate yourself about your body and your options
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 284.36 301.35 <o,f0,female> so when we think about child development we all know that the first five years are a critical period for language and attachment in the brain it 's a time when your ordinary day to day life has an inordinate impact on who you will become
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 301.35 310.44 <o,f0,female> but what we hear less about is that there 's such a thing as adult development and our twenty s are that critical period of adult development
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 311.51 318.81 <o,f0,female> but this isn 't what twentysomethings are hearing newspapers talk about the changing timetable of adulthood
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 318.93 321.98 <o,f0,female> researchers call the twenty s an extended adolescence
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 339.37 344.68 <o,f0,female> leonard bernstein said that to achieve great things you need a plan and not quite enough time
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 355.77 363.07 <o,f0,female> nothing happens you have robbed that person of his urgency and ambition and absolutely nothing
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 382.62 388.3 <o,f0,female> or they say everybody says as long as i get started on a career by the time i 'm thirty i 'll be fine
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 389.28 391.4 <o,f0,female> but then it starts to sound like this
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 392.1 396.11 <o,f0,female> my twenty s are almost over and i have nothing to show for myself
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 396.54 400.45 <o,f0,female> i had a better resume the day after i graduated from college
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 401.22 403.37 <o,f0,female> and then it starts to sound like this
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 404.69 422.28 <o,f0,female> dating in my twenty s was like musical chairs everybody was running around and having fun but then sometime around thirty it was like the music turned off and everybody started sitting down i didn 't want to be the only one left standing up so sometimes i think i married my husband because he was the closest chair to me at thirty
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 447.41 452.02 <o,f0,female> many of these things are incompatible and as research is just starting to show
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 458.65 474.58 <o,f0,female> the post millennial midlife crisis isn 't buying a red sports car it 's realizing you can 't have that career you now want it 's realizing you can 't have that child you now want or you can 't give your child a sibling
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 474.58 487.76 <o,f0,female> too many thirtysomethings and fortysomethings look at themselves and at me sitting across the room and say about their twenty s what was i doing what was i thinking
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 489.04 498.62 <o,f0,female> i want to change what twentysomethings are doing and thinking here 's a story about how that can go it 's a story about a woman named emma
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 499.54 515.71 <o,f0,female> at twenty five emma came to my office because she was in her words having an identity crisis she said she thought she might like to work in art or entertainment but she hadn 't decided yet so she 'd spent the last few years waiting tables instead
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 516.91 522.3 <o,f0,female> because it was cheaper she lived with a boyfriend who displayed his temper more than his ambition
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 523.37 527.49 <o,f0,female> and as hard as her twenty s were her early life had been even harder
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 528.15 535.87 <o,f0,female> she often cried in our sessions but then would collect herself by saying you can 't pick your family but you can pick your friends
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 536.65 543.89 <o,f0,female> well one day emma comes in and she hangs her head in her lap and she sobbed for most of the hour
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 543.89 557.98 <o,f0,female> she 'd just bought a new address book and she 'd spent the morning filling in her many contacts but then she 'd been left staring at that empty blank that comes after the words in case of emergency please call
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 558.21 564.44 <o,f0,female> she was nearly hysterical when she looked at me and said who 's going to be there for me if i get in a car wreck
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 564.68 567.77 <o,f0,female> who 's going to take care of me if i have cancer
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 568.99 573.39 <o,f0,female> now in that moment it took everything i had not to say i will
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 574.26 582.54 <o,f0,female> but what emma needed wasn 't some therapist who really really cared emma needed a better life and i knew this was her chance
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 583.57 592.05 <o,f0,female> i had learned too much since i first worked with alex to just sit there while emma 's defining decade went parading by
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 593.22 602.34 <o,f0,female> so over the next weeks and months i told emma three things that every twentysomething male or female deserves to hear
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 603.77 610.48 <o,f0,female> first i told emma to forget about having an identity crisis and get some identity capital
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 611.09 616.48 <o,f0,female> by get identity capital i mean do something that adds value to who you are
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 617.04 620.95 <o,f0,female> do something that 's an investment in who you might want to be
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 622.44 628.51 <o,f0,female> i didn 't know the future of emma 's career and no one knows the future of work but i do know this
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 628.64 632.24 <o,f0,female> identity capital begets identity capital
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 632.34 638.13 <o,f0,female> so now is the time for that cross country job that internship that startup you want to try
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 638.91 646.36 <o,f0,female> i 'm not discounting twentysomething exploration here but i am discounting exploration that 's not supposed to count
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 647.15 650.11 <o,f0,female> which by the way is not exploration
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 658.54 671.91 <o,f0,female> second i told emma that the urban tribe is overrated best friends are great for giving rides to the airport but twentysomethings who huddle together with like minded peers limit who they know
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 672.03 674.44 <o,f0,female> what they know how they think
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 674.46 677.26 <o,f0,female> how they speak and where they work
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 677.94 687.52 <o,f0,female> that new piece of capital that new person to date almost always comes from outside the inner circle new things come from what are called our weak ties
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 687.77 689.91 <o,f0,female> our friends of friends of friends
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 700.66 708 <o,f0,female> half of new jobs are never posted so reaching out to your neighbor 's boss is how you get that un posted job
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 708.18 712.18 <o,f0,female> it 's not cheating it 's the science of how information spreads
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 728.55 732.98 <o,f0,female> i told emma the time to start picking your family is now
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 734.28 741.17 <o,f0,female> now you may be thinking that thirty is actually a better time to settle down than twenty or even twenty five
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 741.64 751.5 <o,f0,female> and i agree with you but grabbing whoever you 're living with or sleeping with when everyone on facebook starts walking down the aisle is not progress
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 752.25 766.2 <o,f0,female> the best time to work on your marriage is before you have one and that means being as intentional with love as you are with work picking your family is about consciously choosing who and what you want
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 766.69 773.2 <o,f0,female> rather than just making it work or killing time with whoever happens to be choosing you
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 773.82 790.61 <o,f0,female> so what happened to emma well we went through that address book and she found an old roommate 's cousin who worked at an art museum in another state that weak tie helped her get a job there that job offer gave her the reason to leave that live in boyfriend
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 790.61 807.7 <o,f0,female> now five years later she 's a special events planner for museums she 's married to a man she mindfully chose she loves her new career she loves her new family and she sent me a card that said now the emergency contact blanks don 't seem big enough
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 820.57 822.33 <o,f0,female> bound for somewhere west
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 822.78 836.15 <o,f0,female> right after takeoff a slight change in course is the difference between landing in alaska or fiji likewise at twenty one or twenty five or even twenty nine
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 836.77 846.29 <o,f0,female> one good conversation one good break one good ted talk can have an enormous effect across years and even generations to come
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 847.54 851.73 <o,f0,female> so here 's an idea worth spreading to every twentysomething you know
MegJay_2013 1 MegJay_2013 852.17 859.42 <o,f0,female> it 's as simple as what i learned to say to alex it 's what i now have the privilege of saying to twentysomethings like emma
