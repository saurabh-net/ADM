BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 16.64 29.31 <o,f0,male> last week talking about the work of the foundation sharing some of the problems and warren buffet had recommended i do that being honest about what was going well what wasn 't and making it kind of an annual thing
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 29.96 43.40 <o,f0,male> a goal i had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems because i think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally that is the market does not drive
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 43.86 55.06 <o,f0,male> the scientists the communicators the thinkers the governments to do the right things and only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 55.57 64.48 <o,f0,male> and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to so this morning i'm going to share two of these problems and talk about
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 66.04 73.68 <o,f0,male> but before i dive into those i want to admit that i am an optimist any tough problem i think it can be solved
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 74.35 77.35 <o,f0,male> part of the reason i feel that way is looking at the past
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 77.96 82.05 <o,f0,male> over the past century average lifespan has more than doubled
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 83.07 87.75 <o,f0,male> another statistic perhaps my favorite is to look at childhood deaths
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 98.21 106.89 <o,f0,male> five years ago one hundred and thirty five million children were born so more and less than ten million of them died before the age of five
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 107.27 116.97 <o,f0,male> so that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate it's a phenomenal thing each one of those lives matters a lot
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 117.79 127.69 <o,f0,male> and the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs vaccines that were used more widely
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 145.42 154.39 <o,f0,male> well under twenty years why well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 155.48 157.47 <o,f0,male> diarrhea pneumonia
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 189.90 202.52 <o,f0,male> actually peaked at a bit over five million in the nineteen thirties so it was absolutely gigantic and the disease was all over the world a terrible disease it was in the united states it was in europe
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 203.52 214.49 <o,f0,male> people didn't know what caused it until the early nineteen hundreds when a british military man figured out that it was mosquitoes so it was everywhere
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 217.04 220.22 <o,f0,male> two tools helped bring the death rate down one was
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 220.90 230.72 <o,f0,male> killing the mosquitoes with ddt the other was treating the patients with quinine or quinine derivatives and so that's why the death rate did come down
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 254.98 261.58 <o,f0,male> and so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poorer countries
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 262.03 264.48 <o,f0,male> it doesn't get much investment
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 265.36 272.18 <o,f0,male> for example there's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 273.03 274.61 <o,f0,male> now baldness it's a terrible
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 278.23 286.92 <o,f0,male> and rich men are afflicted and so that's why that priority has been set
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 287.80 297.02 <o,f0,male> but malaria even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact over two hundred million people at any one time are suffering from it
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 297.61 305.68 <o,f0,male> it means that you can't get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so much
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 306.11 315.50 <o,f0,male> now malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitoes i brought some here just so you could experience this we'll let those roam around the
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 323.68 324.11 <o,f0,male> the
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 331.84 334.39 <o,f0,male> those mosquitoes are not infected
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 336.36 341.53 <o,f0,male> so we've come up with a few new things we've got bed nets and bed nets are
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 341.73 351.23 <o,f0,male> a great tool what it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night so the mosquitoes that bite late at night can't get at them
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 351.90 359.79 <o,f0,male> and when you use indoor spraying with ddt and those nets you can cut deaths by over fifty percent
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 360.73 368.40 <o,f0,male> and that's happened now in a number of countries it's great to see but we have to be careful because malaria
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 378.05 391.46 <o,f0,male> and so you end up with two choices if you go into a country with the right tools and the right way you do it vigorously you can actually get a local eradication and that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 392.01 398.13 <o,f0,male> or if you go in kind of half heartedly for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 399.04 411.98 <o,f0,male> but eventually those tools will become ineffective and the death rate will soar back up again and the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention now we're on the upswing
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 412.91 421.77 <o,f0,male> bed net funding is up there's new drug discovery going on our foundation has backed a vaccine that's going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 423.60 431.59 <o,f0,male> over two thirds of the lives if it's effective so we're going to have these new tools but that alone doesn't give us the road map
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 443.36 450.13 <o,f0,male> it involves social scientists so we know how to get not just seventy percent of the people to use the bed nets but ninety percent
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 450.85 463.21 <o,f0,male> we need mathematicians to come in and simulate this to do monte carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 463.73 476.29 <o,f0,male> we need rich world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things and so as these elements come together i'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 478.42 484.63 <o,f0,male> let me turn to a second question a fairly different question but i'd say equally important
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 485.63 488.11 <o,f0,male> and this is how do you make a teacher great
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 500.14 502.02 <o,f0,male> let 's start with why this is important
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 503.07 513.89 <o,f0,male> well all of us here i'll bet had some great teachers we all had a wonderful education that's part of the reason we're here today part of the reason we're successful
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 514.64 528.13 <o,f0,male> i can say that even though i'm a college drop out i had great teachers in fact in the united states the teaching system has worked fairly well there are fairly effective teachers
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 528.47 536.41 <o,f0,male> in a narrow set of places so the top twenty percent of students have gotten a good education and those top twenty percent
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 536.94 549.22 <o,f0,male> have been the best in the world if you measure them against the other top twenty percent and they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the u s at the forefront
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 549.89 562.09 <o,f0,male> now the strength for those top twenty percent is starting to fade on a relative basis but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 562.76 567.56 <o,f0,male> not only has that been weak it's getting weaker and if you look at the economy
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 568.45 571.47 <o,f0,male> it really is only providing opportunities now
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 571.84 579.36 <o,f0,male> to people with a better education and we have to change this we have to change it so that people have equal opportunity
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 579.67 589.30 <o,f0,male> we have to change it so that the country is strong and stays at the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education like science and mathematics
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 590.73 599.26 <o,f0,male> when i first learned the statistics i was pretty stunned at how bad things are over thirty percent of kids never finish high school
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 599.71 606.38 <o,f0,male> and that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate as the number who started in senior year and
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 616.35 624.11 <o,f0,male> the stated dropout rate as soon as that tracking was done to over thirty percent for minority kids it's over fifty percent
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 625.38 629.69 <o,f0,male> and even if you graduate from high school
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 630.83 637.14 <o,f0,male> if you're low income you have less than a twenty five percent chance of ever completing a college degree
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 637.75 645.97 <o,f0,male> if you're low income in the united states you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four year degree
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 647.35 650.04 <o,f0,male> and that doesn't seem entirely fair
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 651.11 653.38 <o,f0,male> so how do you make education better
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 654.16 667.23 <o,f0,male> our foundation for the last nine years has invested in this there's many people working on it we've worked on small schools we've funded scholarships we've done things in libraries a lot of these things had a good effect
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 667.79 670.45 <o,f0,male> but the more we looked at it the more we realized
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 671.24 674.10 <o,f0,male> having great teachers was the very key thing
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 674.90 683.66 <o,f0,male> and we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers between say the top quartile the very best and the bottom
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 684.91 695.93 <o,f0,male> how much variation is there within a school or between schools and the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable a top quartile teacher
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 696.71 706.80 <o,f0,male> will increase the performance of their class based on test scores by over ten percent in a single year what does that mean that means that if the entire u s
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 706.97 715.15 <o,f0,male> for two years had top quartile teachers the entire difference between us and asia would go away
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 715.91 724.80 <o,f0,male> within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away so it's simple all you need are those top quartile teachers
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 725.72 733.40 <o,f0,male> and so you'd say wow we should reward those people we should retain those people we should find out what they're doing
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 733.68 740.94 <o,f0,male> and transfer that skill to other people but i can tell you that absolutely is not happening today
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 763.05 769.75 <o,f0,male> you might think these are people with master 's degrees they've gone back and they've gotten their master 's of education
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 770.12 779.74 <o,f0,male> this chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality that bottom thing which says there's no effect at all is a master 's degree
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 781.21 791.74 <o,f0,male> now the way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded one is seniority because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension the second is
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 795.08 798.68 <o,f0,male> but it in no way is associated with being a better teacher
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 799.30 813.29 <o,f0,male> teach for america slight effect for math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect but overwhelmingly it's your past performance there are some people who are very good at this
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 814.02 826.64 <o,f0,male> and we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in and to replicate it to raise the average capability or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 838.73 844.35 <o,f0,male> now there are a few places very few where great teachers are being made
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 845.37 858.10 <o,f0,male> a good example of one is a set of charter schools called kipp kipp means knowledge is power it's an unbelievable thing they have sixty six schools mostly middle schools some high schools
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 858.87 867.55 <o,f0,male> and what goes on is great teaching they take the poorest kids and over ninety six percent of their high school graduates go
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 867.76 874.24 <o,f0,male> to four year colleges and the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 874.68 888.59 <o,f0,male> in the normal public schools they're team teaching they're constantly improving their teachers they're taking data the test scores and saying to a teacher hey you caused this amount of increase they're deeply engaged in making teaching better
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 889.85 895.28 <o,f0,male> actually go and sit in one of these classrooms at first it's very bizarre i sat down and
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 895.48 904.38 <o,f0,male> i thought what is going on the teacher was running around and the energy level was high i thought i 'm in the sports rally or something what's going on
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 904.83 919.00 <o,f0,male> and the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention which kids were bored and calling kids rapidly putting things up on the board it was a very dynamic environment because particularly in those middle school years fifth through eighth grade
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 919.59 929.16 <o,f0,male> keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention nobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 939.92 941.82 <o,f0,male> a normal school teachers
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 942.66 945.29 <o,f0,male> how good they are the data isn't gathered
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 946.32 954.05 <o,f0,male> in the teacher 's contract it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom sometimes to once per year
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 954.52 961.39 <o,f0,male> and they need advanced notice to do that so imagine running a factory where you've got these workers some of them just making
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 962.03 972.37 <o,f0,male> crap and the management is told hey you can only come down here once a year but you need to let us know because we might actually fool you and try and do a good job in that one brief moment
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 973.78 977.55 <o,f0,male> even a teacher who wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 978.06 985.28 <o,f0,male> they don't have the test scores and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data for example new york passed a law
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 985.65 994.11 <o,f0,male> that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure decision for the teachers
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 999.08 1004.52 <o,f0,male> but i'm optimistic about this i think there are some clear things we can do
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 1004.96 1013.72 <o,f0,male> first of all there's a lot more testing going on and that's given us the picture of where we are and that allows us to understand
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 1023.71 1036.44 <o,f0,male> that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis is very practical in all public schools and so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say ok here 's a little clip of something i thought i did well
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 1037.68 1046.95 <o,f0,male> little clip of something i think i did poorly advise me when this kid acted up how should i have dealt with that and they could all sit and work together on those problems
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 1047.24 1061.82 <o,f0,male> you can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff you can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 1062.14 1075.23 <o,f0,male> learn from that if you have a kid who 's behind you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept and in fact these free courses could not only be available just on the internet but you could make it so that dvds were always
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 1076.19 1083.16 <o,f0,male> available and so anybody who has access to a dvd player can have the very best teachers
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 1084.32 1089.99 <o,f0,male> and so by thinking of this as a personnel system we can do it much better
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 1099.28 1107.27 <o,f0,male> and i thought it was so fantastic it gave you a sense of what a good teacher does i'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 1117.81 1122.30 <o,f0,male> i really think that education is the most important thing to get right
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 1123.15 1132.34 <o,f0,male> for the country to have as strong a future as it should have in fact we have in the stimulus bill it's interesting the house version actually had money in it for these data systems
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 1132.91 1141.44 <o,f0,male> and it was taken out in the senate because there are people who are threatened by these things but i i'm optimistic i think people are beginning to recognize
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 1141.84 1148.29 <o,f0,male> how important this is and it really can make a difference for millions of lives if we get it right
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 1149.85 1154.54 <o,f0,male> only had time to frame those two problems there's a lot more problems like that
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 1157.71 1170.38 <o,f0,male> see you're getting excited just at the very name of these things and the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad you know the system doesn't naturally make it happen
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 1170.89 1184.88 <o,f0,male> governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way the private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things so it's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things get other people involved
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 1185.34 1190.43 <o,f0,male> and you're helping to come up with solutions and with that i think there's some great things that will come out of it
