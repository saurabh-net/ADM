GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 104.13 112.08 <o,f0,male> what they have in common is what we see unlocked and what we cannot see what we see unlocked
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 112.44 121.75 <o,f0,male> the invisible ties and bonds of sympathy that bring us together to become a human community
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 122.76 131.78 <o,f0,male> what these pictures demonstrate is that we do feel the pain of others however distantly what i think these pictures demonstrate
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 141.74 153.41 <o,f0,male> across all religions across all faiths across all continents a moral sense that not only do we share the pain of others and believe in something bigger than ourselves but we have a duty to act
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 153.71 160.80 <o,f0,male> when we see things that are wrong that need righted see injuries that need to be corrected see problems that need to be
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 187.57 192.35 <o,f0,male> reagan asked olof palme the social democratic prime minister of sweden

GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 205.74 216.25 <o,f0,male> i believe there is a moral sense and a global ethic that commands attention from people of every religion and every faith and people of no faith
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 216.76 224.97 <o,f0,male> but i think what's new is that we now have the capacity to communicate instantaneously across frontiers right across the world
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 225.51 233.14 <o,f0,male> we now have the capacity to find common ground with people we will never meet but who we will meet through the internet
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 233.86 241.31 <o,f0,male> and through all the modern means of communication that we now have the capacity to organize and take collective action together
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 241.63 253.92 <o,f0,male> to deal with the problem or an injustice that we want to deal with and i believe that this makes this a unique age in human history and it is the start of what i would call the creation of a truly
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 254.44 263.79 <o,f0,male> global society go back two hundred years when the slave trade was under pressure from william wilberforce and all the protesters

GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 273.42 287.30 <o,f0,male> what could they have done with the pictures they could have shown if they were able to use the modern means of communication to win people a s hearts and minds or if you take eglantyne jebb the woman who created save the children ninety years ago
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 287.74 297.22 <o,f0,male> she was so appalled by what was happening in austria as a result of the first world war and what was happening to children who were part of the defeated
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 324.23 335.09 <o,f0,male> to create a sense that the injustice that people saw had to be acted upon immediately now look at what a s happened in the last ten years in philippines in two thousand and one president estrada
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 335.44 343.20 <o,f0,male> a million people texted each other about the corruption of that regime eventually brought it down and it was of course called

GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 346.23 351.67 <o,f0,male> then you have in zimbabwe the first election under robert mugabe a year ago
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 361.92 369.84 <o,f0,male> or take burma and the monks that were blogging out a country that nobody knew anything that was happening until these blogs told the world
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 370.18 379.81 <o,f0,male> that there was a repression meaning that lives were being lost and people were being persecuted and aung san suu kyi who is one of the great prisoners of conscience of the world
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 381.12 389.04 <o,f0,male> to be listened to then take iran itself and what people are doing today following what happened to
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 390.02 403.31 <o,f0,male> people who are preventing the security services of iran finding those people who are blogging out of iran changing their address to tehran iran and making it difficult for the security services
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 404.01 415.50 <o,f0,male> take therefore what modern technology is capable of the power of our moral sense allied to the power of communications and our ability to organize
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 417.11 423.03 <o,f0,male> that in my view gives us the first opportunity as a community
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 423.43 435.77 <o,f0,male> to fundamentally change the world foreign policy can never be the same again it cannot be run by elites it a s got to be run by listening to the public opinions of peoples who are blogging who are communicating with each other around the world
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 436.39 444.21 <o,f0,male> two hundred years ago the problem we had to solve was slavery one hundred and fifty years ago i suppose the main problem in a country like ours
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 444.45 452.13 <o,f0,male> was how young people children had the right to education one hundred years ago in most countries in europe the pressure was for the right to vote
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 452.54 461.51 <o,f0,male> fifty years ago the pressure was for the right to social security and welfare in the last fifty sixty years we have seen fascism anti semitism
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 463.08 468.54 <o,f0,male> apartheid discrimination on the basis of sex and gender and sexuality
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 468.76 478.18 <o,f0,male> all these have come under pressure because of the campaigns by people to change the world i was with nelson mandela a year ago when he was in london
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 478.88 488.06 <o,f0,male> i was at a concert that he was attending to mark his birthday and for the creation of new resources for his foundation
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 488.31 495.05 <o,f0,male> i was sitting next to nelson mandela i was very privileged to do so when amy winehouse came onto the stage
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 505.90 510.54 <o,f0,male> said nelson mandela and i have a lot in common
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 512.24 514.79 <o,f0,male> my husband too has spent a long time in prison
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 525.11 526.56 <o,f0,male> he said in his lifetime he
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 536.64 545.53 <o,f0,male> the challenge of poverty of climate change global challenges that needed global solutions and needed the creation of a truly global society
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 546.11 554.93 <o,f0,male> we are the first generation that is in a position to do this combine the power of a global ethic
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 555.46 562.97 <o,f0,male> with the power of our ability to communicate and organize globally with the challenges that we now face
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 563.39 577.66 <o,f0,male> most of which are global in their nature climate change cannot be solved in one country but has got to be solved by the world working together a financial crisis just as we have seen could not be solved by america alone or europe alone it needed the world to work together
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 578.06 589.76 <o,f0,male> take the problems of security and terrorism and equally the problem of human rights and development they cannot be solved by africa alone they cannot be solved by america or europe alone we cannot solve these problems
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 601.09 610.47 <o,f0,male> a truly global society built on that ethic but with institutions that can serve that global society and make for a different future
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 611.01 618.10 <o,f0,male> we have now and are the first generation with the power to do this take climate change is it not absolutely scandalous
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 628.86 637.52 <o,f0,male> when we want to create a global carbon market but there is no global institution that people have been able to agree upon to deal with this problem
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 637.96 651.86 <o,f0,male> one of the things that has to come out of copenhagen in the next few months is an agreement that there will be a global environmental institution that is able to deal with the problems of persuading the whole of the world to move along a climate change agenda one of
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 674.61 684.10 <o,f0,male> if people in poorer countries can be hit by a crisis that starts in new york or starts in the sub prime market of the united states of america
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 684.47 695.28 <o,f0,male> if people can find that that sub prime product has been transferred across nations many many times until it ends up in banks in iceland or the rest in britain and people 's ordinary savings are affected by it
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 695.74 710.28 <o,f0,male> then you cannot rely on a system of national supervision you need in the long run for stability for economic growth for jobs as well as for financial stability global economic institutions that make sure that growth to be sustained has to be shared
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 710.52 718.82 <o,f0,male> and are built on the principle that the prosperity of this world is indivisible so another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions that reflect
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 719.25 729.51 <o,f0,male> our ideas of fairness and responsibility not the ideas that were the basis of the last stage of financial development over these recent years then take development
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 729.87 741.58 <o,f0,male> and take the partnership we need between our countries and the rest of the world the poorest part of the world we do not have the basis of a proper partnership for the future
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 749.70 760.22 <o,f0,male> sierra leone this is a country of six and a half million people but it has only eighty doctors it has two hundred nurses it has one hundred and twenty midwives
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 772.39 780.11 <o,f0,male> eleven years old her parents had both died from aids her mother and then her father she was an aids orphan being handed across different
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 780.74 790.74 <o,f0,male> extended families to be cared for she herself was suffering from hiv she was suffering from tuberculosis i met her in a field she was ragged she had no shoes
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 791.45 799.99 <o,f0,male> when you looked in her eyes any girl at the age of eleven is looking forward to the future but there was an unreachable sadness in that
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 801.67 810.38 <o,f0,male> and if i could have translated that to the rest of the world for that moment i believe that all the work that it had done for the global hiv aids fund
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 810.79 820.01 <o,f0,male> would be rewarded by people prepared to make donations we must then build a proper relationship between the richest and the poorest countries based on our desire
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 820.53 828.88 <o,f0,male> they are able to fend for themselves with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture so that africa is not a net importer of food but an exporter of food
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 829.30 836.94 <o,f0,male> take the problems of human rights and the problems of security in so many countries around the world burma is in chains zimbabwe
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 837.52 844.59 <o,f0,male> is a human tragedy in sudan thousands of people have died unnecessarily for wars that we could prevent
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 845.86 853.39 <o,f0,male> in the rwanda children 's museum there is a photograph of a ten year old boy
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 854.22 861.54 <o,f0,male> and the children 's museum is commemorating the lives that were lost in the rwandan genocide where a million people died
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 862.24 872.00 <o,f0,male> there is a photograph of a boy called david beside that photograph there is the information about his life it said david age ten
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 872.72 886.92 <o,f0,male> david ambition to be a doctor favorite sport football what did he enjoy most making people laugh how did he die tortured to death
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 887.69 896.28 <o,f0,male> last words said to his mother who was also tortured to death don 't worry the united nations are coming
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 897.02 906.13 <o,f0,male> and we never did and that young boy believed our promises that we would help people in difficulty in rwanda and we never did
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 906.77 917.61 <o,f0,male> so we have got to create in this world also institutions for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid but also for reconstruction and security for some of the conflict ridden states of the world
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 918.18 929.20 <o,f0,male> so my argument today is basically this we have the means by which we could create a truly global society the institutions of this global society can be created by our endeavors
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 929.59 941.53 <o,f0,male> that global ethic can infuse the fairness and responsibility that is necessary for these institutions to work but we should not lose the chance in this generation in this decade in particular
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 941.84 949.89 <o,f0,male> with president obama in america with other people working with us around the world to create global institutions for the environment and for finance
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 950.13 961.86 <o,f0,male> and for security and for development that make sense of our responsibility to other peoples our desire to bind the world together and our need to tackle problems that everybody knows exist
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 963.08 970.57 <o,f0,male> that in ancient rome that when cicero spoke to his audiences people used to turn to each other and say
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 970.96 977.74 <o,f0,male> about cicero great speech but it is said that in ancient greece when demosthenes spoke to his audiences
GordonBrown_2009G 1 GordonBrown_2009G 978.98 986.29 <o,f0,male> to each other and didn a t say great speech they said let 's march we should be marching towards a global society thank you
