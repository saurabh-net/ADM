StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 41.52 44.27 <o,f0,male> would be helpful if humanity got into the habit
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 45.55 49.69 <o,f0,male> of thinking of the now not just as next week or next quarter
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 50.86 52.13 <o,f0,male> next ten thousand years
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 57.88 64.71 <o,f0,male> we have the long now foundation in san francisco it's an incubator for about a dozen projects all having to do with continuity over the long term
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 65.89 66.86 <o,f0,male> core project
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 67.85 69.81 <o,f0,male> is a rather ambitious
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 71.77 75.58 <o,f0,male> i suppose a mythic undertaking to build a ten thousand year clock
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 77.19 79.96 <o,f0,male> really keep good time for that long a period
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 81.26 82.58 <o,f0,male> the design problems
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 83.82 89.69 <o,f0,male> of a project like that are just absolutely delicious go to the clock
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 91.71 100.34 <o,f0,male> and what we have here is something many of you saw here three years ago it's the first working prototype of the clock it's about nine feet high designed by danny hillis and alexander rose
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 101.11 102.38 <o,f0,male> it's presently in london
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 103.26 106.88 <o,f0,male> and is ticking away very deliberately at the science museum there
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 107.56 109.47 <o,f0,male> so the design problem for today
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 110.82 121.86 <o,f0,male> is going to be how do you house an eventual monumental clock like this so it can really tick save time beautifully for one hundred centuries well this was the first solution
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 128.86 132.77 <o,f0,male> and it looked like a way to go until you start thinking about what does deep time
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 133.71 147.87 <o,f0,male> do to a building well this is what deep time does to a building this is the parthenon it's only two thousand four hundred and fifty years old and look what happened to it here 's a beautiful project they really knew it 'd last forever because they'd build it out of absolutely huge stones
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 148.87 152.14 <o,f0,male> and now it's a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 152.75 158.71 <o,f0,male> that's what happens to buildings they're vulnerable even the most durable and intactable buildings like the
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 160.21 164.24 <o,f0,male> are in bad shape when you look up close they've been looted inside and out
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 164.99 167.76 <o,f0,male> and they're built to protect things but they don't protect things
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 168.68 182.07 <o,f0,male> so we got to thinking if you can't put things safely in a building where can you safely put them we thought ok underground how about underground with a view underground in a place that's really solid so the obvious answer was
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 182.99 190.92 <o,f0,male> we need a mountain you don't want just any mountain you need absolutely the right mountain if you're going to have a clock for ten thousand years
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 191.54 194.50 <o,f0,male> so here 's an image of the long view of the search problem
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 196.60 205.32 <o,f0,male> and we got to thinking for various reasons it ought to be a desert mountain so we got looking in the dry areas of the southwest we looked at mesas in new mexico
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 220.29 222.13 <o,f0,male> right on the eastern border of
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 223.76 226.88 <o,f0,male> it's the highest range in the state over thirteen thousand feet
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 233.79 235.21 <o,f0,male> this place is remote
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 242.08 246.96 <o,f0,male> and it's the only thing that goes by is what's called america 's loneliest highway us fifty
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 249.27 255.50 <o,f0,male> now inside the yellow line here on the right is that's all national park inside the green line
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 256.10 266.91 <o,f0,male> is national forest and then over to the left is bureau of land management land and some private land now as it happened that two mile long strip right in the middle this vertical was available
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 270.42 275.74 <o,f0,male> and thanks to jay walker who was here and mitch kapor who was here who started the process
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 276.17 278.90 <o,f0,male> long now was able to get that two mile long strip of land
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 279.92 281.58 <o,f0,male> now let 's look at the grand truth of what's there
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 283.42 285.27 <o,f0,male> pole canyon looking west
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 286.04 288.28 <o,f0,male> up the western escarpment of mount washington
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 289.00 291.82 <o,f0,male> which is eleven thousand six hundred feet on top
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 303.67 307.98 <o,f0,male> be a pilgrimage to get to it it would be a serious hike to get up to where the clock
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 309.07 311.25 <o,f0,male> so last june the long now board
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 312.05 319.38 <o,f0,male> staff and some donors and advisors made a two week expedition to the mountain to
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 338.17 340.07 <o,f0,male> it starts with the image
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 340.78 346.62 <o,f0,male> the image is a picture you have in your mind of the goal at the end of the journey in this case it might well be an image of the clock
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 347.17 353.34 <o,f0,male> then there's the point of embarkation that is the point of transition from ordinary life to being a pilgrim on a quest
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 381.80 388.02 <o,f0,male> now brian eno who 's been in the thick of the long now process spent two years making a cd
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 394.33 407.46 <o,f0,male> based on parts of it are based on an algorithm that danny hillis developed so that a peal of ten bells makes a different peal every day for ten thousand years the hillis algorithm ten factorial gives you that number
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 408.45 410.43 <o,f0,male> and in fact pretty soon we'll hear the sound
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 427.80 439.71 <o,f0,male> have a secret payoff something you didn't expect that caps what you did expect then there's the return you've got to have a gradual return to the ordinary world so you have time to assimilate
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 442.36 442.79 <o,f0,female> and then
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 443.23 452.92 <o,f0,male> about a memento number seven at the end of it there's something physical a kind of reward that you take away it might be a piece of a core drill of the mountain something that's just yours
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 454.90 456.42 <o,f0,male> how do you study
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 466.11 467.90 <o,f0,male> ideas and decisions
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 479.27 480.83 <o,f0,male> other elements were
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 483.40 486.51 <o,f0,male> weather approaches and elevation
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 490.70 492.38 <o,f0,male> turns out that mount washington
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 494.45 506.41 <o,f0,male> the world 's oldest living thing people think they're just the size of shrubs but that's not actually true there are trees on that mountain that are five thousand years old and still living
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 516.17 524.82 <o,f0,male> studies of trunks that are on the mountain some of them go back ten thousand years the stone itself is absolutely beautiful sculpted by millennia
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 540.66 541.93 <o,f0,male> you'll find out why it's called
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 551.38 555.93 <o,f0,male> pine forest on long now land i should say that the age of bristlecones
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 557.05 565.36 <o,f0,male> was discovered led by a theory edmund schulman in the nineteen fifties had been studying trees under great stress at timberline
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 565.93 573.77 <o,f0,male> and came to the realization that he put in an article in science magazine called longevity under adversity in conifers
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 599.51 603.99 <o,f0,male> was one billion dollars for one hundred and eighty acres and a couple
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 606.47 609.88 <o,f0,male> the owner said there 's one billion dollars of beryllium in that mountain
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 610.70 614.81 <o,f0,male> and we said wow that's great listen we'll counter how about zero
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 635.88 643.91 <o,f0,male> the whole property for one hundred and forty thousand dollars this is one of the mines it doesn't have any beryllium in it it's called the pole adit
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 672.30 685.66 <o,f0,male> shale would like some shoring and so parts of it are caved in in there that's ben roberts from he 's the bat specialist from the national park but there are many wonders back in there like this weird fungus on some of the collapsed timbers
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 696.86 698.67 <o,f0,male> was a very productive silver mine
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 699.58 706.97 <o,f0,male> in fact it was the highest operating mine in nevada and it ran year round you can imagine what it was like in the winter at ten thousand feet
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 707.78 712.97 <o,f0,male> you may recognize a couple of the miners there there's jeff bezos on the right and paul
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 715.11 723.42 <o,f0,male> looking for galena which is the lead silver thing they didn't find any they both kept their day jobs
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 725.40 733.58 <o,f0,male> mine it's called the bonanza adit it's down in a canyon and alexander rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people from the national park to survey
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 734.09 741.79 <o,f0,male> the whole mine it's a mile deep and they also found four species of bats in there now almost all those mines by the way meet underneath the mountain
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 749.92 752.49 <o,f0,male> mountains specialize in interesting weather
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 752.69 755.24 <o,f0,male> way more interesting than monterey even today
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 763.09 771.99 <o,f0,male> that was a great time to go up and visit our weather station which again thanks to mitch kapor we're building up there and it's a pretty interesting scene
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 772.24 779.79 <o,f0,male> this is on the left there the joyful lady is pat irwin who 's the regional head of the national forest service and they gave us the
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 788.63 799.34 <o,f0,male> the weather station 's pretty interesting kurt bollacker and alexander rose designed a radically wireless station it runs on solar and it sends a signalwith that antenna and bounces it off of
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 801.28 810.64 <o,f0,male> trails in the atmosphere to a place in bozeman montana where the data is taken down and then sent through landlines to san francisco
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 810.81 813.57 <o,f0,male> where we put the data in real time up on our website
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 823.01 831.62 <o,f0,male> as it happens there are no trails anywhere on mount washington just a few old mining roads like this so you have to bushwhack everywhere but there's no bears
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 838.36 847.24 <o,f0,male> this place has been empty for a long time you can hike for days and not encounter anybody well here 's a potential approach you need to come up the lincoln canyon
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 848.05 858.02 <o,f0,male> it's this beautiful world all of its own surrounded by cliffs and it's an easy hike to stroll up the canyon bottom until you get to this barrier and
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 859.35 860.98 <o,f0,male> it actually presents a problem
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 862.93 864.59 <o,f0,male> scratch lincoln canyon as an approach
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 870.46 871.74 <o,f0,male> see why we sometimes
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 883.49 893.01 <o,f0,male> through meadows and steepening forest to the high base of the cliffs at ten thousand five hundred feet where there's a bit of a problem now jeff
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 895.45 896.78 <o,f0,male> the end of the expedition
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 897.49 899.25 <o,f0,male> make the clock inaccessible
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 900.59 903.76 <o,f0,male> the harder it is to get to the more people will value it
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 905.32 916.90 <o,f0,male> check those are six hundred foot vertical walls there so alexander rose wanted to explore this route and he started over here on the left
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 917.33 925.79 <o,f0,male> from his pickup truck at eight thousand nine hundred feet and headed up the mountain now as you gain elevation your iq goes down
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 927.96 929.92 <o,f0,male> but your emotional affect goes up
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 930.55 940.08 <o,f0,male> which is great for having a mythic experience whether you want to or not in fact danny hillis can estimate altitude by how much math he can't do
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 944.19 955.95 <o,f0,male> now i happened to be on the radio with alexander when he got to this point at the base of the cliffs and he said quote there 's a hidden notch i think i can get up a ways
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 956.61 968.18 <o,f0,male> now he 's a rock climber but you know he 's our executive director i don't want him killed i know he 's going to love cliffs i'm saying be careful be careful be careful then he starts going up and the next thing i hear is
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 971.00 979.65 <o,f0,male> like climbing stairs i'm going up sixty degrees it's a secret passage it's like something from tolkien and i'm going careful careful please be careful
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 987.98 995.90 <o,f0,male> in fact there he is that's alexander rose first ascent of the western face to mount washington and a solo ascent at that
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 997.17 998.87 <o,f0,male> this discovery changed everything
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 999.41 1001.91 <o,f0,male> about our sense of these cliffs and what to do with them
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1002.48 1009.38 <o,f0,male> we realized that we had to name this thing that alexander discovered how about zander 's crevice no
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1013.66 1021.64 <o,f0,male> so we finally decided on alexander 's siq zander 's siq is named after some of you have been to petra there's this wonderful
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1022.22 1035.23 <o,f0,male> slot canyon that leads into petra called the siq and so this is the siq and it really is hidden i can't find it in this image and i'm not sure you can only when you get fresh snow can you see just along the rim there and that brings it out
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1035.53 1042.35 <o,f0,male> now danny and i were up at this same area one day and danny looked over to the right and noticed something halfway up the cliffs
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1044.81 1054.93 <o,f0,male> a cliff shelf with bristlecones on it and supposed that people going up to the clock inside the mountain could come out onto that shelf and look down at the view
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1055.86 1063.65 <o,f0,male> and the people toiling up the mountain could see them these tiny little people up there incredibly halfway up the cliff how did they get there do i have to do that
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1064.31 1073.00 <o,f0,male> and so that maybe becomes part of the draw and part of the labyrinth you can get another angle on danny's porch by going around to the south
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1073.53 1074.70 <o,f0,male> and looking north
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1079.02 1080.52 <o,f0,male> you need to know that danny's clock is
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1080.77 1086.11 <o,f0,male> be kept accurate by a ray of sunshine that perfect noon hitting it every sunny day
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1086.58 1096.73 <o,f0,male> and the pulse of heat from that sets off a solar trigger which resets the clock to make it perfectly accurate so even with the slowing of the rotation of the earth and so on the clock will keep perfectly good time
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1097.11 1105.94 <o,f0,male> so here we're looking from the south look north this is all forest service land if you go up on top of those cliffs that's some of the long now land in those trees
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1106.79 1109.03 <o,f0,male> and if you go up there and look back
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1113.11 1115.63 <o,f0,male> from the top of the mountain that's the long view
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1116.36 1121.28 <o,f0,male> that's eighty miles to the horizon and that's also timberline and those bristlecones really are shrubs
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1124.95 1128.91 <o,f0,male> a different place to be it's eleven thousand four hundred feet and
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1130.08 1132.56 <o,f0,male> you go over to the right from this image to
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1132.96 1145.77 <o,f0,male> at the edge of the cliffs it's six hundred foot just about a yard to the left of kurt bollacker 's foot there is a six hundred foot drop he 's ambling on over to zander 's siq that's what it looks like looking down
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1155.80 1165.35 <o,f0,male> that's not snow that's what the white limestone looks like you also see there a bighorn sheep their herd was reintroduced from wyoming
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1165.73 1168.28 <o,f0,male> and they're doing pretty well but they've got a bit of trouble
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1168.80 1176.18 <o,f0,male> this is danny hillis and he 's figuring out a design problem he 's trying to determine if where he is on a bit of long now land
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1176.64 1179.13 <o,f0,male> would appear from down in the valley
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1179.64 1187.68 <o,f0,male> to be the actual peak of the mountain because the real peak is hidden around the corner this is what in the infantry we used to call the military crest
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1188.50 1201.41 <o,f0,male> and as it turned out the answer is yes that is from down below in the valley it does look like the peak and that might be conjured with we gradually realized we have three serious design domains to work on with this
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1204.84 1209.96 <o,f0,male> another is the experience in the mountain and the third is the experience from the mountain
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1210.57 1222.22 <o,f0,male> which is really dominated by the view shed of the spring valley there behind danny and if you look off to the right out there fifteen miles across to the schell creek range
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1222.84 1232.10 <o,f0,male> in the front there are ten ranches strung right along the base of the mountains using the water from the mountains in fact there are artesian wells where water springs right into the air
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1233.06 1244.49 <o,f0,male> one of the ranches is called the kirkeby ranch and i'll take you there for a minute it's a very nice ranch alfalfa and cattle run by paul and ronnie brenham
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1248.13 1248.88 <o,f0,male> also hard
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1257.42 1258.31 <o,f0,male> line of trees
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1260.34 1262.41 <o,f0,male> see what the valley used to look like
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1264.56 1267.92 <o,f0,male> rocky mountain junipers that have been there for thousands of years
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1268.89 1274.27 <o,f0,male> a scheme emerged that long now is looking to see if it might be possible to buy up the whole valley
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1274.98 1283.39 <o,f0,male> because those ten ranches with their seventeen thousand acres dominate a five hundred square mile valley with their grazing allotments and so on
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1283.85 1287.45 <o,f0,male> and there's a possibility that you could get the whole thing for five million dollars
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1287.97 1293.79 <o,f0,male> and gradually restore it to its wild condition and somewhere in the process turn it back over to the national park
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1294.54 1297.94 <o,f0,male> and it would double the size of great basin national park that would be swell
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1298.63 1300.67 <o,f0,male> let 's take one more look at the mountain itself
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1301.60 1310.54 <o,f0,male> the clock experience should be profound but from the outside it should be invisible now at the base of the high cliffs
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1320.48 1330.81 <o,f0,male> could have an entrance which was very rough and narrow as you first went in that gradually becomes more refined and then actually quite exquisite and this stone takes a perfect polish
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1331.73 1339.71 <o,f0,male> have a polished set of passages and chambers in there eventually leading to the ten thousand year clock
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1340.54 1352.79 <o,f0,male> and it's not a mine this would be a nuanced evocation of the basic structure of the mountain and you would be appreciating it as much from inside as you do from outside this is architecture not made by building
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1353.43 1356.06 <o,f0,male> but by what you very carefully take away
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1357.69 1359.18 <o,f0,male> so that's what the mountain taught us
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1360.88 1363.12 <o,f0,male> most of the amazingness of the clock
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1363.58 1366.19 <o,f0,male> we can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1366.99 1371.02 <o,f0,male> all we have to do is highlight its spectacular features and blend in with them
StewartBrand_2004 1 StewartBrand_2004 1375.92 1382.41 <o,f0,male> now the tewa indians in the southwest have a saying for what you need to do when you want to think long term
