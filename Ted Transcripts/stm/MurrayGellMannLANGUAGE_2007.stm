MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 1 MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 13.22 22.74 <o,f0,male> well i'm involved in other things besides physics in fact mostly now in other things one thing is distant relationships among human languages
MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 1 MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 23.69 28.97 <o,f0,male> and the professional historical linguists in the us and in western europe
MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 1 MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 29.58 32.99 <o,f0,male> mostly try to stay away from any long distance relationships
MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 1 MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 34.21 36.53 <o,f0,male> big groupings groupings that go back
MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 1 MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 37.28 43.74 <o,f0,male> a long time longer than the familiar families they don't like that they think it's crank i don't think it's crank
MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 1 MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 44.48 51.90 <o,f0,male> and there are some brilliant linguists mostly russians who are working on that at santa fe institute and in moscow
MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 1 MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 52.63 64.77 <o,f0,male> and i would love to see where that leads does it really lead to a single ancestor some twenty twenty five thousand years ago and what if we go back beyond that single ancestor
MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 1 MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 81.10 93.23 <o,f0,male> must be older than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures and dance steps in the soft clay in the caves in western europe in the aurignacian period some
MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 1 MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 93.86 106.21 <o,f0,male> thirty five thousand years ago or earlier i can't believe they did all those things and didn't also have a modern language so i would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further but that doesn't mean
MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 1 MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 106.55 118.48 <o,f0,male> that all or many or most of today 's attested languages couldn't descend perhaps from one that's much younger than that like say twenty thousand years or something of that kind it's what we call a bottleneck
MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 1 MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 120.71 125.89 <o,f0,male> may have been right you may just know more about everything than anyone so it's been an honor thank you
