NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 13.14 13.27 <o,f0,male> so
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 13.72 24.75 <o,f0,female> i'm in chile in the atacama desert sitting in a hotel lobby because that's the only place that i can get a wi fi connection and i have this picture up on my screen and a woman comes up behind me
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 29.43 35.34 <o,f0,female> and unfortunately i can be a little too honest i said no it's it's penguin shit
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 37.63 39.35 <o,f0,female> and you know excuse me
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 41.24 43.06 <o,f0,female> sense that she thought i was speaking
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 56.10 66.49 <o,f0,female> just been in the falkland islands taking pictures of penguins this is a gentoo penguin and she was still skeptical so literally a few minutes before that i downloaded this scientific paper
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 67.52 74.17 <o,f0,female> about calculations on avian defecation which is really quite interesting because it turns out
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 74.26 75.68 <o,f0,male> you can model this as
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 87.13 88.76 <o,f0,female> at this point she stops me
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 94.47 95.53 <o,f0,male> what do you do
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 97.98 102.48 <o,f0,female> i was stuck because i didn't have any way to describe what i do
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 102.86 111.75 <o,f0,female> and so in some sense this talk today is my answer to that it's a selection of a random bunch of the stuff that i do
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 113.09 121.74 <o,f0,female> it's very hard for me to make sense of it so i'm not sure that you can it's the kind of thing that i sit up late at night thinking about sometimes often at four in the morning
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 123.90 126.58 <o,f0,female> so some people are afraid of what i do
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 127.95 135.08 <o,f0,female> some people think i am the nerd tony soprano and in response i have ordered a bulletproof pocket protector
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 136.73 140.40 <o,f0,female> i'm not sure what these people think because i don't speak norsk
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 142.40 145.27 <o,f0,female> but i'm not thinking monsteret is a good thing
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 147.02 147.52 <o,f0,female> you know
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 148.73 158.62 <o,f0,female> so one of the things that i love to do is travel around the world and look at archaeological sites because archaeology gives us an opportunity to study past civilizations and see where
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 158.88 166.14 <o,f0,female> they succeeded and where they failed use science to you know work backwards and say well really what were they thinking
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 166.75 168.95 <o,f0,female> and recently i was in easter island
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 172.04 179.50 <o,f0,female> an incredibly mysterious place because no matter where you go in easter island you're struck by these statues called the moai
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 180.97 182.30 <o,f0,female> sixty four square miles
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 182.79 185.49 <o,f0,female> they made so far as we can tell nine hundred of them
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 187.34 188.22 <o,f0,female> why on earth
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 188.78 200.71 <o,f0,female> and if you haven't read jared diamond 's book collapse i totally recommend that you do he 's a got a great chapter about it basically these people committed ecological suicide in order to make more of these
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 201.47 201.84 <o,f0,female> and
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 204.68 208.74 <o,f0,female> cut down the last tree and commit suicide because we need more identical statues
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 219.10 227.10 <o,f0,female> that look on the face why that brow i mean it's such a powerful thing where did they get that inspiration and then i met yoyo
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 227.87 232.88 <o,f0,female> who is the native rapa nuian guide and if you look at yoyo 's face you kind of figure out where they got
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 235.18 239.82 <o,f0,male> many mysteries these statues everyone wants to know how did they made them how did they transport them
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 240.90 246.53 <o,f0,male> this woman in the foreground is jo anne van tilberg she's the leading archaeologist working easter island today
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 256.51 262.55 <o,f0,male> one interesting problem is the stone isn't very hard so this used to be completely smooth
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 276.27 283.57 <o,f0,male> and we're going to do a very high res digitization first because it's a way of preserving them second we have these ideas about how you can algorithmically then
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 283.95 292.04 <o,f0,male> learn a few of the mysteries about them how long have they been standing in what positions and maybe indirectly get at some of the issues of what caused them to be the way they are
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 297.54 299.80 <o,f0,male> get a gratuitous picture of a moai with a comet
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 301.76 307.67 <o,f0,male> i also have an archaeological project going on in egypt going on is perhaps a little bit strong
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 318.23 320.75 <o,f0,male> another thing i do is i invent stuff
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 321.95 324.07 <o,f0,male> in fact i design nuclear reactors
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 327.68 336.98 <o,f0,female> this is the conventional nuclear fuel cycle the red line is what is done in most nuclear reactors it's called the open fuel cycle
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 337.92 340.74 <o,f0,female> the white lines are what's called an advance fuel cycle where you
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 342.58 351.52 <o,f0,female> now this is the normal way it's done it's got the huge advantage that it does not create carbon pollution it has a lot of
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 361.75 366.09 <o,f0,female> which is a problem so our reactor eliminates these steps
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 367.63 370.24 <o,f0,female> which if we can actually make it work is a really cool thing
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 382.10 386.49 <o,f0,female> it's the kind of very high risk but potentially very high return thing that we do
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 388.53 394.34 <o,f0,female> a totally different field we do a lot of stuff in solid state physics particularly in an area called metamaterials
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 394.80 403.72 <o,f0,female> a metamaterial is an artificial material which manipulates in this case electromagnetic radiation in a way that you couldn't otherwise
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 404.42 408.12 <o,f0,female> so this device here is an invisibility cloak
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 410.32 411.67 <o,f0,female> but if you were a microwave
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 412.64 414.24 <o,f0,female> this is how you would view it
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 421.66 425.71 <o,f0,female> you could do that with mirrors from one angle the cool thing is this does it from all angles
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 436.79 442.79 <o,f0,female> it's you know today i'd like to say it's a zero billion dollar business but in fact it's negative
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 443.68 446.10 <o,f0,female> but some day some day maybe it's going to work
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 447.35 449.25 <o,f0,female> we do a lot of work in biomedical
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 457.50 459.13 <o,f0,female> diseases in developing countries
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 466.39 467.62 <o,f0,female> my eyes by the way
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 469.90 477.18 <o,f0,female> now i'm also very interested in cooking while i was at microsoft i took a leave of absence and went to a chef school in france
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 490.24 498.91 <o,f0,female> but barbecue 's interesting because it's one of these cult foods like chili or bouillabaisse various parts will have a cult food that people get enormously attached to
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 510.22 514.78 <o,f0,female> if this looks more complicated than the nuclear reactor that's because it is
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 516.64 522.97 <o,f0,female> but if you get to play with all those knobs and dials and of course really the controller over there does it all on software you can
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 528.77 533.41 <o,f0,female> this is a high speed centrifuge you should all have one in your kitchen beside your turbochef
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 539.32 541.93 <o,f0,female> oh boy does it clarify chicken stock you would not
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 555.38 561.80 <o,f0,female> turns out a it's useful and for a geek like me it's fun theory is red black is experiment
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 562.95 567.44 <o,f0,female> so i'm either really good at faking it or or this particular model seems to work
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 568.47 573.87 <o,f0,female> so another random thing i do is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence or seti
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 574.38 583.15 <o,f0,female> and you may be familiar with the movie contact which sort of popularized that it turns out there are real people who go out and search for extraterrestrials in a very scientific way
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 595.92 598.86 <o,f0,male> and jill has dedicated her life to this
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 605.88 609.15 <o,f0,male> but jill has what i call slow heroism
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 609.98 612.64 <o,f0,male> risking her professional life on something
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 627.85 629.80 <o,f0,male> and afterwards they came to me and they said so
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 638.63 640.52 <o,f0,male> you know that creepy rich guy in the movie
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 644.42 645.82 <o,f0,male> just a movie come on
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 649.14 661.16 <o,f0,female> so the seti institute with a little bit of help from me and a lot of help from paul allen and a variety of other people is building a dedicated radio telescope in hat creek california so they can do this seti work
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 675.50 678.25 <o,f0,male> can you imagine e t s phoning home and i'm not like
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 678.70 680.15 <o,f0,male> there you know horrible
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 681.49 689.46 <o,f0,male> so i do a lot of work on dinosaurs i'm known to tedsters as the guy that has sex with dinosaurs and i resemble that remark
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 690.47 693.45 <o,f0,male> talk about a different aspect of dinosaurs which is the finding of
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 695.11 698.52 <o,f0,male> now to find dinosaurs you hike around in horrible conditions
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 711.05 721.02 <o,f0,male> always find dinosaurs in deserts or badlands areas that have very little plant growth and have flash floods in the spring you know skiers pray for
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 725.29 726.06 <o,f0,male> hike around
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 726.90 734.43 <o,f0,male> and this is after you dig them up they look like this you hike around you see something like this now this is something i found so look at it very closely here
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 744.23 747.99 <o,f0,male> you say well gee that's kind of interesting what are all of these pieces
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 749.78 754.03 <o,f0,male> closely you can recognize actually from the shape that these are skull fragments
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 762.61 764.80 <o,f0,male> a big serration on the edge
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 765.46 768.21 <o,f0,male> this is what tyrannosaurus rex looks like in the ground
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 768.90 771.38 <o,f0,male> this is what it's like to find a tyrannosaurus rex
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 772.02 773.91 <o,f0,male> which i was lucky enough to do a few years ago
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 776.66 778.91 <o,f0,male> this is what tyrannosaurus rex looks like in my living room
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 781.15 788.29 <o,f0,female> not the same one actually this is a cast which i had bought and then after buying the cast i found my own and i don't have room for two
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 791.86 802.88 <o,f0,male> so the thing that's wonderful for me about finding dinosaurs is that it is both an intellectual thing because you're trying to reconstruct the environment of millions of years ago
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 803.23 813.70 <o,f0,male> it's something that can inform all sorts of science in unexpected ways the study of dinosaurs led to the realization that there's a problem with asteroid impact for example
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 814.08 819.40 <o,f0,male> the study of dinosaurs may literally one day save the planet study of the ancient climate
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 820.27 830.97 <o,f0,male> is very important in fact the mesozoic when dinosaurs lived had much higher co two than today was much warmer than today and is one of the interesting proof points for the effects of co two on climate
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 831.96 835.52 <o,f0,male> but besides being intellectually and scientifically interesting
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 841.50 846.43 <o,f0,male> is actually what most dinosaur research looks like this is one of my papers a pygostyle from a non avian
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 852.85 857.99 <o,f0,male> now i'm also really big on photography i travel all over the world taking pictures
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 867.20 869.14 <o,f0,male> here 's a picture i took in the falkland islands
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 882.91 889.32 <o,f0,male> the last day the sun comes out the orcas come they're right by the boat it's fantastic and i get lots of pictures like this
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 890.76 891.72 <o,f0,male> a little bit later
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 892.43 894.09 <o,f0,male> i start getting some pictures like this
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 895.09 897.54 <o,f0,male> now to a human audience i need to explain that
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 898.09 900.79 <o,f0,male> if penthouse magazine had a marine mammal edition
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 901.82 902.90 <o,f0,male> this would be the centerfold
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 907.97 910.59 <o,f0,female> more and more activity near the boat and all of a sudden somebody
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 922.55 925.60 <o,f0,female> a variety of things you can learn from watching whales have sex
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 928.04 929.23 <o,f0,female> the first thing you learn
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 930.32 932.74 <o,f0,female> is the overwhelming importance of hands
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 937.21 944.14 <o,f0,female> i think paul simon is in the audience and he has he may not realize it but he wrote a song all about whale sex
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 947.89 949.09 <o,f0,female> that's kind of what it's like
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 949.45 955.66 <o,f0,female> the other interesting thing that i learned about whale sex they curl their toes too
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 974.19 980.67 <o,f0,female> and i've never been able to do that i just you know because yes i'll focus passion on something
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 989.89 996.55 <o,f0,female> that was so engrossing and the whole industry was expanding so much that it did tend to crowd out most of the other things in my
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 1007.33 1012.28 <o,f0,female> yeah you know i this whole talk has been a mile wide and an inch deep
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 1012.82 1014.54 <o,f0,female> but that's really what works for me
NathanMyhrvold_2007 1 NathanMyhrvold_2007 1021.34 1026.00 <o,f0,female> the common or lowest common denominator is me that's it thank you
