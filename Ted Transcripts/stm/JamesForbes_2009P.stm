JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 31.60 40.72 <o,f0,female> if you come in you will see us evening time at table set for ten but not always all seats filled
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 41.51 54.40 <o,f0,female> at the point when dinner is ready to be served since mom had eight kids sometimes she said she couldn't tell who was who and where they were before we could eat she would
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 55.82 61.56 <o,f0,female> all the children in and if someone happened to be missing
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 62.85 72.14 <o,f0,female> we say fix a plate for that person put it in the oven then we could say grace and we could eat
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 73.20 78.18 <o,f0,female> also while we were at the table there was a ritual in our family
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 78.69 86.53 <o,f0,female> when something significant had happened for any one of us whether mom had just been elected as the president of the
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 87.78 98.84 <o,f0,female> or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 99.35 109.31 <o,f0,female> the ritual at the family was once the announcement is made we must take five ten minutes to do what we call make over that person
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 109.67 117.67 <o,f0,female> that is to make a fuss over the one who had been honored in some way for when one is honored
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 118.07 123.22 <o,f0,female> all are honored also we had to make a report on our
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 123.73 125.89 <o,f0,female> extended visited
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 126.85 132.24 <o,f0,female> members that is extended members of the family sick
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 132.65 140.39 <o,f0,male> elderly shut in my task was at least once a week to visit mother lassiter who lived on east street
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 140.67 147.76 <o,f0,male> mother williamson who lived on bledsoe avenue mother lathers who lived on oberlin road why because they
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 148.66 160.21 <o,f0,female> and infirm and we needed to go by to see if they needed anything for mom said to be family is to care and share and to look
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 160.65 164.24 <o,f0,female> for one another they are our family and
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 178.95 186.05 <o,f0,female> to give me this was the nature of being at that table in fact she indicated that
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 186.89 198.20 <o,f0,female> if we would do that not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude from the members of the extended family but she said even
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 198.53 212.54 <o,f0,female> god will smile and when god smiles there is peace and justice and joy so at the table at nine hundred and fifteen i learned something about compassion
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 212.81 221.67 <o,f0,female> of course it was a minister 's family so we had to add god into it and so i came to think that mama
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 222.13 228.54 <o,f0,female> eternal mama eternal is always wondering are all
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 228.63 236.27 <o,f0,female> the children in and if we had been faithful in caring and sharing we had
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 236.34 247.44 <o,f0,male> the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world now it was not always wonderful at that table let me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 247.76 258.22 <o,f0,male> it was christmas and at our family oh what a morning christmas morning where we open up our gifts where we have special prayers and where we get to the old
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 258.52 268.71 <o,f0,male> upright piano and we would sing carols it was a very intimate moment in fact you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing and then get
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 284.59 294.21 <o,f0,female> and daddy brought elder revels to the christmas family celebration we thought he must be out of his mind this is
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 294.80 303.52 <o,f0,female> time this is intimate time this is when we can just be who we are and now we have this stuffy brother with his shirt and tie on
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 303.75 312.72 <o,f0,female> while we are still in our pjs why would daddy bring elder revels any other time but
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 313.02 323.24 <o,f0,male> not to the christmas celebration and mom overheard us as said well you know what if you really understand the nature of this celebration
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 323.89 334.86 <o,f0,female> it is that this is a time where you extend the circle of love that's what the celebration is all about it's time to make space
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 335.43 342.89 <o,f0,female> to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community so we sucked up
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 348.98 351.58 <o,f0,female> was not a word to be debated
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 352.55 355.46 <o,f0,female> it was a sensibility to how
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 356.08 359.87 <o,f0,female> we are together we are
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 360.32 372.77 <o,f0,female> sisters and brothers united together and like chief seattle said we did not spin the web of life we're all strands in it and whatever we do to the web
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 373.08 387.21 <o,f0,female> we do to ourselves now that's compassion so let me tell you i kind of look at the world this way i see pictures and something says now that's compassion a harvested field of grain
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 388.25 391.93 <o,f0,female> with some grain
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 392.57 401.12 <o,f0,female> the corners reminding me of the hebrew tradition that you may indeed harvest but you must always leave some
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 401.51 410.14 <o,f0,female> on the edges just in case there's someone who has not had the share necessary for good nurture
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 410.43 421.55 <o,f0,male> talk about a picture of compassion i see always it stirs my heart a picture of doctor martin luther king jr walking
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 424.65 429.85 <o,f0,female> young and rabbi heschel and maybe thich nhat hanh and some of
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 430.20 441.67 <o,f0,male> other saints assembled walking across the bridge and going into selma just a photograph arm in arm for struggle suffering
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 443.21 455.28 <o,f0,male> in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters without the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity robbing us of a sense of unity
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 457.39 463.42 <o,f0,male> another picture here this one i really do like this picture when doctor martin luther king
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 463.87 471.60 <o,f0,female> was assassinated that day everybody in my community
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 471.86 475.16 <o,f0,female> was upset you heard about riots
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 475.63 483.28 <o,f0,male> all across the land bobby kennedy was scheduled to bring an inner city message
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 484.42 485.82 <o,f0,female> in indianapolis
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 487.15 499.12 <o,f0,female> this is the picture they said it 's going to be too volatile for you to go he insisted i must go so sitting on a flatbed truck
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 500.29 507.37 <o,f0,female> elders of the community and bobby stands up and says to the people i have bad news for you
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 515.73 525.80 <o,f0,male> almost wish to have the opportunity to enter now into activities of revenge but he said what i really want you to know is that i know how you feel
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 527.47 536.58 <o,f0,female> because i had someone dear to me snatched away i know how you feel
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 537.17 547.88 <o,f0,female> and he said i hope that you will have the strength to do what i did i allowed my anger my bitterness my grief to simmer
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 549.26 559.74 <o,f0,female> and then i made up my mind that i was going to make a different world and we can do that together that's a picture compassion i think i see it
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 559.89 572.39 <o,f0,female> i saw it when the dalai lama came to the riverside church while i was a pastor and he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 573.45 585.77 <o,f0,female> he asked them to give a message and they each read in their own language a central affirmation and that was some
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 586.14 596.44 <o,f0,female> version of the golden rule as you would that others would do unto you do also unto them
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 597.33 606.03 <o,f0,female> twelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire affirming one message
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 606.45 616.14 <o,f0,female> we are so connected that we must treat each other as if an action toward you is an action toward myself
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 616.66 624.85 <o,f0,female> one more picture while i'm stinking and thinking about the riverside church nine eleven last night
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 625.70 633.56 <o,f0,female> at chagrin fall a newspaper man and a television guy said that evening
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 633.88 641.72 <o,f0,female> when a service was held at the riverside church we carried it on our station in this city
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 642.13 651.93 <o,f0,male> it was he said one of the most powerful moments of life together we were all suffering
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 652.07 665.11 <o,f0,female> but you invited representatives of all of the traditions to come and you invited them find out what it is in your tradition that tells us what to do
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 665.47 674.50 <o,f0,female> when we have been humiliated when we have been despised and rejected and they all spoke out of their own tradition
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 674.88 680.88 <o,f0,female> a word about the healing power of solidarity one with the other
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 691.09 693.46 <o,f0,female> as a preacher i got a job i got to preach
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 693.53 703.08 <o,f0,male> the stuff but i got to do it too or as father divine in harlem used to say to folks some people preach the gospel
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 703.35 710.02 <o,f0,male> i have to tangibilitate the gospel so the real issue is how do you tangibilitate
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 710.73 721.21 <o,f0,male> compassion how do you make it real my faith has constantly lifted up the ideal and challenged me when i
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 721.89 728.23 <o,f0,female> beneath it in my tradition there is a gift that we have made to other traditions
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 730.02 742.90 <o,f0,female> around the world who knows the story of the good samaritan many people think of it primarily in terms of charity
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 744.13 751.42 <o,f0,female> random acts of kindness but for those who really study that text a little more
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 751.89 759.26 <o,f0,female> thoroughly you will discover that a question has been raised that leads to this parable the question was
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 759.73 772.88 <o,f0,female> what is the greatest commandment and according to jesus the word comes forth you must love yourself you must love the lord your god with all your heart mind and soul and your neighbor as yourself
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 774.56 781.92 <o,f0,female> and then the person asked well what do you mean neighbor and he answered
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 783.09 791.82 <o,f0,female> by telling the story of the man who fell among thieves and how religious authorities went the other way
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 792.23 800.41 <o,f0,female> and how their supporters in the congregation went the other way but an unsuspecting despised person
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 800.89 811.33 <o,f0,female> came along saw the man in need provided oil and wine for his wounds put him on his own
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 822.46 835.64 <o,f0,female> he said here this is the initial investment but if needs continue make sure that you provide them and whatever else is needed
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 835.82 840.19 <o,f0,female> i will provide it and pay for it when i return
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 840.67 854.24 <o,f0,female> this always seemed to me to be a deepening of the sense of what it means to be a good samaritan a good samaritan is not simply one whose heart is touched in an immediate act of care and charity
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 854.53 859.72 <o,f0,female> but one who provides a system of sustained care i like that a system
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 861.46 869.24 <o,f0,female> in the inn take care i think maybe it's one time when the bible talks about a healthcare system and a commitment to do
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 869.99 879.53 <o,f0,male> is necessary that all god 's children would have their needs cared for so that we could answer when mommy eternal asks in regards to
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 881.79 889.81 <o,f0,female> and we could say yes oh what a joy it has been to be a person seeking to tangibilitate
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 891.09 897.90 <o,f0,female> compassion i recall that my work as a pastor has always involved
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 898.54 906.64 <o,f0,female> caring for their spiritual needs being concerned for housing for healthcare for the prisoners for the
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 907.42 916.27 <o,f0,female> for children even the foster care children for whom no one maybe can even keep a record where they started off where they are going
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 916.59 928.04 <o,f0,female> to be a pastor is to care for these individual needs but now to be a good samaritan and i always say and to be a good american for me
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 928.47 941.61 <o,f0,female> is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care compassion takes on a corporate dynamic i believe that whatever we did
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 942.30 950.27 <o,f0,female> that table at bloodworth street must be done around tables and rituals of faith
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 951.00 963.23 <o,f0,female> until we become that family that family together that understands the nature of our unity we are one people together
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 963.70 972.87 <o,f0,female> so let me explain to you what i mean when i think about compassion and why i think it is so important
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 973.15 982.53 <o,f0,female> that right at this point in history we would decide to establish this charter of compassion the reason it's important
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 983.13 989.84 <o,f0,female> is because this is a very special time in history
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 990.60 1000.83 <o,f0,female> it is the time which biblically we would speak of it as the day or the year of god 's favor this is a season of grace
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 1002.42 1006.93 <o,f0,male> things are beginning to happen please pardon me as a black man for celebrating that
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 1007.23 1014.91 <o,f0,female> the election of obama was an unusual sign of the fact that it is a year of favor
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 1018.22 1020.10 <o,f0,female> there is so much more that
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 1020.34 1028.68 <o,f0,female> needs to be done we need to bring health and food and education and respect
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 1028.99 1031.85 <o,f0,male> for all god 's citizens all
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 1032.80 1044.30 <o,f0,female> children remembering mama eternal now let me close my comments by telling you that whenever i feel something very deeply
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 1045.11 1052.51 <o,f0,female> it usually takes the form of verse and so i want to close with a little song
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 1052.95 1063.35 <o,f0,female> i close with this song it's a children 's song because we are all children at the table of mama eternal and if mama
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 1064.23 1078.39 <o,f0,male> has taught us correctly this song will make sense not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering but to all who sign the charter for compassion and this is why we do it the song says a i
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 1078.58 1086.61 <o,f0,female> made heaven so happy today a a receiving god 's love and giving it away a a when i looked
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 1088.57 1091.98 <o,f0,female> me a a now i'm so happy can't
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 1094.07 1094.89 <o,f0,female> look at me
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 1096.34 1103.42 <o,f0,female> can't you see a a sharing makes me happy makes heaven happy too a a i'm happy look at me
JamesForbes_2009P 1 JamesForbes_2009P 1104.79 1110.83 <o,f0,female> can't you see a a let me share happy loving smile with you a that's compassion
