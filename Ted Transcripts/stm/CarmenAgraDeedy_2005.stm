CarmenAgraDeedy_2005 1 CarmenAgraDeedy_2005 157.52 161.04 <o,f0,female> from the mists of avalon back in time but further still
CarmenAgraDeedy_2005 1 CarmenAgraDeedy_2005 164.51 166.99 <o,f0,female> we were doing the pictographs on walls in
CarmenAgraDeedy_2005 1 CarmenAgraDeedy_2005 167.90 169.38 <o,f0,female> moist damp caves

CarmenAgraDeedy_2005 1 CarmenAgraDeedy_2005 225.28 229.87 <o,f0,female> my cuban mother which i just briefly introduced you to in that short character sketch
CarmenAgraDeedy_2005 1 CarmenAgraDeedy_2005 246.13 253.85 <o,f0,female> a small southern town and in that little southern town i grew up and grew up hearing these stories but this story only happened a few years ago
CarmenAgraDeedy_2005 1 CarmenAgraDeedy_2005 254.51 267.33 <o,f0,female> i called my mom it was a saturday morning and i was calling about how to make ajiaco it's a cuban meal it's delicious it's savory it makes spit froth in the little corners of your mouth it makes your armpits juicy you know
CarmenAgraDeedy_2005 1 CarmenAgraDeedy_2005 268.70 272.09 <o,f0,female> food yeah this is the sensory part of the program people

CarmenAgraDeedy_2005 1 CarmenAgraDeedy_2005 284.09 288.72 <o,f0,female> esther my mother had stopped driving several years ago to the collective relief of the entire city of atlanta
CarmenAgraDeedy_2005 1 CarmenAgraDeedy_2005 289.19 298.33 <o,f0,female> any vehicular outing with that woman from the time i was a young child guys naturally included flashing blue lights but she'd become adept at dodging
CarmenAgraDeedy_2005 1 CarmenAgraDeedy_2005 298.71 303.15 <o,f0,female> the boys in blue and when she did meet them oh she had wonderful

CarmenAgraDeedy_2005 1 CarmenAgraDeedy_2005 355.14 361.04 <o,f0,female> this is the woman that wants me to come on a saturday morning when i have a lot to do but it doesn't take long because cuban guilt is a weighty thing
