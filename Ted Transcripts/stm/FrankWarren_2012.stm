FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 16.51 19.47 <o,f0,male> name is frank and i collect secrets
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 19.67 35.36 <o,f0,male> it all started with a crazy idea in november of two thousand and four i printed up three thousand self addressed postcards just like this they were blank on one side and on the other side i listed some simple instructions
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 35.43 41.43 <o,f0,male> i asked people to anonymously share an artful secret they 'd never told anyone before
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 51.5 66.44 <o,f0,male> people began to buy their own postcards and make their own postcards i started receiving secrets in my home mailbox not just with postmarks from washington d c but from texas california vancouver new zealand iraq
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 66.44 70.32 <o,f0,male> soon my crazy idea didn 't seem so crazy
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 81.35 98.59 <o,f0,male> you can see my wife struggling to stack a brick of postcards on a pyramid of over a half million secrets what i 'd like to do now is share with you a very special handful of secrets from that collection starting with this one
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 100.11 109.85 <o,f0,male> i found these stamps as a child and i have been waiting all my life to have someone to send them to i never did have someone
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 111.22 123.09 <o,f0,male> secrets can take many forms they can be shocking or silly or soulful they can connect us to our deepest humanity or with people we 'll never meet
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 148.38 151.56 <o,f0,male> a stamp and my home address written on the other side
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 152.73 158.31 <o,f0,male> dear birthmother i have great parents i 've found love
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 176.19 181 <o,f0,male> everyone who knew me before nine eleven believes i 'm dead
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 188.02 196.71 <o,f0,male> i used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people so sometimes i didn 't wear panties and just had a big smile and chuckled to myself
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 212.9 229.03 <o,f0,male> and sometimes afterwards i 'll stick around and sign books and take photos with students and this next postcard was made out of one of those photos and i should also mention that just like today at that postsecret event i was using a wireless microphone
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 244.92 249.41 <o,f0,male> this was really embarrassing when it happened until i realized
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 249.41 254.32 <o,f0,male> it could have been worse
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 287.6 292.49 <o,f0,male> that saturday when you wondered where i was well i was getting your ring
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 292.49 294.41 <o,f0,male> it 's in my pocket right now
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 294.96 303.72 <o,f0,male> i had this postcard posted on the postsecret blog two years ago on valentine 's day it was the very bottom the last secret in the long column
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 317.71 330.07 <o,f0,male> he said for three years my girlfriend and i we 've made it this sunday morning ritual to visit the postsecret blog together and read the secrets out loud i read some to her she reads some to me
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 330.12 333.77 <o,f0,male> he says it 's really brought us closer together through the years
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 334.23 348.73 <o,f0,male> and so when i discovered that you had posted my surprise proposal to my girlfriend at the very bottom i was beside myself and i tried to act calm not to give anything away and just like every sunday we started reading the secrets out loud to each other
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 349.73 353.94 <o,f0,male> he said but this time it seemed like it was taking her forever to get through
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 355.73 358.4 <o,f0,male> but she finally did she got to that bottom
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 362.65 368.51 <o,f0,male> and then she read it again and she turned to him and said is that our cat
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 376.12 385.79 <o,f0,male> and when she saw him he was down on one knee he had the ring out he popped the question she said yes it was a very happy ending so i emailed him back and i said
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 385.79 395.2 <o,f0,male> please share with me an image something that i can share with the whole postsecret community and let everyone know your fairy tale ending and he emailed me this picture
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 400.96 406.86 <o,f0,male> i found your camera at lollapalooza this summer i finally got the pictures developed
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 407.36 414.92 <o,f0,male> and i 'd love to give them to you this picture never got returned back to the people who lost it
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 415.47 421.91 <o,f0,male> but this secret has impacted many lives starting with a student up in canada named matty
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 429.9 443.93 <o,f0,male> matty invites people to mail him digital cameras that they 've found memory sticks that have been lost with orphan photos and matty takes the pictures off these cameras and posts them on his website every week
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 443.93 454.64 <o,f0,male> and people come to visit to see if they can identify a picture they 've lost or help somebody else get the photos back to them that they might be desperately searching for
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 461.39 480.36 <o,f0,male> matty has found this ingenious way to leverage the kindness of strangers and it might seem like a simple idea and it is but the impact it can have on people 's lives can be huge matty shared with me an emotional email he received from the mother in that picture
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 481.92 485.28 <o,f0,male> that 's me my husband and son
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 485.28 490.63 <o,f0,male> the other pictures are of my very ill grandmother thank you for making your site
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 491 498.61 <o,f0,male> these pictures mean more to me than you know my son 's birth is on this camera he turns four tomorrow
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 499.91 512.17 <o,f0,male> every picture that you see there and thousands of others have been returned back to the person who lost it sometimes crossing oceans sometimes going through language barriers
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 512.21 515.77 <o,f0,male> this is the last postcard i have to share with you today
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 516.34 523.95 <o,f0,male> when people i love leave voicemails on my phone i always save them in case they die tomorrow
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 523.98 528.61 <o,f0,male> and i have no other way of hearing their voice ever again
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 529.5 543.42 <o,f0,male> when i posted this secret dozens of people sent voicemail messages from their phones sometimes ones they 'd been keeping for years messages from family or friends who had died
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 544.37 552.52 <o,f0,male> they said that by preserving those voices and sharing them it helped them keep the spirit of their loved ones alive
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 553.99 559.27 <o,f0,male> one young girl posted the last message she ever heard from her grandmother
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 561.89 575.37 <o,f0,male> secrets can take many forms they can be shocking or silly or soulful they can connect us with our deepest humanity or with people we 'll never meet again
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 635.7 638.13 <o,f0,female> have you ever sent in a secret to postsecret
FrankWarren_2012 1 FrankWarren_2012 638.13 658.13 <o,f0,male> i have one of my own secrets in every book i think in some ways the reason i started the project even though i didn 't know it at the time was because i was struggling with my own secrets and it was through crowd sourcing it was through the kindness that strangers were showing me that i could uncover parts of my past that were haunting me
