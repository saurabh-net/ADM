AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 28.03 36.39 <o,f0,male> to talk about feasibility as well of course i'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about aging and then i'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 36.56 46.04 <o,f0,male> you know how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong namely by actually doing something about it i'm going to do that in two steps the first one i'm going to talk about is
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 46.61 60.40 <o,f0,male> how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension which i'm going to define as thirty years applied to people who are already in middle age when you start to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging namely essentially an elimination of the
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 75.89 86.33 <o,f0,male> i want to ask a question hands up anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria that was easy ok ok hands up anyone in the audience who 's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 86.89 99.21 <o,f0,male> ok so we all think malaria is a bad thing that's very good news because i thought that was what the answer would be now the thing is i would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 99.59 107.64 <o,f0,male> aging and here is that characteristic the only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 108.50 114.59 <o,f0,male> i like in an audience in britain especially to talk about the comparison with fox hunting which is something that was banned after a long struggle
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 115.31 122.89 <o,f0,male> by the government not very many months ago i mean i know i'm with a sympathetic audience here but as we know a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 123.18 134.59 <o,f0,male> and this is actually a rather good comparison it seems to me you know a lot of people said well you know city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time it's a traditional part of the way of life and we should be
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 135.82 144.92 <o,f0,male> to carry on doing it it's ecologically sound it stops the population explosion of foxes but ultimately the government prevailed in the end because the majority of the british public and certainly the majority of members of parliament
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 145.30 155.84 <o,f0,male> to the conclusion that it was really something that should not be tolerated in a civilized society and i think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades what part of this do people not understand it's not just about life
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 157.76 163.54 <o,f0,male> it's about healthy life you know getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 173.71 183.00 <o,f0,male> and i mean ok i'm not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless there are some good points to be made here things that we ought to be thinking about forward planning so that
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 183.26 193.07 <o,f0,male> nothing goes too well so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging but these are completely crazy when you actually remember your sense of proportion
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 193.41 203.54 <o,f0,male> you know these are arguments these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about but the question is are they so dangerous these risks of doing something about aging
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 203.88 217.24 <o,f0,male> that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite namely leaving aging as it is are these so bad that they outweigh condemning one hundred thousand people a day to an unnecessarily early death
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 241.99 252.65 <o,f0,male> and you know a lot of people try to fudge this question and give answers like this i don't agree with those answers i think they basically don't work i think it's true that we will face a dilemma in this respect we will have
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 253.88 255.22 <o,f0,male> decide whether to have
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 255.60 269.49 <o,f0,male> a low birth rate or a high death rate a high death rate will of course arise from simply rejecting these therapies in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids and i say that that's fine the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 269.93 278.56 <o,f0,male> what's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future if we vacillate hesitate and do not actually develop these therapies
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 278.97 285.65 <o,f0,male> then we are condemning a whole cohort of people who would have been young enough and healthy enough to benefit from those therapies
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 285.99 295.87 <o,f0,male> but will not be because we haven't developed them as quickly as we could we'll be denying those people an indefinite life span and i consider that that is immoral that's my answer to the overpopulation question
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 296.33 304.59 <o,f0,male> right so the next thing is now why should we get a little bit more active on this and the fundamental answer is that the pro aging trance is not as dumb as it looks
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 304.94 316.25 <o,f0,male> it's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging aging is ghastly but it's inevitable so you know we've got to find some way to put it out of our minds and it's rational to
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 316.83 324.72 <o,f0,male> do anything that we might want to do to do that like for example making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all but of course
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 333.61 341.05 <o,f0,male> this becomes part of the problem this pro aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things and that's why we have to really
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 362.88 368.37 <o,f0,male> aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place which is to say metabolism this is not
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 369.12 378.03 <o,f0,male> a completely tautological statement it's a reasonable statement aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars and it also happens to us despite the fact that we have a lot of
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 378.45 388.19 <o,f0,male> clever self repair mechanisms because those self repair mechanisms are not perfect so basically metabolism which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 388.61 396.25 <o,f0,male> has side effects those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology that's a fine definition so we can put it this way we can say that you know we have this chain of events
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 404.58 412.69 <o,f0,male> the geriatrician will intervene late in the day when pathology is becoming evident and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time and stop the
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 431.40 443.29 <o,f0,male> but unfortunately the thing is that we don't understand metabolism very well in fact we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work even cells we're not really too good on yet we've discovered things like for example rna interference
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 443.54 454.92 <o,f0,male> only a few years ago and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work basically gerontology is a fine approach in the end but it is not an approach whose time has come when we're talking about intervention so then
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 468.30 473.92 <o,f0,male> just suppose as i said that we do acquire let 's say we do it today for sake of argument
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 474.15 483.27 <o,f0,male> the ability to confer thirty extra years of healthy life on people who are already in middle age let 's say fifty five i'm going to call that robust human rejuvenation ok
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 483.60 493.01 <o,f0,male> what would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today or equivalently of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive would actually live
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 494.14 502.31 <o,f0,male> that question you might think it's simple but it's not simple we can't just say well if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies then they'll live thirty years longer that's the wrong
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 511.28 518.14 <o,f0,male> and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs now they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 529.85 543.16 <o,f0,male> but after that things were pretty steady and pretty uniform i think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight we can think really that each one is
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 544.83 553.22 <o,f0,male> beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one if you like the incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 553.61 562.03 <o,f0,male> this is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough and you see it in all sorts of technologies computers you can look at a more or less parallel time line happening of course a bit later
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 562.25 572.16 <o,f0,male> you can look at medical care i mean hygiene vaccines antibiotics you know the same sort of time frame so i think that actually step two that i called a step a moment ago isn't a step
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 573.24 583.22 <o,f0,male> that in fact the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension even though those people are already middle aged when the therapies arrive
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 583.86 591.95 <o,f0,male> will be at some sort of cusp they will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments that will give them a further thirty or maybe fifty years
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 592.22 601.55 <o,f0,male> in other words they will be staying ahead of the game the therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 601.89 615.51 <o,f0,male> this is a very important point for me to get across because you know most people when they hear that i predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to one thousand or more they think that i'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 627.01 638.53 <o,f0,male> but we'll be able to fix the things that two hundred year olds die of before we have any two hundred year olds and the same for three and four hundred and so on i decided to give this a little name which is longevity escape velocity
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 643.42 652.14 <o,f0,male> across so these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live in terms of remaining life expectancy as measured by their health
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 653.23 665.08 <o,f0,male> given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive if you're already one hundred or even if you're eighty and an average eighty year old we probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies because you're too close to death 's door for the really initial
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 675.36 683.97 <o,f0,male> eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense in terms of your youthfulness both physical and mental and in terms of your risk of death from
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 685.19 693.56 <o,f0,male> of course if you're a bit younger than that then you're never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age related causes so this is a genuine
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 702.89 708.63 <o,f0,male> but irrespective of that age i'm claiming that the first person to live to one thousand
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 718.30 725.30 <o,f0,male> all right so finally i'm going to spend the rest of the talk my last seven and a half minutes on step one namely how do we actually get to
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 726.27 734.96 <o,f0,male> this moderate amount of life extension that will allow us to get to escape velocity and in order to do that i need to talk about mice a little bit
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 735.49 748.11 <o,f0,male> i have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation i'm calling it robust mouse rejuvenation not very imaginatively and this is what it is i say we're going to take a long lived strain of mouse which basically means mice that live about three years on average
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 748.46 757.44 <o,f0,male> we do exactly nothing to them until they're already two years old and then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them and with those therapies we get them to live on average to their fifth birthday
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 786.93 797.73 <o,f0,male> and it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question and it's extremely hard to answer one has to be very speculative and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation that we should simply
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 811.97 825.76 <o,f0,male> assess their priorities so i say that we have a fifty fifty chance of reaching this rhr milestone robust human rejuvenation within fifteen years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation fifteen years from the robust mouse
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 826.16 834.39 <o,f0,male> the public 's perception will probably be somewhat better than that the public tend to underestimate how difficult scientific things are so they'll probably think it's five years away they'll be wrong but that actually won 't matter too much
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 835.28 843.93 <o,f0,male> and finally of course i think it's fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now is the global trance i spoke about earlier the coping strategy
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 844.28 857.43 <o,f0,male> that will be history at this point because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans since it's been postponed so very effectively in mice so we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people 's attitudes and of course that has enormous implications
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 858.65 871.72 <o,f0,male> so in order to tell you now how we're going to get these mice i'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging i'm going to use this word damage to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism and that eventually cause pathology
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 881.02 892.26 <o,f0,male> but it is not part of metabolism itself and this turns out to be useful because we can re draw our original diagram this way we can say that fundamentally the difference between gerontology and geriatrics is that gerontology tries to inhibit the
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 892.82 898.95 <o,f0,male> which metabolism lays down this damage and i'm going to explain exactly what damage is in concrete biological terms in a moment
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 899.42 907.77 <o,f0,male> and geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology and the reason it's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 908.40 914.43 <o,f0,male> so there's a third approach if we look at it this way we can call it the engineering approach and i claim that the engineering approach is
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 939.23 947.57 <o,f0,male> so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold that must exist that causes it to be pathogenic we know that this threshold exists because
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 947.71 960.62 <o,f0,male> we don't get age related diseases until we're in middle age even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born why do i say that we're in range well this is basically it the point about this slide is actually the bottom
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 961.05 970.98 <o,f0,male> if we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging we will be here all night because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another this list is just for illustration it is incomplete
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 971.42 982.62 <o,f0,male> the list on the right is also incomplete it's a list of types of pathology that are age related and it's just an incomplete list but i would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete this is the list of
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 983.35 991.49 <o,f0,male> thing that qualify as damage side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end or that might cause pathology and there are only seven of them
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 993.52 1005.54 <o,f0,male> thing of course but there's only seven of them cell loss mutations in chromosomes mutations in the mitochondria and so on first of all i'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1006.20 1015.96 <o,f0,male> of course one can make a biological argument one can say ok what are we made of we're made of cells and stuff between cells what can damage accumulate in the answer is long lived molecules
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1016.21 1029.09 <o,f0,male> because if a short lived molecule undergoes damage but then the molecule is destroyed like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis then the damage is gone too it's got to be long lived molecules so these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1029.44 1040.05 <o,f0,male> and that is pretty good news because it means that you know we've come a long way in biology in these twenty years so the fact that we haven't extended this list is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1052.67 1060.35 <o,f0,male> i haven't got time to go through them at all but my conclusion is that if we can actually get suitable funding for this then
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1060.44 1070.96 <o,f0,male> we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only ten years but we do need to get serious about it we do need to really start trying so of course there are some biologists in the audience and
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1072.69 1079.74 <o,f0,male> to some of the questions that you may have you may have been dissatisfied with this talk but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff i've published a great deal on this i
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1080.81 1094.39 <o,f0,male> the experimental work on which my optimism is based and there's quite a lot of detail there the detail is what makes me confident of my rather aggressive time frames that i'm predicting here so if you think that i'm wrong you'd better damn well go and find out why you think i'm wrong
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1095.68 1105.24 <o,f0,male> and of course the main thing is that you shouldn 't trust people who call themselves gerontologists because as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field you know
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1105.56 1113.97 <o,f0,male> you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously so you know you've got to actually do your homework in order to understand whether this is true
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1114.74 1121.94 <o,f0,male> with a few things one thing is you know you'll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1122.99 1135.19 <o,f0,male> and everyone said well it's obviously impossible and you know what happened so you know this does happen we have various strategies there's the methuselah mouse prize which is basically an incentive to innovate and to do
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1137.01 1149.64 <o,f0,male> what you think is going to work and you get money for it if you win there's a proposal to actually put together an institute this is what's going to take a bit of money but i mean look how long does it take to spend that on the war in iraq not very long ok
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1150.10 1159.84 <o,f0,male> it's got to be philanthropic because profits distract biotech but it's basically got a ninety percent chance i think of succeeding in this and i think we
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1183.74 1186.51 <o,f0,male> because i am an old man i am actually one hundred and fifty eight
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1191.68 1199.22 <o,f0,male> on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1226.80 1233.05 <o,f0,male> which is that no aging is not a product of selection evolution is simply a product of evolutionary neglect in other words
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1233.31 1243.04 <o,f0,male> we have aging because it's hard work not to have aging you need more genetic pathway more sophistication in your genes in order to age more slowly and that carries on being true
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1243.81 1254.05 <o,f0,male> you push it out so to the extent that evolution doesn't matter doesn't care whether genes are passed on by individuals living a long time or by procreation
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1255.31 1264.45 <o,f0,male> amount of modulation of that which is why different species have different lifespans but that's why there are no immortal species ca the genes don't care but we do ag that's right
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1267.31 1268.10 <o,f0,male> hello
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1268.94 1275.82 <o,f0,male> i read somewhere that in the last twenty years the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by ten years
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1276.65 1278.44 <o,f0,male> if i project that
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1279.14 1282.23 <o,f0,male> would make me think that i would live until one hundred and twenty if i don't crash
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1284.86 1285.88 <o,f0,male> that means that
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1286.26 1289.88 <o,f0,male> one of your subjects to become a one thousand year old
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1290.10 1290.34 <o,f0,male> if you
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1310.35 1317.93 <o,f0,male> i was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults are actually in the human embryo and that the brain cells last eighty years or so
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1318.81 1327.25 <o,f0,male> if that is indeed true biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation if there are cells in my body that live all eighty years as opposed to a typical you know couple of months
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1327.63 1337.82 <o,f0,male> there are technical implications certainly basically what we need to do is replace cells in those few areas of the brain that lose cells at a respectable rate especially neurons
AubreydeGrey_2005G 1 AubreydeGrey_2005G 1352.42 1360.47 <o,f0,male> no aging hydra for example but they do it by not having a nervous system and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function on very long lived cells
