ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 12.79 32.02 <o,f0,male> going to talk about the strategizing brain we 're going to use an unusual combination of tools from game theory and neuroscience to understand how people interact socially when value is on the line so game theory is a branch of originally applied mathematics used mostly in economics and political science a little bit in biology that gives us a mathematical taxonomy of social life
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 32.02 45.13 <o,f0,male> and it predicts what people are likely to do and believe others will do in cases where everyone 's actions affect everyone else that 's a lot of things competition cooperation bargaining games like hide and seek and poker
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 45.68 52.62 <o,f0,male> here 's a simple game to get us started everyone chooses a number from zero to one hundred we 're going to compute the average of those numbers
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 56.65 65.24 <o,f0,male> so you want to be a little bit below the average number but not too far below and everyone else wants to be a little bit below the average number as well think about what you might pick
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 65.7 81.26 <o,f0,male> as you 're thinking this is a toy model of something like selling in the stock market during a rising market right you don 't want to sell too early because you miss out on profits but you don 't want to wait too late to when everyone else sells triggering a crash you want to be a little bit ahead of the competition but not too far ahead
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 81.92 86.3 <o,f0,male> okay here 's two theories about how people might think about this and then we 'll see some data
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 86.34 91.94 <o,f0,male> some of these will sound familiar because you probably are thinking that way i 'm using my brain theory to see
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 92.13 94.12 <o,f0,male> a lot of people say
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 94.33 102.75 <o,f0,male> i really don 't know what people are going to pick so i think the average will be fifty they 're not being really strategic at all and i 'll pick two thirds of fifty that 's thirty three that 's a start
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 102.75 115.18 <o,f0,male> other people who are a little more sophisticated using more working memory say i think people will pick thirty three because they 're going to pick a response to fifty and so i 'll pick twenty two which is two thirds of thirty three they 're doing one extra step of thinking two steps
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 115.65 127.62 <o,f0,male> that 's better and of course in principle you could do three four or more but it starts to get very difficult just like in language and other domains we know that it 's hard for people to parse very complex sentences with a kind of recursive structure
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 127.63 142.63 <o,f0,male> this is called a cognitive hierarchy theory by the way it 's something that i 've worked on and a few other people and it indicates a kind of hierarchy along with some assumptions about how many people stop at different steps and how the steps of thinking are affected by lots of interesting variables and variant people as we 'll see in a minute
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 147.52 166.67 <o,f0,male> of a beautiful mind fame is what 's called equilibrium analysis so if you 've ever taken a game theory course at any level you will have learned a little bit about this an equilibrium is a mathematical state in which everybody has figured out exactly what everyone else will do it is a very useful concept but behaviorally it may not exactly explain what people do the first time they play these types of
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 166.67 175.12 <o,f0,male> economic games or in situations in the outside world in this case the equilibrium makes a very bold prediction which is everyone wants to be below everyone else
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 175.21 177.14 <o,f0,male> therefore they 'll play zero
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 192.6 202.4 <o,f0,male> and whoever is close to two thirds of the average will win a big prize and as you can see there 's so much data here you can see the spikes very visibly there 's a spike at thirty three those are people doing one step
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 216.95 218.73 <o,f0,male> because they 're picking zero or one
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 233.64 251.92 <o,f0,male> one study by coricelli and nagel gives a really sharp interesting answer so they had people play this game while they were being scanned in an fmri and two conditions in some trials they 're told you 're playing another person who 's playing right now and we 're going to match up your behavior at the end and pay you if you win in the other trials they 're told you 're playing a computer they 're just choosing randomly
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 251.99 259.7 <o,f0,male> so what you see here is a subtraction of areas in which there 's more brain activity when you 're playing people compared to playing the computer
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 275.94 282.43 <o,f0,male> and these are all areas which are fairly reliably known to be part of what 's called a theory of mind circuit or mentalizing circuit
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 282.43 290.44 <o,f0,male> that is it 's a circuit that 's used to imagine what other people might do so these were some of the first studies to see this tied in to game theory
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 290.44 303.27 <o,f0,male> what happens with these one and two step types so we classify people by what they picked and then we look at the difference between playing humans versus playing computers which brain areas are differentially active on the top you see the one step players there 's almost no difference
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 303.36 310.02 <o,f0,male> the reason is they 're treating other people like a computer and the brain is too the bottom players you see all the activity in dorsomedial pfc
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 310.44 327.06 <o,f0,male> so we know that those two step players are doing something differently now if you were to step back and say what can we do with this information you might be able to look at brain activity and say this person 's going to be a good poker player or this person 's socially naive and we might also be able to study things like development of adolescent brains once we have an idea of where this circuitry exists
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 327.06 334.07 <o,f0,male> okay get ready i 'm saving you some brain activity because you don 't need to use your hair detector cells
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 334.37 345.17 <o,f0,male> you should use those cells to think carefully about this game this is a bargaining game two players who are being scanned using eeg electrodes are going to bargain over one to six dollars
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 345.17 355.3 <o,f0,male> if they can do it in ten seconds they 're going to actually earn that money if ten seconds goes by and they haven 't made a deal they get nothing that 's kind of a mistake together the twist is that one player on the left
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 355.3 363.71 <o,f0,male> is informed about how much on each trial there is they play lots of trials with different amounts each time in this case they know there 's four dollars the uninformed player
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 363.84 377.8 <o,f0,male> doesn 't know but they know that the informed player knows so the uninformed player 's challenge is to say is this guy really being fair or are they giving me a very low offer in order to get me to think that there 's only one or two dollars available to split in which case they might reject it and not come to a deal
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 378.08 390.22 <o,f0,male> so there 's some tension here between trying to get the most money but trying to goad the other player into giving you more and the way they bargain is to point on a number line that goes from zero to six dollars and they 're bargaining over how much the uninformed player gets
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 390.4 399.57 <o,f0,male> and the informed player 's going to get the rest so this is like a management labor negotiation in which the workers don 't know how much profits the privately held company has
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 399.82 406.72 <o,f0,male> right and they want to maybe hold out for more money but the company might want to create the impression that there 's very little to split i 'm giving you the most that i can
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 407.26 419.97 <o,f0,male> first some behavior so a bunch of the subject pairs they play face to face we have some other data where they play across computers that 's an interesting difference as you might imagine but a bunch of the face to face pairs agree to divide the money evenly every single time
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 420.27 431.64 <o,f0,male> boring it 's just not interesting neurally it 's good for them they make a lot of money but we 're interested in can we say something about when disagreements occur versus don 't occur
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 431.64 441.71 <o,f0,male> so this is the other group of subjects who often disagree so they have a chance of they bicker and disagree and end up with less money they might be eligible to be on real housewives the tv show
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 446.4 464.84 <o,f0,male> they disagree about half the time and when the amount is four five six they agree quite often this turns out to be something that 's predicted by a very complicated type of game theory you should come to graduate school at caltech and learn about it 's a little too complicated to explain right now but the theory tells you that this shape kind of should occur your intuition might tell you that too
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 464.84 472.48 <o,f0,male> now i 'm going to show you the results from the eeg recording very complicated the right brain schematic is the uninformed person and the left is the informed
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 472.76 489.57 <o,f0,male> remember that we scanned both brains at the same time so we can ask about time synced activity in similar or different areas simultaneously just like if you wanted to study a conversation and you were scanning two people talking to each other and you 'd expect common activity in language regions when they 're actually kind of listening and communicating
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 489.96 493.52 <o,f0,male> so the arrows connect regions that are active at the same time
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 493.93 510.9 <o,f0,male> and the direction of the arrows flows from the region that 's active first in time and the arrowhead goes to the region that 's active later so in this case if you look carefully most of the arrows flow from right to left that is it looks as if the uninformed brain activity is happening first
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 510.99 517.94 <o,f0,male> and then it 's followed by activity in the informed brain and by the way these were trials where their deals were made
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 518.31 537.26 <o,f0,male> this is from the first two seconds we haven 't finished analyzing this data so we 're still peeking in but the hope is that we can say something in the first couple of seconds about whether they 'll make a deal or not which could be very useful in thinking about avoiding litigation and ugly divorces and things like that those are all cases in which a lot of value is lost by delay and strikes
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 538.34 542.02 <o,f0,male> here 's the case where the disagreements occur you can see it looks different than the one before
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 542.45 558.38 <o,f0,male> there 's a lot more arrows that means that the brains are synced up more closely in terms of simultaneous activity and the arrows flow clearly from left to right that is the informed brain seems to be deciding we 're probably not going to make a deal here and then later there 's activity in the uninformed brain
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 558.38 574 <o,f0,male> next i 'm going to introduce you to some relatives they 're hairy smelly fast and strong you might be thinking back to your last thanksgiving maybe if you had a chimpanzee with you charles darwin and i and you broke off from the family tree from chimpanzees about five
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 574 580.96 <o,f0,male> million years ago they 're still our closest genetic kin we share ninety eight point eight percent of the genes we share more genes with them than zebras do with horses
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 581.18 590.66 <o,f0,male> and we 're also their closest cousin they have more genetic relation to us than to gorillas so how humans and chimpanzees behave differently might tell us a lot about brain evolution
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 591.06 608.4 <o,f0,male> so this is an amazing memory test from nagoya japan primate research institute where they 've done a lot of this research this goes back quite a ways they 're interested in working memory the chimp is going to see watch carefully they 're going to see two hundred milliseconds exposure that 's fast that 's eight movie frames of numbers one two three four five
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 608.41 617.22 <o,f0,male> then they disappear and they 're replaced by squares and they have to press the squares that correspond to the numbers from low to high to get an apple reward let 's see how they can do it
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 627.08 631.61 <o,f0,male> this is a young chimp the young ones are better than the old ones just like humans
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 632.62 637.9 <o,f0,male> and they 're highly experienced so they 've done this thousands and thousands of time obviously there 's a big training effect as you can imagine
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 658.68 676.3 <o,f0,male> is based on an idea of tetsuro matsuzawa he had a bold idea that what he called the cognitive trade off hypothesis we know chimps are faster and stronger they 're also very obsessed with status his thought was maybe they 've preserved brain activities and they practice them in development that are really really important to them to negotiate status and to win
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 676.47 683.35 <o,f0,male> which is something like strategic thinking during competition so we 're going to check that out by having the chimps actually play a game
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 683.65 693.88 <o,f0,male> by touching two touch screens the chimps are actually interacting with each other through the computers they 're going to press left or right one chimp is called a matcher they win if they press left left
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 694.13 703.83 <o,f0,male> like a seeker finding someone in hide and seek or right right the mismatcher wants to mismatch they want to press the opposite screen of the chimp and the rewards are apple cube rewards
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 704.19 720.72 <o,f0,male> so here 's how game theorists look at these data this is a graph of the percentage of times the matcher picked right on the x axis and the percentage of times they predicted right by the mismatcher on the y axis so a point here is the behavior by a pair of players one trying to match one trying to mismatch
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 720.72 727.21 <o,f0,male> the ne square in the middle actually ne ch and qre those are three different theories of nash equilibrium and others
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 727.24 730.83 <o,f0,male> tells you what the theory predicts which is that they should match fifty fifty
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 743.02 744.63 <o,f0,male> now we move the payoffs
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 744.68 758.16 <o,f0,male> we 're actually going to make the left left payoff for the matcher a little bit higher now they get three apple cubes game theoretically that should actually make the mismatcher 's behavior shift because what happens is the mismatcher will think oh this guy 's going to go for the big reward and so i 'm going to go to the right make sure he doesn 't get it
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 758.27 773.75 <o,f0,male> and as you can see their behavior moves up in the direction of this change in the nash equilibrium finally we changed the payoffs one more time now it 's four apple cubes and their behavior again moves towards the nash equilibrium it 's sprinkled around but if you average the chimps out they 're really really close within one
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 781.08 783.97 <o,f0,male> here 's two human groups in green and blue
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 784.44 796.85 <o,f0,male> they 're closer to fifty fifty they 're not responding to payoffs as closely and also if you study their learning in the game they aren 't as sensitive to previous rewards the chimps are playing better than the humans better in the sense of adhering to game theory and these are two different groups of humans from japan
ColinCamerer_2013X 1 ColinCamerer_2013X 803.16 807.89 <o,f0,male> so here are some things we learned today people seem to do a limited amount of strategic thinking using theory of mind
