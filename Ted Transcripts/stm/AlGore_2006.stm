AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 38.81 42.35 <o,f0,male> and i say that sincerely partly because
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 43.38 43.83 <o,f0,male> need that
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 58.89 61.10 <o,f0,male> i flew on air force two for eight years
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 63.23 66.62 <o,f0,male> now i have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 78.82 80.32 <o,f0,male> what that's been like for me
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 82.39 84.63 <o,f0,male> it's a true story every bit of this is true
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 85.66 87.74 <o,f0,male> soon after tipper and i left the
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 113.86 116.32 <o,f0,male> i looked in the rearview mirror and
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 118.10 122.10 <o,f0,male> all of a sudden it just hit me there was no motorcade back there
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 124.98 126.83 <o,f0,male> you've heard of phantom limb pain
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 134.03 135.98 <o,f0,male> this was a rented ford taurus
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 166.19 170.71 <o,f0,male> she took our order and then went to the couple in the booth next to us and she lowered her
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 193.09 194.32 <o,f0,male> a series of
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 196.70 197.76 <o,f0,male> the very next day
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 265.65 274.41 <o,f0,male> but what it turned out to be was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 287.46 295.85 <o,f0,male> the story began former vice president al gore announced in nigeria yesterday my wife tipper and i have opened a low cost family
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 298.64 301.82 <o,f0,male> shoney 's and we are running it ourselves
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 314.46 316.74 <o,f0,male> tipper was saying one more burger with fries
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 352.69 353.17 <o,f0,female> talk about
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 363.06 367.44 <o,f0,male> on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on what can you
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 367.69 373.65 <o,f0,male> do about the climate crisis i want to start with
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 376.24 386.90 <o,f0,male> show some new images and i'm going to recapitulate just four or five now the slide show i update the slide show
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 387.48 398.05 <o,f0,male> every time i give it i add new images because i learn more about it every time i give it it's like beachcombing you know every time the tide comes in and out you find some more shells
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 399.03 412.16 <o,f0,male> just in the last two days we got the new temperature records in january this is just for the united states of america historical average for january is thirty one degrees last month was thirty nine
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 412.68 418.24 <o,f0,male> point five degrees now i know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 421.20 429.35 <o,f0,male> but these are the recapitulation slides and then i'm going to go into new material about what you can do but i wanted to elaborate on a couple of these
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 430.08 436.60 <o,f0,male> first of all this is where we're projected to go with the u s contribution to global warming under business as usual
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 446.52 460.30 <o,f0,male> a cost it's a profit the sign is wrong it's not negative it's positive these are investments that pay for themselves but they are also very effective in deflecting our path
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 461.51 470.52 <o,f0,male> cars and trucks i talked about that in the slideshow but i want you to put it in perspective it's an easy visible
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 471.22 480.97 <o,f0,male> target of concern and it should be but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 481.54 489.30 <o,f0,male> cars and trucks are very significant and we have the lowest standards in the world and so we should address that but it's part of the puzzle
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 489.83 494.33 <o,f0,male> other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 513.32 527.39 <o,f0,male> shows it carbon capture and sequestration that's what ccs stands for is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 528.08 540.49 <o,f0,male> to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe not quite there yet ok now what can you do
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 542.03 548.82 <o,f0,male> reduce emissions in your home most of these expenditures are also profitable
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 557.55 564.97 <o,f0,male> a hybrid use light rail figure out some of the other options that are much better it's important
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 565.76 578.09 <o,f0,male> be a green consumer you have choices with everything you buy between things that have a harsh effect or a much less harsh effect on the global
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 578.66 590.62 <o,f0,male> climate crisis consider this make a decision to live a carbon neutral life those of you who are good at branding i'd love to get your advice and help
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 591.07 600.65 <o,f0,male> on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people it is easier than you think it really is
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 602.67 611.57 <o,f0,male> a lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy reduce your carbon
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 617.05 626.31 <o,f0,male> and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced and what it means
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 626.53 634.33 <o,f0,male> is elaborated at climatecrisis net there is a carbon calculator
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 643.93 651.27 <o,f0,male> on this arcane science of carbon calculation to construct a consumer friendly carbon calculator
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 651.74 661.03 <o,f0,male> you can very precisely calculate what your co two emissions are and then you will be given options to reduce
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 661.42 669.85 <o,f0,male> and by the time the movie comes out in may this will be updated to two point zero and we will have click through purchases of offsets
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 670.60 677.73 <o,f0,male> next consider making your business carbon neutral again some of us have done that and it's not as hard as you think
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 687.52 698.34 <o,f0,male> community invest sustainably majora mentioned this listen if you have invested money with managers
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 698.44 706.26 <o,f0,male> who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance don't ever again complain about quarterly report ceo
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 731.98 733.42 <o,f0,male> it talk about it
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 734.69 740.10 <o,f0,male> the movie comes out the movie is a movie version of the slideshow i gave two nights ago except it's a lot more
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 742.30 744.64 <o,f0,male> and it comes out in may
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 744.95 748.51 <o,f0,male> many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 750.68 756.14 <o,f0,male> consider sending somebody to nashville pick well
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 756.86 759.38 <o,f0,male> and i am personally going to train people to give
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 759.55 768.40 <o,f0,male> this slideshow re purposed with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach and it's
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 769.16 776.78 <o,f0,male> not just the slides it's what they mean and it's how they link together and so i'm going to be conducting a course this summer
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 777.20 785.70 <o,f0,male> for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse in communities all across the country and we're
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 799.61 804.85 <o,f0,male> use copyrights so that young people can remix it
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 819.30 829.65 <o,f0,male> we need republicans as well this used to be a bipartisan issue and i know that in this group it really is become politically active make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 830.42 837.69 <o,f0,male> support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions global warming pollution and trading
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 839.38 846.04 <o,f0,male> as long as the united states is out of the world system it's not a closed system once it becomes a closed system
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 856.07 857.09 <o,f0,male> it's a closed system
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 857.37 860.57 <o,f0,male> you will have legal liability if you do not
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 861.58 871.75 <o,f0,male> urge your ceo to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided the market will work to solve this problem
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 874.51 876.16 <o,f0,male> if we can accomplish this
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 888.81 896.62 <o,f0,male> and in our modern country the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 905.71 912.68 <o,f0,male> let 's rebrand global warming as many of you have suggested i like climate crisis instead of climate collapse
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 912.85 915.86 <o,f0,male> but again those of you who are good at branding i need your help on this
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 929.68 931.88 <o,f0,female> that's really true
AlGore_2006 1 AlGore_2006 959.73 960.22 <o,f0,female> you very
