WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 17.01 26.22 <o,f0,male> we are in this wonderful open air amphitheater and we are enjoying ourselves in that mild evening temperature tonight
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 27.51 32.43 <o,f0,male> but when qatar will host the football world cup
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 32.75 42.97 <o,f0,male> ten years from now two thousand and twenty two we already heard it will be in the hot very hot and sunny summer months of june and july
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 42.97 55.96 <o,f0,male> and when qatar has been assigned to the world cup all many people around the world have been wondering how would it be possible that football players show spectacular football run around in this desert climate
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 55.96 64.75 <o,f0,male> how would it be possible that spectators sit enjoy themselves in open air stadia in this hot environment
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 65.38 70.97 <o,f0,male> together with the architects of albert speer partner our engineers from transsolar have been
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 70.97 89.4 <o,f0,male> supporting have been developing open air stadia based on one hundred percent solar power on one hundred percent solar cooling let me tell you about that but let me start with comfort let me start with the aspect of comfort because many people are confusing
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 90.26 104.82 <o,f0,male> ambient temperature with thermal comfort we are used to looking at charts like that and you see this red line showing the air temperature in june and july and yes that 's right it 's picking up to forty five degrees c it 's actually very hot
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 124.61 138.71 <o,f0,male> people have perceived at these different sport activities and let me start with mexico mexico temperature has been air temperature has been something between fifteen up to thirty degrees c and people enjoyed themselves
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 138.71 146.96 <o,f0,male> it was a very comfortable game in mexico city have a look orlando same kind of stadium open air stadium
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 147.22 150.57 <o,f0,male> people have been sitting in the strong sun
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 168.29 171.45 <o,f0,male> so the games have been perceived as comfortable
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 172.21 176.03 <o,f0,male> what about athens mediterranean climate
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 176.18 182.67 <o,f0,male> but in the sun it was not comfortable they didn 't perceive comfort and we know that from spain we know that
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 198.65 210.33 <o,f0,male> high humidity and it was not comfortable so if i overlay and if you overlay all these comfort envelopes what we see is in all these places air temperature has been ranging something
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 215.27 231.73 <o,f0,male> thirty of thirty degrees c ambient temperatures if you go along that line you see there has been all kind of comfort all kinds of perceived outdoor comfort ranging from very comfortable to very uncomfortable so why is that
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 252.18 269.87 <o,f0,male> and this is air temperature all these parameters go into the comfort feeling of our human body and scientists have developed a parameter which is the perceived temperature where all these parameters go in and help designers to understand
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 286.7 288.67 <o,f0,male> because of our metabolism
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 289.06 292.2 <o,f0,male> we as human beings we produce heat
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 292.43 303.46 <o,f0,female> i 'm excited i 'm talking to you i 'm probably producing one hundred and fifty watts at the moment you are sitting you are relaxed you 're looking at me it 's probably one hundred watts each person is producing
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 303.46 315.08 <o,f0,female> and we need to get rid of that energy i need with my body to get rid of the energy and the harder it is for myself for my body to get rid of the energy the less comfort i feel
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 315.08 322.56 <o,f0,male> that 's it and if i don 't get rid of the energy i will die
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 322.56 334.43 <o,f0,male> if we overlay what happens during the football world cup what will happen in june july we will see yes air temperature will be much higher but because the games and the plays will be in the afternoon
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 334.46 347.59 <o,f0,male> it 's probably the same comfort rating we 've found in other places which has perceived as non comfortable so we sat together with a team which prepared the bid book or goal that we said let 's
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 347.59 357.65 <o,f0,male> aim for perceived temperature for outdoor comfort in this range which is perceived with a temperature of thirty two
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 361.98 378.61 <o,f0,male> people would feel really fine in an open outdoor environment but what does it mean if we just look on what happens we see temperature 's too high if we apply the best architectural design climate engineering design we won 't get much better
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 378.73 391.68 <o,f0,male> so we need to do something active we need for instance to bring in radiant cooling technology and we need to combine this with so called soft conditioning and how does it look like in a stadium
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 391.69 393.29 <o,f0,male> so the stadium
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 393.33 397.06 <o,f0,male> has a few elements which create that outdoor comfort first
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 418.98 438.29 <o,f0,female> floor heating system where water pipes are embedded in the floor and just by using cold water going through the water pipes you can release the heat which is absorbed during the day in the stadium so you can create that comfort and then by adding dry air instead of down chilled air
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 438.29 450.99 <o,f0,female> the spectators and the football players can adjust to their individual comfort needs to their individual energy balance they can adjust and find their comfort they need to find
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 458.56 471.43 <o,f0,male> training pitches where all the individual countries are going to train we applied the same concept shading of the training pitch using a shelter against wind then using the grass
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 471.84 479.59 <o,f0,male> natural watered lawn is a very good cooling source stabilizing temperature and using dehumidified air to create comfort
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 480.35 482.28 <o,f0,male> but even the best
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 482.68 489.03 <o,f0,male> passive design wouldn 't help we need active system and how do we do that our idea for the bid was
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 489.04 506.72 <o,f0,male> one hundred percent solar cooling based on the idea that we use the roof of the stadia we cover the roofs of the stadia with pv systems we don 't borrow any energy from history we are not using fossil energies we are not borrowing energy from our neighbors
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 506.72 509.94 <o,f0,female> we 're using energy we can harvest on our roofs
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 509.94 512.77 <o,f0,female> and also on the training pitches which
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 512.77 518.58 <o,f0,female> will be covered with large flexible membranes and we will see in the next years
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 518.58 537.72 <o,f0,female> an industry coming up with flexible photovoltaics giving the possibilities of shading against strong sun and producing electric energy in the same time and this energy now is harvested throughout the year sent into the grid is replacing fossils in the grid and when i need it for the
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 554.43 560.58 <o,f0,female> which is necessary to condition a world cup in qatar the next twenty years this energy
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 566.85 570.6 <o,f0,female> this is not only useful for stadia we can use that also in open
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 592.34 595.8 <o,f0,female> we wanted to create an outdoor space
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 595.8 605.04 <o,f0,female> which is so comfortable that people can go there in the early afternoon even in these sunny and hot summer months and they can enjoy and meet there
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 612.76 620.36 <o,f0,male> use and take advantage of the sun you can harvest on your footprint and these beautiful umbrellas
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 621.61 624.56 <o,f0,male> so i 'd like to encourage you
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 624.87 629.74 <o,f0,male> to pay attention to your thermal comfort to your thermal environment
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 643.57 645.78 <o,f0,male> and i also hope
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 645.8 655.35 <o,f0,male> that you share the idea that if engineers and designers can use all these different climatic parameters it will be possible
WolfgangKessling_2012S 1 WolfgangKessling_2012S 668.88 679.23 <o,f0,male> and we can do that with the best passive design but also using the energy source of the site in qatar which is the sun
