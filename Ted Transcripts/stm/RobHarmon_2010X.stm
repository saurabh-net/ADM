RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 25.76 38.72 <o,f0,male> this is happening all over the country there are tens of thousands of miles of dewatered streams in the united states on this map the colored areas represent water conflicts
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 38.72 51.14 <o,f0,male> similar problems are emerging in the east as well the reasons vary state to state but mostly in the details there are four thousand miles of dewatered streams in montana
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 51.15 62.15 <o,f0,male> alone they would ordinarily support fish and other wildlife they 're the veins of the ecosystem and they 're often empty veins
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 62.15 76.64 <o,f0,male> i want to tell you the story of just one of these streams because it 's an archetype for the larger story this is prickly pear creek it runs through a populated area from east helena to lake helena
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 76.64 87.52 <o,f0,male> it supports wild fish including cutthroat brown and rainbow trout nearly every year for more than a hundred years
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 87.52 103.39 <o,f0,male> it 's looked like this in the summer how did we get here well it started back in the late one thousand eight hundred s when people started settling in places like montana in short there was a lot of water and there weren 't very many people
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 103.39 120.59 <o,f0,male> but as more people showed up wanting water the folks who were there first got a little concerned and in one thousand eight hundred and sixty five montana passed its first water law it basically said everybody near the stream can share in the stream oddly a lot of people showed up wanting to share
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 139.56 146.55 <o,f0,male> had the first or senior water rights these senior water rights
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 165.89 171.89 <o,f0,male> along with the economic value that goes with it so they have no incentive to conserve
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 171.89 175.2 <o,f0,male> so it 's not just about the number of people
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 175.2 190.21 <o,f0,male> the system itself creates a disincentive to conserve because you can lose your water right if you don 't use it so after decades of lawsuits and one hundred and forty years now of experience we still have this
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 190.21 205.25 <o,f0,male> it 's a broken system there 's a disincentive to conserve because if you don 't use your water right you can lose your water right and i 'm sure you all know this has created significant conflicts between the agricultural and environmental communities
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 219.8 236.58 <o,f0,male> there 's another thing happening around the country which is that companies are starting to get concerned about their water footprint they 're concerned about securing an adequate supply of water they 're trying to be really efficient with their water use and they 're concerned about how their water use affects the image of their brand
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 236.58 249.49 <o,f0,male> well it 's a national problem but i 'm going to tell you another story from montana and it involves beer i bet you didn 't know it takes about five pints of water to make a pint of beer if you include all the
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 264.71 283.17 <o,f0,male> so what can they do about this remaining water footprint that can have serious effects on the ecosystem these ecosystems are really important to the montana brewers and their customers after all there 's a strong correlation between water and fishing
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 283.17 298.05 <o,f0,male> and for some there 's a strong correlation between fishing and beer laughter so the montana brewers and their customers are concerned and they 're looking for some way to address the problem so how can they address this remaining water
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 298.05 310.99 <o,f0,male> footprint remember prickly pear up until now business water stewardship has been limited to measuring and reducing and we 're suggesting that the next step
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 311.01 317.09 <o,f0,male> is to restore remember prickly pear it 's a broken system you 've got a disincentive to
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 333.03 338.01 <o,f0,male> senior water rights holders can leave their water in stream
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 338.05 345.17 <o,f0,male> while legally protecting it from others and maintaining their water right
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 345.17 364.86 <o,f0,male> after all it is their water right and if they want to use that water right to help the fish grow in the stream it 's their right to do so but they have no incentive to do so so working with local water trusts we created an incentive to do so
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 365.13 373.1 <o,f0,male> we pay them to leave their water in stream that 's what 's happening here this individual has made the choice
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 373.1 387.09 <o,f0,male> and is closing this water diversion leaving the water in the stream he doesn 't lose the water right he just chooses to apply that right or some portion of it to the stream instead of to the land
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 387.09 393.41 <o,f0,male> because he 's the senior water rights holder he can protect the water from other users in the stream
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 399.22 403.18 <o,f0,male> this guy 's measuring the water that this leaves in the stream
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 403.18 409.08 <o,f0,male> we then take the measured water we divide it into thousand gallon increments
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 409.08 424.71 <o,f0,male> each increment gets a serial number and a certificate and then the brewers and others buy those certificates as a way to return water to these degraded ecosystems the brewers pay to restore water to the stream
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 424.71 429.62 <o,f0,male> it provides a simple inexpensive and measurable way
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 429.62 447.09 <o,f0,male> to return water to these degraded ecosystems while giving farmers an economic choice and giving businesses concerned about their water footprints an easy way to deal with them after one hundred and forty years of conflict and one hundred years of dry streams
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 447.09 452.11 <o,f0,male> a circumstance that litigation and regulation has not solved
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 452.79 460.7 <o,f0,male> we put together a market based willing buyer willing seller solution a solution that does not require litigation
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 460.7 479.41 <o,f0,male> it 's about giving folks concerned about their water footprints a real opportunity to put water where it 's critically needed into these degraded ecosystems while at the same time providing farmers a meaningful economic choice
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 479.42 496.8 <o,f0,male> about how their water is used these transactions create allies not enemies they connect people rather than dividing them and they provide needed economic support for rural communities and most importantly it 's working we 've returned more than four billion gallons of water to degraded ecosystems
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 496.8 508.83 <o,f0,male> we 've connected senior water rights holders with brewers in montana with hotels and tea companies in oregon and with high tech companies that use a lot of water in the southwest and when we make these connections
RobHarmon_2010X 1 RobHarmon_2010X 508.83 516.9 <o,f0,male> we can and we do turn this into this
