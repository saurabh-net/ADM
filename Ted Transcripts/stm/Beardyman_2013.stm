Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 13.89 33.34 <o,f0,male> like you all to ask yourselves a question which you may never have asked yourselves before what is possible with the human voice what is possible with the human
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 93.95 98.73 <o,f0,female> it
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 151.69 154.22 <o,f0,male> monks can do which is like
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 166.36 174.87 <o,f0,male> and it hurts your throat so there 's things you can 't do and these limitations on the human voice have always really annoyed me
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 174.87 189.66 <o,f0,male> because beatbox is the best way of getting musical ideas out of your head and into the world but they 're sketches at best which is what 's annoyed me if only if only there was a way for these ideas to come out
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 189.67 193.14 <o,f0,male> unimpeded by the restrictions which
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 193.14 206.26 <o,f0,male> my body gives it so i 've been working with these guys and we 've made a machine we 've made a system which is basically a live production
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 206.26 214.71 <o,f0,male> machine a real time music production machine and it enables me to using nothing but my voice
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 214.71 218.74 <o,f0,male> create music in real time as i hear it in my head
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 218.74 226.17 <o,f0,male> unimpeded by any physical restrictions that my body might place on me and i 'm going to show you
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 226.17 239.22 <o,f0,male> what it can do and before i start making noises with it and using it to manipulate my voice i want to reiterate that everything that you 're about to hear is being made by
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 239.29 242.77 <o,f0,male> my voice this system has
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 242.96 245.35 <o,f0,male> thank you beautiful assistant
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 247.01 256.02 <o,f0,male> this system has no sounds in it itself until i start putting sounds in it so there 's no prerecorded samples of any kind
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 256.02 262.33 <o,f0,male> so once this thing really gets going and it really starts to mangle the audio i 'm putting into it it becomes
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 262.33 278.89 <o,f0,male> not obvious that it is the human voice but it is so i 'm going to take you through it bit by bit and start nice and simple so the polyphony problem i 've only got one voice how do i get around the problem of really wanting to have as many different voices going on at the same time the simplest way to do it is something like this
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 324.82 341.34 <o,f0,male> the easiest way but if you want to do something a little bit more immediate something that you can 't achieve with live looping there 's other ways to layer your voice up there 's things like pitch shifting which are awesome and i 'm going to show you now what that sounds like so i 'm going to start another beat for you like this
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 386.84 390.87 <o,f0,male> which is nice but what if i want to make say
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 417.4 420.93 <o,f0,male> if i wanted to sound like the whole of pink floyd
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 420.93 429.68 <o,f0,male> impossible you say no it is possible and you can do it very simply using this machine it 's really fantastic check it out
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 464.47 483.69 <o,f0,male> every noise you can hear there is my voice i didn 't just trigger something which sounds like that there 's no samples there 's no synthesizers that is literally all my voice being manipulated and when you get to that point you have to ask don 't you what 's the point
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 491.93 508.68 <o,f0,male> in actual fact i haven 't made this machine so that i can emulate things that already exist i 've made this so that i can make any noise that i can imagine so with your permission i 'm going to do some things that are in my mind and i hope you enjoy them
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 621.58 625.19 <o,f0,male> this
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 648.12 655.87 <o,f0,male> loosely defined that is what 's possible with the human voice thank you very much
