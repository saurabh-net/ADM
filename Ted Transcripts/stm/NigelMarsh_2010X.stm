NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 53.47 63.44 <o,f0,male> and i decided that i would try and turn my life around in particular i decided i would try to address the thorny issue of work life balance
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 64.18 66.05 <o,f0,male> so i stepped back
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 71.33 73.22 <o,f0,male> and four young children
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 73.92 77.3 <o,f0,male> but all i learned about work life balance from that year
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 77.45 80.66 <o,f0,male> was that i found it quite easy to balance
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 80.69 84.98 <o,f0,male> work and life when i didn 't have any work
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 91.86 93.73 <o,f0,male> so i went back to work
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 94 97.13 <o,f0,male> and i 've spent these seven years since
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 107.88 113.51 <o,f0,male> the first is if society 's to make any progress on this issue we need an honest
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 122.08 124.12 <o,f0,male> all the discussions about
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 129.24 132.3 <o,f0,male> only serve to mask the core issue
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 133.06 137.4 <o,f0,male> which is that certain job and career choices
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 137.41 140.78 <o,f0,male> are fundamentally incompatible
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 141.02 145.69 <o,f0,male> with being meaningfully engaged on a day to day basis with a young family
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 148.32 153.77 <o,f0,male> now the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the reality of the situation you 're in
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 153.89 157.18 <o,f0,male> and the reality of the society that we 're in
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 161.28 164.76 <o,f0,male> leading lives of quiet screaming desperation
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 169.4 173.69 <o,f0,male> to enable them to buy things they don 't need to impress people they don 't like
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 207.78 215.83 <o,f0,male> if you don 't design your life someone else will design it for you and you may just not like their idea of balance
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 216.76 219.03 <o,f0,male> it 's particularly important
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 219.55 229.1 <o,f0,male> this isn 't on the world wide web is it i 'm about to get fired it 's particularly important that you never put the quality of your life in the hands of a commercial corporation
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 230.22 236.21 <o,f0,male> now i 'm not talking here just about the bad companies the abattoirs of the human soul as i call them
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 241.46 245.32 <o,f0,male> because commercial companies are inherently designed
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 245.37 249.11 <o,f0,male> to get as much out of you as they can get away with
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 256.22 262.13 <o,f0,male> on the one hand putting childcare facilities in the workplace is wonderful and enlightened
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 262.85 267.71 <o,f0,male> on the other hand it 's a nightmare it just means you spend more time at the bloody office
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 269.17 275.68 <o,f0,male> we have to be responsible for setting and enforcing the boundaries that we want in our life
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 283.56 286.88 <o,f0,male> that we choose upon which to judge our balance
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 288.17 291.91 <o,f0,male> before i went back to work after my year at home
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 292.09 293.77 <o,f0,male> i sat down
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 295.75 299.72 <o,f0,male> detailed step by step description
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 299.78 303.82 <o,f0,male> of the ideal balanced day that i aspired
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 304.87 306.44 <o,f0,male> and it went like this
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 327.68 329.29 <o,f0,male> do three hours work
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 332.79 334.3 <o,f0,male> do another three hours work
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 334.97 337.74 <o,f0,male> meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 343.62 345.41 <o,f0,male> meditate for half an hour
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 378.71 380.4 <o,f0,male> life when i retire
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 380.79 387.66 <o,f0,male> when my kids have left home when my wife has divorced me my health is failing i 've got no mates or interests left
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 400.76 402.4 <o,f0,male> in a balanced way
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 433.57 436.29 <o,f0,male> now i don 't mean to mock
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 436.78 439.85 <o,f0,male> but being a fit ten hour a day office rat
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 473.62 480.35 <o,f0,male> understand how that can be daunting but an incident that happened a couple of years ago gave me a new perspective
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 480.69 483.55 <o,f0,male> my wife who is somewhere in the audience
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 486.01 490.86 <o,f0,male> and said nigel you need to pick our youngest son harry up from school
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 501.34 503.26 <o,f0,male> we walked down to the local park
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 531.1 539.18 <o,f0,male> as i was walking out of his bedroom he said dad i went yes mate he went dad this has been the best day of my life
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 567.84 571.89 <o,f0,male> moreover i think it can transform society
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 574.49 577.87 <o,f0,male> we can change society 's definition of success
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 578.12 583.73 <o,f0,male> away from the moronically simplistic notion that the person with the most money when he dies wins
NigelMarsh_2010X 1 NigelMarsh_2010X 584.14 590.42 <o,f0,male> to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well lived looks like
