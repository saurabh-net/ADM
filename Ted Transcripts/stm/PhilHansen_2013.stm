PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 13.37 18.36 <o,f0,male> when i was in art school i developed a shake in my hand and this was the straightest line i could draw
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 18.96 24.92 <o,f0,male> now in hindsight it was actually good for some things like mixing a can of paint or shaking a polaroid
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 25.1 30.46 <o,f0,male> but at the time this was really doomsday this was the destruction of my dream of becoming an artist
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 31.19 32.77 <o,f0,male> the shake developed out of
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 33.21 37.83 <o,f0,male> really a single minded pursuit of pointillism just years of making tiny tiny dots
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 37.97 40.31 <o,f0,male> and eventually these dots went from
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 40.53 44.92 <o,f0,male> being perfectly round to looking more like tadpoles because of the shake
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 45.49 51.93 <o,f0,male> so to compensate i 'd hold the pen tighter and this progressively made the shake worse so i 'd hold the pen tighter still
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 52.25 58.36 <o,f0,male> and this became a vicious cycle that ended up causing so much pain and joint issues i had trouble holding anything
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 64.41 66.19 <o,f0,male> and then i left art completely
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 67.23 74.16 <o,f0,male> but after a few years i just couldn 't stay away from art and i decided to go to a neurologist about the shake and discovered i had permanent nerve damage
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 80.65 87.33 <o,f0,male> so i did i went home i grabbed a pencil and i just started letting my hand shake and shake i was making all these scribble pictures
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 87.6 91.48 <o,f0,male> and even though it wasn 't the kind of art that i was ultimately passionate about
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 97.59 100.8 <o,f0,male> i just had to find a different approach to making the art that i wanted
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 101.17 108.12 <o,f0,male> now i still enjoyed the fragmentation of pointillism seeing these little tiny dots come together to make this unified whole
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 108.14 116.11 <o,f0,male> so i began experimenting with other ways to fragment images where the shake wouldn 't affect the work like dipping my feet in paint and walking on a canvas
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 117.73 123.56 <o,f0,male> or in a three d structure consisting of two by fours creating a two d image
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 123.73 125.66 <o,f0,male> by burning it with a blowtorch
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 126.76 132.21 <o,f0,male> i discovered that if i worked on a larger scale and with bigger materials my hand really wouldn 't hurt
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 132.43 136.19 <o,f0,male> and after having gone from a single approach to art
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 136.4 141.41 <o,f0,male> i ended up having an approach to creativity that completely changed my artistic horizons
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 141.98 148.61 <o,f0,male> this was the first time i 'd encountered this idea that embracing a limitation could actually drive creativity
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 158.55 163.45 <o,f0,male> i felt like i could do so much more with the supplies i thought an artist was supposed to have
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 164.07 170.43 <o,f0,male> i actually didn 't even have a regular pair of scissors i was using these metal shears until i stole a pair from the office that i worked at
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 182.21 185.45 <o,f0,male> really try to create something just completely outside of the box
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 185.95 187.73 <o,f0,male> but i sat there for hours
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 187.99 189.64 <o,f0,male> and nothing came to mind
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 190.53 193.21 <o,f0,male> the same thing the next day and then the next
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 193.29 195.64 <o,f0,male> quickly slipping into a creative slump
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 196.91 201.24 <o,f0,male> and i was in a dark place for a long time unable to create
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 201.33 207.01 <o,f0,male> and it didn 't make any sense because i was finally able to support my art and yet i was creatively blank
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 208.04 215.13 <o,f0,male> but as i searched around in the darkness i realized i was actually paralyzed by all of the choices that i never had before
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 216.12 219.52 <o,f0,male> and it was then that i thought back to my jittery hands
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 220.23 221.79 <o,f0,male> embrace the shake
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 222.66 228.78 <o,f0,male> and i realized if i ever wanted my creativity back i had to quit trying so hard to think outside of the box
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 236.73 240.13 <o,f0,male> what if i could only create with a dollar 's worth of supplies
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 259.68 262.94 <o,f0,male> it really became a moment of clarification for me that
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 262.98 264.99 <o,f0,male> we need to first be limited
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 265.23 267.21 <o,f0,male> in order to become limitless
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 267.88 274.67 <o,f0,male> i took this approach of thinking inside the box to my canvas and wondered what if instead of painting on a canvas i could only paint on my chest
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 275.7 282.28 <o,f0,male> so i painted thirty images one layer at a time one on top of another with each picture representing an influence in my life
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 283.73 288.11 <o,f0,male> or what if instead of painting with a brush i could only paint with karate chops
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 310.05 319.43 <o,f0,male> so for six days i lived in front of a webcam i slept on the floor and i ate takeout and i asked people to call me and share a story with me about a life changing moment
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 320.24 325.13 <o,f0,male> their stories became the art as i wrote them onto the revolving canvas
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 341.96 349.89 <o,f0,male> this destruction idea turned into a yearlong project that i called goodbye art where each and every piece of art had to be destroyed after its creation
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 350.54 357.15 <o,f0,male> in the beginning of goodbye art i focused on forced destruction like this image of jimi hendrix made with over seven thousand matches
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 365.01 366.65 <o,f0,male> like spitting out food
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 374.05 376.33 <o,f0,male> and even frozen wine
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 378.22 391.76 <o,f0,male> the last iteration of destruction was to try to produce something that didn 't actually exist in the first place so i organized candles on a table i lit them and then blew them out then repeated this process over and over with the same set of candles
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 391.79 395.23 <o,f0,male> then assembled the videos into the larger image
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 395.67 399.62 <o,f0,male> so the end image was never visible as a physical whole
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 399.99 402.48 <o,f0,male> it was destroyed before it ever existed
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 404.42 412.16 <o,f0,male> in the course of this goodbye art series i created twenty three different pieces with nothing left to physically display
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 412.53 415.28 <o,f0,male> what i thought would be the ultimate limitation
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 415.32 417.94 <o,f0,male> actually turned out to be the ultimate liberation
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 417.95 426.09 <o,f0,male> as each time i created the destruction brought me back to a neutral place where i felt refreshed and ready to start the next project
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 426.3 435.77 <o,f0,male> it did not happen overnight there were times when my projects failed to get off the ground or even worse after spending tons of time on them the end image was kind of embarrassing
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 436.1 443.05 <o,f0,male> but having committed to the process i continued on and something really surprising came out of this as i destroyed each project
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 443.79 445.65 <o,f0,male> i was learning to let go
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 446.54 448.48 <o,f0,male> let go of outcomes
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 448.87 452.22 <o,f0,male> let go of failures and let go of imperfections
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 452.64 456.59 <o,f0,male> and in return i found a process of creating art that 's perpetual
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 459.23 463.27 <o,f0,male> i found myself in a state of constant creation thinking only of what 's next
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 463.69 466.02 <o,f0,male> and coming up with more ideas than ever
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 466.68 469.24 <o,f0,male> when i think back to my three years away from art
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 469.54 471.97 <o,f0,male> away from my dream just going through the motions
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 472.69 476.17 <o,f0,male> instead of trying to find a different way to continue that dream
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 476.7 478.72 <o,f0,male> i just quit i gave up
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 479.73 482.53 <o,f0,male> and what if i didn 't embrace the shake
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 483.1 488.94 <o,f0,male> because embracing the shake for me wasn 't just about art and having art skills it turned out to be about life
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 489.1 490.69 <o,f0,male> and having life skills
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 499.49 503.21 <o,f0,male> learning to be creative within the confines of our limitations
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 503.57 506.86 <o,f0,male> is the best hope we have to transform ourselves
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 507.41 510.29 <o,f0,male> and collectively transform our world
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 511.74 515.13 <o,f0,male> looking at limitations as a source of creativity
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 518.26 522.5 <o,f0,male> now when i run into a barrier or i find myself creatively stumped
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 530.15 533.71 <o,f0,male> like using hundreds of real live worms to make an image
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 534.84 537.26 <o,f0,male> using a pushpin to tattoo a banana
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 539.8 543.1 <o,f0,male> or painting a picture with hamburger grease
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 555.55 560.67 <o,f0,male> limitations may be the most unlikely of places to harness creativity
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 566.42 569.38 <o,f0,male> rethink categories and challenge accepted norms
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 569.99 573.55 <o,f0,male> and instead of telling each other to seize the day
