Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 26.49 30.05 <o,f0,male> and for quite a long time
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 32.60 42.96 <o,f0,male> a consumer it cannot be consciously a
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 48.67 51.19 <o,f0,male> it is helpless it doesn't know
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 85.24 92.43 <o,f0,male> afford to doubt the person
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 93.67 101.17 <o,f0,male> who tends the child it has to totally surrender
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 108.68 118.68 <o,f0,male> totally surrender that implies a lot of trust
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 123.79 132.52 <o,f0,male> that implies the trusted person won 't violate the trust
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 133.96 144.55 <o,f0,male> as the child grows it begins to discover that the person trusted
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 146.83 150.77 <o,f0,male> is violating the trust it doesn't know even the word violation
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 153.87 156.20 <o,f0,male> therefore it has to
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 167.95 176.19 <o,f0,male> more difficult to really resolve the wordless self blame
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 180.98 183.54 <o,f0,male> the child grows to become an adult
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 185.91 188.57 <o,f0,male> so far it has been a consumer
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 189.86 196.16 <o,f0,male> but the growth of a human being lies in
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 198.74 200.65 <o,f0,male> capacity to
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 206.63 213.74 <o,f0,male> cannot contribute unless one feels secure one
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 216.72 219.26 <o,f0,male> one feels i have enough
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 221.76 231.56 <o,f0,male> to be compassionate is not a joke it's not that simple one has to discover
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 232.25 243.73 <o,f0,male> a certain bigness in oneself that bigness should be centered on oneself not in terms of money not in terms of power you
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 246.27 252.87 <o,f0,male> not in terms of any status that you can command in the society
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 254.12 259.61 <o,f0,male> but it should be centered on oneself the self you are
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 262.07 265.45 <o,f0,male> that self it should be centered a
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 267.14 276.67 <o,f0,male> wholeness otherwise compassion is just a word and a dream
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 279.46 286.18 <o,f0,male> you can be compassionate occasionally more moved by
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 311.45 315.91 <o,f0,male> these two guys fight it out each one has got
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 320.07 320.62 <o,f0,male> it can be
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 325.11 331.67 <o,f0,male> so far has no meaning one person
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 340.28 342.43 <o,f0,male> both the players have to come to the net
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 345.79 350.88 <o,f0,male> and shake hands
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 365.82 366.35 <o,f0,male> and
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 368.18 370.52 <o,f0,male> has to come to the net when he comes to the
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 372.98 375.95 <o,f0,male> you see his whole face changes
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 378.11 380.20 <o,f0,male> it looks as though he 's wishing that
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 383.17 383.40 <o,f0,male> why
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 390.04 390.27 <o,f0,male> no
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 390.60 399.18 <o,f0,male> human hearted is denied of that empathy no religion can demolish that by indoctrination
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 401.30 409.50 <o,f0,male> no culture no nation and nationalism nothing can touch it
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 410.81 417.14 <o,f0,male> because it is empathy and that capacity
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 423.45 434.99 <o,f0,male> you reach out to people you do something that makes a difference in somebody 's life even words even
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 450.29 454.51 <o,f0,male> it transcends nation gender
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 458.21 459.22 <o,f0,male> why because
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 462.23 462.78 <o,f0,male> in
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 474.48 476.95 <o,f0,male> then this occasional compassion
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 478.69 482.67 <o,f0,male> we are not talking about
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 486.36 488.43 <o,f0,male> mandate you cannot make a person
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 494.08 496.38 <o,f0,male> you can't say please love me
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 497.58 503.73 <o,f0,male> is something you discover it's not an action
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 504.95 510.60 <o,f0,male> but in the english language it is also an action
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 514.51 518.82 <o,f0,male> so one has got to discover a certain wholeness
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 521.96 525.70 <o,f0,male> i am going to cite the possibility of being
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 528.53 532.27 <o,f0,male> which is within our experience everybody 's experience
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 535.76 541.71 <o,f0,male> in spite of a very tragic life
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 544.59 556.21 <o,f0,male> one is happy in moments which are very few and far between and the one who is happy
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 559.15 560.54 <o,f0,male> slapstick joke
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 565.75 571.61 <o,f0,male> accepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 574.91 581.29 <o,f0,male> that means the whole universe known things and unknown things
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 582.72 585.48 <o,f0,male> all of them are totally accepted
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 598.38 604.63 <o,f0,male> and the object the scheme of things fuse into
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 613.28 615.78 <o,f0,male> experience common to all and sundry
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 618.30 622.69 <o,f0,male> that experience confirms
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 623.22 630.29 <o,f0,male> in spite of all your limitations all your wants desires unfulfilled and
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 633.51 633.70 <o,f0,male> and
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 637.73 640.09 <o,f0,male> and finally baldness
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 641.89 646.59 <o,f0,male> you can be happy but the
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 648.24 653.39 <o,f0,male> the logic is that you don't need to fulfill your desire to be
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 656.53 665.82 <o,f0,male> you are the very happiness the wholeness that you want to be there's no choice in this that only
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 671.55 681.50 <o,f0,male> the wholeness cannot be different from you cannot be minus you
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 681.99 689.14 <o,f0,male> it has got to be you you cannot be a part of wholeness and still be
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 691.11 698.67 <o,f0,male> moment of happiness reveals that reality that realization that recognition
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 700.41 712.59 <o,f0,male> i am the whole maybe the swami is right maybe the swami is right you start your new life
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 716.97 719.88 <o,f0,male> then everything becomes meaningful
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 722.41 725.54 <o,f0,male> i have no more reason to blame myself
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 726.98 737.58 <o,f0,male> if one has to blame oneself one has a million reasons plus many but if i say in spite of my body being limited
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 739.08 745.96 <o,f0,male> if it is black it is not white if it is white it is not black
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 747.79 757.85 <o,f0,male> is limited any which way you look at it limited your knowledge is limited health is limited
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 771.18 776.41 <o,f0,male> is going to be limitless you cannot command compassion
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 786.16 795.03 <o,f0,male> are not period and there is no way of your being not limitless too
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 797.75 799.95 <o,f0,male> your own experience
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 802.91 805.28 <o,f0,male> in spite of all limitations you are the
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 807.88 814.47 <o,f0,male> and the wholeness is the reality of you when you relate to the world it is
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 817.68 826.04 <o,f0,male> relate to the world the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness is what we say
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 830.65 832.18 <o,f0,male> becomes compassion
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 833.98 837.06 <o,f0,male> if the object that you relate to
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 841.58 842.85 <o,f0,male> that
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 845.93 855.97 <o,f0,male> then that again transforms into giving into sharing you express
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 878.91 886.84 <o,f0,male> you learn swimming by swimming you cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 888.57 898.78 <o,f0,male> you learn swimming by swimming you learn cycling by cycling you learn cooking by cooking having some sympathetic people around you to
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 907.64 913.66 <o,f0,male> and therefore what i say you have to fake it and make it
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 920.36 920.75 <o,f0,male> you
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 926.08 926.67 <o,f0,male> meant that
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 929.35 929.75 <o,f0,male> you
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 941.59 947.09 <o,f0,male> is no verb for compassion but you have
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 948.61 957.09 <o,f0,male> for compassion that's interesting to me you act compassionately
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 960.48 971.41 <o,f0,male> but then how to act compassionately if you don't have compassion that is where you fake you fake it and make it this is the mantra of the united states of
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 976.62 978.85 <o,f0,male> you fake it and make it
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 980.47 989.62 <o,f0,male> you act compassionately as though you have compassion grind your teeth take all the support system if you know how to
Saraswati_2009P 1 Saraswati_2009P 1021.70 1026.67 <o,f0,male> wholeness and that's what you are with these words thank you
