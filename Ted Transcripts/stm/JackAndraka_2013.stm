JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 12.97 16.11 <o,f0,female> you ever experienced a moment in your life
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 23.78 25.43 <o,f0,female> to make sense of it all
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 25.44 28.48 <o,f0,female> when i was thirteen a close family friend
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 28.64 37.54 <o,f0,female> who was like an uncle to me passed away from pancreatic cancer when the disease hit so close to home i knew i needed to learn more
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 37.56 52.86 <o,f0,female> so i went online to find answers using the internet i found a variety of statistics on pancreatic cancer and what i had found shocked me over eighty five percent of all pancreatic cancers are diagnosed late
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 53.09 56.56 <o,f0,female> when someone has less than a two percent chance of survival
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 57.52 60.93 <o,f0,female> why are we so bad at detecting pancreatic cancer
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 61.63 67.11 <o,f0,female> the reason today 's current modern medicine is a sixty year old technique
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 67.27 70.12 <o,f0,female> that 's older than my dad
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 95.45 102.82 <o,f0,female> so i set up a scientific criteria as to what a sensor would have to look like in order to effectively diagnose pancreatic cancer
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 103.09 107.16 <o,f0,female> the sensor would have to be inexpensive rapid
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 113.81 119.13 <o,f0,female> now there 's a reason why this test hasn 't been updated in over six decades
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 119.13 135.71 <o,f0,female> and that 's because when we 're looking for pancreatic cancer we 're looking at your bloodstream which is already abundant in all these tons and tons of protein and you 're looking for this miniscule difference in this tiny amount of protein just this one protein that 's next to impossible
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 135.87 139.95 <o,f0,female> however undeterred due to my teenage optimism
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 155.02 163.69 <o,f0,female> and what i had found was an article that listed a database of over eight thousand different proteins that are found when you have pancreatic cancer
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 163.69 175.14 <o,f0,female> so i decided to go and make it my new mission to go through all these proteins and see which ones could serve as a biomarker for pancreatic cancer and to make it a bit simpler for myself
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 175.25 189.29 <o,f0,female> i decided to map out a scientific criteria and here it is essentially first the protein would have to be found in all pancreatic cancers at high levels in the bloodstream in the earliest stages but also only in cancer
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 189.29 199.04 <o,f0,female> and so i 'm just plugging and chugging through this gargantuan task and finally on the four thousandth try when i 'm close to losing my sanity i find the protein
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 203.19 220.8 <o,f0,female> and it 's just your ordinary run of the mill type protein unless of course you have pancreatic ovarian or lung cancer in which case it 's found at these very high levels in your bloodstream but also the key is that it 's found in the earliest stages of the disease when someone has close to one hundred percent chance of survival
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 224.33 228.86 <o,f0,female> i then shifted my focus to actually detecting that protein and thus pancreatic cancer
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 229.86 240.19 <o,f0,female> now my breakthrough came in a very unlikely place possibly the most unlikely place for innovation my high school biology class the absolute stifler of innovation
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 245.88 262.84 <o,f0,female> and i had snuck in this article on these things called carbon nanotubes and that 's just a long thin pipe of carbon that 's an atom thick and one fifty thousandth the diameter of your hair and despite their extremely small sizes they have these incredible properties they 're kind of like the superheroes of material science
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 262.84 278.93 <o,f0,female> and while i was sneakily reading this article under my desk in my biology class we were supposed to be paying attention to these other kind of cool molecules called antibodies and these are pretty cool because they only react with one specific protein but they 're not nearly as interesting as carbon nanotubes
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 278.93 291.67 <o,f0,female> and so then i was sitting in class and suddenly it hit me i could combine what i was reading about carbon nanotubes with what i was supposed to be thinking about antibodies
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 291.67 303.46 <o,f0,female> essentially i could weave a bunch of these antibodies into a network of carbon nanotubes such that you have a network that only reacts with one protein but also due to the properties of these nanotubes
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 303.52 307.47 <o,f0,female> it would change its electrical properties based on the amount of protein present
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 307.63 325.66 <o,f0,female> however there 's a catch these networks of carbon nanotubes are extremely flimsy and since they 're so delicate they need to be supported so that 's why i chose to use paper making a cancer sensor out of paper is about as simple as making chocolate chip cookies which i love
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 352.89 358.13 <o,f0,female> i can 't really do cancer research on my kitchen countertop my mom wouldn 't really like that
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 358.13 375.29 <o,f0,female> so instead i decided to go for a lab so i typed up a budget a materials list a timeline and a procedure and i emailed it to two hundred different professors at johns hopkins university and the national institutes of health essentially anyone that had anything to do with pancreatic cancer
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 400.24 406.13 <o,f0,female> he went through and said why each and every step was like the worst mistake i could ever make
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 406.26 411.25 <o,f0,female> clearly the professors did not have as high of an opinion of my work as i did
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 412.16 420.12 <o,f0,female> however there was a silver lining one professor said maybe i might be able to help you kid so i went in that direction
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 443.1 460.52 <o,f0,female> and they 're just firing these questions at me and by the end i kind of felt like i was in a clown car there were twenty ph d s plus me and the professor crammed into this tiny office space with them firing these rapid fire questions at me trying to sink my procedure how unlikely is that i mean
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 492.78 505.42 <o,f0,female> this makes it one hundred and sixty eight times faster over twenty six thousand times less expensive and over four hundred times more sensitive than our current standard for pancreatic cancer detection
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 525.24 537.76 <o,f0,female> and so in the next two to five years this sensor could potentially lift for pancreatic cancer survival rates from a dismal five point five percent to close to one hundred percent and it would do similar for ovarian and lung cancer
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 537.76 540.09 <o,f0,female> but it wouldn 't stop there
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 540.09 558.19 <o,f0,female> by switching out that antibody you can look at a different protein thus a different disease potentially any disease in the entire world so that ranges from heart disease to malaria hiv aids as well as other forms of cancer anything and so hopefully one day
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 558.19 566.47 <o,f0,female> we can all have that one extra uncle that one mother that one brother sister we can have that one more family member to love
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 566.85 579.38 <o,f0,female> and that our hearts will be rid of that one disease burden that comes from pancreatic ovarian and lung cancer and potentially any disease that through the internet anything is possible
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 579.39 584.99 <o,f0,female> theories can be shared and you don 't have to be a professor with multiple degrees to have your ideas valued
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 585.01 592.23 <o,f0,female> it 's a neutral space where what you look like age or gender it doesn 't matter it 's just your ideas that count
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 592.9 602.77 <o,f0,female> for me it 's all about looking at the internet in an entirely new way to realize that there 's so much more to it than just posting duck face pictures of yourself online
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 605.03 607.2 <o,f0,female> you could be changing the world
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 613.23 617.11 <o,f0,female> could find a new way to detect pancreatic cancer
