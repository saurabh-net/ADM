FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 17.55 26.93 <o,f0,male> about compassion from an islamic point of view and perhaps my faith is not very well thought of as being one that is grounded in compassion
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 27.34 34.88 <o,f0,male> the truth of the matter is otherwise our holy book the koran consists of one hundred and fourteen chapters
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 35.51 38.53 <o,f0,male> each chapter begins with what we call the
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 39.74 47.06 <o,f0,male> the saying in the name of god the all compassionate the all merciful or as sir richard burton
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 47.53 50.09 <o,f0,male> not the richard burton who was married to elizabeth taylor
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 50.56 59.36 <o,f0,male> but the sir richard burton who lived a century before that and who was a world wide traveler and translator of many works of literature
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 60.31 65.41 <o,f0,male> translates it as in the name of god the compassionating the compassionate
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 67.47 75.81 <o,f0,male> and in a saying of the koran which to muslims is god speaking to humanity god says to his prophet muhammad
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 76.18 89.20 <o,f0,male> whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets beginning with adam including noah including moses including abraham including jesus christ and ending with muhammad
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 90.06 101.81 <o,f0,male> that we have not sent you oh muhammad except as a raham except as a source of compassion to humanity and for us human beings and certainly for us as muslims
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 103.78 110.18 <o,f0,male> and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet is to make ourselves as much like the
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 111.23 123.82 <o,f0,male> and the prophet in one of his sayings said adorn yourselves with the attributes of god and because god himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 124.74 131.68 <o,f0,male> in fact the koran says that god decreed upon himself compassion or reigned himself in
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 141.35 150.46 <o,f0,male> of compassion actors of compassion and speakers of compassion and doers of compassion that is all well and good
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 151.57 163.49 <o,f0,male> but where do we go wrong and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world for the answer to this we turn to our spiritual path
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 164.76 171.07 <o,f0,male> in every religious tradition there is what you call the outer path and the inner path
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 172.13 175.28 <o,f0,male> or the exoteric path and the esoteric path
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 176.89 183.72 <o,f0,male> the esoteric path of islam is more popularly known as sufism or tasawwuf in arabic
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 184.75 194.87 <o,f0,male> and these doctors or these masters these spiritual masters of the sufi tradition refer to teachings and examples of our prophet
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 195.66 199.06 <o,f0,male> that teach us where the source of our problems lie
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 200.37 211.38 <o,f0,male> in one of the battles that the prophet waged he told his followers we are returning from the lesser war to the greater war to the greater battle
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 212.90 225.63 <o,f0,male> and they said messenger of god we are battle weary how can we go to a greater battle he said that is the battle of the self the battle of the ego
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 228.21 235.34 <o,f0,male> the sources of human problems have to do with egotism i
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 237.57 243.28 <o,f0,male> the famous sufi master rumi who is very well known to most of you
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 243.79 250.91 <o,f0,male> has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend and knocks on the door
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 252.22 263.75 <o,f0,male> and a voice answers who 's there it 's me or more grammatically correctly it is i as we might say in english the voice says go
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 266.43 279.00 <o,f0,male> after many years of training of disciplining of search and struggle he comes back and with much greater humility he knocks again on the door
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 280.07 288.70 <o,f0,male> the voice asks who is there he said it is you oh heartbreaker the door swings open
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 289.55 295.33 <o,f0,male> and the voice says come in for there is no room in this house for two
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 298.45 301.55 <o,f0,male> not these eyes for two egos
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 304.02 309.37 <o,f0,male> and rumi 's stories are metaphors for the spiritual path
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 310.81 315.94 <o,f0,male> in the presence of god there is no room for more than one
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 317.24 319.07 <o,f0,male> and that is the i of divinity
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 321.25 332.42 <o,f0,male> in a teaching called a hadith qudsi in our tradition god says that my servant or my creature my human creature does not approach me
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 335.56 339.27 <o,f0,male> that is dearer to me than what i have asked them to do
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 344.35 352.44 <o,f0,male> you want your employees to do what you ask them to do and if they've done that then they can do extra but don't ignore what you've asked them to do
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 353.66 356.77 <o,f0,male> and god says
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 356.97 364.52 <o,f0,male> my servant continues to get nearer to me by doing more of what i've asked them to do extra credit we might call
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 365.27 373.34 <o,f0,male> until i love him or love her and when i love my servant god says i become
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 374.20 377.12 <o,f0,male> by which he or she sees
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 378.04 382.29 <o,f0,male> the ears by which he or she listens
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 389.96 393.72 <o,f0,male> by which he or she walks and the heart
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 394.18 395.96 <o,f0,male> by which he or she
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 401.45 408.60 <o,f0,male> with divinity that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 410.26 414.21 <o,f0,male> muslims regard jesus as the master of
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 423.17 431.60 <o,f0,male> when he says i am the spirit and i am the way when the prophet muhammad said whoever has seen me has seen god
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 432.64 436.28 <o,f0,male> it is because they became so much an instrument
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 437.13 446.01 <o,f0,male> of god they became part of god 's steam so that god 's will was manifest through them and not acting from their own self
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 450.63 453.14 <o,f0,male> is given it is in us
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 454.55 462.12 <o,f0,male> all we have to do is to get our egos out of the way get our egotism out of the way
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 465.26 471.46 <o,f0,male> sure probably all of you here or certainly the very vast majority of you have had
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 471.71 480.72 <o,f0,male> what you might call a spiritual experience a moment in your lives when for a few seconds a minute perhaps
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 484.45 485.56 <o,f0,male> ego dissolved
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 497.21 510.88 <o,f0,male> of water one with every human being one with the creator and you felt in the presence of power of awe of the deepest love
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 523.34 532.13 <o,f0,male> a gift when for a moment he lifts that boundary which makes us insist on i i i me me me
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 533.85 539.76 <o,f0,male> and instead like the person in rumi 's story we say oh this is all
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 542.07 543.27 <o,f0,male> this is all you
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 544.13 545.08 <o,f0,male> and this is all us
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 547.57 548.57 <o,f0,male> us and i and
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 549.16 550.87 <o,f0,male> all part of you
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 551.90 559.22 <o,f0,male> all creator all the objective the source of our being and the end of our journey
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 560.01 563.25 <o,f0,male> you are also the breaker of our hearts
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 564.40 574.72 <o,f0,male> you are the one whom we should all be towards for whose purpose we live and for whose purpose we shall die and for
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 576.15 587.09 <o,f0,male> shall be resurrected again to account to god to what extent we have been compassionate beings our message today
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 588.09 597.56 <o,f0,male> and our purpose today and those of you who are here today and the purpose of this charter of compassion is to remind for the
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 599.17 608.24 <o,f0,male> always urges us to remember to remind each other because the knowledge of truth
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 609.66 611.23 <o,f0,male> is within every human being
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 622.58 630.68 <o,f0,male> through our subconscious in your dreams which the koran calls our
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 631.14 633.13 <o,f0,male> state of sleep the lesser death
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 638.88 646.02 <o,f0,male> in our state of sleep we have dreams we have visions we travel
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 646.16 648.40 <o,f0,male> even outside of our bodies for many of us
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 649.76 660.96 <o,f0,male> and we see wonderful things we travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it and beyond the limitations of time as we know it
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 663.26 664.46 <o,f0,male> is for us to
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 668.74 670.13 <o,f0,male> the name of the creator
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 671.84 675.88 <o,f0,male> whose primary name is the compassionating the compassionate
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 679.66 686.06 <o,f0,male> whatever name you want to call him with allah ram om whatever the name might be
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 686.99 688.98 <o,f0,male> through which you name or access
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 689.51 691.04 <o,f0,male> the presence of divinity
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 691.91 693.09 <o,f0,male> is the locus
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 701.78 708.57 <o,f0,male> and absolute knowledge and wisdom what hindus call satchidananda the language differs
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 711.17 712.65 <o,f0,male> but the objective is the same
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 714.44 716.55 <o,f0,male> rumi has another story
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 716.96 719.06 <o,f0,male> about three a turk an arab
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 728.90 736.25 <o,f0,male> one is asking for grapes and they have a fight and an argument because i want grapes i want eneb i want
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 738.30 740.92 <o,f0,male> not knowing that the word that they're using
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 741.68 748.10 <o,f0,male> the same reality in different languages there's only one absolute reality by definition
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 750.23 755.88 <o,f0,male> one absolute being by definition because absolute is by definition single
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 756.48 758.31 <o,f0,male> and absolute and singular
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 760.60 770.21 <o,f0,male> absolute concentration of being the absolute concentration of consciousness awareness an absolute locus
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 775.99 778.86 <o,f0,male> that defines the primary attributes of divinity
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 780.24 785.98 <o,f0,male> and that should also be the primary attributes of what it means to be human
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 788.62 792.91 <o,f0,male> for what defines humanity perhaps biologically
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 793.99 795.28 <o,f0,male> is our physiology
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 804.82 811.58 <o,f0,male> the koran says he speaks to the angels and says when i have finished the formation of adam from
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 812.91 821.90 <o,f0,male> and breathed into him of my spirit then fall in prostration to him the angels
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 823.71 826.69 <o,f0,male> prostrate not before the human body
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 828.74 836.52 <o,f0,male> but before the human soul why because the soul the human soul embodies
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 838.48 840.52 <o,f0,male> a piece of the divine breath
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 841.68 843.46 <o,f0,male> a piece of the divine soul
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 845.83 850.41 <o,f0,male> this is also expressed in biblical vocabulary when we
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 851.32 854.63 <o,f0,male> we were created in the divine image
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 855.63 857.25 <o,f0,male> what is the imagery of god
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 858.11 866.08 <o,f0,male> the imagery of god is absolute being absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom and absolute compassion
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 867.79 870.82 <o,f0,male> and love and therefore for us to be human
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 871.87 879.50 <o,f0,male> in the greatest sense of what it means to be human in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human means that we
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 881.81 883.74 <o,f0,male> have to be proper stewards
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 884.97 886.83 <o,f0,male> of the breath of divinity within us
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 888.68 894.54 <o,f0,male> and to seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being of being alive
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 896.35 900.72 <o,f0,male> the attribute of wisdom of consciousness of awareness
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 901.59 907.41 <o,f0,male> and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings this
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 908.85 911.21 <o,f0,male> is what i understand from my faith
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 912.68 918.12 <o,f0,male> and this is what i understand from my studies of other faith traditions
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 919.32 921.85 <o,f0,male> and this is the common platform
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 922.55 929.42 <o,f0,male> on which we must all stand and when we stand on this platform as such i am convinced
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 929.79 939.42 <o,f0,male> that we can make a wonderful world and i believe personally that we're on the verge
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 940.66 946.29 <o,f0,male> and that with the presence and help of people like you here we can bring about
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 948.42 957.09 <o,f0,male> the prophecy of isiah for he foretold of a period when people shall transform
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 958.01 959.76 <o,f0,male> their swords into plowshares
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 961.47 967.05 <o,f0,male> and will not learn war and make war anymore
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 979.51 980.34 <o,f0,male> lower our
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 994.15 997.84 <o,f0,male> and let all be for the glorification of the one
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 998.84 1000.47 <o,f0,male> thank you and god bless
