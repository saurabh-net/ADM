AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 14.12 20.90 <o,f0,male> you today about hopefully converting fear into hope when we go to the physician
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 21.25 28.08 <o,f0,male> today when we go to the doctor 's office and we walk in there are words that we just don't want to hear there are words that we're truly afraid
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 42.10 54.65 <o,f0,male> what i want to lay out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease why it's important why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down if you think it already
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 55.88 62.47 <o,f0,male> and where we are clinically today and where we might go tomorrow and what some of the hurdles are and we're going to do all of that in eighteen minutes
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 63.65 72.46 <o,f0,male> i want to start with this slide because this slide sort of tells the story the way science magazine thinks of it this was an issue from two thousand and two
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 72.79 82.59 <o,f0,male> that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human it was basically a regenerative medicine issue regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 83.68 91.24 <o,f0,male> that everybody can understand it's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself to a clinically relevant
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 92.88 103.22 <o,f0,male> so we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there we know that if we have a damaged hip you can put an artificial hip in and this is the idea that science magazine used on their front cover
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 103.96 117.51 <o,f0,male> this is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine this is not regenerative medicine regenerative medicine is what business week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago the idea
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 117.83 126.08 <o,f0,male> is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms with devices and drugs and the like and i'll come back to that theme a few times
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 126.53 136.49 <o,f0,male> instead of doing that we will regenerate lost function of the body by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue so that at the end of the treatment you are the same
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 136.82 138.37 <o,f0,male> as you were at the beginning of the
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 143.57 151.13 <o,f0,male> this is a good idea very few good ideas are truly novel and this is just the same if you look back in history
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 151.64 160.49 <o,f0,male> charles lindbergh who was better known for flying airplanes was actually one of the first people along with alexis carrel one of the nobel laureates from rockefeller
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 173.99 184.63 <o,f0,male> we've come a long way since then i'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that's going on but before doing that what i'd like to do is share my depression about the health care system and the need for this with you
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 185.13 192.01 <o,f0,male> many of the talks yesterday talked about improving the quality of life and reducing poverty and essentially
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 213.07 223.67 <o,f0,male> and you can basically see that the richer a country is the older the people are within it why is this important and why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 224.23 233.23 <o,f0,male> if the average age of your population is thirty then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a broken ankle every now and again maybe a little bit of
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 233.83 243.29 <o,f0,male> if the average age in your country is forty five to fifty five now the average person is looking at diabetes early onset diabetes heart failure coronary artery disease
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 256.06 263.41 <o,f0,male> workers per retiree forty one people who were basically outside of being really sick paying for
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 263.70 276.59 <o,f0,male> the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease in two thousand and ten two workers per retiree in the u s and this is matched in every industrialized wealthy country in the world
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 277.61 279.36 <o,f0,male> how can you actually afford
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 280.14 289.82 <o,f0,male> to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this this is age versus cost of health care and you can see that right around
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 290.70 294.68 <o,f0,male> age forty five forty to forty five there's a sudden spike
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 295.14 300.50 <o,f0,male> in the cost of health care it's actually quite interesting if you do the right studies
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 300.77 310.93 <o,f0,male> you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care plotted over your lifetime and about seven years before you're about to die there's a spike and you can actually
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 313.15 314.75 <o,f0,male> we won 't get into that
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 318.93 332.39 <o,f0,male> there are very few things very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases and experience what i would call healthy aging
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 332.80 343.52 <o,f0,male> i'd suggest there are four things and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system all those things do is change who pays they don't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 344.80 355.36 <o,f0,male> one thing you can do is not treat you can ration health care we won 't talk about that anymore it's too depressing you can prevent obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 355.85 364.76 <o,f0,male> but perhaps most interesting to me anyway and most important is the idea of diagnosing a
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 365.00 371.19 <o,f0,male> and then treating the disease to cure the disease instead of treating a symptom think of it in terms of
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 380.52 387.68 <o,f0,male> ten twenty thirty forty years and we do ok insulin 's a pretty good therapy but eventually it stops working
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 388.11 394.88 <o,f0,male> and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 395.63 403.68 <o,f0,male> why couldn't we just inject the pancreas with something to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease perhaps even before it was symptomatic
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 404.11 412.15 <o,f0,male> and it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it but if it worked we would truly be able to do something different this video
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 412.39 419.55 <o,f0,male> i think gets across the concept that i'm talking about quite dramatically this is a newt re growing its limb
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 420.11 428.15 <o,f0,male> if a newt can do this kind of thing why can't we i'll actually show you some more important features about limb regeneration in a moment
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 428.67 434.62 <o,f0,male> but what we're talking about in regenerative medicine is doing this in every organ system of the body
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 436.10 439.80 <o,f0,male> tissues and for organs themselves
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 441.45 450.21 <o,f0,male> so today 's reality is that if we get sick the message is we will treat your symptoms and you need to adjust to a new way of life
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 450.54 459.68 <o,f0,male> i would pose to you that tomorrow and when tomorrow is we could debate but it's within the foreseeable future we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 460.33 469.82 <o,f0,male> a limb prosthetic up here similar actually to the one that the soldier that's come back from iraq there are three hundred and seventy soldiers that have come back from iraq that have lost limbs
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 470.55 481.78 <o,f0,male> imagine if instead of facing that they could actually face the regeneration of that limb it's a wild concept i'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 482.76 491.74 <o,f0,male> but it's applicable again to every organ system how can we do that the way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body we need to learn to speak the body 's language
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 492.23 503.46 <o,f0,male> and to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus a mammalian fetus if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy will re grow that
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 505.01 516.99 <o,f0,male> so our dna has the capacity to do these kinds of wound healing mechanisms it's a natural process but it is lost as we age in a child
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 526.25 535.82 <o,f0,male> so to engage in that conversation with the body we need to speak the body 's language and there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 536.22 545.51 <o,f0,male> i'm going to give you an example of three of these tools through which to converse with the body the first is cellular therapies clearly
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 546.02 555.93 <o,f0,male> we heal ourselves in a natural process using cells to do most of the work therefore if we can find the right cells and implant them in the body they may do the healing
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 567.83 578.22 <o,f0,male> then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself and finally we may be able to use smart devices that will offload the work of the body and allow it to
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 592.79 598.91 <o,f0,male> if you threw away all the cells and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 599.23 607.41 <o,f0,male> may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself and he asked a very important question he asked the question
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 607.74 617.45 <o,f0,male> if i take that material which is a natural material that usually induces healing in the small intestine and i place it somewhere else on a person 's body
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 617.73 631.41 <o,f0,male> would it give a tissue specific response or would it make small intestine if i tried to make a new ear i wouldn't be telling you this story if it wasn't compelling the picture i'm about to show you
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 633.26 634.93 <o,f0,male> is a compelling picture
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 635.74 649.80 <o,f0,male> however for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends the lights are down this is a good time to look at your feet check your blackberry do anything other than look at the screen what i'm about to show you
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 654.96 664.57 <o,f0,male> is a diabetic ulcer and although it's good to laugh before we look at this this is the reality of diabetes i think a lot of times we hear about diabetics diabetic ulcers
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 664.93 674.27 <o,f0,male> we just don't connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment which is amputation if you can't heal it so i'm going to put the slide up now it won 't be up for long
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 674.74 687.66 <o,f0,male> this is a diabetic ulcer it's tragic the treatment for this is amputation this is an older lady she has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes and has decided to die with what s left of her body intact
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 688.17 696.50 <o,f0,male> and this lady decided after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer that she would try this new therapy that steve invented
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 696.85 702.86 <o,f0,male> that's what the wound looked like eleven weeks later that material contained only natural signals
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 703.37 714.22 <o,f0,male> and that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response that it didn't have before there's going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you i'll let you know when you can look again
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 714.77 728.61 <o,f0,male> this is a horse the horse is not in pain if the horse was in pain i wouldn't show you this slide the horse just has another nostril that's developed because of a riding accident just a few weeks after treatment in this case taking that material turning it into a gel
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 728.98 736.65 <o,f0,male> and packing that area and then repeating the treatment a few times and the horse heals up and if you took an ultrasound of that area it would look great
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 737.03 745.35 <o,f0,male> a dolphin where the fin 's been re attached there are now four hundred thousand patients around the world who have used that material to heal their
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 746.42 758.15 <o,f0,male> could you regenerate a limb darpa just gave steve fifteen million dollars to lead an eight institution project to begin the process of asking that question and i'll show you the fifteen million dollar picture
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 758.63 767.67 <o,f0,male> this is a seventy eight year old man who 's lost the end of his fingertip remember that i mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips after treatment that's what it looks like
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 769.49 782.72 <o,f0,male> this is happening today this is clinically relevant today there are materials which do this there are the heart patches but could you go a little further could you say instead of using material can i take some cells along with the material
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 783.10 791.61 <o,f0,male> and remove a damaged piece of tissue put a bio degradable material on there you can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish this was done by
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 805.14 806.43 <o,f0,male> now i'm going to show you cell based
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 808.36 816.48 <o,f0,male> to show you here is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient again if you're squeamish you don't want to watch but this one 's kind of cool
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 818.23 823.23 <o,f0,male> this is a bypass operation just like what al gore had with a
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 823.92 833.62 <o,f0,male> in this case at the end of the bypass operation you're going to see the stem cells from the patient that were removed at the beginning of the procedure being injected directly into the heart of the patient
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 834.11 837.09 <o,f0,male> and i'm standing up here because at one point i'm going to show you
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 837.52 849.08 <o,f0,male> just how early this technology is here go the stem cells right into the beating heart of the patient and if you look really carefully it's going to be right around this point you'll actually see a back flush you see the cells coming back out
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 850.97 857.97 <o,f0,male> we need all sorts of new technology new devices to get the cells to the right place at the right time
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 858.32 865.59 <o,f0,male> just a little bit of data a tiny bit of data this was a randomized trial at this time this was an n of twenty now there's an n of about one hundred
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 876.71 878.78 <o,f0,male> these are now two years out
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 880.36 883.78 <o,f0,male> the coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 884.52 891.26 <o,f0,male> and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state this is the same procedure but now done minimally invasively
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 891.48 900.14 <o,f0,male> with only three holes in the body where they're taking the heart and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure there go the cells we don't have time to
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 900.47 911.51 <o,f0,male> go into all of those details but basically that works too you can take patients who are less sick and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 912.13 918.70 <o,f0,male> through that kind of therapy here 's another example of stem cell therapy that isn't quite clinical yet but i think very soon will be
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 930.35 944.74 <o,f0,male> it's a great source of stem cells stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid so you could go in you could get your tummy tuck out comes the liposuction fluid and in this case the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 945.17 954.25 <o,f0,male> all done in the lab and i think fairly soon you will see patients being treated with their own fat derived or adipose derived stem cells
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 954.90 962.76 <o,f0,male> i talked before about the use of devices to dramatically change the way we treat disease here 's just one example before i close up this is equally tragic we
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 963.55 972.75 <o,f0,male> very abiding and heartbreaking partnership with our colleagues at the institute for surgical research in the us army who have to treat the now eleven thousand
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 973.10 980.85 <o,f0,male> kids that have come back from iraq many of those patients are very severely burned and if there's anything that's been learned about burn it's that we don't know how to treat it
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 981.71 992.09 <o,f0,male> everything that is done to treat burn basically we do a sodding approach we make something over here and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound and we try and get the two to take
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 992.49 1001.26 <o,f0,male> in this case here a new wearable bio reactor has been designed it should be tested clinically later this year at isr by joerg gerlach in pittsburgh
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 1001.78 1008.22 <o,f0,male> and that bio reactor will lay down in the wound bed the gun that you see there sprays cells
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 1008.47 1017.93 <o,f0,male> that's going to spray cells over that area the reactor will serve to fertilize the environment deliver other things as well at the same time and therefore we will
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 1018.99 1024.70 <o,f0,male> that lawn as opposed to try the sodding approach it's a completely different way of doing it
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 1025.97 1033.60 <o,f0,male> so my eighteen minutes is up so let me finish up with some good news and maybe a little bit of bad news the good news
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 1033.89 1042.76 <o,f0,male> is that this is happening today it's very powerful work clearly the images kind of get that across it's incredibly difficult because it's highly inter disciplinary
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 1050.03 1059.90 <o,f0,male> a number of governments and a number of regions have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease the japanese government were perhaps the first when they decided to invest first three billion
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 1076.75 1089.95 <o,f0,male> european union same thing china the same thing china just launched a national tissue engineering center the first year budget was two hundred and fifty million us dollars in the united states we've had a somewhat different approach we
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 1095.14 1105.24 <o,f0,male> and be in the real world as president we've had a different approach and the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along but there's been no strategic investment
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 1105.77 1118.63 <o,f0,male> to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way and i'm going to finish up with a quote maybe a little cheap shot at the director of the nih who 's a very charming man
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 1130.34 1137.67 <o,f0,male> to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece of that twenty seven point five billion dollars
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 1138.28 1146.84 <o,f0,male> get next year and focus it in a strategic way to make sure we can accelerate the pace at which these things get to patients
AlanRussell_2006 1 AlanRussell_2006 1147.39 1160.06 <o,f0,male> and at the end of a very testy meeting what the nih director said is your vision is larger than our appetite i'd like to close by saying that no one 's going to change our vision but together we can change his appetite thank
