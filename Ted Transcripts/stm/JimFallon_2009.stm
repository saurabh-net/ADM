JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 37.19 45.95 <o,f0,male> i got into something else just recently and it all grew out of one of my colleagues asking me to analyze a bunch of brains of psychopathic killers
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 46.58 56.31 <o,f0,male> and so this would be the typical talk i would give and the question is how do you end up with a psychopathic killer what i mean by psychopathic killer are these people these types of people
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 69.56 82.99 <o,f0,male> so we look at these sorts of things theoretically on the basis of genetics and brain damage and interaction with environment and exactly how that machine works so we're interested in exactly where in the brain and what's the most important
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 83.29 94.14 <o,f0,male> part of the brain so we've been looking at this the interaction of genes what's called epigenetic effects brain damage and environment and how these are tied
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 94.54 106.68 <o,f0,male> and how you end up with a psychopath and a killer depends on exactly when the damage occurs it's really a very precisely timed thing you get different kinds of psychopaths so we're going along with this and here 's just to give you the
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 117.94 126.91 <o,f0,male> and also the interior part of the temporal lobe so there is the pattern that every one of them had but they all were a little different too they had other sorts of brain damage a key thing is
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 127.86 135.40 <o,f0,male> the major violence genes like the mao a gene and there is a variant of this gene that
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 135.62 145.21 <o,f0,male> is in the normal population some of you have this and it's sex linked it's on the x chromosome and so in this way you can only get it from your mother
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 145.90 152.81 <o,f0,male> and in fact this is probably why mostly men are psychopathic killers or are very aggressive
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 154.21 160.53 <o,f0,male> daughter can get one x from the father one x from the mother it's kind of diluted out but for a son he can only get
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 176.63 183.96 <o,f0,male> utero your brain is bathed in this so your whole brain becomes insensitive to serotonin so it doesn't work later on
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 184.89 197.74 <o,f0,male> and i'd given this one talk in israel just this past year and it does have some consequences theoretically what this means is that in order to express this gene in a violent way
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 198.20 212.67 <o,f0,male> very early on before puberty you have to be involved in something that is really traumatic not a little stress not being spanked or something but really seeing violence or being involved in it in three d right that's how the mirror neuron system works and so
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 213.18 222.34 <o,f0,male> if you have that gene and you see a lot of violence in a certain situation this is the recipe for disaster absolute disaster
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 222.94 230.90 <o,f0,male> and what i think might happen in these areas of the world where we have constant violence you end up having generations of kids
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 231.35 245.07 <o,f0,male> that are seeing all this violence and if i was a young girl somewhere in a violent area you know a fourteen year old and i want to find a mate i'd find some tough guy right to protect me well what the problem is this tends to concentrate these genes
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 245.71 254.42 <o,f0,male> and now the boys and the girls get them so i think after several generations and here is the idea we really have a tinder box so that was the idea but then
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 254.58 263.93 <o,f0,male> my mother said to me i hear you've been going around talking about psychopathic killers and you're talking as if you come from a normal family i said what the hell are you talking about
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 264.70 273.07 <o,f0,male> she then told me about our own family tree now she blamed this on my father 's side of course this was one of these cases because she has no violence in her background
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 285.70 289.99 <o,f0,male> now i said okay so what we have
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 301.98 310.80 <o,f0,male> okay so that's the first case of matricide and that book is very interesting because it's about witch trials and how people thought back then but it doesn't stop there
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 312.25 320.34 <o,f0,male> seven more men on my father 's side starting then cornells that were all murderers okay now this
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 323.70 325.40 <o,f0,male> my father himself
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 325.59 335.61 <o,f0,male> my three uncles in world war ii were all conscientious objectors all pussycats but every once in a while like lizzie borden like three times a century and we're kind of due so
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 338.08 341.43 <o,f0,male> the moral of the story is people in glass houses shouldn 't throw stones but
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 341.73 343.82 <o,f0,male> more likely is this
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 351.45 360.64 <o,f0,male> and they all seemed to be ok but our grandkids are going to be kind of concerned here so what we've done is i've started to do pet scans of everybody in the family
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 363.04 371.24 <o,f0,male> pet scans eegs and genetic analysis to see where the bad news is now the only person it turns out one son and one
