PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 21.67 31.58 <o,f0,male> of whales and dolphins since we are such a visual species it's hard for us to really understand this so i'll use a mixture of figures and sounds and hope this can communicate it
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 31.85 45.42 <o,f0,male> but let 's also think as a visual species what it's like when we go snorkeling or diving and try to look underwater we really can't see very far our vision which works so well in air all of a sudden is very restricted and claustrophobic
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 45.90 54.15 <o,f0,male> and what marine mammals have evolved over the last tens of millions of years is ways to depend on sound to both explore their world
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 54.42 69.22 <o,f0,male> and also to stay in touch with one another dolphins and toothed whales use echolocation they can produce loud clicks and listen for echos from the sea floor in order to orient they can listen for echos from prey in order to decide where food is and to decide which one they want to eat
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 69.72 83.38 <o,f0,male> all marine mammals use sound for communication to stay in touch so the large baleen whales will produce long beautiful songs which are used in reproductive advertisement for male and females both to find one another and to select a mate
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 83.72 96.28 <o,f0,male> and mother and young and closely bonded animals use calls to stay in touch with one another so sound is really critical for their lives the first thing that got me interested in the sounds of these underwater animals whose world was so foreign to me
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 96.64 105.00 <o,f0,male> was evidence from captive dolphins that captive dolphins could imitate human sounds and i mentioned i'll use some visual representations of sounds
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 115.74 121.39 <o,f0,male> this is a picture of a trainer 's whistle a whistle a trainer will blow to tell a dolphin it's done the right thing and can
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 121.96 129.34 <o,f0,male> a fish it sounds sort of like tweeeeeet like that and this is a calf in captivity making an imitation
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 129.54 138.39 <o,f0,male> of that trainer 's whistle now if you hummed this tune to your dog or cat and it hummed it back to you you ought to be pretty surprised very few
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 160.23 167.85 <o,f0,male> so let 's start with calls of a nonhuman primate many mammals have to produce contact calls when say a mother and calf
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 168.14 175.93 <o,f0,male> are apart this is an example of a call produced by squirrel monkeys when they're isolated from another one and you can see there's not much variability
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 176.20 184.32 <o,f0,male> in these calls by contrast the signature whistle which dolphins use to stay in touch each individual here has a radically different call
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 193.68 205.24 <o,f0,male> the setting in which animals need to use this call well let 's look at mothers and calves in normal life for mother and calf dolphin they'll often drift apart or swim apart if mom is chasing a fish and when they separate
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 205.58 218.82 <o,f0,male> they have to get back together again and what this figure shows is the percentage of the separations in which dolphins whistle against the maximum distance so when dolphins are separated by less than twenty meters less than half the time they need to use whistle
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 219.20 229.95 <o,f0,male> most of the time they can just find each other just by swimming around but all of the time when they separate by more than one hundred meters they need to use these individually distinctive whistles to come back together again
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 231.59 241.13 <o,f0,male> most of these distinctive signature whistles are quite stereotyped and stable through the life of a dolphin but there are some exceptions when a male dolphin leaves mom
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 241.48 249.50 <o,f0,male> it will often join up with another male and form an alliance which may last for decades and as these two animals form a social bond
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 259.29 264.18 <o,f0,male> like woop woop woop they both have that kind of up sweep whereas members of a pair go
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 266.33 277.55 <o,f0,male> and what's happened is they've used this learning process to develop a new sign that identifies this new social group it's a very interesting way that they can form a new identifier for the new social group that
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 295.39 309.31 <o,f0,male> but it turns out that when just a single boat is approaching a group of dolphins at a couple hundred meters away the dolphins will start whistling they'll change what they're doing they'll have a more cohesive group wait for the boat to go by and then they'll get back to normal business
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 309.64 317.79 <o,f0,male> well in a place like sarasota florida the average interval between times that a boat is passing within a hundred meters of a dolphin group is six minutes
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 318.17 324.98 <o,f0,male> so even in the situation that doesn't look as bad as this it's still affecting the amount of time these animals have to do their normal work
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 334.34 342.38 <o,f0,male> before there were dolphin watching boats when there was one boat not much of an impact and two boats when the second boat was added
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 342.61 351.71 <o,f0,male> what happened was that some of the dolphins left the area completely and of the ones that stayed their reproductive rate declined so it it could have a negative impact on the whole population
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 368.61 381.79 <o,f0,male> also like to point out that sound doesn't obey boundaries so you can draw a line to try to protect an area but chemical pollution and noise pollution will continue to move through the area and i'd like to switch now from this local
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 382.49 392.09 <o,f0,male> familiar coastal environment to the much broader world of the baleen whales and the open ocean this is a kind of map we've all been looking at the world is mostly blue
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 426.60 434.29 <o,f0,male> so we live in a world of satellite communication are used to global communication but it's still amazing to me the ocean has properties
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 434.85 443.35 <o,f0,male> low frequency sound to basically move globally the acoustic transit time for each of these paths is about three hours it's nearly halfway around the globe
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 445.04 447.46 <o,f0,male> now in the early seventies roger payne
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 447.54 457.77 <o,f0,male> and an ocean acoustician published a theoretical paper pointing out that it was possible that sound could transmit over these large areas but very few biologists believed
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 458.45 468.39 <o,f0,male> it actually turns out though even though we've only known of long range propagation for a few decades the whales clearly have evolved over tens of millions of years
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 468.67 479.49 <o,f0,male> a way to exploit this amazing property of the ocean so blue whales and fin whales produce very low frequency sounds that can travel over very long ranges and the top plot here shows
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 479.79 493.61 <o,f0,male> a complicated series of calls that are repeated by males they form songs and they appear to play a role in reproduction sort of like that of song birds down below here we see calls made by both males and females that also carry over very long ranges
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 495.55 503.27 <o,f0,male> the biologists continued to be skeptical of the long range communication issue well past the seventies until the end of the cold war
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 503.65 510.98 <o,f0,male> what happened was during the cold war the u s navy had a system that was secret at the time that they used to track russian submarines
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 511.26 519.09 <o,f0,male> it had deep underwater microphones or hydrophones cabled to shore all wired back to a central place that could listen to sounds over the whole north atlantic
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 519.47 531.73 <o,f0,male> and after the berlin wall fell the navy made these systems available to whale bio acousticians to see what they could hear this is a plot from christopher clark who tracked one individual blue whale
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 542.52 553.83 <o,f0,male> this shows us both that the calls are detectable over hundreds of miles and that whales routinely swim hundreds of miles they're ocean based and scale animals who are communicating over much longer ranges than we had anticipated
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 554.58 561.14 <o,f0,male> unlike fins and blues which disperse into the temperate and tropical oceans the humpbacked whales congregate
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 561.41 570.38 <o,f0,male> in local traditional breeding grounds and so they can make a sound that's a little higher in frequency broader band and more complicated so you're listening the complicated
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 570.73 573.90 <o,f0,male> song produced by humpbacks here and humpbacks when
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 584.91 591.29 <o,f0,male> this means that humpback song is a form of animal culture just like music for humans would be
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 605.67 614.27 <o,f0,male> in ninety five they all sang the normal song but in ninety six they heard a few weird songs and it turned out that these strange songs were typical of west coast whales
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 656.16 665.18 <o,f0,male> shown down here you only hear the low frequencies you hear the reverberation as the sound travels over long range in the ocean and is not quite as loud
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 667.87 672.17 <o,f0,male> back these humpback calls i'll play blue whale calls but they have to be sped up
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 672.75 683.56 <o,f0,male> so low in frequency that you wouldn't be able to hear it otherwise here 's a blue whale call at fifty miles which was distant for the humpback it's loud clear you can hear it very clearly
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 685.36 693.22 <o,f0,female> from a hydrophone five hundred miles away there's a lot of noise which is mostly other whales but you
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 695.41 697.68 <o,f0,male> let 's now switch and think about a potential for
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 707.55 712.97 <o,f0,male> imagine that whale listening from five hundred miles there's a potential problem that maybe this kind of
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 714.45 721.83 <o,f0,male> whales from being able to hear each other now this is something that's been known for quite a while this is a figure from a textbook on underwater sound
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 722.09 734.31 <o,f0,male> and on the y axis is the loudness of average ambient noise in the deep ocean by frequency and in the low frequencies this line indicates sound that comes from seismic activity of the earth
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 734.71 744.08 <o,f0,male> up high these variable lines indicate increasing noise in this frequency range from higher wind and wave but right in the middle here where there's a sweet spot
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 744.39 751.23 <o,f0,male> the noise is dominated by human ships now think about it this is an amazing thing that in this frequency range where whales communicate
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 751.52 759.90 <o,f0,male> the main source globally on our planet for the noise comes from human ships thousands of human ships distant far away just all
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 761.84 772.18 <o,f0,male> the next slide will show what the impact this may have on the range at which whales can communicate so here you have the loudness of a call at the whale and as we get farther away the sound gets fainter and
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 773.30 781.93 <o,f0,male> now in the pre industrial ocean as we were mentioning this whale call could be easily detected it's louder than noise at a range of a thousand kilometers
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 782.50 792.22 <o,f0,male> let 's now take that additional increase in noise that we saw comes from shipping all of a sudden the effective range of communication goes from a thousand kilometers to ten
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 792.88 801.68 <o,f0,male> if this signal is used for males and females to find each other for mating and they're dispersed imagine the impact this could have on the recovery of endangered populations
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 803.28 812.11 <o,f0,male> also have contact calls like i described for the dolphins i'll play the sound of a contact call used by right whales to stay in touch and
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 826.30 835.30 <o,f0,male> one strategy is if your call 's down here and the noise is in this band you could shift the frequency of your call out of the noise band and communicate better
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 835.91 847.09 <o,f0,male> susan parks of penn state has actually studied this she's looked in the atlantic here 's data from the south atlantic here 's a typical south atlantic contact call from the seventies look what happened by two thousand to the average call
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 847.70 861.40 <o,f0,male> same thing in the north atlantic in the fifties versus two thousand over the last fifty years as we've put more noise into the oceans these whales have had to shift it's as if the whole population had to shift from being basses to singing as a tenor
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 862.30 870.66 <o,f0,male> it's an amazing shift induced by humans over this large scale in both time and space and we now know that whales can compensate for noise
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 870.84 877.96 <o,f0,male> by calling louder like i did when that ship was playing by waiting for silence and by shifting their call out of the noise band
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 878.26 890.91 <o,f0,male> now there's probably costs to calling louder or shifting the frequency away from where you want to be and there's probably lost opportunities if we also have to wait for silence they may miss a critical opportunity to communicate so we have to be very concerned
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 891.45 903.07 <o,f0,male> about when the noise in habitats degrades the habitat enough that the animals either have to pay too much to be able to communicate or are not able to perform critical functions it's a really important problem
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 903.45 911.22 <o,f0,male> and i'm happy to say that there are several very promising developments in this area looking at the impact of shipping on whales
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 911.59 923.54 <o,f0,male> in terms of the shipping noise the international maritime organization of the united nations has formed a group whose job is to establish guidelines for quieting ships to tell the industry how you could quiet ships
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 923.88 931.17 <o,f0,male> and they've already found that by being more intelligent about better propeller design you can reduce that noise by ninety percent
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 931.47 938.88 <o,f0,male> if you actually insulate and isolate the machinery of the ship from the hull you can reduce that noise by ninety nine percent
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 939.18 950.90 <o,f0,male> so at this point it's primarily an issue of cost and standards if this group can establish standards and if the shipbuilding industry adopts them for building their ships we can now see a gradual decline in this potential problem
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 973.65 984.54 <o,f0,male> the first case comes from the bay of fundy and these black lines mark shipping lanes in and out of the bay of fundy and the colorize area shows the risk of collision for endangered right whales
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 985.00 995.46 <o,f0,male> because of the ships moving in this lane it turns out that this lane here goes right through a major feeding area of right whales in the summer time and it makes an area of a significant risk of collision
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 995.82 1005.83 <o,f0,male> well biologists who couldn't take no for an answer went to the international maritime organization and petitioned them to say can 't you move that lane those are just lines on the ground
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 1006.16 1013.60 <o,f0,male> can't you move them over to a place where there's less of a risk and the international maritime organization responded very strongly these are the new lanes
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 1013.98 1024.03 <o,f0,male> the shipping lanes have been moved and as you can see the risk of collision is much lower so it's very promising actually and we can be very creative about thinking of different ways to reduce these risks
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 1024.46 1036.88 <o,f0,male> another action which was just taken independently by a shipping company itself was initiated because of concerns the shipping company had about greenhouse gas emissions with global warming the maersk line
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 1037.23 1045.03 <o,f0,male> looked at their competition and saw that everybody in shipping thinks time is money they rush as fast as they can to get to their port but then they often wait there
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 1045.39 1054.62 <o,f0,male> what maersk did is they worked ways to slow down they could slow down by about fifty percent this reduced their fuel consumption by about thirty percent which saved them money
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 1054.96 1062.84 <o,f0,male> and at the same time it had a significant benefit for whales it you slow down you reduce the amount of noise you make and you reduce the risk of collision
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 1063.24 1073.03 <o,f0,male> so to conclude i'd just like to point out you know the whales live in an amazing acoustic environment they've evolved over tens of millions of years to take advantage of
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 1073.69 1082.74 <o,f0,male> and we need to be very attentive and vigilant to thinking about where things that we do may unintentionally prevent them from being able to achieve their important activities
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 1089.94 1098.79 <o,f0,male> have shown some of the different directions that we can take in addition to protected areas to be able to keep the ocean safe for whales to be able to continue to communicate thank you very much
