IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 461.26 468.15 <o,f0,female> we can call this place in congo a death camp because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation

IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 572.28 583.79 <o,f0,female> catholic and conservative family no wonder that by age five i was a raging feminist although the term had not reached chile yet so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 587.33 589.76 <o,f0,female> there was a high price to pay for my freedom
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 589.92 597.62 <o,f0,female> and for questioning the patriarchy but i was happy to pay it because for every blow that i received i was able to deliver two
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 599.45 605.72 <o,f0,female> once when my daughter paula was in her twenties she said to me that feminism was dated that i should move on
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 606.61 608.35 <o,f0,female> we had a memorable fight
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 611.86 619.22 <o,f0,female> for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 619.99 628.32 <o,f0,female> forced into premature marriage prostitution forced labor they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 628.90 638.86 <o,f0,female> they have no control over their bodies or their lives they have no education and no freedom they are raped beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 639.68 644.25 <o,f0,female> for most western young women of today being called a feminist is an insult
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 656.53 660.01 <o,f0,female> by no means it has evolved if you don't like the term
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 665.10 666.27 <o,f0,female> or whatever you want
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 676.55 682.08 <o,f0,female> the place is a small women 's clinic in a village in bangladesh the year is two thousand and
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 683.42 690.85 <o,f0,female> jenny is a young american dental hygienist who has gone to the clinic as a volunteer during her three week vacation
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 691.28 700.60 <o,f0,female> she's prepared to clean teeth but when she gets there she finds out that there are no doctors no dentists and the clinic is just a hut full of flies
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 707.65 716.65 <o,f0,female> patient is in excruciating pain because she has several rotten molars jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 717.47 721.52 <o,f0,female> not licensed for that she has never done it she risks a lot and
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 730.34 731.82 <o,f0,female> jenny has a brave
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 742.03 744.84 <o,f0,female> that day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 746.07 752.43 <o,f0,female> the next morning when she comes again to the so called clinic her first patient is waiting for her with her
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 753.97 759.69 <o,f0,female> the woman 's face looks like a watermelon it is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 760.22 763.37 <o,f0,female> the husband furious threatens to kill the american
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 764.34 766.73 <o,f0,female> jenny is horrified at what she has done
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 767.60 774.14 <o,f0,female> but then the translator explains that the patient 's condition has nothing to do with the operation
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 774.72 775.78 <o,f0,female> the day before
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 777.22 781.53 <o,f0,female> up because she was not home in time to prepare dinner for him
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 785.92 787.89 <o,f0,female> they are the poorest of the poor
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 788.77 800.18 <o,f0,female> although women do two thirds of the world 's labor they own less than one percent of the world 's assets they are paid less than men for the same work if they're paid at all
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 800.60 808.40 <o,f0,female> and they remain vulnerable because they have no economic independence and they are constantly threatened by exploitation violence and abuse
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 810.60 818.48 <o,f0,female> that giving women education work the ability to control their own income inherit and own property benefits the society
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 818.92 827.91 <o,f0,female> if a woman is empowered her children and her family will be better off if families prosper the village prospers and eventually so does the whole
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 835.62 848.83 <o,f0,female> because they have cut and sold the trees she gets the women to plant new trees and water them drop by drop in a matter of five or six years they have a forest the soil is enriched and the village is
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 850.53 855.64 <o,f0,female> the poorest and most backward societies are always those that put women down
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 856.39 867.50 <o,f0,female> yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments and also by philanthropy for every dollar given to a women 's program twenty dollars are given to men 's programs
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 868.41 879.58 <o,f0,female> women are fifty one percent of humankind empowering them will change everything more than technology and design and entertainment i can promise you that
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 880.33 888.11 <o,f0,female> women working together linked informed and educated can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 888.80 893.89 <o,f0,female> in any war today most of the casualties are civilians mainly women and children
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 894.33 895.98 <o,f0,female> they are collateral damage
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 897.90 898.52 <o,f0,female> the world
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 900.51 902.24 <o,f0,female> what kind of world do we want
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 907.20 910.95 <o,f0,female> does it make sense to participate in the existing world
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 914.67 919.07 <o,f0,female> and the quality of life is enriched for everybody not only for the privileged
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 935.20 939.51 <o,f0,female> to show the paintings because the theme is the abu ghraib prison
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 940.19 946.27 <o,f0,female> they are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power in the voluminous botero style
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 952.99 963.28 <o,f0,female> what i fear most is power with impunity i fear abuse of power and the power to abuse in our species the alpha males define reality and force the
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 964.76 970.44 <o,f0,female> that reality and follow the rules the rules change all the time but they always benefit them
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 973.34 979.83 <o,f0,female> which does not work in economics works perfectly abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 980.68 983.74 <o,f0,female> women and children especially the poor are at the bottom
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 984.64 989.36 <o,f0,female> even the most destitute of men have someone they can abuse a woman or a child
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 992.16 996.10 <o,f0,female> with the power that a few exert over the many through gender income race
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 998.32 1001.38 <o,f0,female> i think that the time is ripe to make fundamental changes
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 1003.03 1013.83 <o,f0,female> but for real change we need feminine energy in the management of the world we need a critical number of women in positions of power and we need to nurture the feminine energy in
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 1014.84 1020.43 <o,f0,female> i'm talking about men with young minds of course old guys are hopeless we have to wait for them to die off
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 1024.66 1028.68 <o,f0,female> i would love to have sophia loren 's long legs and legendary
IsabelAllende_2007 1 IsabelAllende_2007 1029.94 1036.66 <o,f0,female> but given a choice i would rather have the warrior heart of wangari maathai somaly mam jenny and
