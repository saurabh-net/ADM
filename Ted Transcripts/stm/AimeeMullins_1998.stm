AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 23.13 24.60 <o,f0,female> thought we'd just talk a little bit
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 25.09 29.13 <o,f0,female> i wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distinctive athlete
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 30.96 36.94 <o,f0,female> those of you who have seen the picture in the little bio it might have given it away i'm a double amputee
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 37.66 44.67 <o,f0,female> i was born without fibulas in both legs i was amputated at age one and i've been running like hell
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 62.31 70.69 <o,f0,female> students out of the nation every year to get involved in international affairs and so i won a full ride to georgetown
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 72.74 74.60 <o,f0,female> and i've been there for four years love it
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 75.32 83.34 <o,f0,female> aimee got there she decided that she 's kind of curious about track and field so she decided to call someone and start asking about it so why don't you tell
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 98.22 111.36 <o,f0,female> and i'd never competed on a disabled level you know i'd always competed against other able bodied athletes that's all i'd ever known in fact i'd never even met another amputee until i was seventeen and i heard
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 111.90 125.36 <o,f0,female> you know that they do these track meets with all disabled runners and i figured oh i don't know about this but before i judge it let me go see what it's all about so i booked myself a flight to boston in ninety five
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 139.38 145.88 <o,f0,female> for me panting and heaving and i had these legs that were made of like a wood and plastic compound
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 169.18 169.70 <o,f0,female> this
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 171.08 171.29 <o,f0,female> and
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 173.11 186.51 <o,f0,female> know what i was expecting but you know when i saw a man who was missing an entire leg go up to the high jump hop on one leg to the high jump and clear it at six feet two inches dan o 'brien jumped five eleven in ninety six in atlanta
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 186.79 197.43 <o,f0,female> i mean if it just gives you a comparison of these are you know truly accomplished athletes without qualifying that word athlete and so i decided to give this a shot and
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 216.03 223.38 <o,f0,female> don't have any skill or finesse going down that track you were all over the place we all saw how hard you were working and
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 223.65 233.00 <o,f0,female> so i decided to call the track coach at georgetown and i thank god i didn't know just how huge this man is in the track and field world he 's coached
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 234.05 238.04 <o,f0,female> and you know the man 's office is lined from floor to ceiling with all
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 249.85 251.42 <o,f0,female> ran one race and i
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 265.40 270.88 <o,f0,female> well we should meet first before we decide anything you know he 's thinking what am i getting myself into so i met
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 274.33 285.73 <o,f0,female> these posters and magazine covers of people he 's coached and we sat and we got talking and it turned out to be a great partnership because he'd never coached a disabled athlete so therefore he had no
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 293.98 300.61 <o,f0,female> on this trip so he started giving me four days a week of his lunch break his free time
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 301.14 306.48 <o,f0,female> that i would come up to the track and train with him so that's how i met frank
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 308.26 319.43 <o,f0,female> that was fall of ninety five and then by the winter rolling around he said you know you're good enough you can run on our women 's track team here and i said no come
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 345.43 352.26 <o,f0,female> why don't you tell them like on your way to the olympics but a couple of memorable events happened at georgetown why don't you just tell
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 353.30 358.55 <o,f0,female> well you know i'd won everything as far as the disabled meets everything i competed in
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 384.64 393.77 <o,f0,female> better than you and i went out there and made it to the big east which was sort of the championship race
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 395.67 403.90 <o,f0,female> and really really hot and it's the first i had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio and
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 405.24 412.94 <o,f0,female> i didn't realize at that time that you know the amount of sweating that i would be doing in the sock it actually acted like a lubricant and i'd be
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 413.11 420.23 <o,f0,female> kind of pistoning in the socket and at about eighty five meters of my one hundred meters sprint in all my glory i
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 420.78 425.46 <o,f0,female> came out of my leg like i almost came out of it in front of like five thousand people
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 426.74 431.21 <o,f0,female> i i mean just mortified and because i was signed up for the two hundred
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 433.60 434.08 <o,f0,female> a
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 441.98 445.35 <o,f0,female> there's no way i'm going two hundred meters and he just sat there
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 446.56 455.06 <o,f0,female> and you know my pleas fell on deaf ears thank god because he was like you know the man 's from brooklyn he 's a big

AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 734.15 743.81 <o,f0,female> the rocky iv sensation of me versus germany and you know everyone else estonia and poland was in this heat and you know the gun went off and
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 745.08 751.41 <o,f0,female> you know finishing last and you know fighting back tears of frustration and
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 766.72 780.24 <o,f0,female> i became a collegiate athlete you know i became an olympic athlete and it made me really think about how you know the achievement was getting there i mean the fact that i set my sight just a year and three months before that
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 797.68 807.85 <o,f0,female> know and their patience you know to deal with me and that was like this collective glory that there was you know fifty people behind me that
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 808.29 816.64 <o,f0,female> had joined in this incredible experience of going to atlanta so i mean it 's i apply this sort of philosophy now to everything i do about like this
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 817.88 824.25 <o,f0,female> you know sitting back and realizing the progression like how far you've come at this day to this goal
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 825.34 835.10 <o,f0,female> it's important to focus on a goal i think but you know also recognize the progression on the way there and how you've grown as a person you know that's the achievement i think that's the
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 848.22 856.12 <o,f0,female> these are my cosmetic legs actually and they're absolutely beautiful
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 856.54 863.08 <o,f0,female> to come up and see them there are hair follicles on them and i can paint my toenails and
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 878.43 888.17 <o,f0,female> ewing who played for georgetown in the eighties comes back every summer and i had incessant fun making fun of him in the training room because he'd come in with
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 898.78 899.04 <o,f0,female> he
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 902.06 907.91 <o,f0,female> as i did anyway okay now these are my sprinting legs made of carbon graphite
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 911.79 913.09 <o,f0,female> i said
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 916.95 917.39 <o,f0,female> got

AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 1013.51 1024.02 <o,f0,female> it's a company in san diego called flex foot and i was a guinea pig and as i hope to continue to be in every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out
AimeeMullins_1998 1 AimeeMullins_1998 1024.45 1029.14 <o,f0,female> but actually these like i said are still the actual prototype i need to get some new ones because the last
