JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 15.03 23.08 <o,f0,male> fear right and you should be really afraid but not for the reasons why you think you should be you should be really afraid
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 23.72 33.73 <o,f0,male> if we stick up the first slide on this thing there we go that you're missing out because if you spend this week thinking about iraq and thinking about bush
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 34.38 42.03 <o,f0,male> and thinking about the stock market you're going to miss one of the greatest adventures that we've ever been on and this is what this adventure 's really about
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 43.20 52.44 <o,f0,male> this is crystallized dna every life form on this planet every insect every bacteria every plant every animal every human every politician
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 55.45 58.97 <o,f0,male> that stuff and if you want to take a single crystal of dna
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 59.06 62.52 <o,f0,male> it looks like that and we're just beginning to understand this
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 63.40 66.01 <o,f0,male> and this is the single most exciting adventure
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 66.54 74.42 <o,f0,male> that we have ever been on it's the single greatest mapping project we've ever been on if you think that the mapping of america 's made a difference or landing on the moon
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 82.63 84.46 <o,f0,male> it's beginning to tell us a lot about evolution
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 90.77 91.79 <o,f0,male> it turns out
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 92.62 100.24 <o,f0,male> what this stuff is and richard dawkins has written about this is this is really a river out of eden so the three point two billion base pairs inside each of your cells
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 100.58 107.38 <o,f0,male> is really a history of where you've been for the past billion years and we could start dating things and we could start changing medicine and archeology
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 108.11 117.09 <o,f0,male> it turns out that if you take the human species about seven hundred years ago white europeans diverged from black africans in a very significant way
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 117.96 128.16 <o,f0,male> white europeans were subject to the plague and when they were subject to the plague most people didn't survive but those who survived had a mutation on the ccr five receptor
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 128.95 141.52 <o,f0,male> that mutation was passed on to their kids because they're the ones that survived so there was a great deal of population pressure in africa because you didn't have these cities you didn't have that ccr five population pressure mutation we can date it to seven hundred years ago
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 142.21 154.00 <o,f0,male> that is one of the reasons why aids is raging across africa as fast as it is and not as fast across europe and we're beginning to find these little things for malaria for sickle cell
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 154.93 164.22 <o,f0,male> for cancers and in the measure that we map ourselves this is the single greatest adventure that we'll ever be on and this friday i want you to pull out a really good bottle of wine
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 164.96 171.88 <o,f0,male> and i want you to toast these two people because this friday fifty years ago watson and crick found the structure
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 193.82 201.63 <o,f0,male> if you think you're successful or cockroaches are successful it turns out that there's ten trillion trillion pleurococcus sitting out there and we didn't know that pleurococcus was out
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 213.03 225.54 <o,f0,male> we're finding amoebas like this this is amoeba dubia and amoeba dubia doesn't look like much except that each of you has about three point two billion letters which is what makes you you as far as gene code inside each
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 227.00 238.18 <o,f0,male> and this little amoeba which you know sits in water in hundreds and millions and billions turns out to have six hundred and twenty billion base pairs of gene code inside
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 239.35 250.30 <o,f0,male> so this little thingamajig has a genome that's two hundred times the size of yours and if you're thinking of efficient information storage mechanisms it may not turn out to be chips
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 251.71 261.28 <o,f0,male> it may turn out to be something that looks a little like that amoeba and again we're learning from life and how life works this funky little thing
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 262.13 269.42 <o,f0,male> people didn't used to think that it was worth taking samples out of nuclear reactors because it was dangerous and of course nothing lived there
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 270.16 275.98 <o,f0,male> and then finally somebody picked up a microscope and looked at the water that was sitting next to the cores and sitting next
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 279.46 288.14 <o,f0,male> a backstroke having its chromosomes blown apart every day six seven times restitching them living in about two hundred times the radiation that would kill you
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 301.29 313.10 <o,f0,male> even outside of this planet because if you can live in radiation that looks like this that brings up a whole series of interesting questions this little thingamajig we didn't know this thingamajig existed
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 324.58 332.00 <o,f0,male> and what you're looking at with this namibiensis is the biggest bacteria we've ever seen so it's about the size of a little period on a sentence
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 342.52 354.71 <o,f0,male> this is ferroplasma the reason why ferroplasma is interesting is because it eats iron lives inside the equivalent of battery acid and excretes sulfuric acid
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 356.55 367.57 <o,f0,male> so when you think of odd life forms when you think of what it takes to live it turns out this is a very efficient life form and they call it an archaea archaea means the ancient
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 368.89 382.14 <o,f0,male> and the reason why they're ancient is because this thing came up when this planet was covered by things like sulfuric acid in batteries and it was eating iron when the earth was part of a melted core so it's not just dogs
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 407.71 420.15 <o,f0,male> it's just beginning to understand this code of dna that's really the most exciting intellectual adventure that we've ever been on and you can do strange things with this stuff this is a baby gar
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 427.76 436.12 <o,f0,male> they can't do it naturally so what they do with this thing is they take a spoon take some cells out of an adult gar 's mouth code
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 437.07 448.77 <o,f0,male> take the cells from that and insert it into a fertilized cow 's egg reprogram cow 's egg different gene code when you do that the cow gives birth to a
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 451.30 459.99 <o,f0,male> we are now experimenting with bongos pandas elims sumatran tigers and the australians bless their hearts are playing with these things
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 469.64 483.43 <o,f0,male> but it turns out that as we learn more about gene code and how to reprogram species we may be able to close the gene gaps in deteriorate dna and when we learn how to close the gene gaps then we can put a full string of dna together
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 513.38 521.64 <o,f0,male> you can take that tree of life and collapse it back and in the measure that you learn to reprogram maybe we'll give birth to something that is very close to the first primordial
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 523.44 531.18 <o,f0,male> and it's all coming out of things that look like this these are companies that didn't exist five years ago huge gene sequencing facilities the size of football
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 539.79 547.47 <o,f0,male> we will have a one thousand dollar genome within the next five to eight years that means each of you will contain on a cd your entire gene code
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 548.68 550.68 <o,f0,male> and it will be really boring it will read like
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 552.54 554.67 <o,f0,male> the really neat thing about this stuff is that's life
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 556.17 562.06 <o,f0,male> 's going to talk about this one a little bit because if you happen to find this one inside your body you're in big trouble because that's the source code for
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 597.45 603.97 <o,f0,male> make a stem next line of code tacgggg make a flower that's white that blooms in the spring that smells like this
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 635.76 648.47 <o,f0,male> in corn this changes all rules this is life but we're reprogramming it this is what you look like this is one of your chromosomes
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 671.32 679.08 <o,f0,male> you can do some pretty strange things because in the same way as you can reprogram this apple if you go to cliff tabin 's lab at the harvard medical school he 's reprogramming
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 679.59 686.57 <o,f0,male> chicken embryos to grow more wings why would cliff be doing that he doesn't
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 689.59 700.25 <o,f0,male> reason why he 's reprogramming that animal to have more wings is because when you used to play with lizards as a little child and you picked up the lizard sometimes the tail fell off but it regrew
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 701.22 709.87 <o,f0,male> not so in human beings you cut off an arm you cut off a leg it doesn't regrow but because each of your cells contains your entire gene code
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 710.60 720.21 <o,f0,male> each cell can be reprogrammed if we don't stop stem cell research and if we don't stop genomic research to express different body functions
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 735.68 743.92 <o,f0,male> cells like stem cells in such a way that they express bone stomach skin pancreas
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 744.42 754.37 <o,f0,male> and you are likely to be wondering around and your children on regrown body parts in a reasonable period of time in some places in the world where they don't stop the research
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 757.43 758.35 <o,f0,male> how 's this stuff work
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 759.95 772.19 <o,f0,male> if each of you differs from the person next to you by one in a thousand but only three percent codes which means it's only one in a thousand times three percent very small differences in expression and punctuation can make a significant difference take a simple declarative sentence
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 777.50 778.38 <o,f0,male> perfectly clear
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 779.79 783.41 <o,f0,male> so men read that sentence and they look at that sentence and they read
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 793.59 795.43 <o,f0,male> wrong this is the way it should be
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 814.07 820.99 <o,f0,male> but you know he 's reasonably good looking but i won 't go there you can do this stuff even without changing the
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 825.30 826.47 <o,f0,male> this right
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 826.77 830.55 <o,f0,male> and they look at the world a little differently they look at the same world and they say
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 850.73 854.96 <o,f0,male> different outcomes even with the same string
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 869.65 882.74 <o,f0,male> these little chippies these things are the size of a credit card they will test any one of you for sixty thousand genetic conditions that brings up questions of privacy and insurability and all kinds of stuff but it also allows us to start going after diseases because if
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 883.66 891.33 <o,f0,male> a person who has leukemia through something like this it turns out that three diseases with completely similar clinical syndromes
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 910.32 920.66 <o,f0,male> if it is not expressing in your body if you don't have one of those types a particular one of those types don't take gleevec it won 't do anything for you same thing with receptin if you've got breast cancer
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 921.60 926.11 <o,f0,male> don't have an her two receptor don't take receptin changes the nature of medicine
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 935.02 941.64 <o,f0,male> and it turns out that this is not so important any more the u s library of congress in terms of its printed volume of data
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 942.29 952.12 <o,f0,male> contains less data than is coming out of a good genomics company every month on a compound basis let me say that again a single genomics company generates more data
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 952.58 962.34 <o,f0,male> in a month on a compound basis than is in the printed collections of the library of congress this is what's been powering the u s economy it's moore 's law
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 962.85 975.62 <o,f0,male> so all of you know that the price of computers halves every eighteen months and the power doubles right except that when you lay that side by side with the speed with which gene data 's being deposited in
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 977.15 980.22 <o,f0,male> moore 's law is right here it's the blue line
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 982.16 993.55 <o,f0,male> this is on a log scale and that's what superexponential growth means this is going to push computers to have to grow faster than they've been growing because so far there haven't been applications that have been required
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 994.72 997.10 <o,f0,male> that need to go faster than moore 's law this stuff
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 999.09 1002.44 <o,f0,male> and here 's an interesting map this is a map which was finished at the harvard business school
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 1014.22 1026.93 <o,f0,male> moving inside from the united states to the united states about four point six trillion is going over to those european countries about five five 's going to japan there's almost no communication between japan and nobody else is literate in this stuff
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 1028.32 1034.39 <o,f0,male> it's free no one 's reading it they're focusing on the war they're focusing on bush they're not interested in life
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 1035.44 1048.29 <o,f0,male> so this is what a new map of the world looks like that is the genomically literate world and that is a problem in fact it's not a genomically literate world you can break this out by states
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 1053.80 1067.42 <o,f0,male> fall off a cliff and you can watch new jersey fall off a cliff and you can watch the rise of the new empires of intelligence and you can break it out by counties because it's specific counties and if you want to get more specific it's actually specific zip codes
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 1077.13 1084.68 <o,f0,male> and that's it and that's the triangle between salk scripps ucsd and it's called torrey pines road
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 1085.91 1092.85 <o,f0,male> that means you don't need to be a big nation to be successful it means you don't need a lot of people to be successful and it means you can move most of the wealth of a country
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 1103.20 1114.29 <o,f0,male> are contiguous what's the net effect of this in an agricultural society the difference between the richest and the poorest the most productive and the least productive was five to one
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 1124.71 1129.86 <o,f0,male> in a knowledge society that number is now four hundred and twenty seven to one it really matters if
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 1131.27 1133.86 <o,f0,male> not just in reading and writing in english and french and german
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 1134.48 1135.93 <o,f0,male> but in microsoft and linux
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 1146.61 1151.70 <o,f0,male> it really matters who speaks life that's why nations rise and fall
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 1152.94 1159.67 <o,f0,male> and it turns out that if you went back to the eighteen seventies the most productive nation on earth was australia per person and new zealand was way up there
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 1169.77 1177.73 <o,f0,male> and today of course you all know that the most productive nation on earth is luxembourg producing about one third more wealth per person per year than america
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 1179.15 1185.50 <o,f0,male> tiny landlocked state no oil no diamonds no natural resources just smart people moving bits
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 1208.94 1214.96 <o,f0,male> ivy league economist stick him in charge of argentina he still crashes the country because he doesn't understand how the rules
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 1227.56 1237.03 <o,f0,male> and they are now about four point eight percent two billion people one third of the global population producing five percent of the wealth because they didn't get this change because
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 1237.56 1247.41 <o,f0,male> treating their people like serfs instead of like shareholders of a common project they didn't keep the people who were educated they didn't foment the businesses they didn't do the
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 1278.56 1286.45 <o,f0,male> and it's all getting very fragmented and this has not stopped in the nineteen nineties these are sovereign states that did not exist before
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 1309.47 1312.24 <o,f0,male> and given that the music is over
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 1312.46 1315.23 <o,f0,male> i was going to talk about how you can use this to generate a lot of
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 1316.57 1316.87 <o,f0,male> and
JuanEnriquez_2003 1 JuanEnriquez_2003 1323.19 1328.55 <o,f0,male> stop there and we'll do it next year because i don't want to take any of laurie 's time but thank you very much
