ErnestoSirolli_2012X 1 ErnestoSirolli_2012X 258.22 269.56 <o,f0,male> or we are paternalistic the two words come from the latin root pater which means father but they mean two different things
ErnestoSirolli_2012X 1 ErnestoSirolli_2012X 292.15 294.51 <o,f0,male> i was given a slap in the face reading
ErnestoSirolli_2012X 1 ErnestoSirolli_2012X 299.28 302.23 <o,f0,male> above all in economic development
ErnestoSirolli_2012X 1 ErnestoSirolli_2012X 307.44 326.82 <o,f0,male> this should be the first principle of aid the first principle of aid is respect this morning the gentleman who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor and said can we can you imagine a city that is not neocolonial
ErnestoSirolli_2012X 1 ErnestoSirolli_2012X 330.47 333.19 <o,f0,male> when i was twenty seven years old
ErnestoSirolli_2012X 1 ErnestoSirolli_2012X 333.32 336.68 <o,f0,male> to only respond to people
ErnestoSirolli_2012X 1 ErnestoSirolli_2012X 336.68 356.52 <o,f0,male> and i invented a system called enterprise facilitation where you never initiate anything you never motivate anybody but you become a servant of the local passion the servant of local people who have a dream to become a better person
ErnestoSirolli_2012X 1 ErnestoSirolli_2012X 356.52 367.35 <o,f0,male> so what you do you shut up you never arrive in a community with any ideas and you sit
ErnestoSirolli_2012X 1 ErnestoSirolli_2012X 367.35 380.59 <o,f0,male> with the local people we don 't work from offices we meet at the cafe we meet at the pub we have zero infrastructure and what we do
ErnestoSirolli_2012X 1 ErnestoSirolli_2012X 380.63 394.59 <o,f0,male> we become friends and we find out what that person wants to do the most important thing is passion you can give somebody an idea if that person doesn 't want to do it what are you going to do
ErnestoSirolli_2012X 1 ErnestoSirolli_2012X 416.83 424.58 <o,f0,male> the person with the idea may not have the knowledge but the knowledge is available so years and years ago
ErnestoSirolli_2012X 1 ErnestoSirolli_2012X 424.91 432.15 <o,f0,male> i had this idea why don 't we for once instead of arriving in the community to tell people what to do
ErnestoSirolli_2012X 1 ErnestoSirolli_2012X 432.15 441.1 <o,f0,female> why don 't for once listen to them but not in community meetings let me
ErnestoSirolli_2012X 1 ErnestoSirolli_2012X 446.8 451.39 <o,f0,male> with community meetings entrepreneurs never come
ErnestoSirolli_2012X 1 ErnestoSirolli_2012X 452.62 459.7 <o,f0,female> and they never tell you in a public meeting what they want to do with their own money
ErnestoSirolli_2012X 1 ErnestoSirolli_2012X 480.66 484.2 <o,f0,female> what we do we work one on one
ErnestoSirolli_2012X 1 ErnestoSirolli_2012X 484.2 491.72 <o,f0,female> and to work one on one you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn 't exist you have to create a new profession
ErnestoSirolli_2012X 1 ErnestoSirolli_2012X 491.72 510.08 <o,f0,female> the profession is the family doctor of enterprise the family doctor of business who sits with you in your house at your kitchen table at the cafe and helps you find the resources to transform your passion into a way to make a living
