BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 22.02 35.40 <o,f0,male> and i feel like this whole evening has been very amazing to me i feel it's sort of like the vimalakirti sutra an ancient work from ancient india in which the buddha appears
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 36.12 41.88 <o,f0,male> at the beginning and a whole bunch of people come to see him from the biggest city in the area
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 43.81 47.35 <o,f0,male> and to bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make offering to
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 47.71 60.60 <o,f0,male> the young people actually from the city the old fogeys don't come because they're mad at buddha because when he came to their city he accepted he always accepts the first invitation that comes to him from whoever it is
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 81.71 90.68 <o,f0,male> and so they boycotted him they wouldn't go listen to him but the young people all came and they brought this kind of a jeweled parasol and they put it on the ground
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 91.28 104.45 <o,f0,male> and as soon as they had laid all these all their big stack of these jeweled parasols that they used to carry in ancient india he performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 104.57 108.86 <o,f0,male> the wonder of the universe everyone looked in that and they saw in there the total interconnectedness of all
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 109.10 116.43 <o,f0,male> life in all universes and of course in the buddhist cosmos there are millions and billions of planets with human life on
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 117.22 124.21 <o,f0,male> and enlightened beings can see the life on all the other planets so they don 't when they look out and they see those lights that you showed in the sky
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 125.19 133.80 <o,f0,male> they don't just see sort of pieces of matter burning or rocks or flames or gases exploding they actually see landscapes and human beings and
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 153.15 159.84 <o,f0,male> i know his other name told us about interconnection and about how we're all totally interconnected here
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 160.35 168.12 <o,f0,male> and how we've all known each other and of course in the buddhist universe we've already done this already billions of times in many many lifetimes in the past
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 168.81 171.53 <o,f0,male> and i didn't give the talk always you
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 175.23 183.89 <o,f0,male> did and we had to watch you and so forth and we're all still trying to i guess we're all trying to become tedsters if that's a modern form of enlightenment
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 185.12 185.46 <o,f0,female> i guess
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 186.94 195.07 <o,f0,male> because in a way if a tedster relates to all the interconnectedness of all the computers and everything it's the forging of a mass awareness
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 195.34 205.26 <o,f0,male> of where everybody can really know everything that's going on everywhere in the planet and therefore it will become intolerable what compassion is is where it will become intolerable for us
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 205.97 213.34 <o,f0,male> totally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoying the life of the mind or whatever it is
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 213.79 220.47 <o,f0,male> and there are people who are absolutely riddled with disease and they cannot have a bite of food and they
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 220.74 230.81 <o,f0,male> have no place or they're being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth it just becomes intolerable with all of us knowing everything we're kind of forced by
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 236.88 241.00 <o,f0,male> and of course we all will be deeply disappointed when we do
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 243.65 250.51 <o,f0,male> we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do a little bit tired we
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 250.87 259.99 <o,f0,male> do suffer we do enjoy our misery in a certain way we distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere but basically we all have this common misery that
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 260.61 270.67 <o,f0,male> stuck inside our skins and everyone else is out there and occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin and the two of us enjoy each other
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 271.05 276.79 <o,f0,male> and each of us tried to get out of our own and ultimately it fails of course and we're back into this thing
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 277.24 286.39 <o,f0,male> because our egocentric perception from the buddha 's point of view misperception is that all we are is what is inside our skin
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 286.99 295.62 <o,f0,male> and it's inside and outside self and other and other is all very different and everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception a little bit
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 306.98 316.75 <o,f0,male> who 's that and so you wouldn't sit that close to another person because of your notion that it's you versus the universe that's all buddha discovered
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 317.52 327.86 <o,f0,male> because that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone each of us and everyone else is different then that puts us in an impossible situation doesn't it
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 328.41 336.57 <o,f0,male> who is it who 's going to get enough attention from the world who 's going to get enough out of the world who 's not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 337.33 343.69 <o,f0,male> if you're different from all the other beings so where compassion comes is where
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 344.39 352.85 <o,f0,male> you surprisingly discover you lose yourself in some way through art through meditation through understanding
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 353.31 366.11 <o,f0,male> through knowledge actually knowing that you have no such boundary knowing your interconnectedness with other beings you can experience yourself as the other beings when you see through the delusion of being separated from them
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 366.95 375.05 <o,f0,male> when you do that you're forced to feel what they feel luckily they say i still am not sure but luckily
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 375.48 384.58 <o,f0,male> they say that when you reach that point because some people have said in the buddhist literature they say ooh who would really want to be compassionate how awful i'm so miserable on my own
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 385.32 393.78 <o,f0,male> my head is aching my bones are aching i go from birth to death i'm never satisfied i never have enough even i'm a billionaire i never have enough i need a hundred billion
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 394.61 402.67 <o,f0,male> so i'm like that imagine if i had to feel even a hundred other people 's suffering it would be terrible
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 403.21 416.81 <o,f0,male> but apparently this is a strange paradox of life when you're no longer locked in yourself and as the wisdom or the intelligence or the scientific knowledge of the nature of the world that enables you
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 417.54 425.91 <o,f0,male> to let your mind spread out and empathize and enhance the basic human ability of empathizing
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 426.33 433.48 <o,f0,male> and realizing that you are the other being somehow by that opening you can see the deeper nature of life
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 455.07 457.92 <o,f0,male> song that song a perfect teaching
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 458.01 465.00 <o,f0,male> but when we're relieved from that we somehow then become interested in all the other beings and we feel ourselves differently it's totally
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 472.55 485.22 <o,f0,male> when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion it's because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures are finally too small a theater for your intelligence it's really
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 487.71 493.15 <o,f0,male> like this or like that or what you know and the more you focus on how you feel by the way the worse it gets
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 495.83 506.82 <o,f0,female> like even when you're having a good time when is the good time over the good time is over when you think how good is it and then it's never good enough i love that
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 507.11 517.98 <o,f0,male> said that the way of helping those who are suffering badly on the physical plane or on other planes is having a good time doing it by having a good time
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 518.42 525.61 <o,f0,male> i think the dalai lama should have heard that i wish he'd been there to hear that he once told me he looked kind of sad he worries very much about the haves and have nots
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 527.37 536.72 <o,f0,male> he said well a hundred years ago they went and took everything away from the haves you know the big communist revolutions russia and china and so forth they took it all away by violence
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 537.86 548.26 <o,f0,male> saying they were going to give it to everyone and then they were even worse they didn't help at all so what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 549.03 559.23 <o,f0,male> and so then he looks at me so i said well you know you're all in this yourself you teach it's generosity was all i could think of what is virtue
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 559.65 566.91 <o,f0,male> but of course i think the key to saving the world the key to compassion is that it is more
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 569.41 581.44 <o,f0,male> it should be done by fun generosity is more fun that's the key everybody has the wrong idea they think buddha was so boring and they're so surprised when they meet dalai lama and he 's fairly jolly
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 582.54 591.75 <o,f0,male> even though his people are being genocided and believe me he feels every blow on every old nun 's head in every chinese prison he feels it
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 592.08 602.65 <o,f0,male> he feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays i won 't even say what they do but he feels it and yet he 's very jolly he 's extremely jolly
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 603.35 611.64 <o,f0,male> because when you open up like that then you can't just what good does it do to add being miserable with others misery
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 612.00 623.86 <o,f0,male> you have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is how it can be changed look at that beautiful thing chiho showed us she scared us with the lava man she scared us with the lava man is coming
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 625.05 630.58 <o,f0,male> the tsunami is coming but then finally there was flowers and trees and it was very beautiful
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 632.12 634.24 <o,f0,male> it's really lovely
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 634.85 643.02 <o,f0,male> so compassion means to feel the feelings of others and the human being actually is compassion
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 643.43 651.15 <o,f0,male> the human being is almost out of time the human being is compassion because what is our brain for
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 653.72 662.52 <o,f0,male> jim 's brain is memorizing the almanac but he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is he will he did
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 662.85 669.58 <o,f0,male> he could memorize all kinds of fantastic things to help many beings and he would have tremendous fun doing that
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 670.10 681.16 <o,f0,male> so the first person who gets happy when you stop focusing on the self centered situation of how happy am i where you're always dissatisfied as mick jagger told us
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 682.03 688.93 <o,f0,male> never get any satisfaction that way so then you decide well i'm sick of myself i'm going to think of how other people can be happy
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 697.13 710.82 <o,f0,male> and the first person who gets happy when you do that you don't do anything for anybody else but you get happier you yourself because your whole perception broadens and you suddenly see the whole world and all of the people in it
BobThurman_2006S 1 BobThurman_2006S 711.27 720.84 <o,f0,male> and you realize that this being with these people is the flower garden that chiho showed us it is nirvana and my time is up and i know the ted commandments thank you
