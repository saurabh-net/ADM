RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 20.2 22.02 <o,f0,female> zipcar buys
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 35.1 38.49 <o,f0,female> and each driver drives about eighty percent less
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 38.68 46.7 <o,f0,female> because they 're now paying the full cost all at once in real time but what zipcar really did was make sharing the norm
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 47.22 64.69 <o,f0,female> now a decade later it 's really time to push the envelope a little bit and so a couple years ago i moved to paris with my husband and youngest child and we launched buzzcar a year ago buzzcar lets people rent out their own cars to their friends and neighbors
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 64.69 69.35 <o,f0,female> instead of investing in a car we invest in a community
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 69.66 74.91 <o,f0,female> we bring the power of a corporation to individuals who add their cars to the network
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 75.32 84.42 <o,f0,female> some people call this peer to peer this does express the humanity of what 's going on and the personal relationships
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 98.7 101.99 <o,f0,female> fairs are the same thing as etsy
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 102.02 108.09 <o,f0,female> but what 's really happening is that we 've got the power of a free and open internet
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 108.12 115.14 <o,f0,female> and on top of that we 're putting a platform for participation and the peers are now in partnership with the company
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 115.67 119.06 <o,f0,female> creating shared value on shared values
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 119.07 123.21 <o,f0,female> and each strengthening the other and doing what the other can 't do
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 123.23 131.54 <o,f0,female> i call this peers inc the incorporated side the company is doing things that it does really well
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 131.63 135.49 <o,f0,female> what does it do really well it creates economies of scale
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 135.53 139.5 <o,f0,female> significant and long term resource investment
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 139.5 158.48 <o,f0,female> the expertise of many different kinds of people and different kinds of minds and for individuals consumers it 's bringing the standards rules and recourse that we really want as consumers and this is kind of bound up in a brand promise and the companies are providing this on a platform for participation
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 158.48 167.83 <o,f0,female> peers are giving and doing things that are incredibly expensive for companies to do what do they bring they bring this fabulous diversity
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 167.88 187.32 <o,f0,female> expensive for companies and what does that deliver it delivers localization and customization specialization and all of this aspect about social networks and how companies are yearning and eager to get inside there it 's natural for me me and my friends i can connect to them easily and it also delivers really fabulous innovation
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 187.4 196.05 <o,f0,female> and i 'll talk about that later so we have the peers that are providing the services and the product and the company that 's doing the stuff that companies do
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 196.05 200.46 <o,f0,female> the two of these are delivering the best of both worlds
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 200.46 204.75 <o,f0,female> some of my favorite examples in transportation
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 204.75 223.96 <o,f0,female> carpooling com ten years old three and a half million people have joined up and a million rides are shared every day it 's a phenomenal thing it 's the equivalent of two thousand five hundred tgv trains and just think they didn 't have to lay a track or buy a car this is all happening with excess capacity
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 223.96 237.59 <o,f0,female> and it 's not just with transportation my love but of course in other realms here 's fiverr com i met these founders just weeks after they had launched and now in two years what would you do for five dollars
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 237.59 246.26 <o,f0,female> seven hundred and fifty thousand gigs are now posted after two years what people would do for five dollars and not just
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 246.45 261.53 <o,f0,female> easy things that anyone can do this peers inc concept is in a very difficult and complex realm topcoder has four hundred thousand engineers who are delivering complex design and engineering services
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 261.53 268.39 <o,f0,female> when i talked to their ceo he had this great line he said we have a community that owns its own company
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 268.39 279.47 <o,f0,female> and then my all time favorite etsy etsy is providing goods that people make themselves and they 're selling it in a marketplace it just celebrated its seventh anniversary
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 279.47 290.13 <o,f0,female> and after seven years last year it delivered five hundred and thirty million dollars worth of sales to all those individuals who have been making those objects
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 290.13 303.57 <o,f0,female> i know you guys out there who are businesspeople are thinking oh my god i want to build one of those i see this incredible speed and scale you mean all i have to do is build a platform and all these people are going to put their stuff on top and i sit back and roll it in
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 303.62 310.01 <o,f0,female> building these platforms for participation are so nontrivial to do i think of the difference
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 310.01 319.85 <o,f0,female> google video versus youtube who would have thought that two young guys and a start up would beat out google video why i actually have no idea why i didn 't talk to them
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 319.85 330.22 <o,f0,female> but i 'm thinking you know they probably had the share button a little bit brighter and to the right and so it was easier and more convenient for the two sides that are always participating on these networks
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 330.22 333.58 <o,f0,female> so i actually know a lot about building a peer
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 345.77 353.51 <o,f0,female> because now every single thing we do has these two different bodies that i have to be thinking about the owners who are going to provide the cars
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 353.51 369.17 <o,f0,female> and the drivers who are going to rent them every single decision i have to think about what is right for both sides there are many many examples and i 'll give you one that is not my favorite example insurance it took me a year and a half to get the insurance just right
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 378.36 388.31 <o,f0,female> way too much money i just can 't even go there with lawyers trying to figure out how this is different who 's responsible to whom and the result was that we were able to provide owners
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 388.31 405.62 <o,f0,female> protection for their own driving records and their own history the cars are completely insured during the rental and it gives drivers what they need and what do they need they need a low deductible and twenty four hour roadside assistance so this was a trick to get these two sides
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 405.62 410.1 <o,f0,female> so now i want to take you to the moment
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 438.89 450.42 <o,f0,female> owners who were getting text messages and emails that said hey joe wants to rent your car for the weekend you can earn sixty euros isn 't that great yes or no no reply
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 465.1 481.53 <o,f0,female> the whole point of industrial production is to provide a standardized exact service model that is consistent every single time and i 'm really thankful that my smartphone is made using industrial production and zipcar provides a very nice consistent service that works fabulously
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 481.53 484.52 <o,f0,female> but what does peer production do peer production
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 484.52 490.75 <o,f0,female> is this completely different way of doing things and you have a big quality range
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 490.75 504.09 <o,f0,female> and so ebay cleverly the first peer production peer inc company i 'd say they figured out early on we need to have ratings and commentaries and all that yucky side stuff
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 511.42 513.7 <o,f0,female> so going back
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 513.75 532.33 <o,f0,female> this is my look of excitement and joy because all this stuff that i 'd also been hoping for actually really did happen and what 's that that is the diversity of what 's going on you have these different fabulous owners and their different cars different prices different locations
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 544.58 552.69 <o,f0,female> excited guys and here is selma who i love this driver and after a year we have
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 577.76 589.72 <o,f0,female> they went to rent a car to go up the coast of france and the owner gave it to them and said you know what here 's where the cliffs are and here 's all the beaches and this is my best beach and this is where the best fish restaurant is
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 589.72 607.71 <o,f0,female> and the peers also become peers and owners create relationships and so at the last minute people can a driver can say hey you know what i really need the car is it available and that person will say sure my wife 's at home go pick up the keys go do it so you can have these really nice things that can 't happen
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 607.71 614.61 <o,f0,female> and it 's a kind of wow and i want to say wow type of thing that 's happening here because individuals
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 620.88 636.25 <o,f0,female> what happens in peer inc companies is that you have tens and hundreds and thousands and even millions of people who are creating experiments on this model and so out of all that influence and that effort you are having this exceptional amount of
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 639.42 648.49 <o,f0,female> so one of the reasons if we come back to why did i call it buzzcar i wanted to remind all of us about the power of the hive
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 648.49 655.83 <o,f0,female> and its incredible facility to create this platform that individuals want to participate and innovate on
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 655.83 673.72 <o,f0,female> and for me when i think about our future and all of those problems that seem incredibly large the scale is impossible the urgency is there peers inc provides the speed and scale and the innovation and the creativity that is going to answer these problems
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 673.73 692.49 <o,f0,female> all we have to do is create a fabulous platform for participation nontrivial so i continue to think that transportation is the center of the hard universe all problems come back to transportation for me but there are all these other areas that are these profound big problems
RobinChase_2012G 1 RobinChase_2012G 703.37 706.44 <o,f0,female> so over the last decade
