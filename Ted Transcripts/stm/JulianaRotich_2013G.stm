JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 15.47 31.19 <o,f0,female> metaphorically and quite literally when you think about connectivity before two thousand and eight though many human intellectual and technological leaps had happened in europe and the rest of the world but africa was sort of cut off
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 31.19 41.85 <o,f0,female> and that changed first with ships when we had the renaissance the scientific revolution and also the industrial revolution and now we 've got the digital revolution
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 41.85 61.77 <o,f0,female> these revolutions have not been evenly distributed across continents and nations never have been now this is a map of the undersea fiber optic cables that connect africa to the rest of the world what i find amazing is that africa is transcending its geography problem
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 61.81 74.18 <o,f0,female> africa is connecting to the rest of the world and within itself the connectivity situation has improved greatly but some barriers remain it is with this context that ushahidi came to be
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 74.18 86.56 <o,f0,female> in two thousand and eight one of the problems that we faced was lack of information flow there was a media blackout in two thousand and eight when there was post election violence in kenya
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 86.56 97.02 <o,f0,female> it was a very tragic time it was a very difficult time so we came together and we created software called ushahidi and ushahidi means testimony or witness in swahili
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 106.96 122.12 <o,f0,female> and we worked together first with building and growing ushahidi and the idea of the software was to gather information from sms email and web and put a map so that you could see what was happening where and you could visualize that data
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 122.12 131.37 <o,f0,female> and after that initial prototype we set out to make free and open source software so that others do not have to start from scratch like we did
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 131.37 145.71 <o,f0,female> all the while we also wanted to give back to the local tech community that helped us grow ushahidi and supported us in those early days and that 's why we set up the ihub in nairobi an actual physical space where we could
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 145.71 157.28 <o,f0,female> collaborate and it is now part of an integral tech ecosystem in kenya we did that with the support of different organizations like the macarthur foundation and omidyar network
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 157.28 163.18 <o,f0,female> and we were able to grow this software footprint and a few years later it became
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 178.52 184.29 <o,f0,female> now this year the internet turns twenty and ushahidi turned five
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 194.49 206.55 <o,f0,female> we did not imagine that there would be this many maps around the world there are crisis maps election maps corruption maps and even environmental monitoring crowd maps
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 206.55 215.72 <o,f0,female> we are humbled that this has roots in kenya and that it has some use to people around the world trying to figure out the different issues that they 're dealing with
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 215.85 231.18 <o,f0,female> there is more that we 're doing to explore this idea of collective intelligence that i as a citizen if i share the information with whatever device that i have could inform you about what is going on and that if you do the same we can have a bigger picture of what 's going on
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 242.77 252.54 <o,f0,female> and in kenya it 's a very different reality and one thing that remains despite the leaps in progress and the digital revolution is the electricity problem
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 252.54 256.51 <o,f0,female> the day to day frustrations of dealing with this can be
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 256.51 276.03 <o,f0,female> let 's just say very annoying blackouts are not fun imagine sitting down to start working and all of a sudden the power goes out your internet connection goes down with it so you have to figure out okay now where 's the modem how do i switch back and then guess what you have to deal with it again
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 276.03 291.19 <o,f0,female> now this is the reality of kenya where we live now and other parts of africa the other problem that we 're facing is that communication costs are also still a challenge it costs me five kenyan shillings or
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 327.93 332.05 <o,f0,female> internet and electricity and reduce the cost of connection
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 332.15 342.74 <o,f0,female> could we leverage the cloud we 've built a crowd map we 've built ushahidi could we leverage these technologies to switch smartly whenever you travel from country to country
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 342.74 358.72 <o,f0,female> so we looked at the modem an important part of the infrastructure of the internet and asked ourselves why the modems that we are using right now are built for a different context where you 've got ubiquitous internet you 've got ubiquitous electricity
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 377.91 395.16 <o,f0,female> it acts as a backup to the internet so that when the power goes out it fails over and connects to the nearest gsm network mobile connectivity in africa is pervasive it 's actually
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 395.16 414.89 <o,f0,female> everywhere most towns at least have a three g connection so why don 't we leverage that and that 's why we built this the other reason that we built this is when electricity goes down this has eight hours of battery left so you can continue working you can continue being productive and let 's just say you are less stressed
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 415.14 432.89 <o,f0,female> and for rural areas it can be the primary means of connection the software sensibility at ushahidi is still at play when we wondered how can we use the cloud to be more intelligent so that you can analyze the different networks and whenever you switch on the backup
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 432.89 443.18 <o,f0,female> you pick on the fastest network so we 'll have multi sim capability so that you can put multiple sims and if one network is faster that 's the one you hop on
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 443.18 448.4 <o,f0,female> and if the up time on that is not very good then you hop onto the next one
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 448.68 459.33 <o,f0,female> the idea here is for you to be able to connect anywhere with load balancing this can be possible the other interesting thing for us we like sensors
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 459.33 476.7 <o,f0,female> is this idea that you could have an on ramp for the internet of things imagine a weather station that can be attached to this it 's built in a modular way so that you can also attach a satellite module so that you could have internet connectivity even in very remote areas
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 476.76 492.17 <o,f0,female> out of adversity can come innovation and how can we help the ambitious coders and makers in kenya to be resilient in the face of problematic infrastructure and for us we begin with solving the problem in our own backyard in kenya
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 492.17 494.55 <o,f0,female> it is not without challenge
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 494.55 502.94 <o,f0,female> our team has basically been mules carrying components from the u s to kenya we 've had very interesting conversations with customs border agents
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 502.94 519.82 <o,f0,female> what are you carrying and the local financing is not part of the ecosystem for supporting hardware projects so we put it on kickstarter and i 'm happy to say that through the support of many people not only here but online
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 526.4 541.51 <o,f0,female> i will close by saying that if we solve this for the local market it could be impactful not only for the coders in nairobi but also for small business owners who need reliable connectivity and it can reduce the cost of connecting
JulianaRotich_2013G 1 JulianaRotich_2013G 541.51 546.52 <o,f0,female> and hopefully collaboration within african countries
