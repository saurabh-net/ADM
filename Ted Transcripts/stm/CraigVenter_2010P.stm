CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 16.94 20.67 <o,f0,male> we're here today to announce the first synthetic cell
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 21.59 31.42 <o,f0,male> cell made by starting with the digital code in the computer building the chromosome from four bottles of chemicals
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 44.10 51.54 <o,f0,male> so this is the first self replicating species that we've had on the planet whose parent is a computer
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 52.63 59.39 <o,f0,male> it also is the first species to have its own website encoded in its genetic code
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 59.92 68.15 <o,f0,male> but we'll talk more about the watermarks in a minute this is a project that had its inception fifteen years ago
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 69.05 78.43 <o,f0,male> when our team then we called the institute tigr were involved in sequencing the first two genomes in history we did haemophilus influenzae and then
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 79.01 83.68 <o,f0,male> the smallest genome of a self replicating organism that of mycoplasma genitalium
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 84.40 93.07 <o,f0,male> and as soon as we had these two sequences we thought if this is supposed to be the smallest genome of a self replicating species
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 93.45 99.88 <o,f0,male> could there be even a smaller genome could we understand the basis of cellular life at the genetic level
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 100.53 106.25 <o,f0,male> it's been a fifteen year quest just to get to the starting point now to be able to answer those questions
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 107.18 118.09 <o,f0,male> because it's very difficult to eliminate multiple genes from a cell you can only do them one at a time we decided early on that we had to take a synthetic route
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 118.57 129.43 <o,f0,male> even though nobody had been there before to see if we could synthesize a bacterial chromosome so we could actually vary the gene content to understand the essential genes for life
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 130.07 138.51 <o,f0,male> that started our fifteen year quest to get here before we did the first experiments we actually asked
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 139.33 149.56 <o,f0,male> art caplan 's team then at the university of pennsylvania to undertake a review of what the risks the challenges the ethics around creating new
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 161.71 169.72 <o,f0,male> two years off as a side project to sequence the human genome but as soon as that was done we got back to the task at hand
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 170.65 180.98 <o,f0,male> in two thousand and two we started a new institute the institute for biological energy alternatives where we set out two goals one to understand
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 181.46 193.35 <o,f0,male> the impact of our technology on the environment and how to understand the environment better and two to start down this process of making synthetic life to understand basic life
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 194.29 202.70 <o,f0,male> in two thousand and three we published our first success so ham smith and clyde hutchison developed some new methods
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 203.34 214.76 <o,f0,male> for making error free dna at a small level our first task was a five thousand letter code bacteriophage a virus that attacks only
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 216.35 223.78 <o,f0,male> so that was the phage phi x one hundred and seventy four which was chosen for historical reasons it was the first
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 224.43 231.34 <o,f0,male> dna phage dna virus dna genome that was actually sequenced so
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 231.82 245.58 <o,f0,male> once we realized that we could make five thousand base pair viral sized pieces we thought we at least have the means then to try and make serially lots of these pieces to be able to eventually assemble them together
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 246.18 254.51 <o,f0,male> to make this megabase chromosome so substantially larger than we even thought we would go after initially
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 255.69 261.81 <o,f0,male> so there were several steps to this there were two sides we had to solve the chemistry for making large dna molecules
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 262.26 272.23 <o,f0,male> and we had to solve the biological side of how if we had this new chemical entity how would we boot it up activate it in a recipient cell
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 273.21 284.07 <o,f0,male> so we had two teams working in parallel one team on the chemistry and the other on trying to be able to transplant entire chromosomes
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 284.79 292.62 <o,f0,male> to get new cells when we started this out we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem which is why we chose the smallest genome
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 293.45 304.79 <o,f0,male> and some of you have noticed that we switched from the smallest genome to a much larger one and we can walk through the reasons for that but basically the small cell took
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 305.54 312.77 <o,f0,male> on the order of one to two months to get results from whereas the larger faster growing cell takes only two days
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 313.10 321.67 <o,f0,male> so there's only so many cycles we could go through in a year at six weeks per cycle and you should know that basically ninety nine
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 334.68 346.95 <o,f0,male> so one of the most important publications we had was in two thousand and seven carole lartigue led the effort to actually transplant a bacterial chromosome from one bacteria to another
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 347.48 355.07 <o,f0,male> i think philosophically that was one of the most important papers that we've ever done because it showed how dynamic life was
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 355.61 363.82 <o,f0,male> and we knew once that worked that we actually had a chance if we could make the synthetic chromosomes to do the same with those
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 364.51 378.51 <o,f0,male> we didn't know it was going to take us several years or more to get there in two thousand and eight we reported the complete synthesis of the mycoplasma genitalium genome a little over five hundred thousand letters of genetic code
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 379.38 393.39 <o,f0,male> but we have not yet succeeded in booting up that chromosome we think in part because of its slow growth and then part cells have all kinds of unique defense mechanisms to keep these events from happening
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 393.77 405.76 <o,f0,male> it turned out the cell that we were trying to transplant into had a nuclease an enzyme that chews up dna on its surface and was happy to eat the synthetic dna that we gave it and never got transplantations
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 406.45 411.73 <o,f0,male> but at the time that was the largest molecule of a defined structure that had been made
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 415.13 424.02 <o,f0,male> but part of the synthesis had to be accomplished or was able to be accomplished using yeast putting the fragments in yeast and yeast would assemble these for us
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 424.46 432.12 <o,f0,male> it's an amazing step forward but we had a problem because now we had the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 433.02 443.94 <o,f0,male> so in addition to doing the transplant we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome out of the eukaryotic yeast into a form where we could transplant it into a recipient cell
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 446.33 452.55 <o,f0,male> our team developed new techniques for actually growing cloning entire bacterial chromosomes in yeast
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 468.68 474.55 <o,f0,male> when we did these experiments though we could get the chromosome out of yeast but it wouldn't transplant and boot up a cell
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 476.21 478.69 <o,f0,male> that little issue took the team two years to solve
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 479.59 483.92 <o,f0,male> it turns out the dna in the bacterial cell was actually methylated
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 484.35 490.70 <o,f0,male> and the methylation protects it from the restriction enzyme from digesting the dna
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 491.43 496.88 <o,f0,male> so what we found is if we took the chromosome out of yeast and methylated it we could then transplant it
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 498.07 505.27 <o,f0,male> further advances came when the team removed the restriction enzyme genes from the recipient capricolum cell
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 510.63 519.45 <o,f0,male> so last fall when we published the results of that work in science we all became overconfident and were sure we were only
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 519.72 525.53 <o,f0,male> a few weeks away from being able to now boot up a chromosome out of yeast
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 526.78 540.50 <o,f0,male> because of the problems with mycoplasma genitalium and its slow growth about a year and a half ago we decided to synthesize the much larger chromosome the mycoides chromosome
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 541.01 551.27 <o,f0,male> knowing that we had the biology worked out on that for transplantation and dan led the team for the synthesis of this over one million base pair chromosome
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 552.29 562.40 <o,f0,male> but it turned out it wasn't going to be as simple in the end and it set us back three months because we had one error out of over a million base pairs in that sequence
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 562.67 573.50 <o,f0,male> so the team developed new debugging software where we could test each synthetic fragment to see if it would grow in a background of wild type dna
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 574.11 581.66 <o,f0,male> and we found that ten out of the eleven one hundred thousand base pair pieces we synthesized were completely accurate and
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 582.35 590.38 <o,f0,male> compatible with a life forming sequence we narrowed it down to one fragment we sequenced it
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 595.74 603.10 <o,f0,male> so accuracy is essential there's parts of the genome where it cannot tolerate even a single error
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 603.78 611.59 <o,f0,male> and then there's parts of the genome where we can put in large blocks of dna as we did with the watermarks and it can tolerate all kinds of errors
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 612.53 621.92 <o,f0,male> took about three months to find that error and repair it and then early one morning at six a m we got a text
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 622.35 633.53 <o,f0,male> from dan saying that now the first blue colonies existed so it's been a long route to get here fifteen years from the beginning we felt
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 634.35 643.90 <o,f0,male> one of the tenets of this field was to make absolutely certain we could distinguish synthetic dna from natural dna
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 644.91 651.68 <o,f0,male> early on when you're working in a new area of science you have to think about all the pitfalls and things that could lead you
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 652.22 664.67 <o,f0,male> to believe you had done something when you hadn 't and even worse leading others to believe it so we thought the worst problem would be a single molecule contamination of the native chromosome
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 665.85 673.95 <o,f0,male> leading us to believe that we actually had created a synthetic cell when it would have been just a contaminant so early on we developed the notion
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 674.38 680.98 <o,f0,male> of putting in watermarks in the dna to absolutely make clear that the dna was synthetic
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 681.96 691.80 <o,f0,male> the first chromosome we built in two thousand and eight the five hundred thousand base pair one we simply assigned
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 692.38 704.46 <o,f0,male> the names of the authors of the chromosome into the genetic code but it was using just amino acid single letter translations which leaves out certain letters of the alphabet
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 705.57 716.55 <o,f0,male> so the team actually developed a new code within the code within the code so it's a new code for interpreting and writing messages in dna
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 716.91 725.59 <o,f0,male> now mathematicians have been hiding and writing messages in the genetic code for a long time but it's clear they were mathematicians and not biologists
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 726.37 738.65 <o,f0,male> because if you write long messages with the code that the mathematicians developed it would more than likely lead to new proteins being synthesized with unknown functions
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 739.46 750.31 <o,f0,male> so the code that mike montague and the team developed actually puts frequent stop codons so it's a different alphabet but allows us to use the entire
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 758.64 767.38 <o,f0,male> base pairs of genetic code the first one actually contains within it this code for interpreting the rest of the genetic code so
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 769.16 775.65 <o,f0,male> the remaining information in the watermarks contain the names of i think
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 776.78 783.56 <o,f0,male> forty six different authors and key contributors to getting the project to this stage
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 784.33 795.67 <o,f0,male> and we also built in a website address so that if somebody decodes the code within the code within the code they can send an email to that address so it's
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 797.28 805.98 <o,f0,male> clearly distinguishable from any other species having forty six names in it its own web address
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 806.97 816.05 <o,f0,male> and we added three quotations because with the first genome we were criticized for not trying to say something more profound than
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 816.59 824.28 <o,f0,male> just signing the work so we won 't give the rest of the code but we will give the three quotations so the first is to live to
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 825.26 831.26 <o,f0,male> to fall to triumph and to recreate life out of life it's a james joyce quote
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 833.22 843.14 <o,f0,male> the second quotation is see things not as they are but as they might be so it's a quote from the american prometheus book on robert oppenheimer
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 843.86 855.59 <o,f0,male> and the last one is a richard feynman quote what i cannot build i cannot understand so because this is as much a philosophical
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 856.26 864.23 <o,f0,male> advance as a technical advance in science we tried to deal with both the philosophical and the technical side
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 870.25 883.51 <o,f0,male> we've done asking for ethical review pushing the envelope on that side as well as the technical side this has been broadly discussed in the scientific community in the policy community
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 884.09 897.45 <o,f0,male> and at the highest levels of the federal government even with this announcement as we did in two thousand and three that work was funded by the department of energy so the work was reviewed at the level of the white house
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 898.96 906.98 <o,f0,male> to classify the work or publish it and they came down on the side of open publication which is the right approach
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 907.68 919.83 <o,f0,male> we've briefed the white house we've briefed members of congress we've tried to take and push the policy issues in parallel with the scientific advances
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 920.63 927.22 <o,f0,male> so with that i would like to open it first to the floor for questions yes in the back
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 933.39 943.62 <o,f0,male> can we explain how significant this is i'm not sure we're the ones that should be explaining how significant it is it's significant to us perhaps it's a giant philosophical
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 943.88 958.49 <o,f0,male> change in how we view life we actually view it as a baby step in terms of it's taken us fifteen years to now be able to do the experiment we wanted to do fifteen years ago on understanding life at its basic level
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 959.05 969.42 <o,f0,male> but we actually believe this is going to be a very powerful set of tools and we're already starting in numerous avenues to use this tool
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 970.54 976.60 <o,f0,male> we have at the institute ongoing funding now from nih in a program
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 976.86 986.51 <o,f0,male> with novartis to try and use these new synthetic dna tools to perhaps make the flu vaccine that you might get next year
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 987.28 994.04 <o,f0,male> because instead of taking weeks to months to make these dan 's team can now make these
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 994.27 1003.37 <o,f0,male> less than twenty four hours so when you see how long it took to get an h one n one vaccine out we think we can shorten that process quite substantially
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 1003.68 1012.29 <o,f0,male> the vaccine area synthetic genomics and the institute are forming a new vaccine company because we think these tools can affect vaccines
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 1013.06 1023.34 <o,f0,male> to diseases that haven't been possible to date things where the viruses rapidly evolve such with rhinovirus wouldn't it be nice to have something that actually blocked common colds
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 1024.17 1035.05 <o,f0,male> or more importantly hiv where the virus evolves so quickly the vaccines that are made today can't keep up with those evolutionary changes
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 1045.73 1053.30 <o,f0,male> we can't see co two we depend on scientific measurements for it and we see the beginning results of having too much of it
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 1054.02 1062.49 <o,f0,male> but we can see pre co two now floating on the waters and contaminating the beaches in the gulf we need some alternatives
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 1063.57 1074.43 <o,f0,male> for oil we have a program with exxon mobile to try and develop new strains of algae that can efficiently capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 1074.73 1087.21 <o,f0,male> or from concentrated sources make new hydrocarbons that can go into their refineries to make normal gasoline and diesel fuel out of co two those are just a couple of the approaches and directions that we're taking
