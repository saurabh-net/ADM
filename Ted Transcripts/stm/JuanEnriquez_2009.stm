JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 13.79 22.98 <o,f0,male> a great big elephant in the room called the economy so let 's start talking about that i wanted to give you current picture of the economy that's what i have behind myself
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 27.46 29.53 <o,f0,male> of course what we have to remember is
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 32.33 43.44 <o,f0,male> and what you have to think about is when you're dancing in the flames what's next so what i'm going to try to do in the next seventeen and a half minutes is i'm going to talk first about the flames where we are in the economy
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 53.33 56.91 <o,f0,male> and i will try and give you a sense of what the ultimate reboot looks like
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 57.78 60.40 <o,f0,male> those three trends are the ability to engineer cells
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 74.57 77.71 <o,f0,male> and the problem with leverage is it makes the u s financial system look like
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 85.78 87.79 <o,f0,male> so a normal commercial bank
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 89.00 99.26 <o,f0,male> has nine to ten times leverage that means for every dollar you deposit it loans out about nine or ten a normal investment bank is not a deposit bank it's an investment bank it has fifteen to twenty times
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 100.03 105.83 <o,f0,male> it turns out that b of a in september had thirty two times and your friendly citibank had forty
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 108.74 112.17 <o,f0,male> that means every bad loan goes bad forty seven times over
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 113.44 119.08 <o,f0,male> and that of course is the reason why all of you are making such generous and wonderful donations to these nice folks
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 123.57 124.91 <o,f0,male> and as you think about that
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 125.42 128.19 <o,f0,male> got to wonder so what do banks have in store for you now
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 144.90 147.23 <o,f0,male> the government meanwhile has been acting like santa claus
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 148.25 154.44 <o,f0,male> we all love santa claus right but the problem with santa clause is if you look at the mandatory spending of
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 163.97 168.90 <o,f0,male> on what we call entitlements and then by two thousand and seven it was sixty eight percent
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 169.91 173.47 <o,f0,male> we weren't supposed to run into one hundred percent until about two thousand and thirty
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 192.99 197.26 <o,f0,male> it turns out santa isn't quite as cute when it's summertime right
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 226.15 227.59 <o,f0,male> and here 's his second bit of advice
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 229.65 232.96 <o,f0,male> and by the way the chinese prime minister reiterated this at davos last
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 235.04 241.15 <o,f0,male> this stuff is getting serious enough that if we don't start paying attention to the deficit we're going to end up losing
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 243.23 244.46 <o,f0,male> and then all bets are off
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 246.34 252.25 <o,f0,male> show you what it looks like i think i can safely say that i'm the only trillionaire in this room
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 256.27 257.33 <o,f0,male> ten trilliion dollars
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 258.95 262.57 <o,f0,male> the only problem with this bill is it's not really worth very much
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 263.70 266.93 <o,f0,male> was eight bucks last week four bucks this week a buck next week
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 268.77 271.49 <o,f0,male> what happens to currencies when you don't stand behind them
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 273.60 284.51 <o,f0,male> so the next time somebody as cute as this shows up on your doorstep and sometimes this creature 's called chrysler and sometimes ford and sometimes whatever you want
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 285.70 290.45 <o,f0,male> just got to say no and you've got to start banishing a word that's called
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 298.50 303.30 <o,f0,male> this is what it looks like the orange slice is what's discretionary everything else is mandated
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 309.66 316.24 <o,f0,male> so what we have to start thinking about doing is capping our medical spending because that's a monster that's simply going to eat the entire budget
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 317.39 320.46 <o,f0,male> got to start thinking about asking people to retire a little bit later
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 326.35 329.67 <o,f0,male> if you're fifty to sixty we want you to work two years more
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 330.52 332.88 <o,f0,male> if you're under fifty we want you to work four more years
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 334.01 341.22 <o,f0,male> the reason why that's reasonable is when your grandparents were given social security they got it at sixty five and were expected to check out at sixty eight
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 346.34 355.42 <o,f0,male> we've also got to cut the military about three percent a year we've got to limit other mandatory spending we've got to quit borrowing as much because otherwise the interest is going to eat that whole pie
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 366.30 369.70 <o,f0,male> i got what you're thinking this is going to
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 371.57 372.46 <o,f0,male> hell freezes over
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 373.83 376.66 <o,f0,male> but let me remind you this december it did snow in vegas
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 428.88 432.48 <o,f0,male> really important in this stuff is as we cut we also have to grow
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 433.38 442.12 <o,f0,male> among other things because startup companies are two percent of u s gdp investment and they're about seventeen point eight percent of output
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 460.58 462.32 <o,f0,male> that's where these three trends come together
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 463.60 467.88 <o,f0,male> the ability to engineer microbes the ability to engineer tissues and the ability to engineer robots
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 471.07 482.09 <o,f0,male> let me recap some of the stuff you've seen craig venter showed up last year and showed you the first fully programmable cell that acts like hardware where you can insert dna and have it boot up as a different species
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 482.76 495.04 <o,f0,male> in parallel the folks at mit have been building a standard registry of biological parts so think of it as a radio shack for biology you can go out and get your proteins your rna your dna whatever and start building stuff
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 495.50 503.42 <o,f0,male> in two thousand and six they brought together high school students and college students and started to build these little odd creatures they just happened to be alive instead of circuit boards
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 504.53 504.95 <o,f0,male> the first
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 508.58 513.05 <o,f0,male> so cells have this cycle first they don't grow then they grow exponentially then they stop growing
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 515.26 516.88 <o,f0,male> a way of telling which stage they were
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 528.57 532.34 <o,f0,male> could tell very easily when your experiment was working and wasn 't and where it was in the
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 533.35 541.54 <o,f0,male> this got a bit more complicated two years later twenty one countries came together dozens of teams they started competing the team from rice university
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 542.32 543.43 <o,f0,male> started to engineer
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 544.40 549.88 <o,f0,male> the substance in red wine that makes red wine good for you into beer
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 553.74 561.71 <o,f0,male> so you take resveratrol and you put it into beer of course one of the judges is wandering by and he goes wow cancer fighting beer there is a god
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 565.30 569.14 <o,f0,male> the team from taiwan was a little bit more ambitious they tried to engineer bacterias
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 569.46 571.53 <o,f0,male> in such a way that they would act as your kidneys
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 573.23 583.85 <o,f0,male> four years ago i showed you this picture and people oohed and ahhed because cliff tabin had been able to grow an extra wing on a chicken and that was very cool stuff back
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 585.26 590.36 <o,f0,male> but now moving from bacterial engineering to tissue engineering let me show you what's happened in that period of time
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 591.52 593.13 <o,f0,male> two years ago you saw this creature
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 598.79 604.18 <o,f0,male> its limbs you can freeze half its heart it regrows you can freeze half the brain it regrows
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 612.61 615.52 <o,f0,male> but now you don't have to have the animal itself to regenerate
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 616.41 620.33 <o,f0,male> you can build cloned mice molars in petri dishes
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 622.08 627.57 <o,f0,male> of course if you can build mice molars in petri dishes you can grow human molars in petri dishes
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 628.60 641.13 <o,f0,male> this should not surprise you right i mean you're born with no teeth you give away all your teeth to the tooth fairy you regrow a set of teeth but then if you lose one of those second set of teeth they don't regrow unless if you're a lawyer
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 647.28 648.47 <o,f0,male> but of course for most of us
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 653.40 656.49 <o,f0,male> put them on a biodegradable mold regrow a tooth and simply implant
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 657.51 658.85 <o,f0,male> and we can do it with other things
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 659.41 673.09 <o,f0,male> so a spanish woman who was dying of tb had a donor trachea they took all the cells off the trachea they spraypainted her stem cells on to that cartilage she regrew her own trachea and seventy two hours later it was
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 674.86 675.77 <o,f0,male> she's now running around
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 677.15 685.41 <o,f0,male> this is going on in tony atala 's lab in wake forest where he is regrowing ears for injured soldiers and he 's also regrowing bladders
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 686.41 689.12 <o,f0,male> so there are now nine women walking around boston
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 689.48 690.73 <o,f0,male> with regrown bladders
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 691.18 695.03 <o,f0,male> which is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bags for the rest of your life
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 696.03 699.13 <o,f0,male> this is kind of getting boring right i mean you understand where this story 's going
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 708.84 711.65 <o,f0,male> they sprayed stem cells on to that heart from a mouse
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 712.08 715.42 <o,f0,male> those stem cells self organized and that heart started to beat
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 720.09 721.96 <o,f0,male> this may be one of the ultimate papers
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 722.52 729.15 <o,f0,male> this was done in japan and in the u s published at the same time and it rebooted skin cells into stem cells last year
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 730.86 735.13 <o,f0,male> that meant that you can take the stuff right here and turn it into almost anything in your body
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 736.16 740.12 <o,f0,male> and this is becoming common it's moving very quickly it's moving in a whole series of places
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 745.89 753.77 <o,f0,male> us of a certain age grew up expecting that by now we would have rosie the robot from the jetsons in our house and all we've got is a
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 768.78 770.76 <o,f0,male> the other one ran on flat threads
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 772.22 774.24 <o,f0,male> if you don't have a flat world that's not good
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 775.35 777.30 <o,f0,male> which is why the robot 's we're designing today
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 780.42 782.34 <o,f0,male> this is boston dynamics bigdog
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 792.57 807.05 <o,f0,male> you're talking to somebody on the other side of the wall and when you don't know if that thing is human or animal that's when computers have reached human intelligence this is not an intelligence turing rest but this is as close as you can get to a physical turing test
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 815.03 822.23 <o,f0,male> these are not the only interesting robots you've also got flies the size of flies that are being made by robert wood at harvard
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 837.92 844.38 <o,f0,male> in the last olympics this gentleman who had several world records in the special olympics tried to run in the normal
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 846.24 850.11 <o,f0,male> the only issue with oscar pistorius is he was born without bones in the lower part of his
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 851.60 853.69 <o,f0,male> he came within about a second of qualifying
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 854.30 857.92 <o,f0,male> he sued to be allowed to run and he won the
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 859.12 860.60 <o,f0,male> but didn't qualify by time
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 871.97 879.33 <o,f0,male> and as you bring these trends together and as you think of what it means to take people who are profoundly deaf who can now begin to hear
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 880.09 888.80 <o,f0,male> remember the evolution of hearing aids right i mean your grandparents had these great big cones and then your parents had these odd boxes that would squawk at odd times during dinner
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 900.72 904.97 <o,f0,male> in ten or fifteen machine generations they will and these are machine generations not human
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 907.35 911.17 <o,f0,male> about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and i can they'll be able to hear
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 911.75 925.31 <o,f0,male> maybe how bats sing or how whales talk or how dogs talk and other types of tonal scales they'll be able to focus their hearing they'll be able to increase the sensitivity decrease the sensitivity do a series of things that we can't do and the same thing is happening in
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 927.55 933.98 <o,f0,male> this is a group in germany that's beginning to engineer eyes so that people who are blind can begin to see light and dark
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 953.23 954.65 <o,f0,male> do stuff you and i can't do
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 956.19 957.92 <o,f0,male> all of these things are coming together
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 959.04 963.59 <o,f0,male> and it's a particularly important thing to understand as we worry about the flames of the present
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 965.16 966.43 <o,f0,male> to keep an eye on the future
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 967.52 968.52 <o,f0,male> and of course the future
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 991.97 996.34 <o,f0,male> there have actually been twenty two species of hominids that have been around
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 1002.68 1004.33 <o,f0,male> it is common for hominids
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 1006.68 1009.79 <o,f0,male> and that's the reason why as you look at the hominid fossil record
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 1012.65 1014.01 <o,f0,male> and heildelbergensis
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 1014.73 1017.99 <o,f0,male> and floresiensis and neanderthals
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 1018.74 1020.90 <o,f0,male> and homo sapiens all overlap
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 1023.41 1028.79 <o,f0,male> the common state of affairs is to have overlapping versions of hominids not one
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 1029.49 1043.34 <o,f0,male> and as you think of the implications of that here 's a brief history of the universe the universe was created thirteen point seven billion years ago and then you created all the stars and all the planets and all the galaxies and all the milky ways and then you created earth about four point five billion years ago
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 1044.09 1046.50 <o,f0,male> and then you got life about four billion years ago
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 1071.51 1073.65 <o,f0,male> that would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 1080.28 1082.69 <o,f0,male> so if that's not the purpose of the universe then what's next
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 1088.94 1092.10 <o,f0,male> i think what we're going to see is we're going to see a different species of hominid
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 1094.39 1097.02 <o,f0,male> we're going to move from a homo sapiens into a homo evolutis
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 1098.28 1103.31 <o,f0,male> and i think this isn't one thousand years out i think most of us are going to glance at it and our grandchildren are going to begin to
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 1104.32 1111.50 <o,f0,male> and a homo evolutis brings together these three trends into a hominid that takes direct and deliberate control over the evolution of his
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 1112.68 1114.66 <o,f0,male> species and other species
JuanEnriquez_2009 1 JuanEnriquez_2009 1117.27 1118.40 <o,f0,male> would be the ultimate reboot
