SharmeenObaidChinoy_2010U 1 SharmeenObaidChinoy_2010U 152.52 161.18 <o,f0,female> i in my research have seen that the taliban have perfected the way in which they recruit and train children and i think it's
SharmeenObaidChinoy_2010U 1 SharmeenObaidChinoy_2010U 161.93 170.28 <o,f0,female> step process step one is that the taliban prey on families that are large that are poor that live in rural areas
SharmeenObaidChinoy_2010U 1 SharmeenObaidChinoy_2010U 170.59 183.46 <o,f0,female> they separate the parents from the children by promising to provide food clothing shelter to these children then they ship them off hundreds of miles away to hard line schools that run along the taliban agenda
SharmeenObaidChinoy_2010U 1 SharmeenObaidChinoy_2010U 184.03 194.38 <o,f0,female> step two they teach the children the koran which is islam 's holiest book in arabic a language these children do not understand and cannot speak they rely very heavily
SharmeenObaidChinoy_2010U 1 SharmeenObaidChinoy_2010U 194.88 202.69 <o,f0,female> on teachers who i have personally seen distort the message to these children as and when it suits their purpose to
SharmeenObaidChinoy_2010U 1 SharmeenObaidChinoy_2010U 203.13 209.58 <o,f0,female> these children are explicitly forbidden from reading newspapers listening to radio reading any books
SharmeenObaidChinoy_2010U 1 SharmeenObaidChinoy_2010U 209.95 216.85 <o,f0,female> that the teachers do not prescribe them if any child is found violating these rules he is severely

SharmeenObaidChinoy_2010U 1 SharmeenObaidChinoy_2010U 239.07 246.28 <o,f0,female> they rarely allow them to play games they tell them that for eight hours at a time all they have to do is read the koran
SharmeenObaidChinoy_2010U 1 SharmeenObaidChinoy_2010U 246.63 255.03 <o,f0,female> the children are virtual prisoners they cannot leave they cannot go home their parents are so poor they have no resources to get them back
