NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 23.42 40.76 <o,f0,female> and let me tell you what it 's like to grow these cells in the lab i work in a lab where we take cells out of their native environment we plate them into dishes that we sometimes call petri dishes and we feed them sterilely of course with what we call cell culture media which is like their food
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 40.76 44.78 <o,f0,female> and we grow them in incubators why do i do this
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 82.44 85.26 <o,f0,female> copying nature in the lab
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 85.68 91.26 <o,f0,female> let 's take the example of the heart the topic of a lot of my research what makes the heart unique
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 91.26 108.2 <o,f0,female> well the heart beats rhythmically tirelessly faithfully we copy this in the lab by outfitting cell culture systems with electrodes these electrodes act like mini pacemakers to get the cells to contract in the lab what else do we know about the heart
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 108.37 114.77 <o,f0,female> well heart cells are pretty greedy nature feeds the heart cells in your body with a very very dense blood supply
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 114.77 132.6 <o,f0,female> in the lab we micro pattern channels in the biomaterials on which we grow the cells and this allows us to flow the cell culture media the cells food through the scaffolds where we 're growing the cells a lot like what you might expect from a capillary bed in the heart so this brings me to lesson number one
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 132.73 142.45 <o,f0,female> life can do a lot with very little let 's take the example of electrical stimulation let 's see how powerful just one of these essentials can be
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 142.45 149.94 <o,f0,female> on the left we see a tiny piece of beating heart tissue that i engineered from rat cells in the lab it 's about the size of a mini marshmallow
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 170.46 185.16 <o,f0,female> in a sense tissue engineers have a bit of an identity crisis here because structural engineers build bridges and big things computer engineers computers but what we are doing is actually building enabling technologies for the cells themselves
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 185.53 199.79 <o,f0,female> what does this mean for us let 's do something really simple let 's remind ourselves that cells are not an abstract concept let 's remember that our cells sustain our lives in a very real way
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 199.81 204.65 <o,f0,female> we are what we eat could easily be described as we are what our cells eat
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 204.66 209.7 <o,f0,female> and in the case of the flora in our gut these cells may not even be human
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 209.7 224.28 <o,f0,female> but it 's also worth noting that cells also mediate our experience of life behind every sound sight touch taste and smell is a corresponding set of cells that receive this information and interpret it for us
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 224.28 239.44 <o,f0,female> it begs the question shall we expand our sense of environmental stewardship to include the ecosystem of our own bodies i invite you to talk about this with me further and in the meantime i wish you luck may none of your non cancer cells
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 239.45 242.68 <o,f0,female> become endangered species thank you
