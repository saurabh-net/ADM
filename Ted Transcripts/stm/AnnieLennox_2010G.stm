AnnieLennox_2010G 1 AnnieLennox_2010G 66.14 71.33 <o,f0,female> it was quite a momentous occasion for all of us in that moment in time
AnnieLennox_2010G 1 AnnieLennox_2010G 71.53 73.64 <o,f0,female> mandela told the world 's press
AnnieLennox_2010G 1 AnnieLennox_2010G 74.66 78.17 <o,f0,female> that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country

AnnieLennox_2010G 1 AnnieLennox_2010G 82.46 89.12 <o,f0,female> a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims the most vulnerable of all
AnnieLennox_2010G 1 AnnieLennox_2010G 92.63 96.88 <o,f0,female> this was a huge impact on my mind because i am a woman
AnnieLennox_2010G 1 AnnieLennox_2010G 98.71 104.97 <o,f0,female> and i am a mother and i hadn 't realized that the hiv aids pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way
AnnieLennox_2010G 1 AnnieLennox_2010G 104.99 114.52 <o,f0,female> and so i committed when i left south africa when i left capetown i told myself this is going to be something that i have to talk about i have to serve
AnnieLennox_2010G 1 AnnieLennox_2010G 114.6 117.86 <o,f0,female> and so subsequently i

AnnieLennox_2010G 1 AnnieLennox_2010G 181.9 192.53 <o,f0,female> people who are living with hiv and in a way because of the stigma by wearing this t shirt i say yes we can talk about this issue it doesn 't have to be in the closet
