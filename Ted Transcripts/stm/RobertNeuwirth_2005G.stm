RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 19.48 30.63 <o,f0,male> so that 's kibera the largest squatter community in nairobi
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 53.39 63.91 <o,f0,male> they are what i consider to be the cities of tomorrow the new urban world now why do i say that to tell you about that i have to talk about this fellow here his name is julius
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 63.91 73.03 <o,f0,male> and i met julius the last week that i was living in kibera so i had been there almost three months
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 73.03 80.34 <o,f0,male> and i was touring around the city going to different squatter areas and julius was tagging along and he was bug eyed
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 80.34 95.35 <o,f0,male> and at certain points we were walking around he grabbed my hand for support which is something most kenyans would never consider doing they 're very polite and they don 't get so forward so quickly and i found out later that it was julius first
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 95.35 100.08 <o,f0,female> day in nairobi and
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 100.08 102.89 <o,f0,male> he 's one of many
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 102.89 110.28 <o,f0,male> so close to two hundred thousand people a day migrate from the rural to the urban areas
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 110.28 126.62 <o,f0,male> that 's and i 'm going to be fair to the statisticians who talked this morning not almost one point five million people a week but almost one point four million people a week but i 'm a journalist and we exaggerate so almost one point five million people a week close to seventy million people a year
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 126.62 138.15 <o,f0,male> and if you do the math that 's one hundred and thirty people every minute so that 'll be in the eighteen minutes that i 'm given to talk here between two and three thousand people will have journeyed to the cities
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 138.15 145.32 <o,f0,male> and here are the statistics today a billion squatters one in six people on the planet
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 158.41 162.14 <o,f0,male> these are the cities of the future
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 162.14 165.12 <o,f0,female> and
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 165.12 179.75 <o,f0,male> we have to engage them and i was thinking this morning of the good life and before i show you the rest of my presentation i 'm going to violate ted rules here and i 'm going to read you something from my book
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 179.75 191.72 <o,f0,male> as quickly as i can because i think it says something about reversing our perception of what we think the good life is
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 194.16 206.42 <o,f0,male> so the hut was made of corrugated metal set on a concrete pad it was a ten by ten cell armstrong o 'brian jr shared it with three other men
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 206.42 218.07 <o,f0,male> armstrong and his friends had no water they bought it from a nearby tap owner no toilet the families in this compound shared a single pit latrine and no sewers or sanitation
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 218.07 226.33 <o,f0,male> they did have electricity but it was illegal service tapped from someone else 's wires and could only power one feeble bulb
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 226.33 244.36 <o,f0,male> this was southland a small shanty community on the western side of nairobi kenya but it could 've been anywhere in the city because more than half the city of nairobi lives like this one point five million people stuffed into mud or metal huts with no services no toilets no rights
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 244.36 256.97 <o,f0,male> armstrong explained the brutal reality of their situation they paid one thousand five hundred shillings in rent about twenty bucks a month a relatively high price for a kenyan shantytown and they could not afford to be late with the money
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 256.97 265.34 <o,f0,male> in case you owe one month the landlord will come with his henchmen and bundle you out he will confiscate your things armstrong said not one month one day
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 265.34 281.65 <o,f0,male> his roommate hilary kibagendi onsomu who was cooking ugali the spongy white cornmeal concoction that is the staple food in the country cut into the conversation they called their landlord a wabenzi meaning that he is a person who has enough money to drive a mercedes benz
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 284.43 295.4 <o,f0,female> hilary served the ugali with a fry of meat and tomatoes the sun slammed down on the thin steel roof and we perspired as we ate after we finished armstrong straightened his tie
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 295.4 310.36 <o,f0,female> put on a wool sports jacket and we headed out into the glare outside a mound of garbage formed the border between southland and the adjacent legal neighborhood of langata it was perhaps eight feet tall forty feet long and ten feet wide
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 310.36 315.65 <o,f0,female> and it was set in a wider watery ooze as we passed two boys
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 331.41 339.08 <o,f0,female> but i was wrong once atop the pile one of the boys lowered his shorts squatted and defecated
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 339.08 342.32 <o,f0,female> the flies buzzed hungrily around his legs
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 342.32 351 <o,f0,female> when twenty families one hundred people or so share a single latrine a boy pooping on a garbage pile is perhaps no big thing
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 351 366.12 <o,f0,female> but it stood in jarring contrast to something armstrong had said as we were eating that he treasured the quality of life in his neighborhood for armstrong southland wasn 't constrained by its material conditions instead the human spirit
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 366.12 385.39 <o,f0,male> radiated out from the metal walls and garbage heaps to offer something no legal neighborhood could freedom this place is very addictive he had said it 's a simple life but nobody is restricting you nobody is controlling what you do once you have stayed here you cannot go back
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 385.61 399.45 <o,f0,male> he meant back beyond that mountain of trash back in the legal city of legal buildings with legal leases and legal rights once you have stayed here he said you can stay for the rest of your life
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 399.45 404.73 <o,f0,male> so he has hope and this is
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 415.43 421.9 <o,f0,male> this is getting ready for the monsoon in bombay india this is home improvement
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 421.9 426.35 <o,f0,male> putting plastic tarps on your roof this is
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 426.35 438.34 <o,f0,male> in rio de janeiro and it 's getting a bit better right we 're seeing scavenged terra cotta tile and little pieces of signs and plaster over the brick some color
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 438.34 446.94 <o,f0,male> and this is sulay montakaya 's house in sultanbelyi and it 's getting even better he 's got a fence he scavenged a door he 's got new
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 446.94 451.93 <o,f0,male> tile on the roof and then you get rocinha and you can see
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 451.93 471.1 <o,f0,male> that it 's getting even better the buildings here are multi story they develop you can see on the far right one where it seems to just stack on top of each other room after room after room and what people do is they develop their home on one or two stories and they sell their loggia or roof rights
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 471.1 480.49 <o,f0,male> and someone else builds on top of their building and then that person sells the roof rights and someone else builds on top of their building all of these buildings are made out of reinforced concrete and brick
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 480.49 494.37 <o,f0,male> and then you get sultanbelyi in turkey where it 's even built to a higher level of design the crud in the front is mattress stuffing and you see that all over turkey people dry out or air out their mattress stuffing on their roofs but
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 494.37 504.11 <o,f0,male> the green building on behind you can see that the top floor is not occupied so people are building with the possibility of expansion and it 's built to a pretty high standard of design
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 504.11 513.45 <o,f0,male> and then you finally get squatter homes like this which is built on the suburban model hey that 's a single family home in the squatter community that 's also in istanbul turkey
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 513.45 520.79 <o,f0,male> they 're quite vital places these communities this is the main drag of rocinha the estrada da gavea and there 's a bus route
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 520.79 530.84 <o,f0,male> that runs through it lots of people out on the street these communities in these cities are actually more vital than the illegal communities they have more things going on in them
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 530.84 539.72 <o,f0,male> this is a typical pathway in rocinha called a beco these are how you get around the community it 's on very steep ground they 're built on the hills inland from the beaches
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 539.72 556.26 <o,f0,male> in rio and you can see that the houses are just cantilevered over the natural obstructions so that 's just a rock in the hillside and these becos are normally very crowded and people hump furniture up them or refrigerators up them all sorts of things
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 556.26 561.22 <o,f0,male> beer is all carried in on your shoulders beer is a very important thing in brazil
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 561.22 571.13 <o,f0,male> this is commerce in kenya right along the train tracks so close to the train tracks that the merchants sometimes have to pull the merchandise out of the way
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 571.13 580.81 <o,f0,male> this is a marketplace also in kenya toi market lots of dealers in almost everything you want to buy those green things in the foreground are mangoes
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 580.81 596.38 <o,f0,male> this is a shopping street in kibera and you can see that there 's a soda dealer a health clinic two beauty salons a bar two grocery stores and a church and more it 's a typical downtown street
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 605.63 613.46 <o,f0,male> and what hotel means in kenya and india is an eating place so that 's a restaurant
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 613.46 628.67 <o,f0,male> people steal electrical power this is rio people tap in and they have thieves who are called grillos or crickets and they steal the electrical power and wire the neighborhood people burn trash
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 628.67 634.05 <o,f0,male> to get rid of the garbage and they dig their own sewer channels
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 634.05 637.23 <o,f0,male> talk about more plastic bags than plankton
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 637.23 640.81 <o,f0,male> and sometimes they have natural trash disposal
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 640.81 651.69 <o,f0,male> and when they have more money they cement their streets and they put in sewers and good water pipes and stuff like that this is water going to rio people
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 651.69 663.06 <o,f0,male> run their water pipes all over the place and that little hut right there has a pump in it and that 's what people do they steal electricity they install a pump and they tap into the water main and pump water up to their houses
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 663.06 669.07 <o,f0,male> so the question is how do you go from the mud hut village
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 669.07 678.13 <o,f0,male> to the more developed city to the even highly developed sultanbelyi i say there are two things one is people need a guarantee they won 't be evicted
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 695.58 701.76 <o,f0,male> there 's a whole variety of other reasons why property rights sometimes don 't work in these cases but they do need security of tenure
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 701.76 704.5 <o,f0,male> and they need access to politics
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 704.5 716.97 <o,f0,male> and that can mean two things that can mean community organizing from below but it can also mean possibilities from above and i say that because the system in turkey is
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 716.97 731.09 <o,f0,male> notable turkey has two great laws that protect squatters one is that it 's called gecekondu in turkish which means built overnight and if you build your house overnight in turkey you can 't be evicted without due process of law
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 733.5 736.25 <o,f0,male> and the second aspect is that
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 736.25 743.49 <o,f0,male> once you have two thousand people in the community you can petition the government to be recognized as a legal sub municipality
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 743.49 756.58 <o,f0,male> and when you 're a legal sub municipality you suddenly have politics you 're allowed to have an elected government collect taxes provide municipal services and that 's exactly what they do so these are the civic leaders of the future
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 756.58 763.82 <o,f0,male> the woman in the center is geeta jiwa she lives in one of those tents on the highway median in mumbai
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 763.82 772.96 <o,f0,male> that 's sureka gundi she also lives with her family on the tent along the same highway median they 're very outspoken they 're very active they can be community leaders
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 772.96 785.93 <o,f0,male> this woman is nine which means grandma in turkish and there were three old ladies who lived in that 's her self built house behind her and they 've lived there for thirty or forty years and they are the backbone of the community there
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 785.93 801.26 <o,f0,male> this is richard muthama peter and he is an itinerant street photographer in kibera he makes money taking pictures of the neighborhood and the people in the neighborhood and is a great resource in the community and finally my choice to run for mayor of rio
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 816.78 834.02 <o,f0,male> the message i take from what i read from the book from what armstrong said and from all these people is that these are neighborhoods the issue is not urban poverty the issue is not the larger over arching thing the issue is for us to recognize that these are neighborhoods this is a legitimate form of urban development and
RobertNeuwirth_2005G 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005G 834.04 841.27 <o,f0,male> that cities have to engage these residents because they are building the cities of the future thank you very much
