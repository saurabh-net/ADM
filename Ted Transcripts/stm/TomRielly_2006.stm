TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 19.44 25.84 <o,f0,male> over the last few years i've been had the opportunity to do this closing conference and
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 37.65 42.13 <o,f0,male> thought that there was absolutely no way in hell to top that
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 46.22 55.43 <o,f0,male> and i mean this without irony i think i can speak for everybody in the audience when i say that i wish to god that you were the president of the united
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 63.18 64.58 <o,f0,male> is the title of my talk today
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 68.59 82.16 <o,f0,male> i just want to give you a quick overview first of all please remember i'm completely politically correct and i mean everything with great affection if any of you have sensitive stomachs or are feeling queasy now is the time to check your blackberry
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 83.83 91.85 <o,f0,male> just to review this is my tedtalk we're going to do some jokes some gags
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 93.95 97.23 <o,f0,male> some little skits and then we're going to talk about the l one point
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 101.01 101.18 <o,f0,female> so
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 101.54 108.38 <o,f0,male> the one of the questions i ask myself is was this the most distressing ted ever let 's try and sum things up
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 125.61 127.17 <o,f0,male> and david pogue singing show
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 130.39 140.89 <o,f0,male> this is the most distressing ted ever i've been working with neil gershenfeld on next year 's ted bag and if the if the conference is anywhere near this distressing then it we're going to have a scream bag next year
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 156.60 157.02 <o,f0,male> here
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 171.68 172.88 <o,f0,male> back at ted university
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 185.91 194.90 <o,f0,male> so robert wright i don't know i felt like if there was anyone that helen needed to give antidepressants to it might have been him i want to deliberately interfere with his dopamine levels
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 196.50 211.21 <o,f0,male> he was talking about morality economy class morality is we want to bomb you back to the stone age business class morality is don't bomb japan they built my car and first class morality is don't bomb mexico they clean my house
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 213.43 215.07 <o,f0,male> yes it is politically incorrect
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 217.34 220.23 <o,f0,male> all right now i want to do a little bit of
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 230.03 230.24 <o,f0,male> the
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 242.49 245.87 <o,f0,male> i wanted to show you guys i wanted to talk about a revolutionary
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 246.02 253.89 <o,f0,male> new computer interface that lets you work with images just as easily as you as a completely natural
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 259.53 260.08 <o,f0,male> and you can
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 260.86 264.14 <o,f0,male> you can use really natural hand gestures to like
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 270.70 279.96 <o,f0,male> now we had a harvard professor here she was from harvard i just wanted to mention and and she was actually a professor from harvard and she was talking about
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 294.18 295.56 <o,f0,female> now
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 300.60 309.50 <o,f0,male> one of the things that is very important to me is to try and figure out what on earth am i here for and that's why i went out and i picked up a best selling business book
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 309.79 319.08 <o,f0,male> you know it basically uses as its central premise greek mythology and it's by a guy named pastor rick warren and it's called the porpoise
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 323.64 337.12 <o,f0,male> and rick is as a pagan god which i thought was kind of appropriate in a certain way and now we're going to have kind of a little more visualization about rick warren
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 353.67 356.39 <o,f0,female> right now
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 358.67 360.16 <o,f0,male> and green is daniel dennett
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 364.83 374.81 <o,f0,male> scales here are religiosity from zero percent or atheist to one hundred percent bible literally true and then this is books sold the logarithmic scale
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 379.74 384.02 <o,f0,male> thousand three hundred thousand three million thirty million three hundred million ok now they're duking it out now
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 387.04 392.26 <o,f0,male> of pulling ahead kind of pulling ahead yup and his installed base is getting a little bigger
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 398.05 403.17 <o,f0,male> but darwin 's dangerous idea is coming back it's coming back let me turn the trails on so you can see that a little bit
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 417.03 421.08 <o,f0,male> things that's very important is nicholas negroponte talked to us about one lap dance per
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 430.55 432.25 <o,f0,male> about one laptop per child
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 434.57 448.33 <o,f0,male> that are important for this revolutionary device i'll tell you a little bit about the design parameters and then i'll show it to you in person first of all it needs to be small it needs to be flat so it's transportable lightweight portable uses very very little power
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 448.86 461.80 <o,f0,male> very very high resolution has to be visible in bright daylight will work anywhere and broadly applicable across many platforms now we've actually done some research neil gershenfeld and the fab labs went out into the market
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 462.17 473.35 <o,f0,male> they did some research we came back and we think we have the perfect prototype of what the students in the field are actually asking for and here it is the one hundred dollar computer
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 480.90 484.30 <o,f0,male> ok ok ok ok excellent
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 486.82 499.14 <o,f0,male> now i bought this device from clifford stoll for about nine hundred bucks and he and his team of junior high school students were doing real science so we're trying to check and trying to douse here and see who uses marijuana
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 506.02 507.70 <o,f0,male> only if we open enough locker doors
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 512.65 525.04 <o,f0,male> ok now smallpox is an extremely distressing illness we had doctor larry brilliant talking about how we eradicated smallpox i wanted to show you the stages of smallpox we start this is day one
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 527.67 528.28 <o,f0,female> two
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 529.11 533.60 <o,f0,male> day three she gets a massively big pox on her shoulder day
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 533.80 539.95 <o,f0,male> three day four day five
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 543.48 550.09 <o,f0,male> good news is because i'm a trained medical professional i know that even though she'll be scarred for life she's going to make a full
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 557.86 568.66 <o,f0,male> now the good news about architects for humanity is they're really kind of the most amazing group they've been sponsoring a design competition to come up with innovative medical housing solutions clinic solutions
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 591.85 593.61 <o,f0,male> so i want to show you some prototypes
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 598.70 606.83 <o,f0,male> the u n you know they took twenty years just to add a flap to a tent but i think we have some more exciting things this is a home made entirely out of fruit roll ups
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 623.81 624.82 <o,f0,male> you can eat it
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 626.77 629.07 <o,f0,male> but the thing that i'm really really excited about
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 629.37 637.28 <o,f0,male> is this incredible granola house and the granola house has a special sun chip roof to collect water and recycle it
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 638.72 648.85 <o,f0,male> well on this side it has regular sour patch kids and gummy bears to let in the light but on this side it has sugary gummy bears to diffuse the light more slightly
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 649.28 653.34 <o,f0,male> and we we wanted just to show you what this might look like in situ
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 664.70 677.20 <o,f0,male> so einstein einstein tell me what's your favorite song no i said what's your favorite song
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 679.45 682.40 <o,f0,male> i said what's your favorite song free bird
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 692.91 697.48 <o,f0,male> ok so einstein what's your favorite singing group
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 700.66 703.33 <o,f0,male> you say that again what's your favorite singing group
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 723.72 725.37 <o,f0,male> have the sound up on the laptop please
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 742.60 744.68 <o,f0,male> it's a little hard to hear the whole message so i wanted to
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 746.96 749.62 <o,f0,male> so i wanted to help you a little bit
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 773.33 774.58 <o,f0,female> so
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 775.99 778.86 <o,f0,male> talked a lot about global warming but you know as jill said
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 788.48 798.54 <o,f0,male> so al i actually think i'm rather good at branding so i've tried to figure out a good design process to come up with a new term to replace global warming so we started with babel fish
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 799.66 808.45 <o,f0,male> we put in global warming and then we decided that we'd change it from english to dutch into het globale verwarmen from dutch to chinese into
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 810.79 814.73 <o,f0,male> chinese to portuguese aquecer se global then portuguese to
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 828.80 831.46 <o,f0,male> finally back into the english which is we're totally
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 861.06 862.02 <o,f0,female> the virgin mary
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 880.45 884.48 <o,f0,male> so first of all we decided that we needed about
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 884.69 892.05 <o,f0,male> one third bookstore one third google cafe about twenty percent registration eighty percent luxury hotel about five percent for restrooms
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 892.34 901.23 <o,f0,male> then of course we wanted to have the simulcast lounge the lobby and the steinbeck forum now let me show you how that literally translated into the design program so first
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 912.22 919.73 <o,f0,male> so we build this building on stilts then up here is where we're going to put the new steinbeck auditorium
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 933.00 937.68 <o,f0,male> and finally we're going to put the marriott hotel and the portola plaza on the top
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 941.99 951.53 <o,f0,male> now i don't know about you but sometimes i have these images in my head of separated at birth i don't know about you but when i see aubrey de grey i immediately go to gandalf the
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 956.63 966.73 <o,f0,male> ok now we've heard of course that we're all soldiers here so what i'd really really like you to do now is pick up your white piece of paper does everybody have their white piece of paper
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 975.34 979.27 <o,f0,male> we put up the elmo for a moment if we put up the elmo
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 979.53 983.20 <o,f0,male> then we'll get you know i'll give you a model that you can work from ok
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 986.57 990.21 <o,f0,male> and then i want you to fold that note into a paper airplane
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 991.81 995.14 <o,f0,male> and once you've folded it into a paper airplane i want you to take some anthrax
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 997.35 1002.44 <o,f0,male> and i want you to put that in the paper airplane and then i want you to throw it on jim young
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 1064.00 1064.19 <o,f0,male> can
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 1094.39 1096.31 <o,f0,male> to talk about global warming a little bit
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 1111.52 1113.14 <o,f0,male> black men ski
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 1122.42 1129.38 <o,f0,male> ten years later the snow packs eroded and if you notice the trees have started turning yellow the water level of the lake has started drying
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 1131.42 1134.10 <o,f0,male> a few years later there's no snow left at all
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 1134.67 1136.38 <o,f0,male> and all the trees have turned brown
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 1138.44 1149.46 <o,f0,male> this year unfortunately the lake bed 's turned into an absolute cracked dry bed and i fear if we do nothing for our planet in twenty years it's going to look like this
TomRielly_2006 1 TomRielly_2006 1167.17 1168.95 <o,f0,male> i wish i knew how to quit you
