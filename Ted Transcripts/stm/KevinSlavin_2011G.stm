KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 30.37 33.3 <o,f0,male> reshaped digitally all of the
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 33.3 42.82 <o,f0,male> contours of the mountains to follow the vicissitudes of the dow jones index so what you see that precipice that high precipice with the valley is the two thousand and eight
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 42.82 53.93 <o,f0,male> financial crisis the photo was made when we were deep in the valley over there i don 't know where we are now this is the hang seng index for hong kong and
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 53.93 56.72 <o,f0,male> similar topography i wonder why
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 78.79 83.59 <o,f0,male> extract and derive from the world to something that actually starts to shape it
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 83.59 92.67 <o,f0,male> the world around us and the world inside us and it 's specifically algorithms which are basically the math that computers use to decide stuff
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 93.11 102.96 <o,f0,male> they acquire the sensibility of truth because they repeat over and over again and they ossify and calcify and they become real
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 102.99 104.61 <o,f0,male> and i was thinking about this
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 104.88 114.16 <o,f0,male> of all places on a transatlantic flight a couple of years ago because i happened to be seated next to a hungarian physicist about my age and we were talking about
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 114.16 131.92 <o,f0,male> what life was like during the cold war for physicists in hungary and i said so what were you doing and he said well we were mostly breaking stealth and i said that 's a good job that 's interesting how does that work and to understand that you have to understand a little bit about how stealth works and so
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 131.92 144.06 <o,f0,male> this is an over simplification but basically it 's not like you can just pass a radar signal right through one hundred and fifty six tons of steel in the sky it 's not just going to disappear
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 144.5 150.86 <o,f0,male> but if you can take this big massive thing and you could turn it into
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 150.86 160.34 <o,f0,male> a million little things something like a flock of birds well then the radar that 's looking for that has to be able to see every flock of birds in the sky
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 160.63 164.18 <o,f0,male> and if you 're a radar that 's a really bad job
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 164.18 175.09 <o,f0,male> and he said yeah he said but that 's if you 're a radar so we didn 't use a radar we built a black box that was looking for electrical signals electronic communication
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 175.09 190.57 <o,f0,male> and whenever we saw a flock of birds that had electronic communication we thought probably has something to do with the americans and i said yeah that 's good so you 've effectively negated sixty years of aeronautic research what 's your
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 216.53 221.16 <o,f0,male> and it 's also sometimes called algo trading algorithmic trading
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 221.16 239.13 <o,f0,male> and algorithmic trading evolved in part because institutional traders have the same problems that the united states air force had which is that they 're moving these positions whether it 's proctor gamble or accenture whatever they 're moving a million shares of something through the market
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 239.13 245.16 <o,f0,male> and if they do that all at once it 's like playing poker and going all in right away you just tip your hand
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 245.16 255.4 <o,f0,male> and so they have to find a way and they use algorithms to do this to break up that big thing into a million little transactions and the magic and the horror
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 255.4 257.78 <o,f0,male> of that is that the same math
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 257.78 275.02 <o,f0,male> that you use to break up the big thing into a million little things can be used to find a million little things and sew them back together and figure out what 's actually happening in the market so if you need to have some image of what 's happening in the stock market right now what you can picture is a bunch of algorithms
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 275.02 280.52 <o,f0,male> that are basically programmed to hide and a bunch of algorithms that are programmed to go find them and
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 283.86 295.35 <o,f0,male> and that 's seventy percent of the united states stock market seventy percent of the operating system formerly known as your pension your mortgage
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 295.35 307.04 <o,f0,male> and what could go wrong what could go wrong is that a year ago nine percent of the entire market just disappears in five minutes and they called it the flash crash of two forty five
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 314.35 321.59 <o,f0,male> because nobody ordered it nobody asked for it nobody had any control over what was actually happening all they had
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 322.49 324.43 <o,f0,male> was just a monitor in front of them
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 325.24 329.59 <o,f0,male> that had the numbers on it and just a red button that said stop
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 330.98 335.49 <o,f0,male> and that 's the thing is that we 're writing things we 're writing these things that we can
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 335.49 341.27 <o,f0,male> no longer read and we 've rendered something illegible
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 341.27 353.12 <o,f0,male> and we 've lost the sense of what 's actually happening in this world that we 've made and we 're starting to make our way there 's a company in boston called nanex
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 353.12 368.54 <o,f0,male> and they use math and magic and i don 't know what and they reach into all the market data and they find actually sometimes some of these algorithms and when they find them they pull them out and they pin them to the wall like butterflies
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 368.54 380.44 <o,f0,male> and they do what we 've always done when confronted with huge amounts of data that we don 't understand which is that they give them a name and a story so this is one that they found they called
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 380.52 383.86 <o,f0,male> the knife
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 385.36 388.49 <o,f0,male> the carnival the boston shuffler
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 389.22 391.51 <o,f0,male> twilight
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 391.51 393.94 <o,f0,male> and the gag is that of course
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 393.94 413.47 <o,f0,male> these aren 't just running through the market you can find these kinds of things wherever you look once you learn how to look for them you can find it here this book about flies that you may have been looking at on amazon you may have noticed it when its price started at one point seven million dollars it 's out of print still
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 419.76 423.84 <o,f0,male> twenty three point six million dollars plus shipping and handling
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 423.84 442.02 <o,f0,male> and the question is nobody was buying or selling anything what was happening and you see this behavior on amazon as surely as you see it on wall street and when you see this kind of behavior what you see is the evidence of algorithms in conflict algorithms locked in loops with each other without any human oversight
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 442.02 448.13 <o,f0,male> without any adult supervision to say actually one point seven million is plenty
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 455.07 464.95 <o,f0,male> has gone through several different algorithms over the years they started with cinematch and they 've tried a bunch of others there 's dinosaur planet there 's gravity they 're using pragmatic chaos now pragmatic chaos
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 464.95 479.65 <o,f0,male> is like all of netflix algorithms trying to do the same thing it 's trying to get a grasp on you on the firmware inside the human skull so that it can recommend what movie you might want to watch next which is a very very difficult problem
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 479.65 484.81 <o,f0,male> but the difficulty of the problem and the fact that we don 't really quite have it down
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 484.81 494.5 <o,f0,male> it doesn 't take away from the effects pragmatic chaos has pragmatic chaos like all netflix algorithms determines in the end sixty percent
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 495.28 502.16 <o,f0,male> of what movies end up being rented so one piece of code with one idea about you
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 502.79 505.38 <o,f0,male> is responsible for sixty percent of those movies
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 505.38 509.9 <o,f0,male> but what if you could rate those movies before they get made
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 520.54 534.18 <o,f0,male> through there and they can tell you quantifiably that that 's a thirty million dollar movie or a two hundred million dollar movie and the thing is is that this isn 't google this isn 't information these aren 't financial stats this is culture
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 534.55 540.81 <o,f0,male> and what you see here or what you don 't really see normally is that these are the physics of culture
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 567.1 585.45 <o,f0,male> and they 're sort of like secret architects in your bedroom and the idea that architecture itself is somehow subject to algorithmic optimization is not far fetched it 's super real and it 's happening around you you feel it most when you 're in a sealed metal box
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 585.45 599.54 <o,f0,male> a new style elevator they 're called destination control elevators these are the ones where you have to press what floor you 're going to go to before you get in the elevator and it uses what 's called a bin packing algorithm so none of this mishegas of letting everybody go into whatever car they want
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 599.54 605.8 <o,f0,male> everybody who wants to go to the tenth floor goes into car two and everybody who wants to go to the
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 630.46 643.38 <o,f0,male> and this is what we 're designing for we 're designing for this machine dialect and how far can you take that how far can you take it you can take it really really far so let me take it back
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 643.45 651.87 <o,f0,male> to wall street because the algorithms of wall street are dependent on one quality above all else which is speed
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 652.16 665.41 <o,f0,male> and they operate on milliseconds and microseconds and just to give you a sense of what microseconds are it takes you five hundred thousand microseconds just to click a mouse but if you 're a wall street algorithm and you 're five microseconds behind
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 665.55 682.94 <o,f0,male> you 're a loser so if you were an algorithm you 'd look for an architect like the one that i met in frankfurt who was hollowing out a skyscraper throwing out all the furniture all the infrastructure for human use and just running steel on the floors to get ready for the stacks of servers to go in
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 686.37 689.48 <o,f0,male> to the internet and you think of
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 689.48 703.95 <o,f0,male> the internet as this kind of distributed system and of course it is but it 's distributed from places in new york this is where it 's distributed from the carrier hotel located on hudson street and this is really where the wires come right up into the city
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 703.95 721.05 <o,f0,male> and the reality is that the further away you are from that you 're a few microseconds behind every time these guys down on wall street marco polo and cherokee nation they 're eight microseconds behind all these guys going into the empty buildings being hollowed out
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 721.6 724.02 <o,f0,male> up around the carrier hotel
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 725.03 727.06 <o,f0,male> and that 's going to keep happening
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 727.36 734.58 <o,f0,male> we 're going to keep hollowing them out because you inch for inch and pound for pound and dollar for dollar
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 734.76 739.61 <o,f0,male> none of you could squeeze revenue out of that space like the boston shuffler could
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 741.08 742.73 <o,f0,male> but if you zoom out
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 743.41 745.01 <o,f0,male> if you zoom out
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 745.01 762.62 <o,f0,male> you would see an eight hundred and twenty five mile trench between new york city and chicago that 's been built over the last few years by a company called spread networks this is a fiber optic cable that was laid between those two cities to just be able to traffic one signal
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 762.82 769.37 <o,f0,male> thirty seven times faster than you can click a mouse just for these algorithms just for the
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 769.37 788.17 <o,f0,male> carnival and the knife and when you think about this that we 're running through the united states with dynamite and rock saws so that an algorithm can close the deal three microseconds faster all for a communications framework that no human will ever know
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 789.87 794.74 <o,f0,male> that 's a kind of manifest destiny and we 'll always look for a new frontier
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 794.9 798.62 <o,f0,male> unfortunately we have our work cut out for us
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 798.62 806.87 <o,f0,male> this is just theoretical this is some mathematicians at mit and the truth is i don 't really understand a lot of what they 're talking about
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 813.05 831.44 <o,f0,male> and what this map says is that if you 're trying to make money on the markets where the red dots are that 's where people are where the cities are you 're going to have to put the servers where the blue dots are to do that most effectively and the thing that you might have noticed about those blue dots is that a lot of them are in the middle of the ocean
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 843.08 844.7 <o,f0,male> if you 're an algorithm
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 855.76 859.49 <o,f0,male> with this kind of algorithmic efficiency and in that light
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 859.66 866.78 <o,f0,male> you go back and you look at michael najjar 's photographs and you realize that they 're not metaphor they 're prophecy
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 873.42 889.86 <o,f0,male> that we 're making and the landscape was always made by this sort of weird uneasy collaboration between nature and man but now there 's this third co evolutionary force algorithms the boston shuffler the carnival
KevinSlavin_2011G 1 KevinSlavin_2011G 889.98 892.63 <o,f0,male> and we will have to understand those as nature
