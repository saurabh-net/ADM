CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 13.35 23.68 <o,f0,female> i'd like to start off with is an observation which is that if i've learned anything over the last year it's that the supreme irony of publishing a book about slowness is that you have to go around promoting it really fast
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 24.25 33.50 <o,f0,female> i seem to spend most of my time these days you know zipping from city to city studio to studio interview to interview serving up the book in really tiny bite size chunks
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 34.01 45.67 <o,f0,female> because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down but they want to know how to slow down really quickly so so i did a spot on cnn the other day where i actually spent more time in makeup than i did talking on air
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 46.16 53.03 <o,f0,female> and i think that that's not really surprising though is it because that's kind of the world that we we live in now a world stuck in fast forward
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 53.34 62.08 <o,f0,female> a world obsessed with speed with doing everything faster with cramming more and more into less and less time every moment of the day feels like
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 62.44 72.38 <o,f0,female> a race against the clock to borrow a phrase from carrie fisher which is is in my bio there i'll just toss it out again these days even instant gratification takes too long and
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 73.11 84.01 <o,f0,female> if you think about how we to try to make things better what do we do no we speed them up don't we so we used to dial now we speed dial we used to read now we speed read we used to walk now we speed walk and of course we used to date and now we speed date
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 102.24 109.60 <o,f0,female> you know salute the sun but only want to give over about twenty minutes to it i mean these are sort of the extreme examples and they're amusing and
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 117.51 123.82 <o,f0,female> of the damage that this roadrunner form of living does to us we're so marinated in the culture of speed
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 124.26 134.96 <o,f0,female> that we almost fail to notice the toll it takes on every aspect of our lives on our health our diet our work our relationships the environment and our community and sometimes it takes
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 135.51 148.37 <o,f0,female> a a wake up call doesn't it to to alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lives instead of actually living them that we're living the fast life instead of the good life and i think for many people that wake up call takes the form of an illness you
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 148.82 161.07 <o,f0,female> a burn out or eventually the body says i can't take it anymore and throws in the towel or maybe a relationship goes up in smoke because we haven't had the time or the patience or the tranquility to be with the other person to listen to them
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 161.82 172.25 <o,f0,female> my wake up call came when i started reading bedtime stories to my son and i found that at the end of day i would go into his room and i just couldn't slow down you know i'd be speed reading the cat
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 179.98 187.34 <o,f0,female> so we would quarrel and what should have been the most relaxing the most intimate the most tender moment of the day when a dad sits down to read to
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 188.27 195.69 <o,f0,female> became instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills a clash between his speed and my or my speed and his slowness
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 196.37 206.36 <o,f0,female> and this went on for some time until i caught myself scanning a newspaper article with time saving tips for fast people and one of them made reference to a series of books called the one minute bedtime story
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 206.88 220.07 <o,f0,female> and i i wince saying those words now but my first reaction at the time was very different my first reflex was to say hallelujah what a great idea this is exactly what i'm looking for to speed up bedtime even more but thankfully
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 220.63 232.55 <o,f0,female> a light bulb went on over my head and my next reaction was very different and i took a step back and i thought whoa you know has it really come to this am i really in such a hurry that i'm prepared to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 253.18 261.03 <o,f0,female> the first was how did we get so fast and the second is is it possible or even desirable to slow down
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 261.60 272.52 <o,f0,female> now if you think about how our world got so accelerated the usual suspects rear their heads you think of you know urbanization consumerism the workplace technology but i think if you cut through
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 273.39 286.19 <o,f0,female> those forces you get to what might be the deeper driver the nub of the question which is how we think about time itself in other cultures time is cyclical it's seen as moving in great
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 287.63 295.88 <o,f0,female> unhurried circles it's always renewing and refreshing itself whereas in the west time is linear it's a finite resource it's always
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 296.27 304.75 <o,f0,female> draining away you either use it or lose it time is money as benjamin franklin said and i think what that that does to us psychologically
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 313.68 321.31 <o,f0,female> moment of every day into a race to the finish line a finish line incidentally that we never reach but a finish line nonetheless
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 332.40 343.48 <o,f0,female> tells us that faster is always better and that busier is best right across the world people are doing the unthinkable they're slowing down and finding that although conventional wisdom tells you that if you slow down you're roadkill
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 343.73 356.60 <o,f0,female> the opposite turns out to be true that by slowing down at the right moments people find that they do everything better they eat better they make love better they exercise better they work better they live better and in this kind of
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 357.26 370.22 <o,f0,female> cauldron of moments and places and acts of deceleration lie what a lot of people now refer to as the international slow movement now if you'll permit me a small act of hypocrisy
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 371.39 379.28 <o,f0,female> a very quick overview of what what's going on inside the slow movement if you think of food many of you will have heard of the slow food movement
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 390.43 399.17 <o,f0,female> and more health from our food when we cultivate cook and consume it at a reasonable pace i think also the explosion of
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 399.90 407.89 <o,f0,female> organic farming movement and the renaissance farmers markets is another are other illustrations of the fact that people are desperate to get away from
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 408.64 419.45 <o,f0,female> eating and cooking and cultivating their food on an industrial timetable they want to get back to slower rhythms and out of the slow food movement has grown something called the slow cities movement
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 420.05 434.00 <o,f0,female> which has started in italy but has spread right across europe and beyond and in this towns begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape so that people are encouraged to to slow down and smell the roses and connect with one another so they might
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 443.04 454.51 <o,f0,female> becomes officially a slow city it's kind of like a philosophical declaration it's saying to the rest of world and to the people in that town that we believe that in the twenty one st century slowness has a role to play
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 454.99 465.87 <o,f0,female> in medicine i think a lot of people are deeply disillusioned with the kind of quick fix mentality you find in conventional medicine and millions of them around the world are turning to to complementary and alternative forms of medicine
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 466.60 479.95 <o,f0,female> which tend to tap into sort of slower gentler more holistic forms of healing now obviously the jury is out on many of these complementary therapies and i personally doubt that the coffee enema will ever you know gain mainstream approval
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 481.64 489.01 <o,f0,female> other treatments such as acupuncture and massage and even just relaxation clearly have some kind of benefit and blue chip medical colleges everywhere
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 506.65 516.33 <o,f0,female> and i saw a magazine a men 's magazine and it said on the front how to bring your partner to orgasm in thirty seconds so you know even sex is on a stopwatch these days
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 516.90 526.14 <o,f0,female> now you know i like a quickie as much as the next person but i think that there's an awful lot to be gained from slow sex from slowing down in the bedroom you
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 526.60 533.64 <o,f0,female> you tap into that those deeper sort of you know psychological emotional spiritual currents and you get a better orgasm
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 533.88 542.36 <o,f0,female> with the buildup you can get more bang for your buck let 's say i mean the pointer sisters said it most eloquently didn't they when they sang the praises of a lover with a slow hand
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 542.99 553.78 <o,f0,female> now we all laughed at sting a few years ago when he went tantric but you fast forward a few years and now you find couples of all ages flocking to workshops or maybe just on their own in their own bedrooms finding ways
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 554.09 566.62 <o,f0,female> to put on the brakes and have better sex and of course in italy where i mean italians always seem to know where to find their pleasure they've launched an official slow sex movement the workplace
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 567.65 580.78 <o,f0,female> right across much of the world north america being a notable exception working hours have been coming down and europe is an example of that and people finding that their quality of life improves as they're working less and also that their
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 581.34 589.04 <o,f0,female> hourly productivity goes up now clearly there are problems with the thirty five hour work week in france too much too soon too rigid but other countries
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 589.32 597.05 <o,f0,female> in europe notably the nordic countries are showing that it's possible to have a kick ass economy without being a workaholic
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 597.86 608.28 <o,f0,female> and norway sweden denmark and finland now rank among the top six most competitive nations on earth and they work the kind of hours that would make the average american weep with envy
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 608.83 618.04 <o,f0,female> and if you go beyond sort of the country level down at the micro company level more and more companies now are realizing that they need to allow their staff either to work fewer hours or just
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 618.83 626.09 <o,f0,female> to take a lunch break or to go sit in a quiet room to switch off their blackberrys you at the back
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 627.11 636.14 <o,f0,female> mobile phones during the work day or on the weekend so that they have time to recharge and to for the brain to slide into that kind of creative mode of thought
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 637.73 648.70 <o,f0,female> it's not just though these days adults who overwork though is it it's children too i'm thirty seven and my childhood ended in the mid eighties and i look at kids now and i'm just amazed by the way they
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 649.06 655.53 <o,f0,female> race around with more homework more tutoring more extracurriculars than we would ever have conceived of a generation ago
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 655.95 664.13 <o,f0,female> and some of the most heartrending emails that i get on my website are actually from adolescents hovering on the edge of burnout pleading with me
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 665.11 671.46 <o,f0,female> to their parents to help them slow down to help them get off this full throttle treadmill
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 695.93 703.66 <o,f0,female> less can be more so there was a case up in scotland recently where a fee paying high achieving private school banned homework for everyone under the age of thirteen
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 704.16 712.28 <o,f0,female> and the high achieving parents freaked out and said what are you you know our kids will fall the headmaster said no no your children need to slow down at the end of the day and just this last month
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 721.72 732.41 <o,f0,female> the elite universities who are often cited as the reason that people drive their kids and hothouse them so much are starting to notice the caliber of students coming to them is falling these kids have wonderful marks
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 743.16 754.83 <o,f0,female> and so what these ivy league schools and oxford and cambridge and so on are starting to send a message to parents and students that they need to put on the brakes a little bit and in harvard for instance they send out a letter to undergraduates freshmen
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 755.91 767.74 <o,f0,female> telling them that they'll get more out of life and more out of harvard if they put on the brakes if they do less but give time to things the time that things need to enjoy them to savor them and even if they sometimes do nothing at all and that letter
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 768.01 780.02 <o,f0,female> is called very revealing i think slow down with an exclamation mark on the end so wherever you look the message it seems to me is the same that less is very often more that slower is very often
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 780.55 793.88 <o,f0,female> better but that said of course it's not that easy to slow down is it i mean you heard that i got a speeding ticket while i was researching my book on the benefits of slowness and that's true but that's not all of it i was actually en route to a dinner held by slow food at the time
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 794.46 802.11 <o,f0,male> and if that's not shaming enough i got that ticket in italy and if any of you have ever driven on an italian highway you'll have a pretty good idea of how fast i was going
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 805.91 814.74 <o,f0,female> but why is it so hard to slow down i think there are various reasons one is that that speed is fun you know speed is sexy it's all that adrenaline rush it's hard to give it up
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 815.68 823.33 <o,f0,female> i think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger deeper questions we fill our head with distraction with
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 823.86 830.64 <o,f0,female> so that we don't have to ask am i well am i happy are my children growing up right are politicians making good decisions on my
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 849.95 858.00 <o,f0,female> with being stupid i guess what the slow movement the purpose of the slow movement or its main goal really is to tackle that taboo and to say that that yes
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 870.48 881.44 <o,f0,female> but the new idea the sort of revolutionary idea of the slow movement is that there is such a thing as good slow too and good slow is you know taking the time to eat a meal with your family with the tv switched off
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 892.24 902.59 <o,f0,female> and savor your life now one of the things that i found most uplifting about all of this stuff that's happened around the book since it came out is the reaction to it
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 902.95 911.09 <o,f0,female> and i knew that when my book on slowness came out it would be welcomed by the new age brigade but it's also been taken up with great gusto by the corporate world
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 912.60 921.62 <o,f0,female> business press but also you know big companies and leadership organizations because people at the top of the chain people like you i think are starting to realize that there's too much
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 931.04 944.23 <o,f0,female> another encouraging sign i think is that it's not just in the developed world that this idea 's been taken up in the developing world in countries that are on the verge of making that leap into first world status china brazil thailand poland and so on these countries are
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 944.53 953.10 <o,f0,female> have embraced the idea of the slow movement many people in them and there's a debate going on in their media on the streets because i think they're looking at the west and
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 953.96 961.83 <o,f0,female> we like that aspect of what you've got but we're not so sure about that so all of that said is it i guess
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 962.80 971.86 <o,f0,female> is it possible that's really the main question before us today is it possible to slow down and i i'm happy to be able to say to you that the answer is a resounding
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 972.27 979.60 <o,f0,female> yes and i present myself as exhibit a a kind of reformed and rehabilitated speed aholic
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 979.99 989.44 <o,f0,female> i still love speed you know i live in london and i work as a journalist and i enjoy the buzz and the busy ness and the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things i play
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 1000.43 1012.99 <o,f0,female> and what that means is that i don't i no longer overload myself gratuitously my default mode is no longer to be a rush aholic
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 1014.34 1024.05 <o,f0,female> i no longer hear time 's winged chariot drawing near or at least not as much as i did before i can actually hear it now because i see my time is ticking off and the
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 1025.58 1036.42 <o,f0,female> of all of that is that i actually feel a lot happier healthier more productive than i ever have i feel like i'm i'm living my life rather than actually just racing
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 1037.18 1046.08 <o,f0,female> through it and perhaps the most important measure of the success of this is that i feel that my relationships are a lot deeper richer
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 1046.65 1055.18 <o,f0,female> stronger and for me the i guess the litmus test for whether this would work and what it would mean was always going to be bedtime stories because that's sort of where the
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 1055.50 1067.19 <o,f0,female> the journey began and there too the news is rosy i you know at the end of the day i go into my son 's room i don't wear a watch i switch off my computer so i can't hear the email pinging into the basket and i just
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 1067.55 1077.30 <o,f0,female> slow down to his pace and and we read and because children have their own tempo and internal clock they don't do quality time where you schedule ten minutes for them to open up to you
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 1077.70 1083.79 <o,f0,female> they need you to move at their rhythm i find that ten minutes into a story you know my son will suddenly say you know
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 1093.27 1100.26 <o,f0,female> used to be a kind of a box on my to do list something that i dreaded because it was so slow and i had to get through it quickly it's become
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 1100.44 1109.26 <o,f0,female> my reward at the end of the day something i really i really cherish and i have a kind of hollywood ending to my talk this afternoon which goes a little bit like this
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 1109.86 1116.75 <o,f0,female> a few months ago i was getting ready to go on another book tour and i had my bags packed i was downstairs by the front door
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 1127.88 1138.20 <o,f0,female> character tintin on the front and he said to me or he handed this to me and and i read it and it said to daddy love benjamin and i thought aah that's really sweet you know is
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 1139.40 1149.08 <o,f0,female> a good luck on the book tour card and he said no no no daddy this is a card for being the best story reader in the world and i thought yeah you know this slowing down thing thank you very much
