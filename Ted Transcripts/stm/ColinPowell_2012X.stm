ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 32.86 40.26 <o,f0,male> this was last wednesday afternoon at a school in brooklyn new york at cristo rey high school run by the jesuits
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 40.72 43.67 <o,f0,male> and i was talking to this group of students and take a look at them
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 44.2 49.51 <o,f0,male> they were around me in three directions you 'll noticed that almost all of them are minority
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 49.55 57.59 <o,f0,male> you 'll notice that the building is rather austere it 's an old new york school building nothing fancy they still have old blackboards and whatnot
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 66.53 70.15 <o,f0,male> twenty two people are graduating and all twenty two are going to college
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 70.45 74.41 <o,f0,male> they all come from homes where there is for the most part just one
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 74.56 90.56 <o,f0,male> person in the home usually the mother or the grandmother and that 's it and they come here for their education and for their structure now i had this picture taken and it was put up on my facebook page last week and somebody wrote in
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 90.87 93.65 <o,f0,male> why does he have him standing at attention like that
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 94.32 96.96 <o,f0,male> and then they said but he looks good
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 101.65 108.28 <o,f0,male> and the trick i play in all of my school appearances is that when i get through with my little homily to the kids
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 108.28 116.67 <o,f0,male> i then invite them to ask questions and when they raise their hands i say come up and i make them come up and stand in front of me i make them stand at attention like a soldier
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 130.63 136.49 <o,f0,male> this young man his name is his last name cruz he loved it that 's all over his facebook page and it 's gone viral
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 140.07 146.32 <o,f0,male> people think i 'm being unkind to this kid no we 're having a little fun and the thing about it i 've done this for years
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 208.42 210.19 <o,f0,male> environment of structure
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 210.73 212.61 <o,f0,male> put them in ranks
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 235.45 238.32 <o,f0,male> and telling them to do all kinds of awful things
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 238.32 241.64 <o,f0,male> but then the most amazing thing happens over time
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 242.06 247.98 <o,f0,male> once that structure is developed once they understand the reason for something
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 248.25 251.95 <o,f0,male> once they understand mama ain 't here
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 278.14 285.52 <o,f0,male> but you 'd be amazed at what you can do with them once you put them in that structure in eighteen weeks they have a skill
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 285.52 287.39 <o,f0,male> they are mature
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 287.82 292.64 <o,f0,male> and you know what they come to admire the drill sergeant and they never forget the drill sergeant
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 292.9 298.15 <o,f0,male> they come to respect him and so we need more of this kind of
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 298.2 300.86 <o,f0,male> structure and respect in the lives of our children
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 314.78 316.65 <o,f0,male> that isn 't the whole answer
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 316.65 325.69 <o,f0,male> it 's part of the answer but the real answer begins with bringing a child to the school with structure in that child 's heart and soul to begin with
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 326.26 333.82 <o,f0,male> when does the learning process begin does it begin in first grade no no it begins the first time a child in a mother 's arms
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 334.11 341.79 <o,f0,male> looks up at the mother and says oh this must be my mother she 's the one who feeds me
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 342.29 349.86 <o,f0,male> oh yeah when i don 't feel so good down there she takes care of me it 's her language i will learn
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 350.3 356.49 <o,f0,male> and at that moment they shut out all the other languages that they could be learning at that age but by three months
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 373.76 376.43 <o,f0,male> you are different from every other child in the world
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 376.78 378.3 <o,f0,male> and we 're going to read to you
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 402.4 409.82 <o,f0,male> and i watched my own young grandchildren now come along and they 're much to the distress of my children they are
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 423.69 425.23 <o,f0,male> we need preschool
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 425.86 427.43 <o,f0,male> we need head start
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 427.8 429.42 <o,f0,male> we need prenatal care
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 430.08 433.77 <o,f0,male> the education process begins even before the child is born
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 448.38 450.15 <o,f0,male> and then they realize
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 456.21 460.8 <o,f0,male> and by the third grade the kids who didn 't have that structure
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 460.83 462.87 <o,f0,male> and minding in the beginning
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 494.24 512.7 <o,f0,male> i was privileged to have that kind of good start i was not a great student i was a public school kid in new york city and i didn 't do well at all i have my entire new york city board of education transcript from kindergarten through college i wanted it when i was writing my first book
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 512.7 515.82 <o,f0,male> i wanted to see if my memory was correct and my god it was
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 517.95 519.74 <o,f0,male> straight c everywhere
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 520.63 540.14 <o,f0,male> and i finally bounced through high school got into the city college of new york with a seventy eight point three average which i shouldn 't have been allowed in with and then i started out in engineering and that only lasted six months laughter and then i went into geology rocks for jocks this is easy and then i found rotc
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 560.54 565.94 <o,f0,male> and when you find those two things together man you got it that 's what 's going on and that 's what i found
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 565.94 572.33 <o,f0,male> now the authorities at ccny were getting tired of me being there i 'd been there four and a half going on five years and my grades were not
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 572.86 574.46 <o,f0,male> doing particularly well
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 611.15 618.18 <o,f0,male> and lo and behold many years later i 'm considered one of the greatest sons the city college of new york has ever had
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 631.53 637.61 <o,f0,male> country that no matter where you start you have opportunities so long as you believe in yourself
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 638.28 642.92 <o,f0,male> you believe in the society and the country and you believe
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 649.7 652.54 <o,f0,male> but it begins with the gift of a good start
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 657.13 658.66 <o,f0,male> at the earliest age
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 658.93 661.09 <o,f0,male> we 're going to be running into difficulties
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 661.53 669.71 <o,f0,male> it 's why we have a dropout rate of roughly twenty five percent overall and almost fifty percent of our minority population living
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 669.78 671.6 <o,f0,male> in low income areas
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 671.86 674.32 <o,f0,male> because they 're not getting the gift of a good start
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 675.3 683.5 <o,f0,male> my gift of a good start was not only being in a nice family a good family but having a family that said to me now listen
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 683.76 686.32 <o,f0,male> we came to this country in banana boats
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 689.88 693.8 <o,f0,male> we worked like dogs down in the garment industry every single day
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 699.68 701.64 <o,f0,male> and don 't even think about dropping out
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 701.91 704.65 <o,f0,male> if i had ever gone home and told those immigrant people
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 716.26 719.75 <o,f0,male> they had expectations for all of the cousins and the extended
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 719.75 722.05 <o,f0,male> family of immigrants that lived in the south bronx
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 722.61 725.6 <o,f0,male> but they had more than just expectations for
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 725.79 730.88 <o,f0,male> they stuck into our hearts like a dagger a sense of shame
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 731.45 733.43 <o,f0,male> don 't you shame this family
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 734.47 750.75 <o,f0,male> sometimes i would get in trouble and my parents were coming home and i was in my room waiting for what 's going to happen and i would sit there saying to myself okay look take the belt and hit me but god don 't give me that shame the family bit again it devastated me when my mother did that to me
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 750.75 758.12 <o,f0,male> and i also had this extended network children need a network children need to be part of a tribe a family a community
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 758.12 772.21 <o,f0,male> in my case it was aunts who lived in all of these tenement buildings i don 't know how many of you are new yorkers but there were these tenement buildings and these women were always hanging out one of the windows leaning on a pillow they never left
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 788.85 790.89 <o,f0,male> and they didn 't care
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 791.18 793.15 <o,f0,male> whether you became
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 795.42 798.12 <o,f0,male> and they never expected any generals in the family
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 798.76 802.45 <o,f0,male> as long as you got an education and then you got a job
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 818.46 821.02 <o,f0,male> culture back into our
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 821.25 822.97 <o,f0,male> families all families
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 823.23 828.58 <o,f0,male> and it is so important that all of you here today who are successful people
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 829.26 837.84 <o,f0,male> and i 'm sure have wonderful families and children and grandchildren it 's not enough you 've got to reach out and back and find kids like mr cruz
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 846.25 856.77 <o,f0,male> if you work with your school system make sure it 's the best school system and not just your kid 's school but the school uptown in harlem not just downtown montessori on the west side
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 870.61 873.49 <o,f0,male> those that we call minorities now are going to be the majority
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 873.74 881.03 <o,f0,male> and we have to make sure that they are ready to be the majority we have to make sure they 're ready to be the leaders of this great country of ours
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 881.62 884.73 <o,f0,male> a country that is like no other
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 884.88 898.98 <o,f0,male> a country that amazes me every single day a country that 's fractious we 're always arguing with each other that 's how the system 's supposed to work it 's a country of such contrasts but it 's a nation of nations we touch every nation every nation touches us
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 899.83 904.47 <o,f0,male> we are a nation of immigrants that 's why we need sound immigration policy
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 911.2 915.97 <o,f0,male> or we can send back home with an education to help their people rise up out of poverty
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 931.27 934.27 <o,f0,male> and get a hot dog from the immigrant pushcart peddler
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 934.69 936.4 <o,f0,male> gotta have a dirty water dog
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 938.13 941.96 <o,f0,male> and no matter where i am or what i 'm doing i 've got to do that
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 951.25 955.99 <o,f0,male> walking up the street and i would hit around fifty fifth street looking for the immigrant pushcart
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 956.2 959.01 <o,f0,male> in those days i had five bodyguards around me
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 981.08 985.58 <o,f0,male> i 've got no bodyguards i 've got no police cars i 've got nothing but i gotta have my hot dog
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 985.58 989.51 <o,f0,male> i did it just last week it was on a tuesday evening
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 990.06 995.3 <o,f0,male> down by columbus circle and the scene repeats itself so often
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 1018.29 1020.58 <o,f0,female> but now i 'm an american sir thank you
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 1029.68 1037.54 <o,f0,male> so we are still that magnificent country but we are fueled by young people coming up from every land in the world
ColinPowell_2012X 1 ColinPowell_2012X 1037.87 1047.11 <o,f0,male> and it is our obligation as contributing citizens to this wonderful country of ours to make sure that no child gets left behind thank you very much
