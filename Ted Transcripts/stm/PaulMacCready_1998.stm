PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 16.09 20.67 <o,f0,male> this is the era of environment or biology
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 21.25 25.33 <o,f0,male> or information technology well it's the era of a lot of different things that we're in right now
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 25.98 32.18 <o,f0,male> but one thing for sure it's the era of change there's more change going on than ever has occurred in the history of
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 34.36 39.00 <o,f0,male> human life on earth and you all sort of know it but it's hard to get it so that you
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 39.65 45.10 <o,f0,female> really understand it and i've tried to put together something that's a good start for this
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 48.74 54.81 <o,f0,male> though the color doesn't come out and what i'm concerned with is the little fifty year time bubble that you are
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 63.92 66.18 <o,f0,male> time bubble you kind of move along in
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 66.98 73.46 <o,f0,male> in that fifty years if you look at the population curve you find the population of humans on the earth more
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 74.89 81.94 <o,f0,male> and we're up three and a half times since i was born and when you have a new baby by the time that kid gets out of
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 83.92 84.88 <o,f0,male> more people will be added
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 93.83 96.31 <o,f0,male> the human part now human related to
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 114.31 117.28 <o,f0,male> how does it balance well certainly ten thousand years ago
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 118.60 120.50 <o,f0,male> civilization 's beginning the human
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 125.83 129.81 <o,f0,male> this curve and you see whiter spot in the middle that's your fifty
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 132.38 144.37 <o,f0,male> humans livestock and pets are now ninety seven percent of that integrated total mass on earth and all wild nature is three percent we have won the next generation doesn't even have to worry about this game it is over
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 145.21 148.45 <o,f0,male> and the biggest problem came the last twenty five
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 148.96 157.13 <o,f0,male> years it went from twenty five percent up to that ninety seven percent and this really is a sobering picture in realizing we humans
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 157.68 162.37 <o,f0,male> are in charge of life on earth we're like the capricious gods of old greek
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 163.99 166.45 <o,f0,male> kind of playing with life
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 167.35 177.51 <o,f0,male> and not a great deal of wisdom injected into it now the third curve is information technology this is moore 's law plotted here which relates to
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 187.76 189.88 <o,f0,male> what's important is it just goes straight up through the top
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 192.06 193.66 <o,f0,male> has no real
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 194.27 200.07 <o,f0,male> limits to it now try and contrast these this is the size of the earth going through that same
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 203.47 214.99 <o,f0,male> to make it really clear i've put all four on one graph there's no need to see the little detailed words on it that first one is humans versus nature
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 217.66 231.61 <o,f0,male> human population and so if you're looking for growth industries to get into that's not a good one protecting natural creatures human population is going up it's going to continue for quite a while good business in obstetricians morticians
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 239.85 252.75 <o,f0,male> fed transported housed and so on and the information technology which connects to our brains has no limit now that is a wonderful field to be in you're looking for growth opportunity it's just going up through the roof
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 254.54 260.28 <o,f0,male> size of the earth somehow making these all compatible with the earth looks like a pretty bad industry to be
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 262.96 265.01 <o,f0,male> the stage out of all this i find
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 266.85 270.33 <o,f0,male> reasons i don't understand i really do have a goal and the goal is that
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 270.78 282.02 <o,f0,male> the world be desirable and sustainable when my kids reach my age and i think that's in other words the next generation i think that's a goal that we probably all share i think it's a hopeless goal technologically it's
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 295.00 298.01 <o,f0,male> except they're there and we have to deal
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 300.45 307.70 <o,f0,male> i spend about fifteen percent of my time trying to save the world the other eighty five percent the usual and whatever else we devote
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 308.76 316.30 <o,f0,male> to and in that fifteen percent the main focus is on human mind thinking skills somehow trying to unleash kids
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 316.70 329.58 <o,f0,male> the straightjacket of schools which is putting information and dogma into them get them so they really think ask tough questions argue about serious subjects don't believe everything that's in the book think broadly or creative
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 329.89 341.70 <o,f0,male> they can be our school systems are very flawed and do not reward you for the things that are important in life or for the survival of civilization they reward you for a lot of learning and sopping up
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 344.16 345.96 <o,f0,male> we can't go into that today because there isn't
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 348.17 352.62 <o,f0,male> broad subject one thing for sure in the future there is an essential
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 357.45 371.46 <o,f0,male> aspect which is doing more with less we've got to be doing things with more efficiency using less energy less material your great great grandparents got by on muscle power and yet we all think there's this huge power that's essential
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 372.01 380.02 <o,f0,male> for our lifestyle and with all the wonderful technology we have we can do things that are much more efficient
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 381.20 382.55 <o,f0,male> conserve recycle
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 383.53 386.04 <o,f0,male> let me just rush through very quickly things that
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 386.17 391.50 <o,f0,male> we've done human powered airplane gossamer condor sort of started me in this direction
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 402.26 408.24 <o,f0,male> odd planes and creatures here 's a giant flying replica of a pterosaur that has no
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 409.61 420.08 <o,f0,male> to have it fly straight is like trying to shoot an arrow with the feathered end forward it was a tough job and boy it made me have a lot of respect for nature this was the full size of the
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 420.59 434.60 <o,f0,male> original creature we did things on land in the air on water vehicles of all different kinds usually with some electronics or electric power systems in them i find they're all the same i don't care what the whether its land air
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 435.02 446.10 <o,f0,male> or water i'll be focusing on the air here this is a solar powered airplane one hundred and sixty five miles carrying a person from france to england as a symbol that solar power is going to be an important part
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 447.39 456.55 <o,f0,male> future then we did the solar car for general motors the sunracer that won the race in australia we got a lot of people thinking about electric cars what you could do with it
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 456.64 465.77 <o,f0,male> a few years later when we suggested to gm now is the time and we could do a thing called the impact they sponsored it and here 's the impact that we developed with them on their
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 466.73 470.83 <o,f0,male> the demonstrator and they put huge effort into turning it into a commercial
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 471.58 481.57 <o,f0,male> product with that preamble let 's show the first two minute video tape which shows a little airplane for surveillance and moving to a giant airplane
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 484.20 495.82 <o,f0,male> a tiny airplane the av pointer serves for surveillance in effect a pair of roving eyeglasses a cutting edge example of where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote from the vehicle
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 496.41 499.25 <o,f0,male> it is convenient to carry assemble and launch by hand
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 503.51 510.57 <o,f0,male> it sends high resolution video pictures back to the operator with onboard gps it can navigate autonomously
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 510.96 512.58 <o,f0,male> and it is rugged enough to self
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 515.82 522.84 <o,f0,male> the modern sailplane is superbly efficient some can glide as flat as sixty feet forward for every foot of descent
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 531.10 536.05 <o,f0,male> humans and soaring birds have found nature to be generous in providing replenishable energy
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 546.71 555.15 <o,f0,male> the solar challenger was made to serve as a symbol that photovoltaic cells can produce real power and will be part of the world 's energy future
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 567.64 574.78 <o,f0,male> the message from all these vehicles is that ideas and technology can be harnessed to produce remarkable gains in doing more
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 576.77 585.12 <o,f0,male> gains that can help us attain a desirable balance between technology and nature the stakes are high as we speed toward a challenging future
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 588.80 591.54 <o,f0,male> there are no passengers on spaceship earth only
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 594.96 596.03 <o,f0,male> must do more with
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 599.55 607.69 <o,f0,female> we could have the second video the one minute put in as quickly as you can which this will show the
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 609.92 616.72 <o,f0,female> pathfinder airplane in some flights this past year in hawaii and
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 616.96 624.08 <o,f0,male> will show a sequence of some of the beauty behind it after it had just flown to seventy one thousand five hundred and thirty feet
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 624.40 633.82 <o,f0,male> higher than any propeller airplane has ever flown it's amazing just on the puny power of the sun by having a super lightweight plane you're able to get it up there
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 636.16 646.73 <o,f0,male> it's part of a long term program nasa sponsored and we worked very closely with the whole thing being a team effort and with wonderful
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 647.86 661.75 <o,f0,male> results like that flight and we're working on a bigger plane two hundred and twenty foot span and an intermediate size one with a regenerative fuel cell that can store excess energy during the day feed it back at night and stay up sixty five thousand feet for months at a time
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 681.28 681.55 <o,f0,female> a
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 702.40 713.12 <o,f0,male> this is starting made the experience enjoyable and unforgettable we have real time ir scans going out through internet while the plane is flying and it's exploring without
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 750.51 762.90 <o,f0,female> in the video you saw that nine pound or eight pound pointer airplane surveillance drone that keenan has developed and just done a remarkable job where some have servos that have gotten down to
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 763.22 772.06 <o,f0,female> oh eighteen or twenty five grams his weigh one third of a gram and what he 's going to bring out here is a surveillance drone
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 780.03 788.45 <o,f0,female> so on and we'll fly it we hope with the same success that we had last night when we did the practice so
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 788.72 796.27 <o,f0,female> matt keenan just any time you're all right ready to let her go but first we're going to make sure that
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 813.29 815.66 <o,f0,female> but now we're trying to get the video
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 819.73 823.02 <o,f0,female> house lights yeah the house lights and we'll see you all better
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 827.80 830.91 <o,f0,male> try to do a few laps around and bring it back
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 849.20 849.92 <o,f0,female> i don't know why it
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 859.44 861.16 <o,f0,female> that was only a minute but i think
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 873.53 875.40 <o,f0,female> if this hits you it will not hurt you
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 904.41 911.77 <o,f0,male> now as they say in infomercials we have something much better for you which we're working on planes that are only
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 911.96 920.97 <o,f0,male> six inches fifteen centimeters in size and matt 's plane was on the cover of popular science last month
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 921.70 927.90 <o,f0,male> showing what this can lead to and in a while something this size will have gps and
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 928.52 939.22 <o,f0,male> video camera in it we've had one of these fly nine miles through the air at thirty five miles an hour with just a little battery in it but there's a lot of technology going this is just
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 940.25 948.81 <o,f0,male> milestones along the way of some remarkable things this one doesn't have the video in it but you get a little feel from what it can do
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 969.70 974.91 <o,f0,male> when you're done yeah i think i lost a little orientation i looked up into this light
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 975.82 979.18 <o,f0,male> it hit the building and the building was poorly placed actually
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 982.83 984.57 <o,f0,male> you're beginning to see what
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 984.99 987.35 <o,f0,male> can be done we're working on projects now even wing
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 987.75 992.40 <o,f0,male> things the size of hawk moths darpa contracts working with caltech
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 993.55 1003.82 <o,f0,male> all this leads i don't know is it practical i don't know but like any basic research when you're really forced to do things that are way beyond existing technology you can get there with
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 1031.61 1044.98 <o,f0,female> and we're learning a lot from its fascinating subject in concluding i want to get back to the big picture and i have just two final
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 1051.24 1052.37 <o,f0,female> read at last i put in
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 1052.49 1060.29 <o,f0,male> three sentences and had it say what i wanted over billions of years on a unique sphere chance has painted a thin covering of life complex
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 1069.22 1076.16 <o,f0,male> have grown in population technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power we now wield the paintbrush
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 1077.85 1085.73 <o,f0,male> that's serious we're not very bright we're short on wisdom we're high on technology where's it going to lead well inspired by
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 1086.79 1095.78 <o,f0,male> the sentences i decided to wield the paintbrush every twenty five years i do a picture here 's the one tries to show that the world isn't getting any bigger sort of a timeline
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 1096.42 1101.12 <o,f0,male> very non linear scale nature rates and trilobites and dinosaurs and eventually we saw
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 1102.69 1115.13 <o,f0,male> humans with caves birds were flying overhead after pterosaurs and then we get to the civilization above the little tv set with a gun on it then traffic jams and power systems and some
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 1129.01 1137.65 <o,f0,male> and we have to think seriously about it and that time when this is happening is not one hundred years or five hundred years things are going on
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 1138.23 1145.77 <o,f0,male> this decade next decade it's a very short time that we have to decide what we are going to do and
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 1146.18 1154.02 <o,f0,male> if we can get some agreement on where we want the world to be desirable sustainable when your kids reach your age i think we actually can
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 1154.89 1161.94 <o,f0,male> now i said this was a warning not a forecast that was before i painted this before we started in on making
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 1180.93 1194.72 <o,f0,male> i don't know the one final bit of sparkle we'll put in at the very end here is an utterly impractical flight vehicle which is a little
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 1199.97 1201.70 <o,f0,male> rubber band powered
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 1211.64 1211.82 <o,f0,female> one
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 1223.09 1227.02 <o,f0,female> last night we gave it a few too many turns and it tried to bash the roof out also
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 1228.45 1231.29 <o,f0,male> it's about a gram the
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 1240.94 1250.13 <o,f0,female> you will destroy it so be gentle just act like a wooden indian or something and when it comes down and we'll see how it goes
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 1252.55 1256.04 <o,f0,male> we consider this to be sort of the spirit
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 1262.48 1266.62 <o,f0,female> and you wonder is it practical and it turns out if i had not been
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 1281.16 1285.73 <o,f0,female> some light bulb changes we can probably get it down but it's possible it's gone up to a greater destiny
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 1288.88 1289.29 <o,f0,female> and i wanted
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 1310.02 1317.29 <o,f0,male> there wouldn't have been a gossamer condor there wouldn't have been an albatross a solar challenger there wouldn't be an impact car there wouldn't be a mandate on zero emission vehicles
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 1327.15 1339.13 <o,f0,male> things with teams like they're trying to get in education systems so i think that as a symbol it's important and i believe that also is important you can think of it as a sort of a symbol
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 1339.54 1339.99 <o,f0,male> for
PaulMacCready_1998 1 PaulMacCready_1998 1342.42 1348.76 <o,f0,female> and ted that somehow gets you thinking of technology and nature and
