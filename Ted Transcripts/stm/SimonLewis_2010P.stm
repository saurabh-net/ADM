SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 16.54 20.43 <o,f0,male> was a time in my life when everything seemed perfect
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 20.79 23.58 <o,f0,male> everywhere i went i felt at home
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 23.97 27.75 <o,f0,male> everyone i met i felt i knew them for as long as i could remember
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 30.25 35.49 <o,f0,male> how i came to that place and what i 've learned since i left it this is where it began
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 35.82 49.98 <o,f0,male> and it raises an existential question which is if i 'm having this experience of complete connection and full consciousness why am i not visible in the photograph and where is this time and place this is los angeles california where i live
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 49.98 65.64 <o,f0,male> this is a police photo that 's actually my car we 're less than a mile from one of the largest hospitals in los angeles called cedars sinai and the situation is that a car full of paramedics on their way home from the hospital after work have run across the wreckage
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 65.74 72.27 <o,f0,male> and they 've advised the police that there were no survivors inside the car that the driver 's dead
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 97.1 102.57 <o,f0,male> that night i receive because of my internal bleeding forty five units of blood which means
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 102.83 113.61 <o,f0,male> full replacements of all the blood in me before they 're able to staunch the flow i 'm put on full life support and i have a massive stroke and my brain drops into a coma
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 141.04 148.35 <o,f0,male> from my family looking in from outside what they 're trying to figure out is a different kind of existential question
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 148.44 162.18 <o,f0,male> which is how far is it going to be possible to bridge from the comatose potential mind that they 're looking at to an actual mind which i define simply as the functioning of the brain that is remaining inside my head
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 162.38 176.95 <o,f0,male> now to put this into a broader context i want you to imagine that you are an eternal alien watching the earth from outer space and your favorite show on intergalactic satellite television is the earth channel and your favorite show is the human show
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 176.95 185.17 <o,f0,male> and the reason i think it would be so interesting to you is because consciousness is so interesting it 's so unpredictable and so fragile
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 185.5 189.48 <o,f0,male> and this is how we began we all began in the awash valley in ethiopia
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 190.23 208.89 <o,f0,male> the show began with tremendous special effects because there were catastrophic climate shifts which sort of sounds interesting as a parallel to today because of the earth tilting on its axis and those catastrophic climate shifts we had to figure out how to find better food and we had to learn there 's lucy that 's how we all began
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 208.89 218.83 <o,f0,male> we had to learn how to crack open animal bones use tools to do that to feed on the marrow to grow our brains more so we actually grew our consciousness in response to this global threat
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 230.16 237.99 <o,f0,male> it 's a cupule that took forty to fifty thousand blows with a stone tool to create and it 's the first known expression of art on the planet
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 238.15 247.22 <o,f0,male> and the reason it connects us with consciousness today is that all of us still today the very first shape we draw as a child is a circle
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 259.97 267.29 <o,f0,male> and that comes down right way to the present with the dollar bill in the united states which has on it an eye of providence
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 267.44 281.39 <o,f0,male> so watching all of this show from outer space you think we get it we understand that the most precious resource on the blue planet is our consciousness because it 's the first thing we draw we surround ourselves with images of it it 's probably the most common image on the planet
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 281.78 287.56 <o,f0,male> but we don 't we take our consciousness for granted while i was producing in los angeles i never thought about it for a second
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 293.82 307.05 <o,f0,male> is that consciousness is under threat on this planet in ways it 's never been under threat before these are just some examples and the reason i 'm so honored to be here to talk today in india is because india has the sad distinction of being
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 307.05 321.45 <o,f0,male> the head injury capital of the world that statistic is so sad there is no more drastic and sudden gap created between potential and actual mind than a severe head injury each one can entail up to a decade of rehabilitation
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 321.45 329.52 <o,f0,male> which means that india unless something changes is accumulating a need for millennia of rehabilitation
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 329.52 344.39 <o,f0,male> what you find in the united states is an injury every twenty seconds that 's one and a half million every year stroke every forty seconds alzheimer 's disease every seventy seconds somebody succumbs to that all of these represent gaps between potential mind and actual mind
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 345.43 363.62 <o,f0,male> and here are some of the other categories if you look at the whole planet the world health organization tells us that depression is the number one disease on earth in terms of years lived with disability we find that the number two source of disability is depression in the age group of fifteen to forty four
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 363.85 372.77 <o,f0,male> our children are becoming depressed at an alarming rate i discovered during my recovery the third leading cause of death amongst teenagers is suicide
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 399.97 408.09 <o,f0,male> we 're talking about a society that is retreating into depression and disassociation when we are potentially confronting the next
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 408.09 409.97 <o,f0,male> great catastrophic climate shift
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 410.5 426.92 <o,f0,male> so what you 'd be wondering watching the human show is are we going to confront and address the catastrophic climate shift that may be heading our way by growing our consciousness or are we going to continue to retreat and that then might lead you to watch an episode one day of cedars sinai medical center
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 434.84 450.91 <o,f0,male> channels of information it 's not my eeg at cedars it 's your eeg tonight and last night it 's the what our minds do every night to digest the day and to prepare to bridge from the potential mind when we 're asleep to the actual mind when we awaken the following morning
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 450.97 469.57 <o,f0,male> this is how i was when i returned from the hospital after nearly four months the horseshoe shape you can see on my skull is where they operated and went inside my brain to do the surgeries they needed to do to rescue my life but if you look into the eye of consciousness that single eye you can see i 'm looking down but let me tell you how i felt at that point
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 470.05 477.07 <o,f0,male> i didn 't feel empty i felt everything simultaneously i felt empty and full hot and cold euphoric and depressed
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 477.63 490.5 <o,f0,male> because the brain is the world 's first fully functional quantum computer it can occupy multiple states at the same time and with all the internal regulators of my brain damaged i felt everything simultaneously
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 490.8 498.02 <o,f0,male> but let 's swivel around and look at me frontally this is now flash forward to the point in time where i 've been discharged by the health system
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 498.21 503.38 <o,f0,male> look into those eyes i 'm not able to focus those eyes i 'm not able to follow a line of text in a book
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 503.56 512.2 <o,f0,male> but the system has moved me on because as my family started to discover there is no long term concept in the health care system
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 541.77 551.07 <o,f0,male> so my family as we moved forward and discovered that the health care system had moved us by had to try to find solutions and answers and during that process it took many years
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 551.48 570.87 <o,f0,male> one of the doctors said that my recovery my degree of advance since the amount of head injury i 'd suffered was miraculous and that was when i started to write a book because i didn 't think it was miraculous i thought there were miraculous elements but i also didn 't think it was right that one should have to struggle and search for answers when this is a pandemic within our society
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 571.22 587.84 <o,f0,male> so from this experience of my recovery i want to share four particular aspects i call them the four c 's of consciousness that helped me grow my potential mind back towards the actual mind that i work with every day the first c is cognitive training
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 588.1 607.25 <o,f0,male> unlike the smashed glass of my car plasticity of the brain means that there was always a possibility with treatment to train the brain so that you can regain and raise your level of awareness and consciousness plasticity means that there was always hope for our reason hope for our ability to rebuild that function
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 629.42 634.08 <o,f0,male> but what i discovered is it 's almost impossible to find anyone who provides that treatment
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 644.46 653.69 <o,f0,male> full scale i q is the mental processing how fast you can acquire information retain it and retrieve it that is essential for success in life today
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 653.69 669.81 <o,f0,male> and you can see here there are three columns untestable that 's when i 'm in my coma and then i creep up to the point that i get a score of seventy nine which is just below average in the health care system if you touch average you 're done that 's when i was discharged from the system
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 669.81 672.5 <o,f0,male> what does average i q really mean
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 672.55 681.24 <o,f0,male> it meant that when i was given two and a half hours to take a test that anyone here would take in fifty minutes i might score
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 682.26 686.56 <o,f0,male> this is a very very low level in order to be kicked out of the health care system
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 687.16 696.29 <o,f0,male> then i underwent cognitive training and let me show you what happened to the right hand column when i did my cognitive training over a period of time this is not supposed to occur
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 696.65 700.91 <o,f0,male> i q is supposed to stabilize and solidify at the age of eight
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 701.3 710.65 <o,f0,male> now the journal of the national medical association gave my memoir a full clinical review which is very unusual i 'm not a doctor i have no medical background whatsoever
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 711.02 721.82 <o,f0,male> but they felt the evidences that there was important valuable information in the book and they commented about it when they gave the full peer review to it but they asked one question they said is this repeatable
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 753.42 767.61 <o,f0,male> second aspect i still had crushing migraine headaches two elements that worked for me here are the first is ninety percent i learned of head and neck pain is through muscular skeletal imbalance the craniomandibular system is critical to that
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 775.04 781.56 <o,f0,male> up to thirty percent of the population have a disorder disease or dysfunction in the jaw that affects the entire body
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 782.03 795.69 <o,f0,male> i was fortunate to find a dentist who applied this entire universe of technology you 're about to see to establish that if he repositioned my jaw the headaches pretty much resolved but that then my teeth weren 't in the right place he then held my jaw in the right position
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 795.69 802.87 <o,f0,male> while orthodontically he put my teeth into correct alignment so my teeth actually hold my jaw in the correct position
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 802.87 811.35 <o,f0,male> this affected my entire body if that sounds like a very very strange thing to say and rather a bold statement how can the jaw affect the entire body
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 819.82 823.4 <o,f0,male> how far would you last before you had to remove that grain of sand
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 823.76 828.21 <o,f0,male> that tiny misalignment bear in mind there are no nerves in the teeth
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 828.21 832.24 <o,f0,male> that 's why the same between the before and after that this shows it 's hard to see the difference
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 851.06 856.39 <o,f0,male> is the circulation imagine the blood flowing through your body i was told at ucla medical center
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 856.64 875.31 <o,f0,male> as one sealed system there 's a big pipe with the blood flowing through it and around that pipe are the nerves drawing their nutrient supply from the blood that 's basically it if you press on a hose pipe in a sealed system it bulges someplace else if that some place else where it bulges is inside the biggest nerve in your body your brain
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 875.31 879.75 <o,f0,male> you get a vascular migraine this is a level of pain that 's only known
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 879.75 882.81 <o,f0,male> to other people who suffer vascular migraines
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 882.81 901.47 <o,f0,male> using this technology this is mapping in three dimensions this is an mri mra mrv a volumetric mri using this technology the specialists at ucla medical center were able to identify where that compression in the hose pipe was occurring a vascular surgeon removed most of the first rib on both sides of my body
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 901.47 906.84 <o,f0,male> and in the following months and years i felt the neurological flow of life itself returning
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 906.84 908.85 <o,f0,male> communication the next c
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 908.85 921.1 <o,f0,male> this is critical all consciousness is about communication and here by great fortune one of my father 's clients had a husband who worked at the alfred mann foundation for scientific research
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 921.1 935.25 <o,f0,male> alfred mann is a brilliant physicist and innovator who 's fascinated with bridging gaps in consciousness whether to restore hearing to the deaf vision to the blind or movement to the paralyzed and i 'm just going to give you an example today of movement to the paralyzed
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 935.65 938.32 <o,f0,male> i 've brought with me from southern california
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 938.49 940.01 <o,f0,male> the fm device
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 940.16 942 <o,f0,male> this is it being held in the hand
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 942.19 950.53 <o,f0,male> it weighs less than a gram so two of them implanted in the body would weigh less than a dime five of them would still weigh less than a rupee coin
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 951.15 957.92 <o,f0,male> where does it go inside the body it has been simulated and tested to endure in the body corrosion free for over eighty years
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 957.92 964.86 <o,f0,male> so it goes in and it stays there here are the implantation sites the concept that they 're working towards and they have working prototypes
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 983.17 993.6 <o,f0,male> and other fm devices implanted in fingertips on contacting a surface will send a message back to the sensory cortex of the brain so that the person feels a sense of touch
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 993.6 1007.02 <o,f0,male> is this science fiction no because i 'm wearing the first application of this technology i don 't have the ability to control my left foot a radio device is controlling every step i take and a sensor picks up my foot for me every time i walk
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 1013.31 1023.32 <o,f0,male> in my coma one of the presences i sensed was someone i felt was a protector and when i came out of my coma i recognized my family but i didn 't remember my own past
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 1023.91 1026.74 <o,f0,male> gradually i remembered the protector was my wife
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 1048.85 1051.54 <o,f0,male> she had been laid to rest in her hometown of phoenix
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 1052.2 1058.91 <o,f0,male> now in the dark years that followed i had to work out what remained for me if everything that made today special was gone
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 1110.57 1124.17 <o,f0,female> man to come by who obviously would have some difficulty i don 't know what i had in my mind and he was walking around i didn 't expect that person that i was going to meet to be him and then we met and we
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 1140.4 1145.2 <o,f0,female> the thing that amazed me is the painstaking
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 1194.56 1201.81 <o,f0,male> and that 's my friend i mean i charge it every night and it works it works and what i would love to add because i didn 't have time
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 1218.27 1227.78 <o,f0,male> this thing blinks all the time i 'll leave it out so you might be able to see it but this is blinking all the time it 's sending signals in real time and if you walk faster if i walk faster
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 1249.2 1259.84 <o,f0,male> and he was going to retire all the technology was going to be lost because not a single medical manufacturer would take it on because it was a small issue but there 's millions of deaf people in the world
SimonLewis_2010P 1 SimonLewis_2010P 1263.85 1282.93 <o,f0,male> it works and the other thing is they 're working on artificial retinas for the blind and this this is the implantable generation because what i didn 't say in my talk is this is actually exoskeletal i should clarify that because the first generation is exoskeletal it 's wrapped around the leg around the affected limb
