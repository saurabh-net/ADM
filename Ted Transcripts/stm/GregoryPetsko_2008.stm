GregoryPetsko_2008 1 GregoryPetsko_2008 12.94 19.91 <o,f0,male> do something to prevent it over the next forty years we a re facing an epidemic of neurologic diseases on a global scale
GregoryPetsko_2008 1 GregoryPetsko_2008 21.70 22.73 <o,f0,male> a cheery thought
GregoryPetsko_2008 1 GregoryPetsko_2008 24.50 34.44 <o,f0,male> on this map every country that a s colored blue has more than twenty percent of its population over the age of sixty five this is the world we live in and this is the world your children will
GregoryPetsko_2008 1 GregoryPetsko_2008 50.65 51.84 <o,f0,male> this is why it a s happening
GregoryPetsko_2008 1 GregoryPetsko_2008 61.37 63.72 <o,f0,male> and this is why that a s not entirely a good thing
GregoryPetsko_2008 1 GregoryPetsko_2008 74.03 83.74 <o,f0,male> about thirty two million people in the united states over the age of eighty and unless we do something about it half of them will have alzheimer a s disease and three million more will have parkinson a s disease
GregoryPetsko_2008 1 GregoryPetsko_2008 84.18 95.51 <o,f0,male> right now those and other neurologic diseases for which we have no cure or prevention cost about a third of a trillion dollars a year it will be well over a trillion dollars by two thousand and fifty
GregoryPetsko_2008 1 GregoryPetsko_2008 104.55 112.25 <o,f0,male> so one approach we a re taking is to try to design drugs that function like molecular scotch tape to hold the protein into its proper shape
GregoryPetsko_2008 1 GregoryPetsko_2008 127.11 137.10 <o,f0,male> which suggest that the approach might be a general one and might be used to cure many neurologic diseases not just alzheimer a s disease there a s also a fascinating connection to cancer here
GregoryPetsko_2008 1 GregoryPetsko_2008 137.47 147.09 <o,f0,male> because people with neurologic diseases have a very low incidence of most cancers and this is a connection that most people aren a t pursuing right now but which we a re fascinated by
GregoryPetsko_2008 1 GregoryPetsko_2008 147.96 160.01 <o,f0,male> most of the important and all of the creative work in this area is being funded by private philanthropies and there a s tremendous scope for additional private help here because the government has dropped the ball on much of this i a m afraid
GregoryPetsko_2008 1 GregoryPetsko_2008 160.46 172.22 <o,f0,male> in the meantime while we a re waiting for all these things to happen here a s what you can do for yourself if you want to lower your risk of parkinson a s disease caffeine is protective to some extent nobody knows why
GregoryPetsko_2008 1 GregoryPetsko_2008 172.73 180.17 <o,f0,male> head injuries are bad for you they lead to parkinson a s disease and the avian flu is also not a good idea
GregoryPetsko_2008 1 GregoryPetsko_2008 181.40 189.84 <o,f0,male> as far as protecting yourself against alzheimer a s disease well it turns out that fish oil has the effect of reducing your risk for alzheimer a s disease
GregoryPetsko_2008 1 GregoryPetsko_2008 190.18 201.35 <o,f0,male> you should also keep your blood pressure down because chronic high blood pressure is the biggest single risk factor for alzheimer a s disease it a s also the biggest risk factor for glaucoma which is just alzheimer a s disease of the eye
GregoryPetsko_2008 1 GregoryPetsko_2008 201.98 209.60 <o,f0,male> and of course when it comes to cognitive effects use it or lose it applies so you want to stay mentally stimulated but hey you a re listening to me
GregoryPetsko_2008 1 GregoryPetsko_2008 210.40 219.05 <o,f0,male> so you a ve got that covered and one final thing wish people like me luck okay because the clock is ticking for all of us thank
