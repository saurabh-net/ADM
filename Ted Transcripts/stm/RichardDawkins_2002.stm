RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 14.53 22.87 <o,f0,male> that splendid music the coming in music the elephant march from aida is the music i've chosen for my funeral
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 25.14 30.52 <o,f0,male> you can see why it's triumphal i will
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 30.59 44.92 <o,f0,male> i won 't feel anything but if i could i would feel triumphal at having lived at all and at having lived on this splendid planet and having been given the opportunity to understand something about why i was here
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 45.37 53.91 <o,f0,male> in the first place before not being here can you understand my quaint english accent
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 57.26 58.55 <o,f0,male> like everybody else i was
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 67.55 78.38 <o,f0,male> the beauty of the things they showed the only slight jarring note was when jeffrey katzenberg said of the mustang the most splendid creatures that god put on this earth
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 79.15 84.54 <o,f0,male> now of course we know that he didn't really mean that but in this country at the moment you
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 87.50 98.14 <o,f0,male> i'm a biologist and the central theorem of our subject the theory of design darwin 's theory of evolution by natural selection
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 99.07 108.55 <o,f0,male> in professional circles everywhere it's of course universally accepted in non professional circles outside america it's largely ignored
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 110.15 122.50 <o,f0,male> in non professional circles within america it arouses so much hostility that it's fair to say that american biologists are in a state of war
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 123.32 131.51 <o,f0,male> the war is so worrying at present with court cases coming up in one state after another that i felt i had to say something about it if you want to know
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 131.70 139.75 <o,f0,male> what i have to say about darwinism itself i'm afraid you're going to have to look at my books which you won 't find in the
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 151.57 164.42 <o,f0,female> or id don't be fooled there's nothing new about id it's just creationism under another name rechristened i choose the word advisedly
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 165.49 175.43 <o,f0,female> for tactical political reasons the arguments of so called id theorists are the same old arguments that had been refuted again and again since darwin down to the present day
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 176.58 184.12 <o,f0,female> is an effective evolution lobby coordinating the fight on behalf of science and i try to do all i can to help them
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 195.88 203.57 <o,f0,female> you can understand why creationists lacking any coherent scientific argument for their case fall back
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 203.88 210.95 <o,f0,female> on the popular phobia against atheism teach your children evolution in biology class
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 211.32 217.04 <o,f0,female> and they'll soon move on to drugs grand larceny and sexual pre version
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 221.39 229.76 <o,f0,male> in fact of course educated theologians from the pope down are firm in their support of evolution this book finding darwin 's god by kenneth miller
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 230.26 242.96 <o,f0,male> one of the most effective attacks on intelligent design that i know and it's all the more effective because it's written by a devout christian people like kenneth miller could be called a godsend to the evolution lobby
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 244.57 252.13 <o,f0,male> because they expose the lie that evolutionism is as a matter of fact tantamount to atheism people like me on the other hand
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 252.70 260.55 <o,f0,male> rock the boat but here i want to say something nice about creationists it's not a thing i often do so listen carefully
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 262.50 273.67 <o,f0,male> i think they're right about one thing i think they're right that evolution is fundamentally hostile to religion i've already said that many individual evolutionists like the pope
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 274.21 283.41 <o,f0,male> also religious but i think they're deluding themselves i believe a true understanding of darwinism is deeply corrosive to
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 285.76 294.41 <o,f0,male> now it may sound as though i'm about to preach atheism and i want to reassure that that's not what i'm going to do
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 294.79 303.08 <o,f0,male> in an audience as sophisticated as that as this one that would be preaching to the choir no what i want to urge upon you
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 307.89 312.00 <o,f0,male> instead what i want to urge upon you is militant atheism
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 320.53 328.46 <o,f0,female> if i wanted to if i was a person who were interested in preserving religious faith i would be very afraid of the positive power
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 328.89 340.19 <o,f0,female> of evolutionary science and any science generally but evolution in particular to inspire and enthrall precisely because it is atheistic
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 341.21 349.82 <o,f0,male> difficult problem for any theory of biological design is to explain the massive statistical improbability of living things
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 379.31 386.29 <o,f0,male> and that's before we even start on the other things he 's expected to do like forgive sins bless marriages listen to
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 419.02 428.39 <o,f0,female> nothing but simplicity essentially it does it by providing a smooth ramp of gradual step by step increment
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 429.10 441.11 <o,f0,female> but here i only want to make the point that the elegance of darwinism is corrosive to religion precisely because it is so elegant so parsimonious so powerful so economically powerful
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 443.70 457.91 <o,f0,female> it has the sinewy economy of a beautiful suspension bridge the god theory is not just a bad theory it turns out to be in principle incapable of doing the job required of it
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 458.79 470.16 <o,f0,female> so returning to tactics and the evolution lobby i want to argue that rocking the boat may be just the right thing to do
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 470.86 480.98 <o,f0,female> my approach to attacking creationism is unlike the evolution lobby my approach to attacking creationism is to attack religion as a whole
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 481.70 491.58 <o,f0,female> at this point i need to acknowledge the remarkable taboo against speaking ill of religion and i'm going to do so in the words of the late douglas adams
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 500.63 513.68 <o,f0,male> he begins this speech which was tape recorded in cambridge shortly before he died he begins by explaining how science works through the testing of hypotheses that are framed to be vulnerable to disproof and then he goes on i
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 515.16 522.43 <o,f0,male> religion doesn't seem to work like that it has certain ideas at the heart of it which we call sacred or holy what it means is
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 522.84 532.23 <o,f0,male> here is an idea or a notion that you're not allowed to say anything bad about you're just not why not because you're not
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 536.35 544.62 <o,f0,male> why should it be that it's perfectly legitimate to support the republicans or democrats this model of economics versus that macintosh instead of windows
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 545.08 554.00 <o,f0,male> but to have an opinion about how the universe began about who created the universe no that's holy so we're used to not challenging
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 568.09 580.97 <o,f0,female> yet when you look at it rationally there is no reason why those ideas shouldn 't be as open to debate as any other except that we've agreed somehow between us that they shouldn 't be and that's the end of the quote from douglas
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 584.20 589.18 <o,f0,male> in my view not only is science corrosive to religion religion
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 589.33 598.63 <o,f0,female> is corrosive to science it teaches people to be satisfied with trivial supernatural non explanations
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 598.98 604.40 <o,f0,female> and blinds them to the wonderful real explanations that we have within our grasp
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 604.82 615.18 <o,f0,female> it teaches them to accept authority revelation and faith instead of always insisting on evidence
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 616.51 627.52 <o,f0,female> there's douglas adams magnificent picture from his book last chance to see now there's a typical scientific journal the quarterly review of biology and i'm going to put together
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 628.29 636.12 <o,f0,female> as guest editor a special issue on the question did an asteroid kill the dinosaurs and the first paper
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 636.77 644.41 <o,f0,female> is a standard scientific paper presenting evidence iridium layer at the k t boundary potassium argon dated crater in
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 652.07 658.53 <o,f0,male> the president of the royal society has been vouchsafed a strong inner conviction
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 659.11 660.89 <o,f0,male> that an asteroid killed the
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 665.88 670.61 <o,f0,male> it has been privately revealed to professor huxtane
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 671.67 673.51 <o,f0,male> that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 690.95 696.42 <o,f0,male> professor hawkins has promulgated an official dogma binding on all
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 698.91 701.26 <o,f0,female> that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 705.12 708.35 <o,f0,female> that's inconceivable of course
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 732.72 741.32 <o,f0,male> no i don't know that atheists should be considered citizens nor should they be considered patriots this is one nation under god
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 741.96 750.42 <o,f0,male> bush 's bigotry was not an isolated mistake blurted out in the heat of the moment and later retracted he stood by it in the face of repeated calls
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 750.65 758.86 <o,f0,male> for clarification or withdrawal he really meant it more to the point he knew it posed no threat to his election quite the
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 768.28 774.94 <o,f0,female> under god what would thomas jefferson have said incidentally
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 775.47 783.18 <o,f0,female> i'm not usually very proud of being british but you can't help making the comparison
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 791.84 802.49 <o,f0,male> in practice what is an atheist an atheist is just somebody who feels about yahweh the way any decent christian feels about thor or
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 803.22 813.96 <o,f0,male> or the golden calf as has been said before we are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in some of us just go one god
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 824.64 835.71 <o,f0,female> however we define atheism it's surely the kind of academic belief that a person is entitled to hold without being vilified as an unpatriotic unelectable non citizen
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 845.13 852.74 <o,f0,female> and that all stems from the perception of atheists as some kind of weird way out minority
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 853.34 860.76 <o,f0,female> natalie angier wrote a rather sad piece in the new yorker saying how lonely she felt as an atheist she clearly feels in a beleaguered minority
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 861.22 870.39 <o,f0,female> but actually how do american atheists stack up numerically the latest survey makes surprisingly encouraging reading
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 882.79 894.73 <o,f0,female> with two point eight million muslims at one point one million and hindus buddhists and all other religions put together the second largest group of nearly thirty million is the one described as non religious or secular
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 896.01 904.36 <o,f0,female> you can't help wondering why vote seeking politicians are so proverbially overawed by the power of for example the jewish lobby
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 904.61 911.53 <o,f0,female> the state of israel seems to owe its very existence to the american jewish vote while at the same time consigning the non
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 912.46 922.64 <o,f0,female> to political oblivion this secular non religious vote if properly mobilized is nine times as numerous as the jewish vote
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 923.35 931.80 <o,f0,female> why does this far more substantial minority not make a move to exercise its political muscle well so much for quantity
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 932.33 940.84 <o,f0,female> how about quality is there any correlation positive or negative between intelligence and tendency to be religious
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 987.33 996.54 <o,f0,female> that is the higher one 's intelligence or educational level the less one is likely to be religious well i haven't seen the original forty two studies and i can't comment on
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 996.94 1005.89 <o,f0,female> that meta anaysis but i would like to see more studies done along those lines and i know that there are if i could put a little plug here there are people in this audience
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1006.95 1014.62 <o,f0,female> easily capable of financing a massive research survey to settle the question and i put the suggestion up for what it's worth
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1014.98 1023.19 <o,f0,female> but let me know show you some data that have been properly published and analyzed on one special group namely top scientists
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1033.13 1041.68 <o,f0,female> among this select group belief in a personal god dropped to a shattering seven percent
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1042.43 1052.59 <o,f0,female> about twenty percent are agnostic and the rest could fairly be called atheists similar figures obtained for belief in personal immortality among biological scientists the figures are even
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1053.80 1059.92 <o,f0,female> five point five percent only believe in god physical scientists it's seven point five percent
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1060.38 1069.03 <o,f0,female> i've not seen corresponding figures for elite scholars in other fields such history or philosophy but i'd be surprised if they were different
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1069.82 1083.98 <o,f0,female> so we've reached a truly remarkable situation a grotesque mismatch between the american intelligentsia and the american electorate a philosophical opinion about the nature of the universe
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1084.38 1098.69 <o,f0,male> which is held by the vast majority of top american scientists and probably the majority of the intelligentsia generally is so abhorrent to the american electorate that no candidate for popular election dare affirm it
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1099.19 1109.59 <o,f0,female> in public if i'm right this means that high office in the greatest country in the world is barred to the very people best qualified to hold it
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1110.07 1123.63 <o,f0,female> the intelligentsia unless they are prepared to lie about their beliefs to put it bluntly american political opportunities are heavily loaded against those who are simultaneously intelligent and honest
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1130.96 1136.79 <o,f0,female> not a citizen of this country so i hope it won 't be thought unbecoming if i suggest that something needs to be done
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1149.00 1155.46 <o,f0,female> we need a consciousness raising coming out campaign for american atheists
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1157.37 1167.28 <o,f0,female> this could be similar to the campaign organized by homosexuals a few years ago although heaven forbid that we should stoop to public outing of people against their will
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1167.74 1181.10 <o,f0,female> in most cases people who out themselves will help to destroy the myth that there is something wrong with atheists on the contrary they'll demonstrate that atheists are often the kinds of people that could serve as decent role models for your children
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1181.47 1189.39 <o,f0,female> the kinds of people an advertising agent could use to recommend a product the kinds of people who are sitting in this room
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1197.06 1206.34 <o,f0,female> could be non linearities threshold effects when a critical mass has been attained there's an abrupt acceleration in recruitment and again it will need money
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1207.81 1214.02 <o,f0,female> i suspect that the word atheist itself contains or remains a stumbling block
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1214.90 1220.74 <o,f0,female> far out of proportion to what it actually means and a stumbling block to people who otherwise might be happy to out
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1221.09 1226.05 <o,f0,female> themselves so what other words might be used to smooth the path oil the wheels
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1226.68 1232.32 <o,f0,female> sugar the pill darwin himself preferred agnostic and not only
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1232.44 1235.98 <o,f0,female> out of loyalty to his friend huxley who coined the term
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1237.19 1248.26 <o,f0,female> darwin said i have never been an atheist in the same sense as denying the existence of a god i think that generally an agnostic would be the most correct description of my state of mind
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1249.18 1256.88 <o,f0,female> he even became uncharacteristically tetchy with edward aveling aveling was a militant atheist who
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1257.19 1266.74 <o,f0,female> failed to persuade darwin to accept the dedication of his book on atheism incidentally giving rise to a fascinating myth that karl marx tried to dedicate das kapital
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1266.99 1273.96 <o,f0,female> to darwin which he didn 't it was actually edward aveling what happened was that aveling 's mistress was marx 's daughter
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1274.52 1284.52 <o,f0,female> and when both darwin and marx were dead marx 's papers became muddled up with aveling 's papers and a letter from darwin saying my
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1323.77 1333.19 <o,f0,female> but why should you be so aggressive darwin thought that atheism might be well and good for the intelligentsia but that ordinary people were not quote ripe for it
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1345.17 1349.31 <o,f0,female> but in any case that was more than one hundred years ago you think we might have grown up since then
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1350.66 1351.72 <o,f0,male> now
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1352.96 1363.61 <o,f0,female> a friend an intelligent lapsed jew who incidentally observed the sabbath for reasons of cultural solidarity describes himself as a tooth fairy agnostic
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1364.46 1375.35 <o,f0,female> he won 't call himself an atheist because it 's in principle impossible to prove a negative but agnostic on its own might suggest that god 's existence was therefore on equal terms of likelihood
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1375.80 1388.39 <o,f0,female> as his non existence so my friend is strictly agnostic about the tooth fairy but it isn't very likely is it like god hence the phrase tooth fairy agnostic
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1399.06 1407.79 <o,f0,male> that doesn't mean you treat the likelihood of its existence as on all fours with its non existence the list of things which we strictly have to be agnostic about
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1418.06 1428.04 <o,f0,male> the onus is on you to say why the onus is not on the rest of us to say why not we who are atheists are also a fairiests and
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1431.82 1432.94 <o,f0,female> but we don't bother to say so
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1434.20 1446.28 <o,f0,female> this is why my friend uses tooth fairy agnostic as a label for what most people would call atheist nonetheless if we want to attract deep down atheists to come out publicly
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1446.46 1454.55 <o,f0,female> we're going to have find something better to stick on our banner than tooth fairy or teapot agnostic so how about humanist
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1456.93 1466.12 <o,f0,female> this has the advantage of a worldwide network of well organized associations and journals and things already in place my problem with it only is its apparent anthropocentrism
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1466.35 1474.29 <o,f0,female> one of the things we've learned from darwin is that the human species is only one among millions of cousins some close some distant
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1474.75 1481.61 <o,f0,female> there are other possibilities like naturalist but that also has problems of confusion because darwin would have thought naturalist
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1489.79 1495.82 <o,f0,female> he was of course and i suppose there might be others who would confuse it with nudism
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1499.54 1508.25 <o,f0,female> such people might be those belonging to the british lynch mob which last year attacked a pediatrician in mistake for
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1514.93 1528.69 <o,f0,female> i think the best of the available alternatives for atheist is simply non theist it lacks the strong connotation that there's definitely no god and it could therefore easily be embraced by teapot or tooth fairy agnostics it's
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1529.94 1538.87 <o,f0,female> completely compatible with the god of the physicists when people like when atheists like stephen hawking and albert einstein

RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1549.69 1558.61 <o,f0,female> non theist will do for all that yet unlike atheist it doesn't have the same phobic hysterical
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1560.66 1572.81 <o,f0,female> responses but i think actually the alternative is to grasp the nettle of the word atheism itself precisely because it is a taboo word carrying frissons of hysterical phobia
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1573.67 1580.62 <o,f0,female> critical mass may be harder to achieve with the word atheist than with the word non theist or some other non confrontational word
RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1581.04 1587.95 <o,f0,female> but if we did achieve it with that dread word atheist itself the political impact would be even greater

RichardDawkins_2002 1 RichardDawkins_2002 1638.53 1648.35 <o,f0,female> a religion old or new that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and
