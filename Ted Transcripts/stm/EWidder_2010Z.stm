EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 17.83 27.63 <o,f0,female> who said people protect what they love i want to share with you today what i love most in the ocean and that's the incredible number and variety of animals in it
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 28.35 35.33 <o,f0,female> light my addiction began with this strange looking diving suit called wasp that's not an acronym just somebody thought it looked like the
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 57.39 62.72 <o,f0,female> was an evening dive i went down to a depth of eight hundred and eighty feet and turned out the lights
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 63.26 75.43 <o,f0,female> and the reason i turned out the lights is because i knew i would see this phenomenon of animals making light called bioluminescence but i was totally unprepared for how much there was and how spectacular it was
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 76.49 81.35 <o,f0,female> i saw chains of jellyfish called siphonophores that were longer than this room
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 89.33 103.28 <o,f0,female> and billows of what looked like luminous blue smoke and explosions of sparks that would swirl up out of the thrusters just like when you throw a log on a campfire and the embers swirl up off the campfire but these were icy blue embers it was breathtaking
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 103.74 115.51 <o,f0,female> now usually if people are familiar with bioluminescence at all it's these guys it's fireflies and there are a few other land dwellers that can make light some insects earthworms fungi but in general on land it's really rare
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 116.11 119.10 <o,f0,female> in the ocean it's the rule rather than the exception
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 119.68 125.99 <o,f0,female> if i go out in the open ocean environment virtually anywhere in the world and i drag a net from three thousand to the surface
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 127.57 134.05 <o,f0,female> most of the animals in fact in many places eighty to ninety percent of the animals i bring up in that net make light
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 134.80 137.74 <o,f0,female> this makes for some pretty spectacular light shows
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 138.30 150.83 <o,f0,female> now i want to share with you a little video that i shot from a submersible i first developed this technique working from a little single person submersible called deep rover and then adapted it for use on the johnson sea link which you see here
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 151.19 156.93 <o,f0,female> so mounted in front of the observation sphere there's a a three foot diameter hoop
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 170.47 181.47 <o,f0,female> just electronic noise on these intensified cameras you don't see luminescence until the submersible begins to move forward through the water but as it does animals bumping into the screen are stimulated to bioluminesc
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 182.07 195.87 <o,f0,female> now when i was first doing this all i was trying to do was count the number of sources i knew my forward speed i knew the area so i could figure out how many hundreds of sources there were per cubic meter but i started to realize that i could actually identify animals by the type of flashes they produced
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 196.15 205.32 <o,f0,female> and so here in the gulf of maine at seven hundred and forty feet i can name pretty much everything you're seeing there to the species level like those big explosions
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 205.91 214.22 <o,f0,female> sparks are from a little comb jelly and there's krill and other kinds of crustaceans and jellyfish there was one of those comb jellies
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 214.64 220.83 <o,f0,female> and so i've worked with computer image analysis engineers to develop automatic recognition systems
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 221.24 230.51 <o,f0,female> can identify these animals and then extract the x y z coordinate of the initial impact point and we can then do the kinds of things that ecologists do on land and do nearest neighbor distances
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 243.18 249.63 <o,f0,female> and this isn't someplace exotic like one of the bioluminescent bays in puerto rico this was actually shot in san diego harbor
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 271.90 279.42 <o,f0,female> so how does a living creature make light well that was the question nineteenth century french physiologist raphael dubois asked about this bioluminescent clam
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 281.02 286.54 <o,f0,female> managed to get out a couple of chemicals one the enzyme he called luciferase the substrate he called
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 287.55 295.89 <o,f0,female> after lucifer the light bearer that terminology has stuck but it doesn't actually refer to specific chemicals because these chemicals come in a lot of different shapes and forms
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 296.24 308.11 <o,f0,female> in fact most of the people studying bioluminescence today are focused on the chemistry because these chemicals have proved so incredibly valuable for developing antibacterial agents cancer fighting drugs
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 316.90 326.85 <o,f0,female> nobel prize in chemistry was awarded for work done on a molecule called green florescent protein that was isolated from the bioluminescent chemistry of a jellyfish
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 327.19 334.75 <o,f0,female> and it's been equated to the invention of the microscope in terms of the impact that it has had on cell biology and genetic engineering
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 357.05 367.43 <o,f0,female> well for animals that are trying to avoid predators by staying in the darkness light can still be very useful for the three basic things animals have to do to survive
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 367.70 377.84 <o,f0,female> and that's find food attract a mate and avoid being eaten so for example this fish has a built in headlight behind its eye that it can use for finding food
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 378.00 384.55 <o,f0,female> or attracting a mate and then when it's not using it it actually can roll it down in its head just like the headlights on your lamborghini
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 385.64 392.95 <o,f0,female> this fish actually has high beams and this fish which is one of my favorites has three headlights on each side of its head
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 393.52 394.73 <o,f0,female> now this one is blue
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 395.82 403.94 <o,f0,female> the color of most bioluminescence in the ocean because evolution has selected for the color that travels farthest through seawater in order to optimize communication
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 404.20 413.72 <o,f0,female> so most animals make blue light and most animals can only see blue light but this fish is a really fascinating exception because it has two red light organs
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 414.01 421.69 <o,f0,female> and i have no idea why there's two and that's something i want to solve some day so not only can it see blue light but it can see red light
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 422.22 431.45 <o,f0,female> so it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper 's scope to be able to sneak up on animals that are blind to red light and will be able to see them without being seen
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 432.10 442.10 <o,f0,female> it's also got a little chin barble here with a blue luminescent lure on it that it can use to attract prey from a long way off and a lot of animals will use their bioluminescence as a lure
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 442.86 452.81 <o,f0,female> this is another one of my favorite fish this is a viperfish and it's got a lure on the end of a long fishing rod that it arches in front of the toothy jaw that gives the viperfish its name
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 453.20 460.22 <o,f0,female> the teeth on this fish are so long that if they closed inside the mouth of the fish it would actually impale its own brain
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 460.64 468.92 <o,f0,female> so instead it slides in grooves on the outside of the head this is a christmas tree of a fish everything on this fish lights up it's not just
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 469.30 477.27 <o,f0,female> that lure it's got built in flashlight it's got these jewel like light organs on its belly that it uses for a type of camouflage that
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 479.39 485.08 <o,f0,female> shadow so when it's swimming around and there's a predator looking up from below it makes itself disappear
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 495.61 507.26 <o,f0,female> and we know a little bit more about bioluminescence thanks to pixar and i'm very grateful to pixar for sharing my favorite topic with so many people i do wish with their budget that they might have spent just a tiny bit more money
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 507.45 514.57 <o,f0,female> to pay a consulting fee to some poor starving graduate student who could have told them that those are the eyes of a fish that's been preserved in formalin
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 515.30 525.97 <o,f0,female> these are the eyes of a living angler fish so she's got a lure that she sticks out in front of this living mousetrap of needle sharp teeth in order to attract in some unsuspecting prey
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 527.20 535.08 <o,f0,female> this one has a lure with all kinds of interesting threads coming off it now we used to think that the different shape of the lure was
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 535.22 542.72 <o,f0,female> to attract different types of prey but then stomach content analysis on these fish done by scientists or more likely their graduate students
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 543.40 556.14 <o,f0,female> have revealed that they all eat pretty much the same thing so now we believe that the different shape of the lure is how the male recognizes the female in the angler fish world because many of these males are what are known as dwarf males
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 557.23 560.56 <o,f0,female> this little guy has no visible means of self support
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 561.34 569.63 <o,f0,female> he has no lure for attracting food and no teeth for eating it when it gets there his only hope for existence on this planet is as a gigolo
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 571.07 574.72 <o,f0,female> he 's got to find himself a babe and then he 's got to latch on for life
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 575.63 577.13 <o,f0,female> so this little guy
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 577.60 584.38 <o,f0,female> has found himself this babe and you will note that he 's had the good sense to attach himself in a way that he doesn't actually have to look at her
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 586.86 591.33 <o,f0,female> but her still knows a good thing when he sees it and so he seals the relationship with an eternal kiss
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 591.84 598.31 <o,f0,female> his flesh fuses with her flesh her bloodstream grows into his body and he becomes nothing more than a little sperm sac
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 600.61 610.19 <o,f0,female> well this is a deep sea version of women 's lib she always knows where he is and she doesn't have to be monogamous because some of these females come up with multiple males attached
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 611.05 623.71 <o,f0,female> so they can use it for finding food for attracting mates they use it a lot for defense many different ways a lot of them can release their luciferin their luferase in the water just like a squid or an octopus will release an ink cloud this shrimp is actually
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 636.90 647.26 <o,f0,female> there's a whole lot of different crustaceans there's even fish that can do this this fish is called the shining tubeshoulder because it actually has a tube on its shoulder that can squirt out light
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 647.68 658.56 <o,f0,female> luck enough to capture one of these when we were on a trawling expedition off the northwest coast of africa for blue planet for the deep portion of blue planet and we were using a special trawling net that
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 659.01 671.99 <o,f0,female> we were able to bring these animals up alive so we captured one of these and i brought it into the lab so i'm holding it and i'm about to touch that tube on its shoulder and when i do you'll see bioluminescence coming out but
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 672.09 677.49 <o,f0,female> to me what's shocking is not just the amount of light but the fact that it's not just luciferin and luciferates
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 692.21 703.59 <o,f0,female> now another form of defense is something called a burglar alarm same reason you have a burglar alarm on your car the honking horn and flashing lights are meant to attract the attention of hopefully the police that will come and take the burglar away
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 703.88 718.16 <o,f0,female> when an animal 's caught in the clutches of a predator its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of something bigger and nastier that will attack their attacker thereby affording them a chance for escape this jellyfish for example has a spectacular bioluminescent display
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 718.64 729.70 <o,f0,female> this is us chasing it in the submersible that's not luminescence that's reflected light from the gonads we capture it in a very special device on the front of the submersible that allows us to bring it up in really pristine condition
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 743.18 756.49 <o,f0,female> is an unbelievably light show it's this pinwheel of light and i've done calculations that show that this could be see from as much as three hundred feet away by a predator and i thought you know that might actually make a pretty good lure
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 757.11 764.92 <o,f0,female> because one of the things that's frustrated me as a deep sea explorer is how many animals there probably are in the ocean that we know nothing about
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 765.17 772.74 <o,f0,female> because of the way we explore the ocean the primary way that we know about what lives in the ocean is we go out and drag nets behind ships
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 773.08 777.88 <o,f0,female> and i defy you to name any other branch of science that still depends on hundreds of year old technology
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 778.36 787.33 <o,f0,female> the other primary way is we go down with submersibles and remote operated vehicles i've made hundreds of dives in submersibles when i'm sitting in a submersible
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 787.63 795.33 <o,f0,female> i know that i'm not unobtrusive at all i've got bright lights and noisy thrusters any animal with any sense is going to be long gone
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 796.39 806.45 <o,f0,female> so i've wanted for a long time to figure out a different way to explore and so sometime ago i got this idea for a camera system it's not exactly rocket science we call this thing eye in the sea
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 806.87 813.28 <o,f0,female> and scientists have done this on land for years we just use a color that the animals can't see and then a camera that can see that color
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 813.45 825.60 <o,f0,female> you can't use infrared in the sea we used far red light but even that's a problem because it gets absorbed so quickly made an intensified camera wanted to make this electronic jellyfish thing is in science
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 826.35 835.30 <o,f0,female> you have to tell the funding agencies what you're going to discover before they'll give you the money and i didn't know what i was going to discover so i couldn't get the funding for this so
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 835.55 842.53 <o,f0,female> i kluged this together i got the harvey mudd engineering clinic to actually do it as an undergraduate student project initially and then i kluged
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 849.57 857.47 <o,f0,female> so that i could test it and we could figure out you know for example which colors of red light we had to use so that we could see the animals but they couldn't see
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 857.95 871.58 <o,f0,female> get the electronic jellyfish working and you can see just what a shoestring operation this really was because when i cast these sixteen blue leds in epoxy and you can see in the epoxy mold we used the word ziploc is still visible
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 881.60 894.28 <o,f0,female> and remarkably that moment got caught on film by photographer mark richards who happened to be there at the precise moment that we discovered that it all came together that's me on the left my graduate student at the time erica raymond
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 894.68 904.22 <o,f0,female> and lee fry who was the engineer on the project and we this photograph posted in our lab in a place of honor with the caption engineer satisfying two women at once
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 905.34 916.26 <o,f0,female> and we were very very happy so now we had a system that we could actually take to some place that was kind of like an oasis on the bottom off the ocean that might be patrolled by large predators
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 916.60 930.81 <o,f0,female> and so the place that we took it to was this place called a brine pool which is in the northern part of the gulf of mexico it's a magical place and i know this footage isn't going to look like anything to you we had a crummy camera at the time but i was ecstatic
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 944.95 946.87 <o,f0,female> down there disturbing them in some way
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 947.91 958.87 <o,f0,female> four hours into the deployment we had programmed the electronic jellyfish to come on for the first time eighty six seconds after it went into its pinwheel display we recorded this
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 960.33 967.67 <o,f0,female> this is a squid over six feet long that is so new to science it cannot be placed in any known scientific family
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 968.32 978.15 <o,f0,female> i could not have asked for a better proof of concept and based on this i went back to the national science foundation and said this is what we will discover and they gave me enough money to do it right
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 978.47 991.11 <o,f0,female> which has involved developing the world 's first deep sea webcam which has been installed in the monterey canyon for the past year and now more recently a modular form of this system a much more mobile form
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 1000.46 1008.99 <o,f0,female> and for me learn more about the bioluminescence in these hope spots so one of these take home messages here is
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 1023.78 1029.43 <o,f0,female> a thousand times yes and please turn out the lights i promise you'll love it thank you
