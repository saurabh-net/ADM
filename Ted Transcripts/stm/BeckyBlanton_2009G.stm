BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 16.42 21.17 <o,f0,female> i'm a writer and a journalist and i'm also an insanely curious person
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 21.58 25.53 <o,f0,female> so in twenty two years as a journalist i've learned how to do a lot of new things
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 25.98 27.25 <o,f0,female> and three years ago
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 31.18 32.93 <o,f0,female> i became one of the working homeless
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 34.30 36.44 <o,f0,female> i quit my job as a newspaper editor
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 37.29 41.71 <o,f0,female> after my father died in february of that same year and decided to travel
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 43.70 55.76 <o,f0,female> his death hit me pretty hard and there were a lot of things that i wanted to feel and deal with while i was doing that i've camped my whole life and i decided that living in a van for a year to do this would be like one long camping trip so
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 69.36 75.94 <o,f0,female> that society equates living in a permanent structure even a shack with having value as a person
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 76.64 83.95 <o,f0,female> two i failed to realize how quickly the negative perceptions of other people can impact our reality if we let it
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 84.77 89.95 <o,f0,female> three i failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude not a lifestyle
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 93.87 99.25 <o,f0,female> i showered in campgrounds i ate out regularly and i had time to relax and to grieve
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 100.25 103.36 <o,f0,female> but then the anger and the depression about my father 's death set in
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 104.64 108.66 <o,f0,female> my freelance job ended and i had to get a full time job to pay the bills
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 113.51 115.49 <o,f0,female> it became impossible to park anywhere
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 130.17 135.54 <o,f0,female> used employee showers in office buildings and truck stops or i washed up in
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 145.06 146.63 <o,f0,female> food rotted in the heat
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 147.35 152.88 <o,f0,female> ice in my ice chest melted within hours and it was pretty miserable
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 158.21 164.49 <o,f0,female> i couldn't afford to find an apartment or couldn't afford an apartment that would allow me to have the rottweiler and the cat
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 164.87 166.24 <o,f0,female> and i refused to give them up
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 166.79 168.00 <o,f0,female> so i stayed in the van
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 177.91 180.17 <o,f0,female> outside my van at night i used a bucket
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 180.57 182.08 <o,f0,female> a trash bag as a toilet
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 194.24 200.96 <o,f0,female> a different place every night so i would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police i didn't always succeed but
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 205.68 207.01 <o,f0,female> out of control of my life
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 212.73 216.25 <o,f0,female> which i went from being a talented writer and journalist
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 221.51 222.69 <o,f0,female> i hadn't changed
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 223.13 225.52 <o,f0,female> my i q hadn't dropped my talent
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 228.24 229.65 <o,f0,female> my integrity my values
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 245.87 247.61 <o,f0,female> and as depressed as anyone in line
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 248.58 249.77 <o,f0,female> i just wasn't drunk or high
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 257.80 260.01 <o,f0,female> you aren't homeless why are you really here
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 260.46 263.43 <o,f0,female> other homeless people didn't see me as homeless but i did
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 276.98 281.70 <o,f0,female> a reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression left me suicidal and i remember thinking
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 282.29 284.74 <o,f0,female> if i killed myself no one would notice
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 295.51 302.86 <o,f0,female> a friend told me shortly after that that she had heard that tim russert a nationally renowned journalist had been talking about me on national
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 303.92 306.95 <o,f0,female> an essay i'd written about my father the year before he died
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 308.26 314.75 <o,f0,female> was in tim 's new book and he was doing the talk show circuit and he was talking about my writing and when i realized that tim russert
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 315.23 318.10 <o,f0,female> former moderator of meet the press was talking about my writing
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 318.46 326.55 <o,f0,female> while i was living in a van in a wal mart parking lot i started laughing you should too i started laughing
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 354.23 363.78 <o,f0,female> by the summer of the following year i was a working journalist i was winning awards i was living in my own apartment i was no longer homeless and i was no longer invisible
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 365.80 369.71 <o,f0,female> thousands of people work full and part time jobs and live in their cars
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 377.09 381.82 <o,f0,female> so the homeless the working homeless primarily remain invisible but if you ever meet one

BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 386.79 389.94 <o,f0,female> the human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 404.70 407.52 <o,f0,female> or what their life situation is at any given time
BeckyBlanton_2009G 1 BeckyBlanton_2009G 409.40 413.90 <o,f0,female> three years ago i was living in a van in a wal mart parking lot
