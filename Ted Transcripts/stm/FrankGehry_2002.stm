FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 12.56 23.23 <o,f0,male> i listened to this scientist this morning and doctor mullis was talking about his experiments and i realized that i almost became a scientist
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 23.91 31.98 <o,f0,male> when i was fourteen my parents bought me a chemistry set and i decided to make water
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 40.77 42.69 <o,f0,male> so i made a hydrogen generator
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 43.99 49.00 <o,f0,male> and i made an oxygen generator and i had the two pipes leading into a beaker and i threw a
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 75.76 86.11 <o,f0,female> i'd like to start again just start this session again the gentleman to my left is the very famous perhaps overly famous frank gehry
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 92.87 96.90 <o,f0,female> it is astonishing for an artist for an architect
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 97.00 110.61 <o,f0,male> to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time i mean you have become whether you can giggle at it because it's funny you know it's a strange thought but your building is an icon you can draw a little picture of that building it can be used in ads
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 111.30 124.30 <o,f0,male> and you've had not rock star status but celebrity status in doing what you wanted to do for most of your life and i know the road was extremely difficult
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 125.43 130.60 <o,f0,female> and it didn't seem that your sell outs
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 130.99 137.74 <o,f0,male> whatever they were were very big you kept moving ahead in a life
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 138.92 140.75 <o,f0,male> dependent on working for somebody
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 142.80 149.44 <o,f0,male> but that's an interesting thing for a creative person a lot of us work for people we're in the hands of other people
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 160.88 169.85 <o,f0,male> that and that makes your win doubly big triply big it's not quite a question but you can comment on it it's a big issue
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 171.88 173.28 <o,f0,male> well i've always just
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 174.60 181.82 <o,f0,male> i've never really gone out looking for work i always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head and
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 182.84 193.79 <o,f0,male> when i started out i thought that architecture was a service business and that you had to please the clients and stuff and i realized when i'd come in to the meetings with these
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 196.35 203.48 <o,f0,male> corrugated metal and chain link stuff and people would just look at me like i'd just landed from mars
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 204.46 209.72 <o,f0,male> but i couldn't do anything else that was my response to the people and the time and
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 210.52 211.68 <o,f0,male> it was responding to
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 213.01 223.10 <o,f0,male> clients that i had that didn't have very much money so they couldn't afford very much i think it was circumstantial until i got to my house where the client was my wife
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 228.07 230.12 <o,f0,male> i built a house around it and
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 239.65 248.99 <o,f0,male> 's building this huge concrete place and it was late in the evening we'd had a lot to drink we were standing out in the desert all alone and he said
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 249.60 260.66 <o,f0,male> thinking about my house he said did it ever occur to you if you built stuff more permanent somewhere in two thousand years somebody 's going to like it
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 266.38 271.53 <o,f0,male> so i thought yes that's probably a good idea luckily i started to get some
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 284.00 290.82 <o,f0,male> where do we go now back to everything 's so temporary i don't see it the way you characterized
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 303.06 304.57 <o,f0,male> i ever did and
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 306.46 314.86 <o,f0,male> i get the sweats i go in and start working i'm not sure where i'm going if i knew where i was going i wouldn't do it when i can predict or plan it i
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 315.55 324.62 <o,f0,male> do it i discard it so i approach it with the same trepidation obviously over time i have a lot more confidence
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 325.47 329.30 <o,f0,male> that it's going to be ok i do
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 339.49 352.52 <o,f0,male> the project is with i think a healthy insecurity and like the playwright said the other day i could relate to him you're not sure when
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 364.63 375.93 <o,f0,male> embarrassed by it i felt an embarrassment how could i have done that how could i have made shapes like that or done stuff like that it's taken several years to
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 376.61 387.63 <o,f0,male> now look at it detached and say as you walk around the corner and a piece of it works with the road and the street and it appears to have a relationship
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 397.20 407.70 <o,f0,male> and explained it all to me and i thought he was nuts and i didn't think he knew what he was doing and he pulled it off so i think he 's icarus and phoenix all in one guy
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 410.73 414.39 <o,f0,male> and he gets up there and then he comes back up
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 418.41 423.55 <o,f0,male> still talking about it september eleven
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 424.92 432.70 <o,f0,male> generated some interest in moving it over to ground zero and i'm totally against
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 453.90 462.97 <o,f0,male> when will that be finished fg that will be finished in two thousand and three september october and i'm hoping kyu and
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 465.03 472.00 <o,f0,male> herbie and yo yo and all those guys come play with us at that place
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 472.80 484.30 <o,f0,male> luckily today most of the people i'm working with are people i really like richard koshalek is probably one of the main reasons that disney hall came to me he 's been a cheerleader
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 484.86 497.53 <o,f0,male> for quite a long time there aren't many people around that are really involved with architecture as clients you know if you think about the world and even just in this audience
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 499.86 501.35 <o,f0,male> most of us
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 502.54 509.38 <o,f0,male> are involved with buildings nothing that you would call architecture right and so to find one
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 509.69 517.08 <o,f0,male> a guy like that you hang on to him you know he 's become the head of art center and
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 518.85 528.02 <o,f0,male> a building by craig ellwood there i knew craig and respected him and they want to add to it and it's hard to add to a building like that
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 556.78 557.67 <o,f0,male> was intuitive
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 566.66 580.49 <o,f0,male> grew up and lived in portugal and is probably considered the portuguese main guy in architecture i visited with him a few years ago and he showed me his early work and his early work
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 581.05 594.96 <o,f0,male> had a resemblance to my early work when i came out of college i started to try to do things contextually in southern california and you got into
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 596.41 607.25 <o,f0,male> the logic of spanish colonial tile roofs and things like that i tried to understand that language as a beginning as a place to jump off
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 607.79 614.92 <o,f0,male> and there was so much of it being done by spec builders and it was trivialized so much that it
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 615.69 622.64 <o,f0,male> wasn't i just stopped i mean charlie moore did a bunch of it but it didn't feel good to me
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 623.78 633.52 <o,f0,male> siza on the other hand continued in portugal where the real stuff was and evolved a modern language that relates to
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 634.77 638.67 <o,f0,male> that historic language and
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 640.40 644.90 <o,f0,male> i always felt that he should come to southern california and do a building i tried to
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 646.67 654.05 <o,f0,male> a couple of jobs and they didn't pan out and i like the idea of collaboration with
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 656.47 661.55 <o,f0,male> people like that because it pushes you
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 664.45 674.85 <o,f0,male> done it with claes oldenburg and with richard serra who doesn't think architecture is art did you see that thing
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 676.17 679.21 <o,f0,male> he say fg he calls architecture plumbing
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 683.27 693.88 <o,f0,male> anyway the siza thing it's a richer experience it must be like that for kyu doing things with musicians it's similar to that i would imagine where you
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 701.90 708.34 <o,f0,male> it's like jazz you improvise you work together you play off each other you make
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 710.64 722.97 <o,f0,male> something they make something and i think it's a way of for me it's a way of trying to understand the city and what might happen in the city
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 727.29 733.17 <o,f0,male> near the current campus anyway he 's that kind of patron it's not his money of course
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 737.91 739.76 <o,f0,male> i don't know what's the schedule
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 746.39 760.29 <o,f0,male> the opening i'll invite you no but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting because it creates chaos right everybody doing their thing
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 760.78 769.32 <o,f0,male> makes a very chaotic environment and if you can figure out how to work off each other i mean it's not that
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 771.09 782.39 <o,f0,male> you can get a bunch of people who respect each other 's work and play off each other you might be able to create models for how to build sections of the city
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 783.39 791.36 <o,f0,male> without resorting to the one architect like the rockefeller center model which is kind of from another era
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 792.34 797.72 <o,f0,male> i found the most remarkable thing my preconception of bilbao
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 806.97 813.71 <o,f0,male> was in its context to the city that was the surprise of going across the river going on the highway around it
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 819.15 830.10 <o,f0,male> but you know richard most architects when they present their work most of the people we know you get up and you talk about your work and it's almost like you
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 831.82 835.09 <o,f0,male> tell everybody you're a good guy by saying look
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 836.15 848.16 <o,f0,male> i'm worried about the context i'm worried about the city i'm worried about my client i worry about budget that i'm on time blah blah blah and all that stuff and it's like
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 872.77 882.02 <o,f0,male> not going to get much work if it leaks bilbao did not leak i was so
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 898.53 905.79 <o,f0,male> they were there three days and it rained every day and they kept walking around i noticed they were looking under things
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 907.51 916.70 <o,f0,male> and they wanted to know where the buckets were hidden you know people put buckets out i was clean there wasn't a bloody leak in the place it was just fantastic
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 918.04 922.85 <o,f0,male> but you've got to yeah well up until then every building
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 923.18 924.19 <o,f0,male> so this
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 932.10 936.80 <o,f0,female> had a fame his fame was built on that in l a for a while
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 941.90 953.64 <o,f0,male> wright story when the woman called and said mister wright i'm sitting on the couch and the water 's pouring in on my head and he said madam move your chair
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 958.37 970.34 <o,f0,male> so some years later i was doing a building a little house on the beach for norton simon and his secretary who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady called me and said
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 988.43 990.69 <o,f0,male> but my point is that
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 991.83 1004.16 <o,f0,male> and i call it the then what ok you solved all the problems you did all the stuff you made nice you loved your clients you loved the city you're a good guy you're a good person
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1004.97 1016.78 <o,f0,male> and then what what do you bring to it and i think that's what i've always been interested in is that which is a personal kind of
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1017.31 1019.16 <o,f0,male> expression
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1024.46 1031.50 <o,f0,male> bilbao i think shows that you can have that kind of personal expression and still touch all the bases
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1032.53 1046.61 <o,f0,male> that are necessary of fitting into the city that's what reminded me of it and i think that's the issue you know it's the then what that most clients who hire architects
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1048.78 1049.08 <o,f0,male> most
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1050.14 1055.68 <o,f0,male> aren't hiring architects for that they're hiring them to get it done get it on budget you know
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1070.56 1072.90 <o,f0,female> at a certain point a number of years ago people when
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1073.79 1077.69 <o,f0,female> michael graves was a fashion before
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1080.50 1082.84 <o,f0,male> i did a teapot and nobody bought it
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1096.06 1105.49 <o,f0,male> people wanted a michael graves building is that a curse that people want a bilbao building
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1108.58 1118.72 <o,f0,male> i've gotten called since bilbao opened which is now four five years i don't know both krens and i have been called
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1119.82 1127.16 <o,f0,male> with i don't know at least one hundred opportunities china brazil
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1128.87 1139.60 <o,f0,male> other parts of spain to come in and do the bilbao effect and i've met with some of these people usually i say no right away
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1140.38 1148.31 <o,f0,male> but some of them come with pedigree and they sound well intentioned and they get you for at least
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1148.95 1157.59 <o,f0,male> one or two meetings in one case i flew all the way to malaga with a team because the thing was signed
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1159.78 1161.40 <o,f0,male> with seals and various
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1163.54 1175.28 <o,f0,male> you know very official seals from the city and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port and i asked them what kind of building it was when you get here we'll explain
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1177.30 1186.52 <o,f0,male> so four of us went and they took us they put us up in a great hotel and we were looking over the
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1188.25 1194.31 <o,f0,male> and then they took us in a boat out in the water and showed us all these sights in the harbor
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1196.25 1200.64 <o,f0,male> each one was more beautiful that the other and then
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1202.22 1213.12 <o,f0,male> going to have lunch with the mayor and we were going to have dinner with the most important people in malaga and just before going to lunch with the mayor
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1213.75 1222.33 <o,f0,male> we went to the harbor commissioner it was a table as long as this carpet and the harbor commissioner was here and i was here and my guys and
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1223.28 1231.80 <o,f0,male> we sat down and we had a drink of water and everybody was quiet and the guy looked at me and said now what can i do for you mister gehry
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1237.11 1240.21 <o,f0,male> oh my god fg so i got up
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1241.31 1253.75 <o,f0,male> i said to my team let 's get out of here we stood up we walked out they followed the guy that dragged us there followed us and he said you mean you're not going to have lunch with the mayor i said nope you 're not going to have dinner at all
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1254.54 1262.42 <o,f0,male> they just brought us there to hustle this group you know to create a project and we get a lot of that
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1266.10 1270.73 <o,f0,male> luckily i'm old enough that you know i can complain i can't travel
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1273.88 1275.47 <o,f0,male> i don't have my own plane
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1288.05 1290.73 <o,f0,male> are you going to talk about me or you
FrankGehry_2002 1 FrankGehry_2002 1303.62 1305.24 <o,f0,male> i want to get a standing ovation like
