IanGoldin_2009G 1 IanGoldin_2009G 92.29 100.28 <o,f0,male> those that are not participating globalization has not been inclusive the second achilles heel is complexity a growing

IanGoldin_2009G 1 IanGoldin_2009G 130.88 142.95 <o,f0,male> our computers our systems will be as primitive as the apollo's are for today our mobile phones are more powerful than the total apollo space engine our mobile phones are more powerful than some of the strongest computers of twenty years ago
IanGoldin_2009G 1 IanGoldin_2009G 143.26 155.75 <o,f0,male> so what will this do it will create huge opportunities in technology miniaturization as well there will be invisible capacity invisible capacity in our bodies in our brains and in the air this is a dust mite on
IanGoldin_2009G 1 IanGoldin_2009G 157.56 166.48 <o,f0,male> sort of ability to do everything in new ways unleashes potential not least in the area of medicine this is a stem cell that we've developed here in oxford
IanGoldin_2009G 1 IanGoldin_2009G 166.69 177.62 <o,f0,male> from an embryonic stem cell we can develop any part of the body increasingly over time this will be possible from our own skin able to replicate parts of the body fantastic potential for regenerative medicine
IanGoldin_2009G 1 IanGoldin_2009G 185.51 193.38 <o,f0,male> who will have it the other major development is going to be in the area of what can happen in genetics the capacity to create
IanGoldin_2009G 1 IanGoldin_2009G 193.93 203.88 <o,f0,male> as this mouse has been genetically modified something which goes three times faster lasts for three times longer we could reduce as this mouse can to the age of our equivalent of eighty years
IanGoldin_2009G 1 IanGoldin_2009G 220.30 228.95 <o,f0,male> the big question for us is how do we manage this technological change how do we ensure that it creates a more inclusive technology a technology
IanGoldin_2009G 1 IanGoldin_2009G 229.37 240.03 <o,f0,male> which means that not only as we grow older that we can also grow wiser and that we're able to support the populations of the future one of the most dramatic manifestations of these improvements will be
IanGoldin_2009G 1 IanGoldin_2009G 249.50 256.73 <o,f0,male> these will be redundant concepts and this isn't only something of the west the most dramatic changes will be the skyscraper type of new
IanGoldin_2009G 1 IanGoldin_2009G 257.36 269.03 <o,f0,male> that will take place in china and in many other countries so forget about retirements if you're young forget about pensions think about life and where it's going to be going of course migration will become even more important the war on
IanGoldin_2009G 1 IanGoldin_2009G 269.55 277.55 <o,f0,male> the need to attract people at all skill ranges to push us around in our wheelchairs but also to drive our economies our innovation will be vital
IanGoldin_2009G 1 IanGoldin_2009G 296.20 305.78 <o,f0,male> the systemic risks we understand that these will become much more virulent that what we see today is this interweaving of societies of systems
IanGoldin_2009G 1 IanGoldin_2009G 306.55 315.67 <o,f0,male> by technologies and hastened by just in time management systems small levels of stock push resilience into other people 's responsibility
IanGoldin_2009G 1 IanGoldin_2009G 315.94 324.97 <o,f0,male> the collapse in biodiversity climate change pandemics financial crises these will be the currency that we will think about and so a new awareness will have to
IanGoldin_2009G 1 IanGoldin_2009G 325.33 333.32 <o,f0,male> of how we deal with these how we mobilize ourselves in a new way and come together as a community to manage systemic risk
IanGoldin_2009G 1 IanGoldin_2009G 333.61 346.19 <o,f0,male> it's going to require innovation it's going to require an understanding that the glory of globalization could also be its downfall this could be our best century ever because of the achievements or it could be our worst
IanGoldin_2009G 1 IanGoldin_2009G 360.67 371.19 <o,f0,male> through the creation for example of a biopathogen how do we begin to weave these tapestries together how do we think about complex systems in new ways that will be the challenge of the scholars and of all of us
IanGoldin_2009G 1 IanGoldin_2009G 372.17 383.44 <o,f0,male> in thinking about the future the rest of our lives will be in the future we need to prepare for it now we need to understand that the governance structure in the world is fossilized it can not begin to cope with the challenges that this will bring
IanGoldin_2009G 1 IanGoldin_2009G 383.70 396.05 <o,f0,male> we have to develop a new way of managing the planet collectively through collective wisdom we know and i know from my own experience that amazing things can happen when individuals and societies come together to change their future
IanGoldin_2009G 1 IanGoldin_2009G 396.30 404.09 <o,f0,male> i left south africa and fifteen years later after thinking i would never go back i had the privilege and the honor to work in the government of nelson mandela this was a miracle
IanGoldin_2009G 1 IanGoldin_2009G 404.21 411.88 <o,f0,male> we can create miracles collectively in our lifetime it is vital that we do so it is vital that the ideas that are nurtured in ted
IanGoldin_2009G 1 IanGoldin_2009G 412.17 420.46 <o,f0,male> that the ideas that we think about look forward and make sure that this will be the most glorious century and not one of eco disaster and eco collapse thank you
