JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 16.07 17.74 <o,f0,male> i'm really scared
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 18.77 20.47 <o,f0,male> i don't think we're going to make it
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 38.27 43.72 <o,f0,male> a real problem we've got a climate crisis so we went around the table to talk about what we should do
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 46.13 49.83 <o,f0,male> the conversation came to my fifteen year old daughter mary
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 50.94 52.90 <o,f0,male> she said i agree with everything that's been
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 55.85 58.17 <o,f0,male> i'm scared and i'm angry
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 58.51 64.82 <o,f0,male> and then she turned to me and said dad your generation created this problem you'd better fix it
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 68.58 70.09 <o,f0,male> all the conversation stopped
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 70.46 71.82 <o,f0,male> all the eyes turned to me
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 77.51 78.69 <o,f0,male> i didn't know what to
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 88.04 89.48 <o,f0,female> we've reached that time
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 91.82 95.55 <o,f0,male> we cannot afford to underestimate this problem
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 96.93 101.55 <o,f0,male> we face irreversible and catastrophic consequences
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 102.33 111.18 <o,f0,male> we must act and we must act decisively i've got to tell you for me everything changed that evening and so my partners and i we set off on this mission
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 111.93 119.81 <o,f0,male> to learn more to try to do much more so we mobilized we got on airplanes we went to brazil we went to china and to india
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 145.11 156.57 <o,f0,male> for this climate crisis we assembled a network really of superstars from policy activists to scientists and entrepreneurs and business leaders fifty or so of them and so
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 156.93 167.42 <o,f0,male> i want to tell you about what we've learned in doing that and four lessons i've learned in the last year the first lesson is that companies are really powerful and that matters a lot
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 168.71 175.40 <o,f0,male> this is a story about how wal mart went green and what that means two years ago the ceo lee scott
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 176.54 182.90 <o,f0,male> that green is the next big thing and so wal mart made going green a top priority
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 183.46 193.45 <o,f0,male> they committed that they're going to take their existing stores and reduce their energy consumption by twenty percent and their new stores by thirty percent and do all that in seven years
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 194.54 205.55 <o,f0,male> the three biggest uses of energy in a store are heating and air conditioning then lighting and then refrigeration so look what they did they painted the roofs of all their stores white
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 206.77 220.03 <o,f0,male> they put smart skylights through their stores so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands and third they put the refrigerated goods behind closed doors with led lighting i mean why would you try to refrigerate a whole store
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 220.77 228.75 <o,f0,male> these are really simple smart solutions based on existing technology why does wal mart matter well it's massive
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 237.76 247.62 <o,f0,male> have one of the world 's most amazing supply chains sixty thousand suppliers if wal mart were a country it would be the sixth largest trading partner with china
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 248.56 257.16 <o,f0,male> most important they have a big effect on other companies when wal mart declares it's going to go green and be profitable
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 257.38 266.60 <o,f0,male> it has a powerful impact on other great institutions so let me tell you this when wal mart achieves twenty percent energy reductions that's going to be a very big deal
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 267.83 269.98 <o,f0,male> but i'm afraid it's not enough
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 270.64 274.98 <o,f0,male> we need wal mart and every other company to do the same
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 276.15 280.92 <o,f0,male> the second thing that we learned is that individuals matter and they matter enormously
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 281.26 282.96 <o,f0,male> i've got another wal mart story for you
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 283.89 289.06 <o,f0,male> wal mart has over one hundred and twenty five million u s customers that's a third of the u s population
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 290.52 295.07 <o,f0,male> sixty five million compact fluorescent light bulbs were sold last year
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 296.16 300.85 <o,f0,male> and wal mart has committed they're going to sell another one hundred million light bulbs in the coming year
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 310.18 323.21 <o,f0,male> but the pay off is really enormous one hundred million compact fluorescent light bulbs means that we'll save six hundred million dollars in energy bills and twenty million tons of co two every year
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 323.72 325.20 <o,f0,male> year in and year out
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 326.77 338.28 <o,f0,male> it does seem really hard to get consumers to do the right thing it is stupid that we use two tons of steel glass and plastic to haul our sorry selves to the shopping mall
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 339.54 346.49 <o,f0,male> it's stupid that we put water in plastic bottles in fiji and ship it here
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 348.58 350.91 <o,f0,male> it's hard to change consumer behavior because
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 355.68 359.55 <o,f0,male> you know how much co two you generated to drive here or fly here
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 361.01 362.28 <o,f0,male> i don't know and i should
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 363.86 367.33 <o,f0,male> those of us who care about all this would act better if we knew what
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 367.69 374.61 <o,f0,male> the real costs were but as long as we pretend that co two is free as long as these uses are nearly invisible
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 375.07 383.05 <o,f0,male> how can we expect change i'm really afraid because i think the kinds of changes we can reasonably expect from individuals
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 383.72 386.12 <o,f0,male> are going to be clearly not enough
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 388.17 390.44 <o,f0,male> the third lesson we learned is that policy matters
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 390.97 394.19 <o,f0,male> it really matters in fact policy is paramount
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 407.41 411.42 <o,f0,male> hand he stood up you know bob 's that berkeley techie type who started sybase
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 412.08 419.16 <o,f0,male> well bob said the most important thing we could do right now is to make it clear in sacramento california
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 419.57 426.83 <o,f0,male> that we need a market based system of mandates that's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in california
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 428.48 433.49 <o,f0,male> it's necessary and just as important it's good for the california economy so
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 453.55 457.82 <o,f0,male> thank you i think it's the most important legislation of two thousand and six why
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 510.62 519.01 <o,f0,male> he told us that brazil 's government mandated that every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol and they mandated that
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 519.48 530.29 <o,f0,male> their new vehicles would be flex fuel compatible right they'd run ethanol or ordinary gasoline and so here 's what's happened in brazil they now have twenty nine thousand ethanol pumps
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 531.13 540.34 <o,f0,male> seven hundred in the u s and a paltry two in california and in three years their new car fleet has gone from four percent to eighty five percent flex fuel
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 541.58 542.90 <o,f0,male> compare that to the u s
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 543.45 545.91 <o,f0,male> five percent are flex fuel and you know what
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 561.08 572.85 <o,f0,male> didn't ship to the middle east it's created a million jobs inside that country and it's saved thirty two million tons of co two it's really substantial that's ten percent of the co two emissions across their entire country
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 573.52 576.41 <o,f0,male> but brazil 's only one point three percent of the world 's
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 584.84 593.14 <o,f0,male> in fact i'm afraid all of the best policies we have are not going to be enough the fourth and final lesson we've learned
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 593.35 606.14 <o,f0,male> is about the potential of radical innovation so i want to tell you about a tragic problem and a breakthrough technology every year a million and a half people die of a completely preventable disease that's malaria six thousand people a day
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 607.73 614.02 <o,f0,male> all for want of two dollars worth of medications that we can buy at the corner drugstore well two dollars two dollars
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 614.68 627.51 <o,f0,male> too much for africa so a team of berkeley researchers with fifteen million dollars from the gates foundation is engineering designing a radical new way to make the key ingredient called
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 629.70 631.33 <o,f0,male> to make that drug ten times cheaper
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 632.01 636.89 <o,f0,male> and in doing so they'll save a million lives at least a million lives a year a million lives
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 638.30 652.11 <o,f0,male> their breakthrough technology is synthetic biology this leverages millions of years of evolution by redesigning bugs to make really useful products now what you do is you get inside the microbe you change its metabolic pathways and
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 661.91 669.20 <o,f0,male> now formed a company called amyris and this technology that they're using can be used to make better biofuels
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 670.27 677.41 <o,f0,male> let me skip over that better biofuels are a really big deal that means we can precisely engineer the molecules in the fuel chain
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 677.78 685.91 <o,f0,male> and optimize them along the way so if all goes well they're going to have designer bugs in warm vats that are
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 688.28 695.46 <o,f0,male> and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels i guess that's better living through bugs
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 696.91 707.20 <o,f0,male> alan kay is famous for saying the best way to predict the future is to invent it and of course at kleiner we kind of apologize and say the second best way is to finance it and that's why we're investing
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 707.91 718.48 <o,f0,male> two hundred million dollars in a wide range of really disruptive new technologies for innovation in green technologies and we're encouraging others to do it as well we're talking a lot about this
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 729.82 731.14 <o,f0,male> i'm really afraid
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 731.52 733.63 <o,f0,male> we need much much more
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 754.59 762.05 <o,f0,male> you didn't know that there's enough energy in hot rocks under the country to supply america 's energy needs for the next thousand years
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 771.84 780.33 <o,f0,male> that we are not investing more in energy research in this country and i am really afraid that it's absolutely not enough
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 780.96 793.13 <o,f0,male> so in a year 's worth of learning we found a bunch of surprises who would have thought that a mass retailer could make money by going green who would have thought that a database entrepreneur could transform california with legislation who would have thought that the
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 806.03 808.98 <o,f0,male> and who would have thought that all that is not enough
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 811.04 819.76 <o,f0,male> not enough to stabilize the climate not enough to keep the ice in greenland from crashing into the ocean the scientists tell us and they're only guessing that we've got to reduce
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 830.68 834.36 <o,f0,male> and so somehow we're going to have to find the political will to do this all around the world
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 837.03 846.92 <o,f0,male> the wild card in this deck is china to size the problem china 's co two emissions today are three point three gigatons the u s is five point
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 848.74 855.46 <o,f0,male> business as usual means we'll have twenty three gigatons from china by two thousand and fifty that's about as much co two as there is in the whole world
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 855.76 865.15 <o,f0,male> and if it's business as usual we're going out of business when i was in davos china 's mayor of dalian was pressed about their co two strategy and he said the following you know
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 870.11 877.09 <o,f0,male> then he asked why should china sacrifice our growth so that the west can continue to be profligate and stupid
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 885.25 888.80 <o,f0,male> so that all people and all nations
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 900.53 910.00 <o,f0,male> tell you what green technologies going green is bigger than the internet it could be the biggest economic opportunity of the twenty one st century moreover if we succeed
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 910.48 922.24 <o,f0,male> it's going to be the most important transformation for life on the planet since as bill joy says we went from methane to oxygen in the atmosphere now here 's the hard question if the trajectory
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 922.60 930.64 <o,f0,male> of all the world 's companies and individuals and policies and innovation is not going to be enough what are we going to do
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 935.80 940.87 <o,f0,male> everyone here cares about changing the world and has made a difference in that one way or another
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 941.99 943.93 <o,f0,male> so our call to action
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 944.63 948.42 <o,f0,male> my call to you is for you to make going green
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 956.52 966.38 <o,f0,male> you can personally get carbon neutral go to climatecrisis org or carboncalculator com and buy carbon credits you could join other leaders in
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 967.13 975.04 <o,f0,male> mandating lobbying for mandated cap and trade in u s greenhouse gas reductions there's six bills right now in congress let 's get one of
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 977.40 984.06 <o,f0,male> the most important thing you can do i think is to use your personal power and your rolodex to lead your business your institution
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 984.55 992.16 <o,f0,male> going green do it like wal mart get it to go green for its customers and its suppliers and for itself
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 993.28 1003.96 <o,f0,male> really think outside the box can you imagine what it would be like if amazon or ebay or google or microsoft or apple really went green and you caused that to happen
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 1009.49 1017.48 <o,f0,male> i can't wait to see what we tedsters do about this crisis and i really really hope
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 1017.90 1023.54 <o,f0,male> that we multiply all of our energy all of our talent and all of our influence to solve this problem
JohnDoerr_2007 1 JohnDoerr_2007 1035.46 1041.88 <o,f0,male> if we do i can look forward to the conversation i'm going to have with my daughter
