JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 23.52 23.92 <o,f0,male> is not
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 26.99 27.68 <o,f0,male> global warming
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 30.25 35.79 <o,f0,male> bioenergy is something which seems counterintuitive bioenergy is oil it's gas
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 36.49 36.80 <o,f0,male> it's
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 37.84 45.53 <o,f0,male> and part of building that bridge to the future to the point where we can actually see the oceans in a rational way or put up these geo spatial orbits
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 53.85 56.22 <o,f0,male> and to do that you really have to look first at agriculture
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 57.58 60.44 <o,f0,male> so we've been planting stuff for eleven thousand years
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 61.51 67.86 <o,f0,male> and in the measure that we plant stuff what we learn from agriculture is you've got to deal with pests you've got to deal with
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 75.44 77.36 <o,f0,male> then you're going to be able to spread beyond the nile
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 78.92 88.54 <o,f0,male> power stuff so irrigation makes a difference irrigation starts to make you be allowed to plant stuff where you want it as opposed to where the rivers flood
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 89.39 91.67 <o,f0,male> you start getting this organic agriculture
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 92.46 94.57 <o,f0,male> you start putting machinery onto this stuff
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 102.50 109.14 <o,f0,male> machines and water and you get landscapes that look like this and then you get sales that look like
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 112.07 122.78 <o,f0,male> so what you've been doing in agriculture is you start out with something that's a reasonably natural system you start taming that natural system you put a lot of force behind that natural system you put a whole bunch of
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 133.60 135.67 <o,f0,male> up with systems that look like this
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 142.71 153.00 <o,f0,male> so the lesson in agriculture is that you can actually change the system that's based on brute force as you start merging that system and learning that system and actually applying biology
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 153.57 164.38 <o,f0,male> and you move from a discipline of engineering you move from a discipline of chemistry into a discipline of biology and probably one of the most important human beings on the planet is this guy behind me
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 165.38 171.80 <o,f0,male> this is a guy called norman borlaug he won the nobel prize he 's got the congressional medal of honor he deserves all of this stuff
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 173.21 182.48 <o,f0,male> and he deserves this stuff because he probably has fed more people than any other human being alive because he researched how to put biology behind seeds
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 183.01 194.86 <o,f0,male> he did this in mexico the reason why india and china no longer have these massive famines is because norman borlaug taught them how to grow grains in a more efficient way and launched the green revolution
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 196.15 203.88 <o,f0,male> that is something that a lot of people have criticized but of course those are people who don't realize that china and india instead of having huge amounts of starving people
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 204.37 205.58 <o,f0,male> are exporting grains
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 206.42 214.55 <o,f0,male> and the irony of this particular system is the place where he did the research which was mexico didn't adopt this technology ignored this technology talked about
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 215.09 222.90 <o,f0,male> why this technology should be thought about but not really applied and mexico remains one of the largest grain importers on the planet
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 235.02 237.70 <o,f0,male> and the institute that this guy ran has now moved to india
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 239.16 242.96 <o,f0,male> that is the difference between adopting technologies and discussing technologies
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 244.37 248.76 <o,f0,male> now it's not just that this guy fed a huge amount of people in the world
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 250.32 255.62 <o,f0,male> that this is the net effect in terms of what technology does if you understand biology
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 267.31 268.07 <o,f0,male> look different
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 268.84 270.98 <o,f0,male> the machines were tractors or
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 271.53 278.04 <o,f0,male> stuff instead of mules but the farmer would have understood this is what the guy 's doing this is why he 's doing it this is where he 's going
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 279.39 287.50 <o,f0,male> what really started to change in agriculture is when you started moving from this brute force engineering and chemistry into biology and that's where you get your productivity increases
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 288.28 289.46 <o,f0,male> and as you do that stuff
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 290.43 295.84 <o,f0,male> here 's what happens to productivity basically you go from two hundred and fifty hours to produce one hundred bushels
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 296.29 297.93 <o,f0,male> to forty to fifteen to five
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 303.26 304.23 <o,f0,male> fifty to two thousand
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 305.45 307.65 <o,f0,male> the rest of the economy increased about two point
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 308.63 313.28 <o,f0,male> this is an absolutely massive increase in how much is produced per person
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 319.86 323.24 <o,f0,male> and fifty percent of the eu budget is going to subsidize agriculture
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 324.27 326.65 <o,f0,male> mountains of stuff that people have overproduced
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 328.26 330.31 <o,f0,male> this would be a good outcome for energy
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 337.01 338.95 <o,f0,male> i thought i came to a talk about energy
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 340.11 342.05 <o,f0,male> and here 's this guy talking about biology
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 343.43 344.93 <o,f0,male> so where's the link between these two things
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 346.52 353.11 <o,f0,male> the ironies of this whole system is we're discussing what to do about a system that we don't understand we don't even know what
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 354.89 356.14 <o,f0,male> we don't know where oil comes from
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 363.56 367.58 <o,f0,male> the best assumption and one of the best guesses in this stuff is that this stuff
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 371.56 373.24 <o,f0,male> that these things absorb sunlight
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 374.42 375.96 <o,f0,male> under pressure for millions of years
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 377.09 378.17 <o,f0,male> and you get these black rivers
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 380.29 385.49 <o,f0,male> the interesting thing about that thesis if that thesis turns out to be true is that oil
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 390.94 399.79 <o,f0,male> if you think of bioenergy bioenergy isn't ethanol bioenergy is taking the sun concentrating it in amoebas concentrating it in plants
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 400.63 402.37 <o,f0,male> and maybe that's why you get these rainbows
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 404.81 406.41 <o,f0,male> as you're looking at this system
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 407.23 409.78 <o,f0,male> if hydrocarbons are concentrated sunlight
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 411.02 413.52 <o,f0,male> then bioenergy works in a different way
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 414.51 416.23 <o,f0,male> we've got to start thinking of oil
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 417.08 418.29 <o,f0,male> and other hydrocarbons
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 419.16 421.06 <o,f0,male> as part of these solar panels
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 423.60 426.78 <o,f0,male> maybe that's one of the reasons why if you fly over west texas
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 428.63 431.27 <o,f0,male> the types of wells that you're beginning to see don't look
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 434.66 435.84 <o,f0,male> those irrigated plots
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 437.01 438.49 <o,f0,male> this is how you farm oil
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 439.15 445.24 <o,f0,male> and as you think of farming oil and how oil has evolved we started with this brute force approach
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 446.52 449.28 <o,f0,male> and then what did we learn then we learned we had to go bigger
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 450.61 452.95 <o,f0,male> and then what'd we learn then we have to go even
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 455.05 458.47 <o,f0,male> and we are getting really destructive as we're going out
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 460.89 472.87 <o,f0,male> these are the athabasca tar sands and there's an enormous amount first of mining the largest trucks in the world are working here and then you've got to pull out this black sludge which is basically oil that doesn't flow
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 473.79 479.90 <o,f0,male> tied to the sand and then you've got to use a lot of steam to separate it which only works at today 's oil prices
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 492.95 499.53 <o,f0,male> so you take something like this you burn it you put it under pressure and likely as not you get this although again i stress we don't know
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 500.30 501.91 <o,f0,male> which is curious as we debate all this stuff
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 502.94 504.19 <o,f0,male> but as you think of coal
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 504.73 506.96 <o,f0,male> this is what burned wheat kernels look like
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 508.59 510.25 <o,f0,male> not entirely unlike coal
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 511.35 512.56 <o,f0,male> and of course coal mines
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 513.76 514.99 <o,f0,male> are very dangerous places
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 519.48 521.17 <o,f0,male> when that gas blows up people die
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 523.58 528.17 <o,f0,male> so you're producing a biogas out of coal in some mines but not in others
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 528.81 532.24 <o,f0,male> any place you see a differential there 're some interesting questions
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 533.42 535.65 <o,f0,male> some questions as to what you should be doing with this stuff
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 536.74 545.59 <o,f0,male> but again coal maybe the same stuff maybe the same system maybe bioenergy and you're applying exactly the same technology here 's your brute force approach
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 551.19 554.01 <o,f0,male> and you end up with the single largest source of carbon emissions
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 555.58 557.44 <o,f0,male> which are coal fired gas plants
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 558.72 560.97 <o,f0,male> that is probably not the best use of
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 563.59 574.31 <o,f0,male> as you think of what are the alternatives to this system it's important to find alternatives because it turns out that the u s is dwindling in its petroleum reserves but it is not dwindling in its coal reserves
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 577.34 580.08 <o,f0,male> there are huge coal reserves that are sitting out there
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 580.79 589.33 <o,f0,male> and we've got to start thinking of them as biological energy because if we keep treating them as chemical energy or engineering energy we're gonna be in deep doo doo
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 593.84 594.79 <o,f0,male> a similar issue
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 596.09 598.53 <o,f0,male> gas is also a biological product
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 599.72 601.03 <o,f0,male> and as you think of gas
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 606.98 608.82 <o,f0,male> and here 's a different way of mining coal
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 610.59 612.15 <o,f0,male> this is called coal bed methane
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 613.78 619.03 <o,f0,male> why is this picture interesting because if coal turns out to be concentrated plant life
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 620.59 628.46 <o,f0,male> the reason why you may get a differential in gas output between one mine and another the reason why one mine may blow up and another one may not
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 630.16 631.27 <o,f0,male> because there's stuff
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 631.97 634.08 <o,f0,male> that stuff and producing gas
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 646.24 655.46 <o,f0,male> it may turn out that biological processes in coal mines have the same process if that is true then one of the ways of getting the energy out of coal may not be to
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 656.26 657.21 <o,f0,male> whole mountaintops
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 658.15 666.51 <o,f0,male> and it may not be to burn coal it may be to have stuff process that coal in a biological fashion as you did in agriculture
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 668.61 669.26 <o,f0,male> that is what
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 671.61 679.68 <o,f0,male> it is not ethanol it is not subsidies to a few companies it is not importing corn into iowa because you've built so many of these ethanol plants
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 680.14 690.20 <o,f0,male> it is beginning to understand the transition that occurred in agriculture from brute force into biological force and in the measure that you can do that you can clean some stuff and you can clean it pretty quickly
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 708.60 715.53 <o,f0,male> this is just the beginning stages of this stuff and as you think of biomaterials this guy who did part of the sequencing of the human genome
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 717.30 721.36 <o,f0,male> the databases of genes and proteins known on earth by sailing around the world
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 722.48 726.51 <o,f0,male> has been thinking about how you structure this and there's a series of smart people thinking about
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 733.52 740.23 <o,f0,male> and what those companies are trying to do is to think of how do you apply biological principles to avoid brute force
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 741.76 752.84 <o,f0,male> think of it in the following terms think of it as beginning to program stuff for specific purposes think of the cell as a hardware think of the genes as a software
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 753.78 764.96 <o,f0,male> and in the measure that you begin to think of life as code that is interchangeable that can become energy that can become food that can become fiber that can become human beings that can become a whole series of things
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 766.43 773.67 <o,f0,male> then you've got to shift your approach as to how you're going to structure and deal and think about energy in a very different way
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 775.74 778.09 <o,f0,male> what are the first principles of this stuff and where are we
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 779.43 784.52 <o,f0,male> this is one of the gentle giants on the planet he 's one of the nicest human beings you've ever met
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 787.24 792.24 <o,f0,male> he won the nobel for figuring out how to cut genes something called restriction enzymes
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 793.74 797.11 <o,f0,male> he was at hopkins when he did this and he 's such a modest guy
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 797.86 799.89 <o,f0,male> that the day he won his mother called
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 812.28 817.25 <o,f0,male> but anyway this guy is just a class act you find him at the bench every single day
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 824.09 835.35 <o,f0,male> what is this this is the first transplant of naked dna where you take an entire dna operating system out of one cell insert it into a different cell and have that cell boot up as a separate species
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 840.36 844.11 <o,f0,male> you will see stuff in the next month that will be just as important as this stuff
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 845.82 850.79 <o,f0,male> and as you think about this stuff and what the implications of this are we're going to start not just
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 861.22 866.86 <o,f0,male> it is very expensive to process this stuff both in economic terms and in energy terms
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 868.08 870.59 <o,f0,male> this is what accumulates in the tar sands of alberta
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 871.74 872.92 <o,f0,male> these are sulfur blocks
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 874.07 880.76 <o,f0,male> because as you separate that petroleum from the sand and use an enormous amount of energy inside that vapor
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 881.49 889.07 <o,f0,male> steam to separate this stuff you also have to separate out the sulfur the difference between light crude and heavy crude well it's about fourteen bucks a barrel
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 890.30 895.64 <o,f0,male> that's why you're building these pyramids of sulfur blocks and by the way the scale on these things is pretty large
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 897.22 901.79 <o,f0,male> now if you can take part of the energy content out of doing this you reduce the system
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 903.02 908.25 <o,f0,male> and you really do start applying biological principles to energy this has to be a bridge
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 909.22 914.95 <o,f0,male> to the point where you can get to wind to the point where you can get to solar to the point where you can get to nuclear
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 916.03 921.00 <o,f0,male> and hopefully you won 't build the next nuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to an earthquake fault
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 930.73 932.31 <o,f0,male> for the next decade at least
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 933.08 934.49 <o,f0,male> the name of the game is hydrocarbons
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 936.15 939.64 <o,f0,male> and be that oil be that gas be that coal
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 940.21 941.42 <o,f0,male> this is what we're dealing with
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 942.50 944.71 <o,f0,male> and before i make this talk too long
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 947.62 949.74 <o,f0,male> here 's what's happening in the current energy system
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 951.03 958.88 <o,f0,male> eighty six percent of the energy we consume are hydrocarbons that means eighty six percent of the stuff we're consuming are probably processed plants
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 959.76 961.15 <o,f0,male> amoebas and the rest of the stuff
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 969.01 971.88 <o,f0,male> how we deal with that other portion is our bridge to the future
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 972.99 981.28 <o,f0,male> and as we think of this bridge to the future one of the things you should ponder is we are leaving about two thirds of the oil today inside those wells
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 983.22 984.53 <o,f0,male> an enormous amount of money
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 985.26 986.68 <o,f0,male> and leaving most of the energy down
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 987.68 997.91 <o,f0,male> which of course requires more energy to go out and get energy the ratios become idiotic by the time you get to ethanol it may even be a one to one ratio on the energy input and the energy
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 999.33 1001.70 <o,f0,male> that is a stupid way of managing this system
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 1003.27 1005.22 <o,f0,male> last point last graph
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 1006.74 1008.90 <o,f0,male> one of the things that we've got to do is to stabilize oil
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 1010.76 1012.13 <o,f0,male> this is what oil prices look like
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 1013.68 1023.12 <o,f0,male> this is a very bad system because what happens is your hurdle rate gets set very low people come up with really smart ideas for solar panels or for wind or for something else
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 1023.43 1028.85 <o,f0,male> and then guess what the oil price goes through the floor that company goes out of business and then you can bring the oil price back
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 1030.10 1032.86 <o,f0,male> so if i had one closing and modest suggestion
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 1034.75 1037.07 <o,f0,male> stable oil price in europe and the united states
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 1038.78 1050.90 <o,f0,male> how do you do that well let 's put a tax on oil that is a non revenue tax and it basically says for the next twenty years the price of oil will be whatever you want thirty five bucks forty bucks
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 1051.78 1054.43 <o,f0,male> if the opec price falls below that we tax
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 1055.74 1058.37 <o,f0,male> if the opec price goes above that the tax goes away
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 1074.73 1083.98 <o,f0,male> not put people through this cycle where it doesn't pay to research because your company will go out of business as opec drives alternatives and keeps bioenergy from happening
