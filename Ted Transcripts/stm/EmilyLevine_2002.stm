EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 13.85 22.56 <o,f0,female> i am going to talk about myself which i rarely do because i well for one thing i prefer to talk about things i know nothing about
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 23.66 24.67 <o,f0,female> and secondly
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 30.94 41.51 <o,f0,female> know i was a narcissist actually i thought narcissism meant you loved yourself and then someone told me there is a flip side to it so it's actually drearier than self love it's unrequited self love
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 46.53 50.87 <o,f0,female> i don't feel i can afford a relapse but i want to
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 51.13 60.58 <o,f0,female> though explain how i came to design my own particular brand of comedy because i've been through so many different forms of it i started with improvisation in a particular
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 74.54 85.97 <o,f0,female> and of course we live in a society that's all about contradicting other peoples reality it's all about contradiction which i think is why i'm so sensitive to contradiction in general i see it everywhere
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 86.44 96.28 <o,f0,female> like polls you know it's always curious to me that in public opinion polls the percentage of americans who don't know the answer to any given question is always
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 98.25 109.87 <o,f0,female> seventy five percent of americans think alaska is part of canada but only two percent don't know the effect that the debacle in argentina will have on the imf 's monetary policy
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 114.59 124.15 <o,f0,female> or this ad that i read in the new york times wearing a fine watch speaks loudly of your rank in society buying it from us screams good taste
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 127.18 133.10 <o,f0,female> that i found in a magazine called california lawyer in an article that is surely meant for the lawyers at enron
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 139.04 143.68 <o,f0,female> use big words learn the lingua franca
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 151.74 153.73 <o,f0,female> yeah lingua this frankie
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 157.59 165.43 <o,f0,female> a contradiction that i talk about science when i don't know math you know because and by the way to i was so grateful to
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 165.81 180.53 <o,f0,female> kamen for pointing out that one of the reasons that there are cultural reasons that women and minorities don't enter the fields of science and technology because for instance the reason i don't do math is i was taught to do math and read at the same time
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 181.32 193.35 <o,f0,female> so you're six years old you're reading snow white and the seven dwarfs it becomes rapidly obvious that there are only two kinds of men in the world dwarfs and prince charmings and the odds are seven to one against your finding the
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 214.74 220.75 <o,f0,female> very upset with me i used the word postmodern as if it were ok
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 247.36 255.65 <o,f0,female> well rationality is constructed by what christie hefner was talking about today that mind body split you know the head is
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 256.30 263.82 <o,f0,female> body bad head is ego body id when we say i as when rene descartes said i think therefore i am
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 264.32 266.04 <o,f0,female> we mean the head
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 266.52 271.09 <o,f0,female> and as david lee roth sang in just a gigolo i ain't got no body
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 272.85 277.51 <o,f0,female> that's how you get rationality and that's why so much
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 278.93 281.20 <o,f0,female> the body asserting itself against the
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 300.88 307.92 <o,f0,female> yes but it's also the head the head of the conference that's the other way that humor like art buchwald
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 308.58 314.02 <o,f0,female> takes shots at the heads of state doesn't make quite as much money as body humor i'm sure
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 315.80 328.00 <o,f0,female> but nevertheless what makes us treasure you and adore you there's also a contradiction in rationality in this country though which is as much as we revere the head we are very anti intellectual
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 328.61 338.51 <o,f0,female> i know this because i read in the new york times the ayn rand foundation took out a full page ad after september eleven in which they said the
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 342.49 347.92 <o,f0,female> in this country facing this country is the university professors and their spawn
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 360.95 364.23 <o,f0,female> how many of you have read it and i'm not an expert on
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 379.92 387.56 <o,f0,female> when they lay together in bed it was as it had to be as the nature of the act demanded an act of violence
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 388.33 398.39 <o,f0,female> it was an act of clenched teeth and hatred it was the unendurable not a caress but a wave of pain the agony as an act of passion
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 398.71 409.27 <o,f0,female> so you can imagine my surprise on reading in the new yorker that alan greenspan chairman of the federal reserve claims ayn rand as his intellectual mentor
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 418.32 426.55 <o,f0,female> enough we had to see j edgar hoover in a dress now we have to picture alan greenspan in a black leather corset with a butt tattoo that says whip inflation
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 435.45 444.67 <o,f0,female> and ayn rand of course ayn rand is famous for a philosophy called objectivism which reflects another value of newtonian physics which is objectivity
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 459.27 467.41 <o,f0,female> passive no voice i was so fascinated by that oxygen commercial i don't know if you know this but
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 467.81 478.03 <o,f0,female> maybe it's different now or maybe you were making a statement but in many hospital nurseries across the country until very recently anyway according to a book by jessica benjamin the
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 478.30 485.12 <o,f0,female> signs over the little boys cribs read i 'm a boy and the signs over the little girls cribs read
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 486.83 494.08 <o,f0,female> yeah so the passivity was culturally projected onto the little girls and this
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 494.24 497.14 <o,f0,female> still goes on as i think i told you last year there's a
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 497.77 509.01 <o,f0,female> poll that proves there was a poll that was given by time magazine in which only men were asked have you ever had sex with a woman you actively disliked
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 511.60 513.34 <o,f0,female> well fifty eight percent said yes
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 514.35 518.41 <o,f0,female> i think is overinflated though because so many men if you just say have you ever had sex
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 539.04 539.52 <o,f0,female> object
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 541.60 543.68 <o,f0,female> part of something i'm very interested in
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 544.13 544.61 <o,f0,female> is
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 546.76 552.16 <o,f0,female> why frankly i believe in political correctness i do i think it can go too far i think
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 552.58 562.47 <o,f0,female> ringling brothers may have gone too far with an ad they took out in the new york times magazine we have a lifelong emotional and financial commitment to our asian elephant partners
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 571.05 571.68 <o,f0,female> i don't think
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 571.82 585.47 <o,f0,female> that a person of color making fun of white people is the same thing as a white person making fun of people of color or women making fun of men is the same as men making fun of or poor people making fun of rich people the same as rich people i think you can make fun of the have
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 585.78 591.74 <o,f0,female> but not the have nots which is why you don't see me making fun of kenneth lay and his charming wife
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 593.59 596.01 <o,f0,female> what's funny about being down to four houses
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 610.07 613.67 <o,f0,female> when people i knew you know people who considered themselves liberal
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 613.77 623.10 <o,f0,female> and everything else were making fun of jennifer flowers and paula jones basically they were making fun of them for being
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 623.81 631.82 <o,f0,female> trailer trash or white trash it seems i suppose a harmless prejudice and that you're not really hurting anybody until you
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 633.90 640.02 <o,f0,female> an ad in the los angeles times for sale white trash compactor
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 650.84 654.24 <o,f0,female> subject object thing has relevance to humor
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 654.35 667.87 <o,f0,female> in this way i read a book by a woman named amy richlin who is the chair of the classics department at usc and the book is called the garden of priapus and she says that roman humor
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 669.30 681.59 <o,f0,female> mirrors the construction of roman society so that roman society was very top bottom as ours is to some degree and so was humor there always had to the butt of a joke
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 682.06 694.09 <o,f0,female> so it was always the satirist like juvenal or marshall represented the audience and he was going to make fun of the outsider the person who
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 694.52 700.33 <o,f0,female> didn't share that subject status and in stand up of course the
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 701.30 709.25 <o,f0,female> up comedian is supposed to dominate the audience a lot of heckling is the tension of trying to make sure that the
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 711.35 724.16 <o,f0,female> comedian is going to be able to dominate and overcome the heckler and i got good at that when i was in stand up but i always hated it because they were dictating the terms of the interaction
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 724.34 734.67 <o,f0,female> in the same way that engaging in a serious argument determines the content to some degree of what you're talking about and i was looking for a form
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 735.33 738.50 <o,f0,female> that didn't have that and
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 742.05 746.48 <o,f0,female> i wanted something that was more interactive i know that word is so
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 753.22 756.22 <o,f0,female> i really miss the old telemarketers now i'll tell you that
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 756.91 763.12 <o,f0,female> i do because at least there you stood a chance you know i used to actually hang up on them
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 763.87 771.09 <o,f0,female> i read in dear abby that that was rude so the next time that one called i let him get halfway through his spiel and then i said you
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 795.33 803.68 <o,f0,female> the world and that's really what i'm looking for and i was sort of as i was starting to analyze what exactly it is that i do
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 804.67 812.01 <o,f0,female> i read a book called trickster makes this world by lewis hyde and it was like being psychoanalyzed i mean he had laid it all out
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 812.47 825.07 <o,f0,female> and then coming to this conference i realized that most everybody here shared those same qualities because really what trickster is is an agent of change trickster is a change agent
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 825.35 835.97 <o,f0,female> and the qualities that i'm about to describe are the qualities that make it possible to make change happen and one of these is boundary crossing
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 836.63 845.02 <o,f0,female> i think this is what so in fact infuriated the scientists but i like to cross boundaries i like to as i said talk about things i know nothing about
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 849.16 850.84 <o,f0,female> i hope that's my agent because
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 854.80 862.63 <o,f0,female> and i think it's good to talk about things i know nothing about because i bring a fresh viewpoint to it you know i'm able to see the contradiction that you may not be
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 864.04 871.27 <o,f0,female> for instance a mime once or a meme as he called himself he was a very selfish meme and
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 872.60 881.47 <o,f0,female> he said that i had to show more respect because it took up to eighteen years to learn how to do mime properly and i said well
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 882.28 884.33 <o,f0,female> you know only stupid people go into it
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 885.78 888.29 <o,f0,female> it only takes two years to learn how to talk
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 896.63 903.77 <o,f0,female> problem with quote objectivity unquote when you're only surrounded by people who speak the same vocabulary as you
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 904.41 911.80 <o,f0,female> share the same set of assumptions as you you start to think that that's reality like economists you know their definition of
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 912.26 918.28 <o,f0,female> rational that we all act out of our own economic self interest well look at michael
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 918.84 926.90 <o,f0,female> or look at dean kamen or look at my grandmother my grandmother always acted in other people 's interests whether they wanted her to or not
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 930.77 934.82 <o,f0,female> olympics in martyrdom my grandmother would have lost on purpose
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 943.69 946.52 <o,f0,female> young i'm old who 's going to see it where am i going
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 950.69 956.35 <o,f0,female> that's one this boundary crossing this go between which fritz lanting is
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 965.72 978.98 <o,f0,female> and this is instead of contradiction where you deny the other person 's reality you have paradox where you allow more than one reality to coexist i think there's another philosophical
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 982.73 989.59 <o,f0,female> what it's called but my example of it is a sign that i saw in a jewelry store it said ears pierced while you wait
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1002.78 1006.24 <o,f0,female> have some errands to run so i'll be back to pick them up around five
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1016.57 1028.47 <o,f0,female> and another attribute of the trickster is smart luck that accidents that louis kahn who talked about accidents this is another quality of the trickster the trickster has a mind
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1028.92 1037.97 <o,f0,female> that is prepared for the unprepared that and i will say this to the scientists that the trickster has
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1038.09 1045.45 <o,f0,female> the ability to hold his ideas lightly so that he can let room in for new
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1046.16 1056.36 <o,f0,female> to see the contradictions or the hidden problems with his ideas i had no joke for that i just wanted to put the scientists in their place
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1061.55 1065.54 <o,f0,female> but here 's how i think i like to make change and that is
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1065.64 1071.71 <o,f0,female> in making connections this is what i tend to see almost more than contradictions like
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1072.10 1079.24 <o,f0,female> the what do you call those toes of the gecko you know the toes of the gecko curling and uncurling like the
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1082.59 1085.82 <o,f0,female> i love connections like i'll read that one of the two
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1086.25 1098.03 <o,f0,female> of matter in the newtonian universe there are two attributes of matter in the newtonian universe one is space occupancy matter takes up space i guess the more you matter the more space you take up which explains the
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1103.18 1110.89 <o,f0,female> one though is impenetrability well in ancient rome impenetrability was the criterion of masculinity
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1121.45 1126.50 <o,f0,female> consumer which explains why business always has to penetrate new markets
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1127.53 1128.50 <o,f0,female> yeah i mean why we
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1130.43 1133.55 <o,f0,female> open her markets and didn't that feel good
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1137.84 1149.99 <o,f0,female> and now we're being penetrated you know the biotech companies are actually going inside us and planting their little flags on our genes you know we're being penetrated and i suspect by someone who actively dislikes
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1154.99 1161.39 <o,f0,female> that's the second of the quadruple yes of course you got that thank you very much i still have a way to go
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1165.67 1171.13 <o,f0,female> what i hope to do when i make these connections is short circuit
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1171.31 1179.89 <o,f0,female> people 's thinking you know make you not follow your usual train of association but make you rewire
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1180.08 1187.61 <o,f0,female> it literally when people say about the shock of recognition it's literally re cognition rewiring how you think
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1193.55 1205.79 <o,f0,female> had a joke to go with this and i forgot it i'm so sorry i'm getting like the woman in that joke about have you heard this joke about the woman driving with her mother and the mother
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1206.00 1213.81 <o,f0,female> is elderly and the mother goes right through a red light and the daughter doesn't want to say anything she doesn't want to be like you 're too old to drive
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1214.60 1225.40 <o,f0,female> and the mother goes through a second red light and the daughter says as tactfully as possible mom are you aware that you just went through two red lights and the mother says
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1246.01 1252.51 <o,f0,female> things one is another characteristic of trickster is that the trickster has to
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1252.93 1256.16 <o,f0,female> walk this fine line he has to have poise
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1256.87 1266.59 <o,f0,female> and you know the biggest hurdle for me in doing what i do is constructing my performance so that it's prepared and unprepared
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1267.73 1277.08 <o,f0,female> finding the balance between those things is always dangerous because you might tip off too much in the direction of unprepared but being too prepared doesn't leave room
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1277.20 1290.25 <o,f0,female> the accidents to happen i was thinking about what moshe safdie said yesterday about beauty because in his book hyde says that
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1298.86 1311.49 <o,f0,female> lose all the other qualities because once you're into beauty you're into a finished thing you're into something that occupies space and inhabits time it's an actual thing and
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1312.23 1320.88 <o,f0,female> it is always extraordinary to see a thing of beauty but if you don't do that if you allow for the accident to keep on happening
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1321.10 1330.71 <o,f0,female> you have the possibility of getting on a wavelength i like to think of what i do as a probability wave
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1344.64 1351.52 <o,f0,female> the one final quality i want to say about trickster is that he doesn't have a home he 's always on the road
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1353.44 1362.96 <o,f0,female> i want to say to you richard in closing that in ted you've created a home and thank you for inviting me into it
