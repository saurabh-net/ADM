DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 259.73 266.21 <o,f0,female> it's pointless and alexander thought why is he sitting around doing nothing
DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 269.07 282.32 <o,f0,female> to understand this difference in viewpoints we have to understand the subjective truth of alexander his myth and the mythology that constructed it

DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 388.39 395.58 <o,f0,female> but these are not the stories that the gymnosophist heard he heard a very different story
DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 396.44 402.57 <o,f0,female> he heard of a man called bharat after whom india is called bharata bharat also conquered the

DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 427.09 430.37 <o,f0,female> before him each one claiming i was
DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 442.76 449.65 <o,f0,female> this was the mythology of the gymnosophist you see he had heroes like ram
DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 451.90 461.12 <o,f0,female> and krishna govinda hari but they were not two characters on two different adventures they were two lifetimes of the same hero
DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 470.23 482.28 <o,f0,female> you see the indians also had a river that separates the land of the living from the land of the dead but you don't cross it once you go to and fro endlessly it was called the
DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 484.77 493.74 <o,f0,female> you go again and again and again because you see nothing lasts forever in india not even death and so you have these grand rituals
DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 494.46 501.67 <o,f0,female> great images of mother goddesses are built and worshiped for ten days and what do you do at the end of ten days you dunk it in
DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 511.73 519.18 <o,f0,female> and this rule applies not just to man but also the gods you see the gods
DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 519.35 532.34 <o,f0,female> have to come back again and again and again as ram as krishna not only do they live infinite lives but the same life is lived infinite times till you get to the point of it all
DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 534.93 537.05 <o,f0,female> groundhog day
DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 541.84 548.62 <o,f0,female> two different mythologies which is right two different mythologies two different ways of looking at the world
DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 549.12 557.36 <o,f0,female> one linear one cyclical one believes this is the one and only life the other believes this is one of many lives
DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 558.53 566.66 <o,f0,female> and so the denominator of alexander 's life was one so the value of his life was the sum total of his achievements
DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 568.17 575.62 <o,f0,female> the denominator of the gymnosophist 's life was infinity so no matter what he did it was always zero
DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 576.41 583.94 <o,f0,female> and i believe it is this mythological paradigm that inspired indian mathematicians to discover the number zero
DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 601.15 608.29 <o,f0,female> you see what is business but the result of how the market behaves and how the organization behaves
DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 619.99 629.16 <o,f0,female> if you live only once in one life cultures around the world you will see an obsession with binary logic absolute truth standardization absoluteness
DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 630.49 638.75 <o,f0,female> in design but if you look at cultures which have cyclical and based on infinite lives you will see a comfort with fuzzy logic
DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 641.46 644.38 <o,f0,female> with contextual thinking with everything
DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 650.09 659.66 <o,f0,female> look at art look at the ballerina how linear she is in her performance and then look at the indian classical dancer the kuchipudi dancer the bharatanatyam dancer
DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 664.43 671.79 <o,f0,female> and then look at business standard business model vision mission values processes
DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 672.30 681.22 <o,f0,female> sounds very much like the journey through the wilderness to the promised land with the commandments held by the leader and if you comply you will go to heaven
DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 693.92 704.86 <o,f0,female> you see businesses are not run as institutions by the idiosyncrasies of individuals it's always about taste it's always about my
DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 707.33 714.25 <o,f0,female> you see indian music for example does not have the concept of harmony there is no orchestra conductor
DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 715.05 721.54 <o,f0,female> is one performer standing there and everybody follows and you can never replicate that performance twice
DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 722.52 731.35 <o,f0,female> it is not about documentation and contract it's about conversation and faith it's not about compliance it's about setting
DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 769.71 779.93 <o,f0,female> which is rooted in one life culture and a clash is going to take place like on the banks of the indus it is bound to happen

DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 886.60 894.24 <o,f0,female> you can't measure it you can't manage it so how do you construct belief how do you enhance the sensitivity of people to indian ness
DevduttPattanaik_2009I 1 DevduttPattanaik_2009I 917.53 929.58 <o,f0,female> so when you go to the temple all you seek is an audience with god you want to see god and you want god to see you and hence the gods have very large eyes large unblinking eyes sometimes made of silver
