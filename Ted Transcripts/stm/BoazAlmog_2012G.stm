BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 42.36 47.02 <o,f0,female> superconductivity is a quantum state of matter
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 60.32 68.45 <o,f0,female> we are now able to demonstrate to you quantum levitation and quantum locking so
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 68.47 79.62 <o,f0,female> a superconductor is defined by two properties the first is zero electrical resistance and the second is the expulsion of a magnetic field
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 79.73 82.72 <o,f0,female> from the interior of the superconductor
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 82.72 90.04 <o,f0,female> that sounds complicated right but what is electrical resistance so
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 103.4 110.73 <o,f0,female> and they dissipate this energy in the form of heat and you know that effect however
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 110.96 112.88 <o,f0,female> inside a superconductor
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 112.97 120.99 <o,f0,female> there are no collisions so there is no energy dissipation it 's quite remarkable
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 121.04 133.68 <o,f0,female> think about it in classical physics there is always some friction some energy loss but not here because it is a quantum effect but that 's not all because
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 165.22 172.77 <o,f0,female> perfect as we all know and sometimes strands of magnetic field remain inside the superconductor
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 172.77 174.53 <o,f0,female> now
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 175.02 180.74 <o,f0,female> under proper conditions which we have here these strands of magnetic field can be trapped
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 180.84 184.74 <o,f0,female> inside the superconductor
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 187.45 189.4 <o,f0,female> inside the superconductor
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 207.82 210.77 <o,f0,female> these are not particles but they behave like particles
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 220.32 222.22 <o,f0,female> when we put it inside
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 234.21 239.36 <o,f0,female> dissipate energy which breaks the superconductivity state
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 239.36 251.44 <o,f0,female> so what it actually does it locks these strands which are called fluxons and it locks these fluxons in place and by doing that what it actually does
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 252.41 257.19 <o,f0,female> is locking itself in place why because
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 257.44 260.47 <o,f0,female> any movement
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 260.47 269.3 <o,f0,female> of the superconductor will change their place will change their configuration so we get quantum locking and let me show you
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 269.75 277.36 <o,f0,female> how this works i have here a superconductor which i wrapped up so it 'd stay cold long enough
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 277.36 279.92 <o,f0,female> and when i place it on
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 296.13 298.69 <o,f0,female> and it will be locked in this new configuration
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 299.18 304.18 <o,f0,female> like this or move it slightly to the right or to the left so
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 304.31 306.5 <o,f0,female> this is quantum locking
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 328.7 334.82 <o,f0,female> you won 't be surprised to hear that if i take this circular magnet
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 334.82 337.44 <o,f0,female> in which the magnetic field is the same all around
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 337.52 345.54 <o,f0,female> the superconductor will be able to freely rotate around the axis of the magnet why because as long as it rotates
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 345.54 351.44 <o,f0,female> the locking is maintained you see i can adjust
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 351.77 355.57 <o,f0,female> and i can rotate the superconductor we have
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 355.68 362.41 <o,f0,female> frictionless motion it is still levitating but can move freely all around
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 362.41 365.06 <o,f0,female> so
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 365.39 371.28 <o,f0,female> we have quantum locking and we can levitate it on top of this magnet
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 385.65 392.9 <o,f0,female> three inch disk but that 's not the amazing part yet because there is something i haven 't told you yet
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 394.15 397.87 <o,f0,female> and yeah the amazing part is that this superconductor that you see here
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 421.65 430.18 <o,f0,female> i can extend this circular magnet and make whatever track i want for example i can make
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 433.1 444.12 <o,f0,female> and when i place the superconducting disk on top of this rail it moves freely
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 452.5 458.11 <o,f0,female> and again that 's not all i can adjust its position like this and rotate and it
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 459 463.69 <o,f0,female> freely moves in this new position
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 474.73 479.07 <o,f0,female> while it stays here don 't move i will try to
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 484.2 489.71 <o,f0,female> hopefully if i did it correctly it stays suspended
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 498.03 502.85 <o,f0,female> you see it 's quantum locking not levitation
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 509.2 513.52 <o,f0,female> let me tell you a little bit about superconductors now
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 518.14 526.62 <o,f0,female> so we now know that we are able to transfer enormous amount of currents inside superconductors so we can use them
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 526.62 535.55 <o,f0,female> to produce strong magnetic fields such as needed in mri machines particle accelerators and so on
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 536.06 547.67 <o,f0,female> but we can also store energy using superconductors because we have no dissipation and we could also produce power cables to transfer enormous amounts of
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 564.58 572.1 <o,f0,female> let me answer this simple question by giving you an example imagine you would have
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 572.11 585.84 <o,f0,female> a disk similar to the one i have here in my hand three inch diameter with a single difference the superconducting layer instead of being half a micron thin
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 586.04 592.03 <o,f0,female> being two millimeters thin quite thin this two millimeter thin superconducting layer
BoazAlmog_2012G 1 BoazAlmog_2012G 597.8 602.49 <o,f0,female> in my hand amazing thank you
