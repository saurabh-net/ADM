KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 19.87 29.58 <o,f0,male> so unlike traditional magic it uses the power of words linguistic deception non verbal communication and various other techniques to create the illusion of a sixth sense
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 40.36 43.94 <o,f0,male> ok clap them together once ok reverse your hands
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 44.51 45.89 <o,f0,male> follow my actions exactly
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 46.62 49.13 <o,f0,male> about half the audience has their left hand up why is that
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 49.83 51.65 <o,f0,male> ok swap them around put your right hand up
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 52.13 61.72 <o,f0,male> ok now cross your hands over so your right hand goes over interlace your fingers like this then make sure your right thumb is outside your left thumb that's very important yours is the other way around so swap it around
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 66.07 67.77 <o,f0,male> all right tap them together once
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 69.05 73.70 <o,f0,male> now if you did not allow me to deceive your minds you would all be able to do this
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 81.83 85.19 <o,f0,male> easy it is for me to manipulate the human mind once you know how
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 88.14 97.72 <o,f0,male> now i remember when i was about fifteen i read a copy of life magazine which detailed a story about a seventy five year old blind russian woman
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 98.73 101.54 <o,f0,male> who could sense printed letters there's still people trying to do it here
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 103.12 104.74 <o,f0,male> who could sense printed letters
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 119.38 128.12 <o,f0,male> you know if you actually think about it if somebody is totally blind a guy yesterday did a demonstration in one of the rooms where people had to close their eyes and they could just hear things
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 130.12 142.65 <o,f0,male> really weird thing to try and figure out how could somebody read using their fingertips now earlier on as part of a tv show that i have coming up on mtv i attempted to give a similar demonstration of what is now known as second sight
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 297.26 310.54 <o,f0,male> two days ago we were going to film this down there at the race course and we got a guy into a car and we got a camera man in the back but halfway through the drive he told me he had a i think it was a nine millimeter or something stuck to his leg so i stopped pretty quick and that was it
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 311.82 322.53 <o,f0,male> so do you believe it's possible to see through somebody else's eyes that's the question now most people here would automatically say no ok but i want you to realize some facts i couldn't see through the blindfold
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 334.84 338.44 <o,f0,male> all right but because your brains are not trained in the art of deception
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 339.19 342.86 <o,f0,male> the solutions you come up with will ninety nine percent of the time be way off the mark
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 343.62 346.07 <o,f0,male> this is because magic is all about directing attention
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 346.57 352.86 <o,f0,male> if for instance i didn't want you to look at my right hand well then i don't look at it but if i wanted you to look at my right hand then i look at it too
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 371.34 371.57 <o,f0,male> the
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 401.77 406.08 <o,f0,male> closer a little bit closer ok a little bit closer come over they look really nervous
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 408.31 409.17 <o,f0,male> in witchcraft
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 411.48 412.35 <o,f0,male> go bump in the

KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 429.68 437.33 <o,f0,male> and don't open your eyes until i ask you from this point onwards close your eyes do not say anything do not open them be aware of the sensations
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 461.95 466.14 <o,f0,male> ok keep it there be aware of the sensations don't say anything don't open your eyes ok
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 475.95 476.39 <o,f0,male> there
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 483.91 487.47 <o,f0,male> ok excellent open your eyes i never touched you i just touched his back
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 495.58 497.67 <o,f0,male> yeah i walk around nightclubs all night like this

KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 511.54 516.93 <o,f0,male> i want you to do is look directly at me ok just take a deep breath in through your nose letting
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 518.26 527.73 <o,f0,male> and relax allow your eyes to close on five four three two one close your eyes right now ok now i'm not hypnotizing you i'm merely placing you in a heightened state of
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 528.65 530.97 <o,f0,male> our minds are along the same lines
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 531.46 534.82 <o,f0,male> and as you sink and drift and float into this relaxed state of mind
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 535.73 544.18 <o,f0,male> take your left hand and just place it up here and i want you to hold it there just for a moment and i only want you to allow your hand to sink and drift and float back to the
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 544.77 551.43 <o,f0,male> at the same rate and speed as you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness and allow it to go all the way down to the
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 552.66 555.78 <o,f0,male> that's it all the way down all the way down all the way down
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 555.91 559.12 <o,f0,male> and further and further and further and further and further and further
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 562.51 563.84 <o,f0,male> ok now allow it to stay there
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 609.30 611.02 <o,f0,male> was wonderfully done let 's try it again
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 638.89 645.22 <o,f0,male> only when you want the pressure to be released make an upward gesture like this but only when you want the pressure to be released you can wait as long as you want
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 645.67 646.66 <o,f0,male> but only when you want the pressure
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 655.72 658.60 <o,f0,male> ok let 's try it again ok now imagine the connection
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 668.05 674.35 <o,f0,male> that time excellent and hold it there hold it there both of you hold it there only when you want the pressure to go back make a downward gesture you can wait as long as
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 697.62 702.24 <o,f0,male> on five four three two one open your eyes wide awake give them a round of applause
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 710.53 719.42 <o,f0,male> i once saw a film called the gods are crazy has anybody here seen that film yeah yeah yeah do you remember when they threw the coke bottle out of the airplane and it landed on the ground and it didn't break
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 720.03 721.57 <o,f0,male> see that's because coke bottles
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 723.20 724.38 <o,f0,male> it's nearly impossible to break
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 731.14 732.26 <o,f0,female> not taking any chances
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 733.70 738.18 <o,f0,male> you see psychokinesis is the paranormal influence of the mind on physical events and processes
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 738.78 747.09 <o,f0,male> for some magicians or mentalists sometimes the spoon will bend or melt sometimes it will not sometimes the object will slide across the table sometimes it will not
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 755.37 759.36 <o,f0,male> excellent now have a look at the coke bottle make sure it is solid there's only one hole
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 784.79 792.37 <o,f0,male> all the negative energy from that broken relationship from that guy being imparted into the broken piece of glass which will represent him ok
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 792.77 799.79 <o,f0,male> i want you to take this very seriously stare at the glass ignore everybody right here in a moment you'll feel a certain sensation ok
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 799.93 807.70 <o,f0,male> and when you feel that sensation i want you to drop the piece of glass into the bottle think of that guy that ba that
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 810.22 815.47 <o,f0,male> trying to be good here ok and when you feel the sensation it might take a while drop it into the glass
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 843.02 844.99 <o,f0,male> was a lot of negative energy
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 900.65 902.49 <o,f0,male> it should be a male victim that's the only thing
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 904.41 908.57 <o,f0,male> i was going to use you for this but i decided i might want to come back another year ca well
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 919.58 922.72 <o,f0,male> ok steve i want you to take a seat right behind here
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 929.07 931.76 <o,f0,male> go ahead i've no fancy assistants underneath there
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 932.34 935.80 <o,f0,male> they just they insist that because i was a magician put a nice black tablecloth on
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 938.20 950.15 <o,f0,male> i've got four wooden plinths here steve one two three and four now they're all the exact same except this one obviously has a stainless steel spike sticking out of it i want you to examine it and make sure
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 955.59 956.09 <o,f0,male> ok
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 956.79 967.72 <o,f0,male> now steve i'm going to stand in front of the table ok when i stand in front of the table i want you to put the cups on the plinths like this in any order you want and then mix them all up so nobody has any idea where the spike
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 992.91 993.76 <o,f0,male> well hidden now
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 995.91 996.27 <o,f0,male> we've
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 1002.22 1004.01 <o,f0,female> so all right we'll leave them like that
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 1012.75 1017.12 <o,f0,male> you know where the spike is but nobody else does correct but i don't want you to know either
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 1061.98 1064.10 <o,f0,male> my hand is at life here so at risk
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 1092.33 1092.80 <o,f0,male> there
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 1105.15 1107.31 <o,f0,male> i go this way is there another cup over here
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 1132.12 1133.08 <o,f0,female> ok give me both hands
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 1138.34 1141.28 <o,f0,male> you think the spike is under your left hand or under your right hand
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 1145.80 1146.30 <o,f0,female> but if you
KeithBarry_2004 1 KeithBarry_2004 1150.80 1155.23 <o,f0,male> your right hand now remember you made all the decisions all along psychologists figure this out
