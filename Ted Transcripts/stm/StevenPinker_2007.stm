StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 13.19 16.42 <o,f0,male> images like this from the auschwitz concentration camp
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 17.62 23.85 <o,f0,male> been seared into our consciousness during the twentieth century and have given us a new
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 30.22 38.83 <o,f0,male> during the twentieth century we witnessed the atrocities of stalin hitler mao pol pot rwanda and other genocides
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 49.38 62.34 <o,f0,male> this has led to a common understanding of our situation namely that modernity has brought us terrible violence and perhaps that native peoples lived in a state of harmony that we have departed from to our peril
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 63.21 72.11 <o,f0,male> here is an example from an op ed on thanksgiving in the boston globe a couple of years ago where the writer wrote the indian life was a difficult one
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 72.34 82.67 <o,f0,male> but there were no employment problems community harmony was strong substance abuse unknown crime nearly non existent what warfare there was between tribes was largely ritualistic
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 82.87 94.73 <o,f0,male> and seldom resulted in indiscriminate or wholesale slaughter now you're all familiar with this treacle we teach it to our children we hear it on television and in story books now
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 95.40 103.45 <o,f0,male> the original title of this session was everything you know is wrong and i'm going to present evidence that this particular part of our common understanding is wrong
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 111.60 120.55 <o,f0,male> that today we are probably living in the most peaceful time in our species existence now in the decade of darfur and iraq a statement like that might seem
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 130.26 143.68 <o,f0,male> the decline of violence is a fractal phenomenon you can see it over millennia over centuries over decades and over years although there seems to have been a tipping point at the onset of the age of reason in the sixteenth century
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 144.19 153.60 <o,f0,male> one sees it all over the world although not homogeneously it's especially evident in the west beginning with england and holland around the time of the enlightenment
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 154.13 162.14 <o,f0,male> let me take you on a journey of several powers of ten from the millennium scale to the year scale to try to persuade you of this
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 188.88 196.55 <o,f0,male> here is a graph that he put together showing the percentage of male deaths due to warfare in a number of
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 197.19 205.75 <o,f0,male> foraging or hunting and gathering societies the red bars correspond to the likelihood that a man will
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 206.26 216.79 <o,f0,male> die at the hands of another man as opposed to passing away of natural causes in a variety of foraging societies in the new guinea highlands and the amazon rainforest
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 217.21 226.14 <o,f0,male> and they range from a rate of almost a sixty percent chance that a man will die at the hands of another man to in the case of the gebusi only a fifteen percent chance
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 226.43 237.73 <o,f0,male> the tiny little blue bar in the lower left hand corner plots the corresponding statistic from united states and europe in the twentieth century and includes all the deaths of both world wars
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 238.23 246.82 <o,f0,male> if the death rate in tribal warfare had prevailed during the twentieth century there would have been two billion deaths rather than one hundred million
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 248.37 257.51 <o,f0,male> also at the millennium scale we can look at the way of life of early civilizations such as the ones described in the bible and in this
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 258.23 266.70 <o,f0,male> supposed source of our moral values one can read descriptions of what was expected in warfare such as the following from numbers thirty one
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 267.07 275.42 <o,f0,male> and they warred against the midianites as the lord commanded moses and they slew all the males and moses said unto them have you saved all the women alive
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 275.95 289.33 <o,f0,male> now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him but all the women children that have not know a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves in other words kill the men kill the
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 315.89 324.86 <o,f0,male> well let 's click the zoom lens down one order of magnitude and look at the century scale although we don't have statistics for
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 338.66 345.67 <o,f0,male> social history will reveal that mutilation and torture were routine forms of criminal punishment the kind of infraction today that would give you
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 346.45 354.48 <o,f0,male> in those days would result in your tongue being cut out your ears being cut off you being blinded a hand being chopped off and so on
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 354.86 364.72 <o,f0,male> there were numerous ingenious forms of sadistic capital punishment burning at the stake disemboweling breaking on the wheel being pulled apart by horses and so on
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 365.06 374.99 <o,f0,male> the death penalty was a sanction for a long list of non violent crimes criticizing the king stealing a loaf of bread slavery of course was the preferred
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 375.20 382.79 <o,f0,male> labor saving device and cruelty was a popular form of entertainment perhaps the most vivid example was the practice of cat burning
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 383.07 391.10 <o,f0,male> in which a cat was hoisted on a stage and lowered in a sling into a fire and the spectators shrieked in laughter as
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 392.08 394.26 <o,f0,male> howling in pain was burned to death
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 395.70 405.55 <o,f0,male> what about one on one murder well there there are good statistics because many municipalities recorded the cause of death the
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 413.19 422.11 <o,f0,male> rates in any village hamlet town county that he could find and he supplemented them with national data when nations started keeping statistics
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 422.27 430.77 <o,f0,male> he plotted on a logarithmic scale going from one hundred deaths per one hundred thousand
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 431.95 445.15 <o,f0,male> people per year which was approximately the rate of homicide in the middle ages and the figure plummets down to less than one homicide per one hundred thousand people per year
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 446.64 457.07 <o,f0,male> seven or eight european countries then there is a slight uptick in the nineteen sixties the people who said that rock n roll would lead to the decline of moral values actually had a grain of truth to that
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 457.33 468.05 <o,f0,male> but there was a decline from at least two orders of magnitude in homicide from the middle ages to the present and the elbow occurred in the early sixteenth century
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 480.40 491.86 <o,f0,male> in interstate wars in deadly ethnic riots or pogroms and in military coups even in south america worldwide there's been a steep decline in deaths in
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 511.29 520.63 <o,f0,male> in this decade as horrific as it is even in the year scale one can see a decline of violence since the end of the cold war there have been fewer civil wars
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 521.02 534.46 <o,f0,male> fewer genocides indeed a ninety percent reduction since post world war ii highs and even a reversal of the nineteen sixties uptick in homicide and violent crime this is from the fbi uniform
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 534.83 548.84 <o,f0,male> crime statistics you can see that there is a fairly low rate of violence in the fifties and the sixties then it soared upward for several decades and began a precipitous decline starting in the nineteen nineties so that it went back almost
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 556.43 561.30 <o,f0,male> so the question is why are so many people so wrong about something so important
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 561.68 572.51 <o,f0,male> i think there are a number of reasons one of them is we have better reporting the associated press is a better chronicler of wars over the surface of the earth than sixteenth century monks were
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 573.72 582.28 <o,f0,male> there's a cognitive illusion we cognitive psychologists know that the easier it is to recall specific instances of something
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 582.58 588.96 <o,f0,male> the higher the probability that you assign to it things that we read about in the paper with gory footage
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 589.55 595.38 <o,f0,male> burn into memory more than reports of a lot more people dying in their beds of old age
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 597.26 608.61 <o,f0,male> there are dynamics in the opinion and advocacy markets no one ever attracted observers advocates and donors by saying things just seem to be getting better and better
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 609.68 617.89 <o,f0,male> there's guilt about our treatment of native peoples in modern intellectual life and an unwillingness to acknowledge there could be anything good about western culture
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 618.38 625.93 <o,f0,male> and of course our change in standards can outpace the change in behavior one of the reasons violence went down
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 626.13 634.30 <o,f0,male> is that people got sick of the carnage and cruelty in their time that's a process that seems to be continuing but if it outstrips behavior
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 634.72 647.47 <o,f0,male> by the standards of the day things always look more barbaric than they would have been by historic standards so today we get exercised and rightly so if a handful of murderers get
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 656.28 664.71 <o,f0,male> they may have been burned at the stake for criticizing the king after a trial that lasted ten minutes and indeed that that would have been repeated over and over
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 665.67 674.02 <o,f0,male> today we look at capital punishment as evidence of how low our behavior can sink rather than how high our standards have risen
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 675.08 677.02 <o,f0,male> well why has violence declined
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 677.53 684.16 <o,f0,male> no one really knows but i have read four explanations all of which i think have some grain of
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 685.80 695.49 <o,f0,male> the first is maybe thomas hobbes got it right he was the one who said that life in a state of nature was solitary poor nasty brutish and short
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 696.10 707.17 <o,f0,male> not because he argued humans have some primordial thirst for blood or aggressive instinct or territorial imperative but because of the logic of anarchy
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 707.39 718.78 <o,f0,male> in a state of anarchy there's a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively before they invade you more recently thomas schelling gives the analogy of a homeowner who hears a rustling in the basement
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 719.11 727.06 <o,f0,male> being a good american he has a pistol in the nightstand pulls out his gun and walks down the stairs and what does he see but a burglar with a gun in his hand
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 727.65 736.34 <o,f0,male> each of them is thinking i don't really want to kill that guy but he 's about to kill me maybe i had better shoot him before he shoots me
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 744.22 752.97 <o,f0,male> hunter gatherer peoples explicitly go through this train of thought and will often raid their neighbors out of fear of being raided first
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 754.01 760.21 <o,f0,male> now one way of dealing with this problem is by deterrence you don't strike first but you have a
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 769.65 778.43 <o,f0,male> having its bluff called and therefore can only work if it's credible to make it credible you must avenge all insults and settle all scores
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 778.65 784.54 <o,f0,male> which leads to cycles of bloody vendetta life becomes an episode of the sopranos
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 785.54 795.80 <o,f0,male> hobbes solution the leviathan was that if authority for the legitimate use of violence was vested in a single democratic agency a leviathan
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 796.48 803.71 <o,f0,male> then such a state can reduce the temptation of attack because any kind of aggression will be punished leaving its profitability
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 804.41 811.15 <o,f0,male> as zero that would remove the temptation to invade preemptively out of fear of them attacking you first
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 811.85 820.13 <o,f0,male> it removes the need for a hair trigger for retaliation to make your deterrent threat credible and therefore it would lead to a state of peace
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 821.09 831.12 <o,f0,male> the man who plotted the homicide rates that you failed to see in the earlier slide argued that the timing of the decline of homicide in europe
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 838.59 850.84 <o,f0,male> also supporting it is the fact that we today see eruptions of violence in zones of anarchy in failed states collapsed empires frontier regions mafias street gangs and so on
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 852.04 856.45 <o,f0,male> the second explanation is that in many times and places there is a widespread
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 857.32 858.79 <o,f0,male> sentiment that life is cheap
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 859.16 868.14 <o,f0,male> in earlier times when suffering and early death were common in one 's own life one has fewer compunctions about inflicting them on others
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 868.61 878.74 <o,f0,male> as technology and economic efficiency make life longer and more pleasant one puts a higher value on life in general this was an argument from the political scientist james payne
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 879.51 888.32 <o,f0,male> a third explanation invokes the concept of a non zero sum game and was worked out in the book non zero by the journalist robert wright
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 903.13 910.76 <o,f0,male> or when two parties lay down their arms and split the so called peace dividend that results in them not having to fight the whole time
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 911.18 924.90 <o,f0,male> wright argues that technology has increased the number of positive sum games that humans tend to be embroiled in by allowing the trade of goods services and ideas over longer distances and among larger groups of people
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 925.17 939.14 <o,f0,male> the result is that other people become more valuable alive than dead and violence declines for selfish reasons as wright put it among the many reasons that i think that we should not bomb the japanese is that they built my mini van
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 941.67 953.62 <o,f0,male> the fourth explanation is captured in the title of a book called the expanding circle by the philosopher peter singer who argues that evolution bequeathed humans with a sense of empathy
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 954.84 965.22 <o,f0,male> an ability to treat other peoples interests as comparable to one 's own unfortunately by default we apply it only to a very narrow circle of friends and family
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 974.72 987.65 <o,f0,male> one can see in historical record it expanding from the village to the clan to the tribe to the nation to other races to both sexes and in singer 's own arguments something that we should extend to other sentient species
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 989.72 1000.64 <o,f0,male> the question is if this has happened what has powered that expansion and there are a number of possibilities increasing circles of reciprocity in the sense that robert wright argues for
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 1000.99 1011.05 <o,f0,male> the logic of the golden rule the more you think about and interact with other people the more you realize that it is untenable to privilege your
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 1012.68 1020.78 <o,f0,male> over theirs at least not if you want them to listen to you you can't say that my interests are special compared to yours anymore than you can say
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 1020.97 1027.03 <o,f0,male> that the particular spot that i'm standing on is a unique part of the universe because i happen to be standing on it that
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 1028.72 1037.33 <o,f0,male> it may also be powered by cosmopolitanism by histories and journalism and memoirs and realistic fiction and travel and literacy
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 1037.62 1046.05 <o,f0,male> which allows you to project yourself into the lives of other people that formerly you may have treated as sub human and also to realize the
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 1053.67 1058.26 <o,f0,male> whatever its causes the decline of violence has profound implications it
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 1058.94 1066.99 <o,f0,male> should force us to ask not just why is there war but also why is there peace not just what are we doing wrong but also
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 1067.23 1074.23 <o,f0,male> what have we been doing right because we have been doing something right and it sure would be good to find out what it is thank you very much
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 1085.72 1091.38 <o,f0,male> i loved that talk i think a lot of people here in the room would say that that expansion of
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 1092.03 1102.69 <o,f0,male> that you were talking about that peter singer talks about is also driven by just by technology by greater visibility of the other and the sense that the world is therefore getting smaller i mean is that also a grain of truth
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 1105.49 1114.94 <o,f0,male> in wright 's theory that it allows us to enjoy the benefits of cooperation over larger and larger circles but also i think it helps us
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 1116.31 1129.21 <o,f0,male> imagine what it's like to be someone else i think when you read these horrific tortures that were common in the middle ages you think how could they possibly have done it how could they have not have empathized with the person that they're disemboweling but clearly
StevenPinker_2007 1 StevenPinker_2007 1144.15 1150.26 <o,f0,male> would love every news media owner to hear that talk at some point in the next year i think it's really important thank you so much
