CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 16.16 20.91 <o,f0,male> pleasure to be here it's a great pleasure to speak after brian cox from
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 22.50 23.55 <o,f0,male> is the home of the
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 27.06 28.55 <o,f0,male> happened to the small
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 32.28 45.35 <o,f0,male> the small hadron collider once was the big thing now the small hadron collider is in a cupboard overlooked and neglected you know when the large hadron collider started and it didn't work
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 45.85 53.19 <o,f0,male> and people tried to work out why it was the small hadron collider team who sabotaged it because they were so
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 54.53 65.27 <o,f0,male> the whole hadron collider family needs unlocking the lesson of brian 's presentation in a way all those fantastic pictures is this really that
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 65.88 75.64 <o,f0,male> vantage point determines everything that you see what brian was saying was science has opened up successively different vantage points from which we can see ourselves and that's why it's
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 76.79 90.49 <o,f0,male> so the vantage point you take determines virtually everything that you will see the question that you will ask will determine much of the answer that you will get and so if you ask this question where would you look to see the future of education
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 90.94 99.90 <o,f0,male> the answer that we've traditionally given to that is very straightforward at least in the last twenty years you go to finland finland is the best place in the world to see school systems
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 100.15 108.33 <o,f0,male> the finns may be a bit boring and depressive and there's a very high suicide rate but by golly they are qualified and they have absolutely amazing education
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 109.51 120.88 <o,f0,male> and so we all troop off to finland and we wonder at their social democratic miracle of finland and its cultural homogeneity and all the rest of it and then we struggle to imagine how we might bring lessons
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 121.62 130.06 <o,f0,male> well so for this last year with the help of cisco who sponsor me for some balmy reason to do this i've been looking somewhere else
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 141.49 150.15 <o,f0,male> and not enough resources for traditional solutions to work traditional high cost solutions which depend on professionals which is what schools and hospitals are
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 150.57 162.54 <o,f0,male> so i ended up in places like this this is a place called monkey hill it's one of the hundreds of favelas in rio most of the populations growth of the next fifty years will be in cities
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 164.02 171.30 <o,f0,male> by six cities of twelve million people a year for the next thirty years almost all of that growth will be in the developed world
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 193.93 201.17 <o,f0,male> at the age of fourteen in common with many fourteen year olds in the brazilian education system he dropped out of school it was
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 202.01 209.45 <o,f0,male> and juanderson instead went into what provided kind of opportunity and hope in the place that he lived which was the drugs
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 209.93 221.51 <o,f0,male> and by the age of sixteen with rapid promotion he was running the drugs trade in ten favelas he was turning over two hundred thousand dollars a week he employed two hundred people he was going to be dead by the age of twenty five
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 232.84 239.71 <o,f0,male> which took computers donated by corporations put them in community centers in favelas and created
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 247.86 258.05 <o,f0,male> or you can go to places like this this is kibera which is the largest slum in east africa millions of people living here stretched over many kilometers and there i met these two
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 272.46 279.07 <o,f0,male> has managed to make it even worse so there are schools in slums like this they're places like this
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 279.33 287.87 <o,f0,male> where maureen went to school they're private schools there are no state schools in slums and the education they got was pitiful
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 288.30 294.43 <o,f0,male> it was in places like this this a school set up by some nuns in another slum called nakuru half the children
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 303.98 315.79 <o,f0,male> so the challenges of education in this kind of place are not to learn the kings and queens of kenya or britain they are to stay alive to earn a living to not become hiv positive
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 326.18 333.23 <o,f0,male> the mobile phone if you want to design from scratch virtually any service in africa you would start now
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 334.68 343.77 <o,f0,male> or you could go to places like this this is a place called the madangiri settlement colony which is a very developed slum about twenty five minutes outside
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 345.04 356.97 <o,f0,male> where i met these characters who showed me around for the day the remarkable thing about these girls and the sign of the kind of social revolution sweeping through the developing world is that these girls
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 370.31 377.83 <o,f0,male> all across the developing world there are millions of parents tens hundreds of millions who for the first time are with children doing homework
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 379.52 387.54 <o,f0,male> and the reason they carry on studying is not because they went to a school like this this is a private school this is a fee pay school this is a good school
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 388.09 395.21 <o,f0,male> this is the best you can get in hyderabad in indian education the reason they went on studying was this
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 395.60 405.35 <o,f0,male> this is a computer installed in the entrance to their slum by a revolutionary social entrepreneur called sugata mitra who 's adopted the most radical experiments showing
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 406.02 415.95 <o,f0,male> children in the right conditions can learn on their own with the help of computers those girls have never touched google they know nothing about wikipedia imagine
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 416.44 423.42 <o,f0,male> what their lives would be like if you could get that to them so if you look as i did through this
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 424.39 438.46 <o,f0,male> and by looking at about a hundred case studies of different social entrepreneurs working in these very extreme conditions look at the recipes they come up with for learning they look nothing like school what do they
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 439.47 450.58 <o,f0,male> well education is a global religion and education plus technology is a great source of hope you can go to places like this this is a school three hours outside
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 451.58 459.68 <o,f0,male> most of the children there have parents who are illiterate many of them don't have electricity at home but they find it completely
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 473.41 483.08 <o,f0,male> most of our education system is push i was literally pushed to school when you get to school things are pushed at you knowledge exams systems timetables
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 498.71 508.46 <o,f0,male> that isn't really going to attract him you need to pull him and so education needs to work by pull not push and so the idea of a curriculum is completely
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 508.98 516.63 <o,f0,male> in a setting like this you need to start education from things that make a difference to them in their settings what does that
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 517.28 525.35 <o,f0,male> well the key is motivation and there are two aspects to it one is to deliver extrinsic motivation that education has a
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 526.19 533.79 <o,f0,male> our education systems all work on the principle that there is a payoff but you have to wait quite a long time that's too long if
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 534.97 548.91 <o,f0,male> waiting ten years for the payoff from education is too long when you need to meet daily needs when you've got siblings to look after or a business to help with so you need education to be relevant and help people to make a living there and then often
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 564.11 575.63 <o,f0,male> two hundred games to teach virtually any subject under the sun in the schools and communities that taio works in the day always starts in a circle and always starts from a question
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 576.26 581.28 <o,f0,male> imagine an education system that started from questions not from knowledge to be imparted
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 581.66 584.25 <o,f0,male> or started from game not from a lesson
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 584.93 587.23 <o,f0,male> or started from the premise that
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 587.63 600.35 <o,f0,male> you have to engage people first before you can possibly teach them our education systems you do all that stuff afterward if you're lucky sport drama music these things they teach through
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 600.80 611.68 <o,f0,male> they attract people to learning because it's really a dance project or a circus project or the best example of all el sistema in venezuela it's a music project
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 612.07 621.15 <o,f0,male> and so you attract people through that into learning not adding that on after all the learning has been done and you've eaten your cognitive greens
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 621.78 630.34 <o,f0,male> so el sistema in venezuela uses a violin as a technology of learning taio rocha uses making soap as a technology of
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 631.52 638.50 <o,f0,male> what you find when you go to these schemes is that they use people and places in incredibly creative ways masses of
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 640.27 651.71 <o,f0,male> get learning to people when there are no teachers when teachers won 't come when you can't afford them and even if you do get teachers what they teach isn't relevant to the communities that they serve
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 652.15 665.11 <o,f0,male> well you create your own teachers you create peer to peer learning or you create para teachers or you bring in specialist skills but you find ways to get learning that's relevant to people through technology people and places that are different so
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 665.59 674.89 <o,f0,male> this is a school in a bus on a building site in pune the fastest growing city in asia pune has five thousand
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 676.16 686.01 <o,f0,male> it has thirty thousand children on those building sites that's one city imagine that urban explosion that's going to take place across the developing world
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 686.22 694.34 <o,f0,male> and how many thousands of children will spend their school years on building sites well this is a very simple scheme to get the learning to them through
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 696.22 703.14 <o,f0,male> they all treat learning not as some sort of academic analytical activity but that's something that's productive
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 703.84 712.61 <o,f0,male> something you make something you can do perhaps earn a living from so i met this character steven he'd spent three years
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 712.86 725.02 <o,f0,male> in nairobi living on the streets because his parents had died of aids and he was finally brought back into school not by the offer of gcses but by the offer of learning how to become a carpenter a practical making skill
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 725.58 738.83 <o,f0,male> so the trendiest schools in the world high tech high and others they espouse a philosophy of learning as productive activity here there isn't really an option learning has to be productive in order for it to make sense
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 739.40 747.80 <o,f0,male> and finally they have a different model of scale and it's a chinese restaurant model of how to scale and i learned it from
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 748.65 755.21 <o,f0,male> is an amazing character he 's probably the most remarkable social entrepreneur in education in the world his name is
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 756.58 767.14 <o,f0,male> and he created something called pratham and pratham runs preschool play groups for now twenty one million children in india it's the largest ngo in education in the world
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 767.55 778.81 <o,f0,male> and it also supports working class kids going into indian schools he 's a complete revolutionary he 's actually a trade union organizer by background and that's how he learned the skills to build his organization
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 786.60 797.15 <o,f0,male> came along and looked at his model and said you know what you should do with this madhav you should turn it into mcdonald 's and what you do when you go to any new site is you kind of roll out a franchise and it's the same
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 797.70 805.99 <o,f0,male> you go it's reliable and people know exactly where they are and they'll be no mistakes and madhav said why do we have to do
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 807.19 815.01 <o,f0,male> why can't we do it more like the chinese restaurants there are chinese restaurants everywhere but there is no chinese restaurant chain
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 815.47 825.34 <o,f0,male> yet everyone knows what is a chinese restaurant they know what to expect even though it'll be subtly different and the colors will be different and the name will be different you know a chinese restaurant when you see it
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 826.00 838.59 <o,f0,male> these people work with the chinese restaurant model same principles different applications and different settings not the mcdonald 's model the mcdonald 's model scales the chinese restaurant model spreads
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 839.28 848.31 <o,f0,male> so mass education started with social entrepreneurship in the nineteenth century and that's desperately what we need again on a global scale
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 848.63 850.85 <o,f0,male> and what can we learn from all of that
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 851.62 853.32 <o,f0,male> well we can learn a lot because our
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 854.15 861.74 <o,f0,male> systems are failing desperately in many ways they fail to reach the people they most need to serve they often hit the
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 862.74 874.07 <o,f0,male> miss the point improvement is increasingly difficult to organize our faith in these systems incredibly fraught and this is just a very simple way of understanding
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 874.49 877.47 <o,f0,male> what kind of innovation what kind of different design
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 891.66 899.04 <o,f0,male> formal settings schools colleges hospitals in which innovation can take place and informal settings communities families
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 912.42 926.23 <o,f0,male> as i said the trouble with this is that in the developing world there just aren't teachers to make this model work you'd need millions and millions of teachers in china india nigeria and the rest of developing world to meet need
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 927.34 937.20 <o,f0,male> system we know that simply doing more of this won 't eat into deep educational inequalities especially in inner cities and former industrial areas
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 937.46 944.92 <o,f0,male> so that's why we need three more kinds of innovation we need more reinvention and all around the world now you see more
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 969.79 977.49 <o,f0,male> called jaringan and they all have the same kind of features highly collaborative very personalized often pervasive technology
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 978.97 986.47 <o,f0,male> learning that starts from questions and problems and projects not from knowledge and curriculum so we certainly need more of
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 987.11 1000.38 <o,f0,male> but because so many of the issues in education aren't just in school they're in family and community what you also need definitely is more on the right hand side you need efforts to supplement schools
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1001.09 1011.66 <o,f0,male> the most famous of these is reggio emilia in italy the family based learning system to support and encourage people in schools the most exciting is the harlem children 's
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1012.52 1024.55 <o,f0,male> which over ten years led by geoffrey canada has through a mixture of schooling and family and community projects attempted to transform not just education in schools but the entire culture and
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1026.19 1036.10 <o,f0,male> about ten thousand families in harlem we need more of that completely new and radical thinking you can go to places an hour away less
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1037.06 1039.98 <o,f0,male> from this room just down the road which need that
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1040.59 1049.94 <o,f0,male> which need radicalism of a kind that we haven't imagined and finally you need transformational innovation that could imagine getting learning to people in completely new and different
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1051.13 1059.06 <o,f0,male> so we are on the verge two thousand and fifteen of an amazing achievement the schoolification of the world every child
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1067.48 1068.55 <o,f0,male> unlike cars which
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1093.70 1101.07 <o,f0,male> as they developed it's recognizably nineteenth century in its roots and of course it's a huge achievement and of course it will bring great things
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1101.37 1112.69 <o,f0,male> it will bring skills and learning and reading but it will also lay waste to imagination it will lay waste to appetite it will lay waste to social confidence it will stratify society as much as it liberates it
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1 CharlesLeadbeater_2010S 1113.28 1120.02 <o,f0,male> and we are bequeathing to the developing world schools systems that they will now spend a century trying to
