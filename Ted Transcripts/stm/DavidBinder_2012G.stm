DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 39.25 42.1 <o,f0,male> in collaboration with the people of minto
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 42.51 50.52 <o,f0,male> what was this place called minto sydney as i would learn is a city of suburbs and minto lies southwest about an hour away
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 51.45 60.48 <o,f0,male> i have to say it wasn 't exactly what i had in mind for my first day down under i mean i 'd thought about the harbour bridge or bondi beach but minto
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 60.49 73.14 <o,f0,male> but still i 'm a producer and the lure of a site specific theater project was more than i could resist laughter so off i went into friday afternoon traffic and i 'll never forget what i saw when i got there for the
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 73.75 77.55 <o,f0,male> the audience walked around the neighborhood from house to house
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 91.31 105.63 <o,f0,male> k based performance company called lone twin lone twin had come to minto and worked with the residents and they had created these dances this australian indian girl she came out and started to dance on her front lawn
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 105.63 110.69 <o,f0,male> and her father peered out the window to see what all the noise and commotion was about
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 110.69 112.8 <o,f0,male> and he soon joined her
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 112.8 120.99 <o,f0,male> and he was followed by her little sister and soon they were all dancing this joyous exuberant dance
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 121.01 122.66 <o,f0,male> right there on their lawn
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 128.18 133.6 <o,f0,male> by the incredible sense of ownership this community clearly felt about this event
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 134.8 144.26 <o,f0,male> minto live brought sydneysiders into dialogue with international artists and really celebrated the diversity of sydney on its own terms
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 144.77 152.13 <o,f0,male> the sydney festival which produced minto live i think represents a new kind of twenty first century arts festival
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 152.39 155.37 <o,f0,male> these festivals are radically open
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 155.74 161.29 <o,f0,male> they can transform cities and communities to understand this i think it
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 161.35 163.86 <o,f0,male> kind of makes sense to look where we 've come from
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 164.7 183.68 <o,f0,male> modern arts festivals were born in the rubble of world war ii civic leaders created these annual events to celebrate culture as the highest expression of the human spirit in one thousand nine hundred and forty seven the edinburgh festival was born and avignon was born and hundreds of others would follow in their wake
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 201.38 217.75 <o,f0,male> these festivals they really became the establishment and as the culture and capital accelerated the internet brought us all together high and low kind of disappeared a new kind of festival emerged the old festivals they continued to thrive
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 217.79 224.85 <o,f0,male> but from brighton to rio to perth something new was emerging and these festivals were really different
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 225.13 233.81 <o,f0,male> they 're open these festivals because like in minto they understand that the dialogue between the local and the global is essential
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 234.06 253.08 <o,f0,male> they 're open because they ask the audience to be a player a protagonist a partner rather than a passive spectator and they 're open because they know that imagination cannot be contained in buildings and so much of the work they do is site specific or outdoor work
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 253.7 270.87 <o,f0,male> so the new festival it asks the audience to play an essential role in shaping the performance companies like de la guarda which i produce and punchdrunk create these completely immersive experiences that put the audience at the center of the action
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 271.47 277.54 <o,f0,male> but the german performance company rimini protokoll takes this all to a whole new level
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 278.19 288.36 <o,f0,male> in a series of shows that includes one hundred percent vancouver one hundred percent berlin rimini protokoll makes shows that actually reflect society
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 293.45 309.34 <o,f0,male> at that moment in terms of race and gender and class through a careful process that begins three months before and then those one hundred people share stories about themselves and their lives and the whole thing becomes a snapshot of that city at that moment
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 320.67 322.27 <o,f0,male> in an airport
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 352.57 359.58 <o,f0,male> i saw their amazing show in new york at the staten island ferry terminal at rush hour
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 359.65 364.08 <o,f0,male> we the audience were given headsets and seated on one side of the terminal
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 369.34 373.09 <o,f0,male> and we could hear them but we might not have otherwise seen them
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 374.08 383.85 <o,f0,male> so back to back takes site specific theater and uses it to gently remind us about who and what we choose to edit out of our daily lives
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 384.28 387.56 <o,f0,male> so the dialogue with the local and the global
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 387.75 391.81 <o,f0,male> the audience as participant and player and protagonist
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 391.83 407.82 <o,f0,male> the innovative use of site all of these things come to play in the amazing work of the fantastic french company royal de luxe royal de luxe 's giant puppets come into a city and they live there for a few days
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 408.58 419.18 <o,f0,male> for the sultan 's elephant royal de luxe came to central london and brought it to a standstill with their story of a giant little girl and her friend
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 419.23 428.25 <o,f0,male> a time traveling elephant for a few days they transformed a massive city into a community
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 428.29 431.29 <o,f0,male> where endless possibility reigned
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 431.49 438.97 <o,f0,male> the guardian wrote if art is about transformation then there can be no more transformative experience
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 438.99 448.97 <o,f0,male> what the sultan 's elephant represents is no less than an artistic occupation of the city and a reclamation of the streets for the people
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 450.78 465.24 <o,f0,male> we can talk about the economic impacts of these festivals on their cities but i 'm much more interested in many more things like how a festival helps a city to express itself how it lets it come into its own
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 465.24 478.74 <o,f0,male> festivals promote diversity they bring neighbors into dialogue they increase creativity they offer opportunities for civic pride they improve our general psychological well being
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 478.76 482.56 <o,f0,male> in short they make cities better places to live
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 483.07 490.05 <o,f0,male> case in point when the sultan 's elephant came to london just nine months after seven seven
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 490.55 506.21 <o,f0,male> a londoner wrote for the first time since the london bombings my daughter called up with that sparkle back in her voice she had gathered with others to watch the sultan 's elephant and you know it just made all the difference
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 506.76 515.01 <o,f0,male> lyn gardner in the guardian has written that a great festival can show us a map of the world a map of the city
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 515.13 517.02 <o,f0,male> and a map of ourselves
DavidBinder_2012G 1 DavidBinder_2012G 517.25 530.3 <o,f0,male> but there is no one fixed festival model i think what 's so brilliant about the festivals the new festivals is that they are really fully capturing the complexity
