LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 17.3 22.1 <o,f0,female> and societies are getting grayer you hear about it all the time
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 22.1 25.76 <o,f0,female> you read about it in your newspapers you hear about it on your television sets
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 25.76 35.52 <o,f0,female> sometimes i 'm concerned that we hear about it so much that we 've come to accept longer lives with a kind of a complacency even
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 39.18 49 <o,f0,female> longer lives can and i believe will improve quality of life at all ages
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 49 62.23 <o,f0,female> now to put this in perspective let me just zoom out for a minute more years were added to average life expectancy in the twentieth century than all years
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 71.91 82.65 <o,f0,female> we nearly doubled the length of time that we 're living so if you ever feel like you don 't have this aging thing quite pegged don 't kick yourself it 's brand new
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 83.72 91.24 <o,f0,female> and because fertility rates fell across that very same period that life expectancy was going up
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 91.24 110.73 <o,f0,female> that pyramid that has always represented the distribution of age in the population with many young ones at the bottom winnowed to a tiny peak of older people who make it and survive to old age is being reshaped into a rectangle
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 110.73 115.02 <o,f0,female> and now if you 're the kind of person who can get chills from population statistics
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 124.79 131.04 <o,f0,female> born in the developed world are having the opportunity to grow old
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 154.11 172.59 <o,f0,female> through cultural changes our ancestors largely eliminated early death so that people can now live out their full lives now there are problems associated with aging diseases poverty loss of social status it 's hardly time to rest on our laurels
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 172.59 181.48 <o,f0,female> but the more we learn about aging the clearer it becomes that a sweeping downward course is grossly inaccurate
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 181.92 188.64 <o,f0,female> aging brings some rather remarkable improvements increased knowledge expertise
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 191.47 193.84 <o,f0,female> of life improve
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 195.43 197.85 <o,f0,female> that 's right older people
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 205.66 217.39 <o,f0,female> is coming to the same conclusion the cdc recently conducted a survey where they asked respondents simply to tell them whether they experienced significant psychological distress in the previous
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 224.5 233.9 <o,f0,female> and a recent gallup poll asked participants how much stress and worry and anger they had experienced the previous day and stress
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 233.9 240.65 <o,f0,female> worry anger all decrease with age
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 254.34 269.56 <o,f0,female> may be that the current generations of older people are and always have been the greatest generations that is that younger people today may not typically experience these improvements as they grow older we 've asked
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 269.56 276.49 <o,f0,female> well maybe older people are just trying to put a positive spin on an otherwise depressing existence
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 284.03 293.5 <o,f0,female> years ago my colleagues and i embarked on a study where we followed the same group of people over a ten year period originally the sample was aged eighteen to ninety four
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 293.5 298.8 <o,f0,female> and we studied whether and how their emotional experiences changed as they grew older
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 298.8 317.79 <o,f0,female> our participants would carry electronic pagers for a week at a time and we 'd page them throughout the day and evenings at random times and every time we paged them we 'd ask them to answer several questions on a one to seven scale how happy are you right now how sad are you right now how frustrated are you right now
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 317.79 329.19 <o,f0,female> so that we could get a sense of the kinds of emotions and feelings they were having in their day to day lives and using this intense study of individuals we find that it 's not
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 329.19 345.97 <o,f0,female> one particular generation that 's doing better than the others but the same individuals over time come to report relatively greater positive experience now you see this slight downturn at very advanced ages
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 345.97 350.77 <o,f0,female> and there is a slight downturn but at no point does it return to the levels
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 350.77 357.32 <o,f0,female> we see in early adulthood now it 's really too simplistic
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 357.32 361.68 <o,f0,female> to say that older people are happy
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 361.68 364.58 <o,f0,female> in our study they are more positive
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 376.7 394.87 <o,f0,female> and other research has shown that older people seem to engage with sadness more comfortably they 're more accepting of sadness than younger people are and we suspect that this may help to explain why older people are better than younger people at solving hotly charged emotional conflicts
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 404.52 406.15 <o,f0,female> and all things being equal
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 406.17 413.33 <o,f0,female> older people direct their cognitive resources like attention and memory to positive information more than negative
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 413.69 426.26 <o,f0,female> if we show older middle aged younger people images like the ones you see on the screen and we later ask them to recall all the images that they can older people
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 426.37 429.24 <o,f0,female> but not younger people remember more positive
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 444.3 449.55 <o,f0,female> in day to day life this translates into greater enjoyment and satisfaction
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 469.2 488.34 <o,f0,female> process than negative emotions and so you switch to the positive emotions maybe our neural centers in our brain are degraded such that we 're unable to process negative emotions anymore but that 's not the case the most mentally sharp older adults are the ones who show this positivity effect
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 497.35 510.15 <o,f0,female> so how can this be well in our research we 've found that these changes are grounded fundamentally in the uniquely human ability to monitor time
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 510.3 523.22 <o,f0,female> not just clock time and calendar time but lifetime and if there 's a paradox of aging it 's that recognizing that we won 't live forever changes our perspective on life in positive
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 525.47 543.25 <o,f0,female> when time horizons are long and nebulous as they typically are in youth people are constantly preparing trying to soak up all the information they possibly can taking risks exploring we might spend time with people we don 't even like because it 's somehow interesting
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 547.51 549.75 <o,f0,female> we go on blind dates
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 552.38 556.16 <o,f0,female> you know after all if it doesn 't work out there 's always tomorrow
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 567.37 583.73 <o,f0,female> we age our time horizons grow shorter and our goals change when we recognize that we don 't have all the time in the world we see our priorities most clearly we take less notice of trivial matters we savor life
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 583.73 591.79 <o,f0,female> we 're more appreciative more open to reconciliation we invest in more emotionally important parts of life
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 627.24 640.11 <o,f0,female> if we invest in science and technology and find solutions for the real problems that older people face and we capitalize on the very real strengths
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 640.11 648.26 <o,f0,female> of older people then added years of life can dramatically improve quality of life at all ages
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 648.56 666.95 <o,f0,female> societies with millions of talented emotionally stable citizens who are healthier and better educated than any generations before them armed with knowledge about the practical matters of life and motivated to solve the big issues
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 667.26 675.44 <o,f0,female> can be better societies than we have ever known my father
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 676.02 678.16 <o,f0,female> who is ninety two likes to say
LauraCarstensen_2011X 1 LauraCarstensen_2011X 678.48 690.58 <o,f0,female> let 's stop talking only about how to save the old folks and start talking about how to get them to save us all
