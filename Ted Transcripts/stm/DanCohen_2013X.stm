DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 13.19 17.95 <o,f0,male> academic as he said and what that means is that
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 18.11 37.39 <o,f0,male> i argue it 's an important part of my life and i like to argue and i 'm not just an academic i 'm a philosopher so i like to think that i 'm actually pretty good at arguing but i also like to think a lot about arguing and thinking about arguing i 've come across some puzzles and one of the puzzles is that
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 37.39 40.98 <o,f0,male> as i 've been thinking about arguing over the years and it 's been decades now
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 43.28 48.29 <o,f0,male> but the more that i argue and the better i get at arguing the more that i lose
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 53.13 58.32 <o,f0,male> why is it that i 'm okay with losing and why is it that i think that good arguers are actually better at losing
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 80.72 94.05 <o,f0,male> whose turn it is to do the dishes or who has to take out the garbage yeah we have those arguments too i tend to win those arguments because i know the tricks but those aren 't the important arguments i 'm interested in academic arguments today and here are the things that puzzle me
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 109.54 116.68 <o,f0,male> what does it matter to me whether you have this idea that kant 's theory works or mill 's the right ethicist to follow
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 116.99 121.49 <o,f0,male> it 's no skin off my back whether you think functionalism is a viable theory of mind
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 122 127.86 <o,f0,male> so why do we even try to argue why do we try to convince other people to believe things that they don 't want to believe
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 148.48 168.35 <o,f0,male> that 's not really a very helpful model for arguing but it 's a pretty common and entrenched model for arguing but there 's a second model for arguing arguments as proofs think of a mathematician 's argument here 's my argument does it work is it any good are the premises warranted are the inferences valid does the conclusion follow from the premises
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 190.92 196.53 <o,f0,male> but there 's another twist on this model that i really think is important namely that when we argue
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 197.11 200.38 <o,f0,male> before an audience sometimes the audience has a more
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 231.56 233.9 <o,f0,male> the argument as war is the dominant one
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 234.24 240.96 <o,f0,male> it dominates how we talk about arguments it dominates how we think about arguments and because of that it shapes
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 260.97 267.56 <o,f0,male> it is the dominant way of thinking about arguments when i 'm talking about arguments that 's probably what you thought of the adversarial model
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 276.89 280.08 <o,f0,male> first it elevates tactics over substance
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 301.47 308.78 <o,f0,male> ignominious defeat i think those are deforming effects and worst of all it seems to prevent things like negotiation
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 308.79 312.16 <o,f0,male> or deliberation or compromise
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 329.11 338.13 <o,f0,male> and finally this is really the worst thing arguments don 't seem to get us anywhere they 're dead ends they are roundabouts or traffic jams or gridlock
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 348.59 350.65 <o,f0,male> then there 's an implicit equation of
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 372.23 375.35 <o,f0,male> how does it apply over here and you answer my question
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 384.07 389.28 <o,f0,male> to my satisfaction and so at the end of the day i say you know what
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 394.63 400.44 <o,f0,male> and it 's not just any belief but it 's a well articulated examined
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 400.54 402.83 <o,f0,male> it 's a battle tested belief
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 407.4 416.25 <o,f0,male> well the war metaphor seems to force us into saying you won even though i 'm the only one who made any cognitive gain what did you gain cognitively
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 435.54 442.4 <o,f0,male> i gained and there 's something wrong with that picture and that 's the picture i really want to change if we can
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 446.72 448.74 <o,f0,male> yield something positive
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 449.45 452.69 <o,f0,male> what we need is new exit strategies for arguments
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 457.73 462.46 <o,f0,male> entry approaches to arguments we need to think of new kinds of arguments
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 479.44 485.24 <o,f0,male> i don 't have an answer but i have some suggestions and here 's my suggestion
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 497.5 501.61 <o,f0,male> that people play in arguments there 's the proponent and the opponent
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 502 508.88 <o,f0,male> in an adversarial dialectical argument there 's the audience in rhetorical arguments there 's the reasoner in arguments as proofs
