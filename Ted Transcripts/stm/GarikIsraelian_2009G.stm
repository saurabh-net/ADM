GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 16.75 22.29 <o,f0,male> a very difficult task i'm a spectroscopist i have to talk about
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 23.33 31.69 <o,f0,male> showing you any single image of nebulae or galaxies etc because my job is spectroscopy i never deal with images
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 32.38 38.54 <o,f0,male> but i'll try to convince you that spectroscopy is actually something which can change this world
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 46.62 60.13 <o,f0,male> it's not very fun to do spectroscopy one of my colleagues in bulgaria neviana markova spent about twenty years studying these profiles and she published forty two articles just dedicated to the subject
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 60.47 69.01 <o,f0,male> can you imagine day and night thinking observing the same star for twenty years is incredible but we are crazy we do these things
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 69.94 77.89 <o,f0,male> and i'm not that far i spent about eight months working on these profiles because
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 78.66 90.54 <o,f0,male> a very small symmetry in the profile of one of the planet host stars and i thought well maybe there is lithium six in this star which is and indication that this star has swallowed a planet
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 125.88 138.29 <o,f0,male> because they thought that if you are having a telescope you are an astronomer so what you are doing is actually looking in a telescope and you might have seen the planet going into a star and i was saying no excuse me
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 138.58 144.34 <o,f0,male> i see is this one it's just incredible because nobody understood
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 145.14 154.93 <o,f0,male> i bet that there were very few people who really understood what i'm talking about because this is the indication that the planet went into the star it's amazing
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 156.71 162.65 <o,f0,male> the power of spectroscopy was actually realized by pink floyd already
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 165.71 169.71 <o,f0,male> because they actually said that you can get any color
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 169.82 182.44 <o,f0,male> you like in a spectrum and all you need is time and money to make your spectrograph this is the number one high resolution most precise spectrograph on this planet called harps
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 182.86 190.09 <o,f0,male> which is actually used to detect extrasolar planets and sound waves in the atmospheres of stars how we get spectra
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 191.12 197.67 <o,f0,male> i'm sure most of you know from school physics that it's basically splitting a white light
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 199.31 210.68 <o,f0,male> to colors and if you have a liquid hot mass it will produce something which we call a continuous spectrum a hot gas is producing emission lines only
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 211.37 222.13 <o,f0,male> no continuum and if you place a cool gas in front of a hot source you will see certain patterns which we call absorption lines
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 222.50 233.01 <o,f0,male> which is used actually to identify chemical elements in a cool matter which is absorbing exactly at those frequencies now what we can do with the spectra
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 233.61 244.78 <o,f0,male> we can actually study line of sight velocities of cosmic objects and we can also study chemical compostion and physical parameters of stars galaxies
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 245.49 258.99 <o,f0,male> a star is the most simple object in the core we have thermonuclear reactions going on creating chemical elements and we have a cool atmosphere it's cool for me cool in my terms is
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 266.73 272.66 <o,f0,male> cool for them but you know everything is relative so for me five thousand degrees is
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 275.04 289.05 <o,f0,male> this is the spectrum of the sun twenty four thousand spectral lines and about fifteen percent of these lines is not yet identified it is amazing so we are in the twenty one st century and we still can not properly
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 303.77 313.53 <o,f0,male> is the only spectral line in the spectrum of the sun and we use this weak feature to measure the composition of gold in the atmosphere of the sun
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 313.98 328.00 <o,f0,male> and now this is a work in progress we have been dealing with a similarly very weak feature which belongs to osmium it's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear explosions of supernovae
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 328.73 337.26 <o,f0,male> the only place where you can produce actually osmium just comparing the composition of osmium in one of the planet host stars
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 337.61 350.98 <o,f0,male> we want to understand why there is so much of this element perhaps we even think that maybe supernova explosions trigger formations of planets and stars it can be an indication
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 351.88 358.80 <o,f0,male> the other day my colleague from berkeley gibor basri emailed me a very interesting spectrum asking me can you have a look at this
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 359.74 372.04 <o,f0,male> and i couldn't sleep next two weeks when i saw the huge amount of oxygen and other elements in the spectrum of the stars i knew that there is nothing like that observed in the galaxy
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 372.80 386.64 <o,f0,male> it was incredible the only conclusion we could make from this is clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion in this system which polluted the atmosphere of this star and later a black hole was formed
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 387.11 398.05 <o,f0,male> in a binary system which is still there with a mass of about five solar masses this was considered as first evidence that actually black holes come from supernovae explosions
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 399.32 407.23 <o,f0,male> my colleagues comparing composition of chemical elements in different galactic stars actually discovered alien stars in our galaxy
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 415.91 426.83 <o,f0,male> one of the stars you see in the spectra is an alien it comes from a different galaxy there is interaction of galaxies we know this and sometimes they just capture stars
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 429.25 435.45 <o,f0,male> heard about solar flares we were very surprised to discover a super flare
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 436.14 444.60 <o,f0,male> a flare which is thousands of millions of times more powerful than those we see in the sun in one of the binary stars in our galaxy called
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 446.48 457.01 <o,f0,male> we discovered the super flare and later we went to study the spectral lines to see is there anything strange with these objects and we found that everything is normal
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 457.58 468.51 <o,f0,male> stars are normal like the sun age everything was normal so this is a mystery it's one of the mysteries we still have super flares and there are six or seven similar cases
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 471.21 481.67 <o,f0,male> to go ahead with this we really need to understand chemical evolution of the universe it's very complicated i don't really want you to try to understand what is here
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 483.41 485.25 <o,f0,male> but it's to show you how
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 496.01 509.78 <o,f0,male> and doing this for fourteen billion years we end up with this picture which is a very important graph showing relative abundances of chemical elements in sun like stars and in the interstellar medium
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 510.48 517.12 <o,f0,male> so which means that it's really impossible to find an object where you find about ten times more sulfur
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 518.37 528.22 <o,f0,male> five times more calcium than oxygen it's just impossible and if you find one i will say that this is something related to seti because naturally you
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 530.48 543.28 <o,f0,male> doppler effect is something very important from fundamental physics and this is related to the change of the frequency of a moving source the doppler effect is used to discover extrasolar planets
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 543.91 557.53 <o,f0,male> the precision which we need to discover a jupiter like planet around a sun like star is something like twenty eight point four meters per second and we need nine centimeters per second to detect an earth like planet
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 558.51 570.72 <o,f0,male> this can be done with the future spectrographs i myself i'm actually involved in the team which is developing a codex high resolution future generation spectrograph for the forty
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 572.90 586.57 <o,f0,male> telescope and this is going to be an instrument to detect earth like planets around sun like stars it is an amazing tool called astroseismology where we can detect sound waves
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 587.07 589.14 <o,f0,male> in the atmospheres of stars
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 591.64 600.25 <o,f0,male> we can detect sound waves in the atmospheres of sun like stars those waves have frequencies in infrasound domain the
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 602.49 612.23 <o,f0,male> coming back to the most important question is there anybody out there this is closely related to tectonic and volcanic activity of planets
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 613.03 622.99 <o,f0,male> connection between life and radioactive nuclei is straightforward no life without tectonic activity without volcanic activity
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 623.54 630.81 <o,f0,male> and we know very well that geothermal energy is mostly produced by decay of uranium thorium and potassium
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 631.48 642.74 <o,f0,male> how to measure if we have planets where the amount of those elements is small so those planets are tectonically dead there can not be life
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 643.25 653.18 <o,f0,male> if there is too much uranium or potassium or thorium probably again there would be no life because can you imagine everything boiling it's too much energy on a planet
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 654.18 662.35 <o,f0,male> now we have been measuring abundancy of or thorium in one of the stars with extrasolar planets it's exactly the same game a very tiny
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 663.33 671.70 <o,f0,male> we are actually trying to measure this profile and to detect thorium it's very tough it's very tough and you have to first you have to convince yourself
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 672.20 682.01 <o,f0,male> then you have to convince your colleagues and then you have to convince the whole world that you have actually detected something like this in the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet host star
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 682.70 689.84 <o,f0,male> one hundred parsec away from here it's really difficult but if you want to know about a life
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 690.30 698.21 <o,f0,male> on extrasolar planets you have to do this job because you have to know how much of radioactive element you have in those systems
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 698.80 712.77 <o,f0,male> the one way to discover about aliens is to tune your radio telescope and listen to the signals if you receive something interesting well that's what seti does actually what seti has been doing for many years
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 713.50 721.55 <o,f0,male> i think the most promising way is to go for biomarkers you can see the spectrum of the earth this earthshine spectrum
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 722.04 731.20 <o,f0,male> and that is a very clear signal the slope which is coming which we call a red edge is a detection of vegetated area
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 731.90 741.74 <o,f0,male> it's amazing that we can detect vegetation from a spectrum now imagine doing this test for other planets
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 743.29 749.54 <o,f0,male> very recently very recently i'm talking about last six seven eight months water
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 751.60 761.24 <o,f0,male> carbon dioxide have been detected in the spectrum of a planet outside the solar system it's amazing so this is the power of spectroscopy
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 761.97 769.07 <o,f0,male> you can actually go and detect and study a chemical composition of planets far far
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 769.42 779.18 <o,f0,male> far from solar system we have to detect oxygen or ozone to make sure that we have all necessary conditions to have life
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 782.28 791.37 <o,f0,male> something which can be related to seti now imagine an object amazing object or something which we can not explain when we just stand up and say look we give up
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 800.49 814.63 <o,f0,male> and with the known physics etc it's something actually which has been pointed out by frank doctorake many years ago if you see in the spectrum of a planet host star if you see strange chemical elements
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 815.18 828.64 <o,f0,male> it can be a signal from a civilization which is there and they want to signal about it they want to actually signal their presence through these spectral lines in the spectrum of a star
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 829.73 839.54 <o,f0,male> in different ways there can be different ways doing this one is for instance technetium is a radioactive element with a decay time of about four point two million years
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 840.75 851.84 <o,f0,male> suddenly observe technetium in a sun like star you can be sure that somebody has put this element in the atmosphere because in a natural way it is impossible to do this
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 852.63 861.54 <o,f0,male> now we are reviewing the spectra of about three hundred stars with extrasolar planets and we are doing this job since two thousand
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 862.30 871.11 <o,f0,male> and it's a very heavy project we have been working very hard and we have some interesting cases
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 873.63 880.11 <o,f0,male> things which we can't really explain and i hope in the near future we can confirm this
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 880.71 889.45 <o,f0,male> so the main question are we alone i think it will not come from ufos it will not come from radio signals
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 890.06 896.20 <o,f0,male> i think it will come from a spectrum like this it is the spectrum of a planet like
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 898.40 911.28 <o,f0,male> showing a presence of nitrogen oxide as a clear signal of life and oxygen and ozone if one day and i think it will be within fifteen years from now or twenty years
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 925.80 934.21 <o,f0,male> will take about five years and then we will need another ten fifteen years with space projects to get the spectra of earth like planets like the one i showed you
GarikIsraelian_2009G 1 GarikIsraelian_2009G 934.52 942.53 <o,f0,male> and if we see the nitrogen oxide and oxygen i think we have the perfect e t thank you very much
