BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 37.2 56.89 <o,f0,male> now here 's the bad news nearly everyone is completely overwhelmed by the chaos of family life every parent i know myself included feels like we 're constantly playing defense just when our kids stop teething they start having tantrums just when they stop needing our help taking a bath they need our help dealing with cyberstalking or
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 62.58 70.03 <o,f0,male> ellen galinsky of the families and work institute asked one thousand children if you were granted one wish about your parents
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 70.03 78.21 <o,f0,male> what would it be the parents predicted the kids would say spending more time with them they were wrong
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 78.25 83.28 <o,f0,male> the kids number one wish that their parents be less tired and less stressed
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 83.92 95.37 <o,f0,male> so how can we change this dynamic are there concrete things we can do to reduce stress draw our family closer and generally prepare our children to enter the world
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 95.92 98.84 <o,f0,male> i spent the last few years trying to answer that question
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 99 116.72 <o,f0,male> traveling around meeting families talking to scholars experts ranging from elite peace negotiators to warren buffett 's bankers to the green berets i was trying to figure out what do happy families do right and what can i learn from them to make my family happier
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 130.9 141.11 <o,f0,male> the starrs are a regular american family with their share of regular american family problems david is a software engineer eleanor takes care of their four children ages ten to fifteen
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 141.56 153.3 <o,f0,male> one of those kids tutors math on the far side of town one has lacrosse on the near side of town one has asperger syndrome one has adhd we were living in complete chaos eleanor said
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 153.59 170.77 <o,f0,male> what the starrs did next though was surprising instead of turning to friends or relatives they looked to david 's workplace they turned to a cutting edge program called agile development that was just spreading from manufacturers in japan to startups in silicon valley
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 170.77 188.87 <o,f0,male> in agile workers are organized into small groups and do things in very short spans of time so instead of having executives issue grand proclamations the team in effect manages itself you have constant feedback you have daily update sessions you have weekly reviews you 're constantly changing
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 188.87 200.74 <o,f0,male> david said when they brought this system into their home the family meetings in particular increased communication decreased stress and made everybody happier to be part of the family team
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 200.74 216.24 <o,f0,male> when my wife and i adopted these family meetings and other techniques into the lives of our then five year old twin daughters it was the biggest single change we made since our daughters were born and these meetings had this effect while taking under twenty minutes
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 229.17 246.03 <o,f0,male> companies followed the waterfall method right in which executives issued orders that slowly trickled down to programmers below and no one had ever consulted the programmers eighty three percent of projects failed they were too bloated or too out of date by the time they were done
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 246.03 255.31 <o,f0,male> sutherland wanted to create a system where ideas didn 't just percolate down but could percolate up from the bottom and be adjusted in real time
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 255.62 264.65 <o,f0,male> he read thirty years of harvard business review before stumbling upon an article in one thousand nine hundred and eighty six called the new new product development
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 283.33 303.27 <o,f0,male> in sutherland 's system companies don 't use large massive projects that take two years they do things in small chunks nothing takes longer than two weeks so instead of saying you guys go off into that bunker and come back with a cell phone or a social network you say you go off and come up with one element then bring it back let 's talk about it let 's adapt
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 303.74 306.69 <o,f0,male> you succeed or fail quickly
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 306.69 317.55 <o,f0,male> today agile is used in a hundred countries and it 's sweeping into management suites inevitably people began taking some of these techniques and applying it to their families
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 317.55 332.72 <o,f0,male> you had blogs pop up and some manuals were written even the sutherlands told me that they had an agile thanksgiving where you had one group of people working on the food one setting the table and one greeting visitors at the door sutherland said it was the best thanksgiving ever
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 332.72 339.29 <o,f0,male> so let 's take one problem that families face crazy mornings and talk about how agile can help
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 339.33 346.12 <o,f0,male> a key plank is accountability so teams use information radiators these large boards in which everybody is accountable
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 346.12 353.46 <o,f0,male> so the starrs in adapting this to their home created a morning checklist in which each child is expected to tick off chores
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 353.46 358.89 <o,f0,male> so on the morning i visited eleanor came downstairs poured herself a cup of coffee sat in a reclining chair
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 358.89 371.89 <o,f0,male> and she sat there kind of amiably talking to each of her children as one after the other they came downstairs checked the list made themselves breakfast checked the list again put the dishes in the dishwasher rechecked the list
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 371.89 380.3 <o,f0,male> fed the pets or whatever chores they had checked the list once more gathered their belongings and made their way to the bus it was one of the most astonishing
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 380.3 382.19 <o,f0,male> family dynamics i have ever seen
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 382.64 394.37 <o,f0,male> and when i strenuously objected this would never work in our house our kids needed way too much monitoring eleanor looked at me that 's what i thought she said i told david keep your work out of my kitchen but i was wrong
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 394.37 405.07 <o,f0,male> so i turned to david so why does it work he said you can 't underestimate the power of doing this and he made a checkmark he said in the workplace adults love it with kids it 's heaven
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 405.07 410.86 <o,f0,male> the week we introduced a morning checklist into our house it cut parental screaming in half
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 412.46 429 <o,f0,male> but the real change didn 't come until we had these family meetings so following the agile model we ask three questions what worked well in our family this week what didn 't work well and what will we agree to work on in the week ahead everyone throws out suggestions and then we pick two to focus on
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 429 438.58 <o,f0,male> and suddenly the most amazing things started coming out of our daughters mouths what worked well this week getting over our fear of riding bikes making our beds
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 438.58 455.27 <o,f0,male> what didn 't work well our math sheets or greeting visitors at the door like a lot of parents our kids are something like bermuda triangles like thoughts and ideas go in but none ever comes out i mean at least not that are revealing this gave us access suddenly to their innermost thoughts
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 455.27 459.87 <o,f0,male> but the most surprising part was when we turned to what are we going to work on in the week ahead
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 483.99 496.8 <o,f0,male> now look naturally there 's a gap between their kind of conduct in these meetings and their behavior the rest of the week but the truth is it didn 't really bother us it felt like we were kind of laying these underground cables that wouldn 't light up their world for many years to come
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 496.8 505.82 <o,f0,male> three years later our girls are almost eight now we 're still holding these meetings my wife counts them among her most treasured moments as a mom
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 505.82 517.46 <o,f0,male> so what did we learn the word agile entered the lexicon in two thousand and one when jeff sutherland and a group of designers met in utah and wrote a twelve point agile manifesto
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 517.46 527.4 <o,f0,male> i think the time is right for an agile family manifesto i 've taken some ideas from the starrs and from many other families i met i 'm proposing three planks
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 527.4 530.87 <o,f0,male> plank number one adapt all the time
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 530.87 547.57 <o,f0,male> when i became a parent i figured you know what we 'll set a few rules and we 'll stick to them that assumes as parents we can anticipate every problem that 's going to arise we can 't what 's great about the agile system is you build in a system of change so that you can react to what 's happening to you in real time
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 547.57 555.91 <o,f0,male> it 's like they say in the internet world if you 're doing the same thing today you were doing six months ago you 're doing the wrong thing parents can learn a lot from that
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 555.91 570.13 <o,f0,male> but to me adapt all the time means something deeper too we have to break parents out of this straitjacket that the only ideas we can try at home are ones that come from shrinks or self help gurus or other family experts
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 570.13 577.99 <o,f0,male> the truth is their ideas are stale whereas in all these other worlds there are these new ideas to make groups and teams work effectively
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 589.88 602.59 <o,f0,male> i met a celebrity chef in new orleans who said no problem i 'll just time shift family dinner i 'm not home can 't make family dinner we 'll have family breakfast we 'll meet for a bedtime snack we 'll make sunday meals more important
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 602.59 605.88 <o,f0,male> and the truth is recent research backs him up
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 605.88 623.08 <o,f0,male> it turns out there 's only ten minutes of productive time in any family meal the rest of it 's taken up with take your elbows off the table and pass the ketchup you can take that ten minutes and move it to any part of the day and have the same benefit so time shift family dinner that 's adaptability
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 639.96 650.16 <o,f0,male> my wife and i actually moved where we sit for difficult conversations because i was sitting above in the power position so move where you sit that 's adaptability
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 650.16 657.83 <o,f0,male> the point is there are all these new ideas out there we 've got to hook them up with parents so plank number one adapt all the time
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 658.13 666.46 <o,f0,male> be flexible be open minded let the best ideas win plank number two empower your children
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 666.46 685.25 <o,f0,male> our instinct as parents is to order our kids around it 's easier and frankly we 're usually right there 's a reason that few systems have been more waterfall over time than the family but the single biggest lesson we learned is to reverse the waterfall as much as possible enlist the children in their own upbringing
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 685.92 690.47 <o,f0,male> just yesterday we were having our family meeting and we had voted to work on overreacting
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 690.47 708.04 <o,f0,male> so we said okay give us a reward and give us a punishment okay so one of my daughters threw out you get five minutes of overreacting time all week so we kind of liked that but then her sister started working the system she said do i get one five minute overreaction or can i get ten thirty second overreactions
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 708.64 721.16 <o,f0,male> i loved that spend the time however you want now give us a punishment okay if we get fifteen minutes of overreaction time that 's the limit every minute above that we have to do one pushup
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 764.5 770.87 <o,f0,male> the point is we have to let our children succeed on their own terms and yes on occasion fail on their own terms
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 770.87 789.6 <o,f0,male> i was talking to warren buffett 's banker and he was chiding me for not letting my children make mistakes with their allowance and i said but what if they drive into a ditch he said it 's much better to drive into a ditch with a dollar six allowance than a dollar sixty thousand a year salary or a dollar six million inheritance so the bottom line is empower
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 794.6 798.71 <o,f0,male> adaptability is fine but we also need bedrock
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 798.71 815.53 <o,f0,male> jim collins the author of good to great told me that successful human organizations of any kind have two things in common they preserve the core they stimulate progress so agile is great for stimulating progress but i kept hearing time and again you need to preserve the core so how do you do that
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 815.53 826.92 <o,f0,male> collins coached us on doing something that businesses do which is define your mission and identify your core values so he led us through the process of creating a family mission statement
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 826.92 832.73 <o,f0,male> we did the family equivalent of a corporate retreat we had a pajama party i made popcorn
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 832.73 847.69 <o,f0,male> actually i burned one so i made two my wife bought a flip chart and we had this great conversation like what 's important to us what values do we most uphold and we ended up with ten statements we are travelers not tourists we don 't like dilemmas we like solutions
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 865.98 878.33 <o,f0,male> a few weeks later we got a call from the school one of our daughters had gotten into a spat and suddenly we were worried like do we have a mean girl on our hands and we didn 't really know what to do so we called her into my office the family mission statement was on the wall and my wife said
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 878.33 887.55 <o,f0,male> so anything up there seem to apply and she kind of looked down the list and she said bring people together suddenly we had a way into the conversation
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 887.55 892.91 <o,f0,male> another great way to tell your story is to tell your children where they came from
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 892.91 908.24 <o,f0,male> researchers at emory gave children a simple what do you know test do you know where your grandparents were born do you know where your parents went to high school do you know anybody in your family who had a difficult situation an illness and they overcame
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 916.1 931 <o,f0,male> the do you know test was the single biggest predictor of emotional health and happiness as the author of the study told me children who have a sense of they 're part of a larger narrative have greater self confidence
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 966 969.92 <o,f0,male> but as i began working on this project i began changing my mind
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 970.61 977.9 <o,f0,male> recent scholarship has allowed us for the first time to identify the building blocks that successful families have
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 978.8 984.07 <o,f0,male> i 've mentioned just three here today adapt all the time empower the children
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 1011.62 1016.82 <o,f0,male> tolstoy became consumed with that stick but he never found
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 1026.6 1031.07 <o,f0,male> that story perfectly captures for me the final lesson that i learned
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 1031.4 1035.66 <o,f0,male> happiness is not something we find it 's something we make
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 1036.18 1047.22 <o,f0,male> almost anybody who 's looked at well run organizations has come to pretty much the same conclusion greatness is not a matter of circumstance it 's a matter of choice
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 1055.64 1058.15 <o,f0,male> keep reaching for that green stick
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 1058.37 1061.78 <o,f0,male> in the end this may be the greatest lesson of all
BruceFeiler_2013S 1 BruceFeiler_2013S 1062.07 1064.01 <o,f0,male> what 's the secret to a happy family
