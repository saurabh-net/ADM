LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 46.68 54.61 <o,f0,male> so for example in the case of ticketmaster the reason you have to type these distorted characters is to prevent scalpers from writing a program that can buy millions of tickets two at a time
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 102.49 112.52 <o,f0,male> which is something that we started here at carnegie mellon then we turned it into a startup company and then about a year and a half ago google actually acquired this company so let me tell you what this project started
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 119.79 131.27 <o,f0,male> when i first heard this i was quite proud of myself i thought look at the impact that my research has had but then i started feeling bad see here 's the thing each time you type a captcha essentially you waste ten seconds of your time
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 131.77 138.29 <o,f0,male> and if you multiply that by two hundred million you get that humanity as a whole is wasting about five hundred thousand hours every day typing these annoying captchas
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 138.93 140.53 <o,f0,male> so then i started feeling bad
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 152.61 161.06 <o,f0,male> so see here 's the thing while you 're typing a captcha during those ten seconds your brain is doing something amazing your brain is doing something that computers cannot yet do
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 161.06 174.39 <o,f0,male> so can we get you to do useful work for those ten seconds another way of putting it is is there some humongous problem that we cannot yet get computers to solve yet we can split into tiny ten second chunks such that each time somebody solves a captcha they solve a little bit of this problem
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 174.39 184.56 <o,f0,male> and the answer to that is yes and this is what we 're doing now so what you may not know is that nowadays while you 're typing a captcha not only are you authenticating yourself as a human but in addition you 're actually helping us to digitize books
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 237.64 241.42 <o,f0,male> so what we 're doing now is we 're taking all of the words that the computer cannot recognize
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 241.42 253.3 <o,f0,male> and we 're getting people to read them for us while they 're typing a captcha on the internet so the next time you type a captcha these words that you 're typing are actually words that are coming from books that are being digitized that the computer could not recognize
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 262.78 265.84 <o,f0,male> but since it doesn 't know the answer for it it cannot grade it for you
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 265.84 279.91 <o,f0,male> so what we do is we give you another word one for which the system does know the answer we don 't tell you which one 's which and we say please type both and if you type the correct word for the one for which the system already knows the answer it assumes you are human and it also gets some confidence that you typed the other word correctly
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 279.91 293.77 <o,f0,male> and if we repeat this process to like ten different people and all of them agree on what the new word is then we get one more word digitized accurately so this is how the system works and basically since we released it about three or four years ago a lot of websites have started switching from
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 293.77 305.93 <o,f0,male> the old captcha where people wasted their time to the new captcha where people are helping to digitize books so for example ticketmaster so every time you buy tickets on ticketmaster you help to digitize a book facebook every time you add a friend or poke somebody you help to digitize a book
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 319.21 324.99 <o,f0,male> two and a half million books a year and this is all being done one word at a time by just people typing captchas on the internet
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 348.08 354.08 <o,f0,male> there 's nothing wrong with it but if you present it along with another randomly chosen word bad things can happen
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 380.94 385.68 <o,f0,male> now of course we 're not just insulting people see here 's the thing since we 're presenting two randomly chosen words
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 389.56 405.93 <o,f0,male> to a really big internet meme that tens of thousands of people have participated in which is called captcha art i 'm sure some of you have heard about it here 's how it works imagine you 're using the internet and you see a captcha that you think is somewhat peculiar like this captcha
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 451.56 468.96 <o,f0,male> this is the number of distinct people that have helped us digitize at least one word out of a book through recaptcha seven hundred and fifty million which is a little over ten percent of the world 's population has helped us digitize human knowledge and it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda so the question that motivates my research is the following
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 468.96 476.13 <o,f0,male> if you look at humanity 's large scale achievements these really big things that humanity has gotten together and done historically like for example
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 476.13 481.32 <o,f0,male> building the pyramids of egypt or the panama canal or putting a man on the moon
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 481.32 489.09 <o,f0,male> there is a curious fact about them and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people it 's weird they were all done with about one hundred thousand people
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 489.09 491.69 <o,f0,male> and the reason for that is because before the internet
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 491.69 510.29 <o,f0,male> coordinating more than one hundred thousand people let alone paying them was essentially impossible but now with the internet i 've just shown you a project where we 've gotten seven hundred and fifty million people to help us digitize human knowledge so the question that motivates my research is if we can put a man on the moon with one hundred thousand what can we do with one hundred million so
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 510.29 525.5 <o,f0,male> based on this question we 've had a lot of different projects that we 've been working on let me tell you about one that i 'm most excited about this is something that we 've been semi quietly working on for the last year and a half or so it hasn 't yet been launched it 's called duolingo since it hasn 't been launched
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 537.12 544.88 <o,f0,male> so i posed the question to my graduate student by the way you did hear me correctly his last name is hacker so i posed this question to him
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 544.88 550.2 <o,f0,male> how can we get one hundred million people translating the web into every major language for free
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 550.2 553.85 <o,f0,male> okay so there 's a lot of things to say about this question first of all translating the web
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 592.11 609.35 <o,f0,male> so let me show you an example of something that was translated with a machine actually it was a forum post it was somebody who was trying to ask a question about javascript it was translated from japanese into english so i 'll just let you read this person starts apologizing for the fact that it 's
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 709.55 715.61 <o,f0,male> i don 't even know if there exists one hundred million people out there using the web who are bilingual enough to help us translate
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 715.61 719.53 <o,f0,male> that 's a big problem the other problem you 're going to run into is a lack of motivation
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 719.53 737.87 <o,f0,male> how are we going to motivate people to actually translate the web for free normally you have to pay people to do this so how are we going to motivate them to do it for free now when we were starting to think about this we were blocked by these two things but then we realized there 's actually a way to solve both these problems with the same solution there 's a way to kill two birds with one stone
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 737.87 748.44 <o,f0,male> and that is to transform language translation into something that millions of people want to do and that also helps with the problem of lack of bilinguals and that is language education
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 754.66 765.32 <o,f0,male> people really really want to learn a foreign language and it 's not just because they 're being forced to do so in school for example in the united states alone there are over five million people who have paid over dollar five hundred for software to learn a new language
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 777.7 790.41 <o,f0,male> and so basically they 're learning by doing so the way this works is whenever you 're a just a beginner we give you very very simple sentences there 's of course a lot of very simple sentences on the web we give you very very simple sentences along with what each word means
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 790.54 804.98 <o,f0,male> and as you translate them and as you see how other people translate them you start learning the language and as you get more and more advanced we give you more and more complex sentences to translate but at all times you 're learning by doing now the crazy thing about this method is that it actually really works
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 805.03 811.42 <o,f0,male> first of all people are really really learning a language we 're mostly done building it and now we 're testing it people really can learn a language with it
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 811.42 827.75 <o,f0,male> and they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software so people really do learn a language and not only do they learn it as well but actually it 's way more interesting because you see with duolingo people are actually learning with real content as opposed to learning with made up sentences people are learning with real content which is inherently interesting
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 837.09 841.07 <o,f0,male> the translations that we get are as accurate as those of professional language translators
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 841.07 853.96 <o,f0,male> which is very surprising so let me show you one example this is a sentence that was translated from german into english the top is the german the middle is an english translation that was done by somebody who was a professional english translator who we paid twenty cents a word
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 853.96 861.12 <o,f0,male> for this translation and the bottom is a translation by users of duolingo none of whom knew any german before they started using the site
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 878.01 886.3 <o,f0,male> the site actually can translate pretty fast so let me show you this is our estimates of how fast we could translate wikipedia from english into spanish
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 886.3 904.21 <o,f0,male> remember this is fifty million dollars worth of value so if we wanted to translate wikipedia into spanish we could do it in five weeks with one hundred thousand active users and we could do it in about eighty hours with a million active users since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users we 're hopeful that we 'll be able to translate extremely fast with this project
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 904.49 911.3 <o,f0,male> now the thing that i 'm most excited about with duolingo is i think this provides a fair business model for language education
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 911.36 915.7 <o,f0,male> so here 's the thing the current business model for language education is the student pays
LuisVonAhn_2011X 1 LuisVonAhn_2011X 938.09 956.13 <o,f0,male> you 're translating stuff which for example we could charge somebody for translations so this is how we could monetize this since people are creating value while they 're learning they don 't have to pay their money they pay with their time but the magical thing here is that they 're paying with their time but that is time that would have had to have been spent anyways learning the language
