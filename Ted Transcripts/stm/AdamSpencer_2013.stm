AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 32.68 47.66 <o,f0,male> humble breakfast radio announcer from sydney australia to be here on the ted stage literally on the other side of the world and i wanted to let you know a lot of the things you 've heard about australians are true from the youngest of ages we display a prodigious sporting talent
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 47.66 55.74 <o,f0,male> on the field of battle we are brave and noble warriors what you 've heard is true australians we don 't mind a bit of a drink
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 56.29 71.76 <o,f0,male> sometimes to excess leading to embarrassing social situations laughter this is my father 's work christmas party december one thousand nine hundred and seventy three i 'm almost five years old fair to say i 'm enjoying the day a lot more than santa was but
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 73.14 79.32 <o,f0,male> i stand before you today not as a breakfast radio host not as a comedian but as someone who was
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 103.2 109.62 <o,f0,male> what do you want to do after lunch i 've got no plans it was an exercise in democratic schooling
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 109.66 113.64 <o,f0,male> and i am all for democratic schooling but we were only seven
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 126.58 128.17 <o,f0,male> through a round hole
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 146.2 148.65 <o,f0,male> is less than the diameter of the circle
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 150.25 152.92 <o,f0,male> well the square peg will pass quite easily through the round
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 163.96 167.78 <o,f0,male> sitting next to me one of my friends one of the cool kids in class steven leaned across
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 185.74 188.56 <o,f0,male> i thought about it for a nanosecond i took one look
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 188.56 190.68 <o,f0,male> at the road map of life
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 191.31 198.87 <o,f0,male> and i ran off down the street marked geek as fast as my chubby asthmatic little legs would carry me
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 212.39 227.2 <o,f0,male> with which the symphony of the universe is written the great descartes said something quite similar the universe is written in the mathematical language and today i want to show you one of those musical notes a number
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 229.14 237.74 <o,f0,male> so beautiful so massive i think it will blow your mind today we 're going to talk about prime numbers most of you i 'm sure remember
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 243.86 260.19 <o,f0,male> because it 's one x seven but we can 't break it down into any smaller chunks or as we call them factors now a few things you might like to know about prime numbers one is not prime the proof of that is a great party trick that admittedly only works at certain parties
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 306.7 315.94 <o,f0,male> i 'm talking about five little number twos next to each other all multiplied together two x two x two x two x two so two five is two
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 324.84 330.24 <o,f0,male> those five little twos multiplied together two five one equal thirty one
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 331.07 336.76 <o,f0,male> thirty one is a prime number and that five in the power is also a prime number
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 336.85 350.77 <o,f0,male> and the vast bulk of massive primes we 've ever found are of that form two to a prime number take away one i won 't go into great detail as to why because most of your eyes will bleed out of your head if i do but
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 356.61 367.62 <o,f0,male> for primacy a random odd number is a lot harder to test but as soon as we go hunting for massive primes we realize it 's not enough just to put in any prime number in the power
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 367.88 370.21 <o,f0,male> two eleven one equal two thousand and
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 395.74 406.95 <o,f0,male> in the one thousand seven hundred s other mathematicians said he is simply the master of us all he was so respected they put him on european currency back when that was a compliment
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 434.14 444.3 <o,f0,male> thirty nine digits long proven to be prime in one thousand eight hundred and seventy six by a mathematician called lucas word up l dog
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 462.36 474.52 <o,f0,male> but he didn 't know what the factors were we knew it was like six but we didn 't know what are the two x three that multiply together to give us that massive number we didn 't know for almost forty years until frank nelson cole came along
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 474.65 477.7 <o,f0,male> and at a gathering of prestigious american mathematicians
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 477.7 479.34 <o,f0,female> walked to the board
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 479.37 480.98 <o,f0,female> took up a piece of chalk
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 481.54 483.87 <o,f0,female> and started writing out the powers of two
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 514.79 525.18 <o,f0,male> it got even more exciting when he then wrote down these two large prime numbers in your standard multiplication format and for the rest of the hour of his talk
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 525.24 528.1 <o,f0,male> frank nelson cole busted that out
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 528.5 546.52 <o,f0,male> he had found the prime factors of two sixty seven one the room went berserk laughter as frank nelson cole sat down having delivered the only talk in the history of mathematics with no words
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 546.95 557.54 <o,f0,female> he admitted afterwards it wasn 't that hard to do it took focus it took dedication it took him by his estimate three years of sundays
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 564.06 568.2 <o,f0,male> the age of the computer goes along and things explode
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 584.28 586.19 <o,f0,male> it was the year i left university
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 586.2 595.36 <o,f0,male> i was torn between mathematics and media it was a tough decision i loved university my arts degree was the best nine and a half years of my life
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 601.55 611.97 <o,f0,male> put simply in a room full of randomly selected people i 'm a maths genius in a roomful of maths ph ds i 'm as dumb as a box of hammers
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 612.4 628.93 <o,f0,male> my skill is not in the mathematics it is in telling the story of the mathematics and during that time since i 've left university these numbers have got bigger and bigger each one dwarfing the last until along came this man dr curtis cooper
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 639.98 643.69 <o,f0,male> not years ago not months ago
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 651.33 654.46 <o,f0,male> to show you what this guy had done i still remember
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 696.1 703.36 <o,f0,female> this number is almost seventeen and a half million digits long
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 703.37 715.78 <o,f0,male> if you typed it out on a computer and saved it as a text file that 's twenty two meg for the slightly less geeky of you think about the harry potter novels okay this is the first harry potter novel
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 716.33 720.7 <o,f0,male> this is all seven harry potter novels because she did tend to faff on a bit near the end
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 736.43 749.04 <o,f0,male> if when ted had begun at eleven o 'clock on tuesday we 'd walked out and simply hit one slide every second it would have taken five hours to show you that number
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 752.13 755.05 <o,f0,female> that 's
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 761.84 768.83 <o,f0,male> as confidently as we know the number seven is prime that fills me with
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 768.83 771.42 <o,f0,male> almost sexual excitement
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 802.51 816.9 <o,f0,male> it 's got a remarkably clear yes no answer and just requires phenomenal grunt large prime numbers are a great way of testing the speed and accuracy of computer chips but secondly as curtis cooper was looking for that monster prime he wasn 't the only guy searching
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 846.96 863.45 <o,f0,male> but for me it 's amazing because it 's a metaphor for the time in which we live when human minds and machines can conquer together we 've heard a lot about robots in this ted we 've heard a lot about what they can and can 't do it is true you can now download onto your smartphone an app
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 863.6 870.29 <o,f0,male> that would beat most grandmasters at chess you think that 's cool here 's a machine doing something cool
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 872.73 884.52 <o,f0,male> it can take a randomly shuffled rubik 's cube using the power of the smartphone it can examine the cube and solve the cube
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 886.5 889.45 <o,f0,female> in five seconds
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 897.34 903.15 <o,f0,female> how lucky are we to live in this age when mind and machine can work together
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 919.83 939.81 <o,f0,male> i was there it was the most emotional exciting day it wasn 't my highlight of two thousand and twelve people thought it might have been an interview i 'd done on my show it might have been a politician it might have been a breakthrough it might have been a book i read the arts no no no it might have been something my two gorgeous daughters had done no it wasn 't the highlight of two thousand and twelve so clearly was the discovery of the higgs boson
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 940.62 942.53 <o,f0,male> give it up for the fundamental
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 959.81 962.42 <o,f0,female> i 've clearly got mass
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 962.75 967.93 <o,f0,female> where does it come from and he postulated a suggestion that there 's this infinite
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 968.16 987 <o,f0,female> incredibly small field stretching throughout the universe and as other particles go through those particles and interact that 's where they get their mass the rest of the scientific community said great idea higgsy we 've got no idea if we could ever prove it it 's beyond our reach and within just fifty years
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 987 992.27 <o,f0,female> in his lifetime with him sitting in the audience
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 992.74 996.26 <o,f0,female> we had designed the greatest machine ever
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 996.31 1000.69 <o,f0,female> to prove this incredible idea that originated just
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 1000.69 1002.7 <o,f0,male> in a human mind
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 1003.36 1007.56 <o,f0,male> that 's what is so exciting for me about this prime number we thought it might be there
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 1007.88 1010.13 <o,f0,male> and we went and found it
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 1014.97 1017.74 <o,f0,female> is what we are all about
AdamSpencer_2013 1 AdamSpencer_2013 1017.83 1021 <o,f0,female> or as my friend descartes might put it we think
