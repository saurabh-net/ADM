ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 34.21 37.44 <o,f0,male> that 's long enough for a generation of managers to retire
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 37.9 48.59 <o,f0,male> you see the first wave of managers simply replaced their steam engines with electric motors but they didn 't redesign the factories to take advantage of electricity 's flexibility
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 48.59 59.06 <o,f0,male> it fell to the next generation to invent new work processes and then productivity soared often doubling or even tripling in those factories
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 59.06 65.39 <o,f0,male> electricity is an example of a general purpose technology like the steam engine before it
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 65.98 75.87 <o,f0,male> general purpose technologies drive most economic growth because they unleash cascades of complementary innovations like lightbulbs and yes factory redesign
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 76.54 79.36 <o,f0,male> is there a general purpose technology of our era
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 80.01 82.12 <o,f0,male> sure it 's the computer
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 82.7 85.26 <o,f0,male> but technology alone is not enough
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 85.72 87.8 <o,f0,male> technology is not destiny
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 88.12 89.9 <o,f0,male> we shape our destiny
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 89.98 94.22 <o,f0,male> and just as the earlier generations of managers needed to redesign their factories
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 94.35 106.7 <o,f0,male> we 're going to need to reinvent our organizations and even our whole economic system we 're not doing as well at that job as we should be as we 'll see in a moment productivity is actually doing all right
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 118.15 121.08 <o,f0,male> as the end of innovation
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 121.43 125.8 <o,f0,male> but they are actually the growing pains of what andrew mcafee and i call
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 126.16 128.4 <o,f0,male> the new machine age
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 133.84 139.16 <o,f0,male> there 's some bumps along the way but the big story is you could practically fit a ruler to it
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 139.24 142.65 <o,f0,male> this is a log scale so what looks like steady growth
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 142.72 147.26 <o,f0,male> is actually an acceleration in real terms and here 's productivity
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 147.88 160.71 <o,f0,male> you can see a little bit of a slowdown there in the mid seventy s but it matches up pretty well with the second industrial revolution when factories were learning how to electrify their operations after a lag productivity accelerated again
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 161.33 163.43 <o,f0,male> so maybe history doesn 't repeat itself
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 163.43 165.43 <o,f0,male> but sometimes it rhymes
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 186.39 202.83 <o,f0,male> is even better worldwide incomes have grown at a faster rate in the past decade than ever in history if anything all these numbers actually understate our progress because the new machine age is more about knowledge creation than just
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 202.83 209.13 <o,f0,male> physical production it 's mind not matter brain not brawn ideas not things
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 209.13 214.06 <o,f0,male> that creates a problem for standard metrics because we 're getting more and more stuff
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 235.56 245.76 <o,f0,male> according to the numbers the music industry is half the size that it was ten years ago but i 'm listening to more and better music than ever you know i bet you are too
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 246.33 256.8 <o,f0,male> in total my research estimates that the gdp numbers miss over three hundred billion dollars per year in free goods and services on the internet
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 257.3 258.85 <o,f0,male> now let 's look to the future
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 259.08 265.64 <o,f0,male> there are some super smart people who are arguing that we 've reached the end of growth
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 266.47 275.38 <o,f0,male> but to understand the future of growth we need to make predictions about the underlying drivers of growth
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 276.11 280.91 <o,f0,male> i 'm optimistic because the new machine age is digital
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 285.09 289.02 <o,f0,male> when goods are digital they can be replicated with perfect quality
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 289.5 291.47 <o,f0,male> at nearly zero cost
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 291.77 295.02 <o,f0,male> and they can be delivered almost instantaneously
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 295.34 297.94 <o,f0,male> welcome to the economics of abundance
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 298.36 306.15 <o,f0,male> but there 's a subtler benefit to the digitization of the world measurement is the lifeblood of science and progress
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 306.15 312.34 <o,f0,female> in the age of big data we can measure the world in ways we never could before
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 313.4 316.38 <o,f0,female> secondly the new machine age is exponential
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 317.28 321.59 <o,f0,male> computers get better faster than anything else
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 334.63 337.39 <o,f0,male> exponential trends take us by surprise
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 364.77 376.57 <o,f0,male> but the reality is that each innovation creates building blocks for even more innovations here 's an example in just a matter of a few weeks an undergraduate student of mine
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 376.57 389.78 <o,f0,male> built an app that ultimately reached one point three million users he was able to do that so easily because he built it on top of facebook and facebook was built on top of the web and that was built on top of the internet and so on and so forth
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 390.26 397.01 <o,f0,male> now individually digital exponential and combinatorial would each be game changers
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 397.1 410.71 <o,f0,male> put them together and we 're seeing a wave of astonishing breakthroughs like robots that do factory work or run as fast as a cheetah or leap tall buildings in a single bound you know robots are even revolutionizing cat transportation
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 420.9 424.05 <o,f0,male> consider one project ibm 's watson
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 424.23 433.32 <o,f0,male> these little dots here those are all the champions on the quiz show jeopardy at first watson wasn 't very good
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 433.71 446.12 <o,f0,male> but it improved at a rate faster than any human could and shortly after dave ferrucci showed this chart to my class at mit watson beat the world jeopardy champion
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 446.99 453.97 <o,f0,male> at age seven watson is still kind of in its childhood recently its teachers let it surf the internet
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 453.97 455.79 <o,f0,male> unsupervised
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 456.56 461.02 <o,f0,male> the next day it started answering questions with profanities
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 466.81 469.5 <o,f0,male> it 's being tested for jobs in call centers
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 469.55 486.64 <o,f0,male> and it 's getting them it 's applying for legal banking and medical jobs and getting some of them isn 't it ironic that at the very moment we are building intelligent machines perhaps the most important invention in human history some people are arguing that innovation is stagnating
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 488.25 496.14 <o,f0,male> like the first two industrial revolutions the full implications of the new machine age are going to take at least a century to fully play out
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 496.68 498.99 <o,f0,male> but they are staggering
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 499.27 502.48 <o,f0,male> so does that mean we have nothing to worry about
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 511.71 518.51 <o,f0,male> we have created more wealth in the past decade than ever but for a majority of americans their income has fallen
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 518.82 524 <o,f0,male> this is the great decoupling of productivity from employment
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 532.9 537.05 <o,f0,male> but like too many others they misunderstand its basic causes
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 537.68 539.72 <o,f0,male> technology is racing ahead
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 540.2 546.76 <o,f0,male> but it 's leaving more and more people behind today we can take a routine job
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 552.94 561.33 <o,f0,male> you know i recently overheard a conversation that epitomizes these new economics this guy says nah i don 't use h r block anymore
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 561.5 567.54 <o,f0,male> turbotax does everything that my tax preparer did but it 's faster cheaper and more accurate
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 568.35 572.54 <o,f0,male> how can a skilled worker compete with a dollar thirty nine piece of software
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 584.11 587.86 <o,f0,male> but seventeen percent of tax preparers no longer have jobs
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 588.18 598.17 <o,f0,male> that is a microcosm of what 's happening not just in software and services but in media and music in finance and manufacturing in retailing
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 598.17 599.98 <o,f0,female> and trade in short
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 605.99 612.63 <o,f0,male> and many of them are losing that race what can we do to create shared prosperity
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 613.16 624.14 <o,f0,male> the answer is not to try to slow down technology instead of racing against the machine we need to learn to race with the machine that is our grand challenge
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 624.14 627.39 <o,f0,female> the new machine age
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 627.52 635.19 <o,f0,female> can be dated to a day fifteen years ago when gary kasparov the world chess champion played deep blue
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 635.32 636.94 <o,f0,female> a supercomputer
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 637.36 644.15 <o,f0,male> the machine won that day and today a chess program running on a cell phone can beat a human grandmaster
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 644.75 653.43 <o,f0,male> it got so bad that when he was asked what strategy he would use against a computer jan donner the dutch grandmaster
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 664.8 670.65 <o,f0,male> neither is a human because kasparov organized a freestyle tournament
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 670.91 674.4 <o,f0,male> where teams of humans and computers could work together
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 674.83 677.65 <o,f0,male> and the winning team had no grandmaster
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 678.15 681.78 <o,f0,male> and it had no supercomputer what they had
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 681.81 684.51 <o,f0,male> was better teamwork
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 684.69 692.95 <o,f0,male> and they showed that a team of humans and computers working together could beat any computer
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 693.17 700.28 <o,f0,male> or any human working alone racing with the machine beats racing against the machine
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 1 ErikBrynjolfsson_2013 700.3 702.17 <o,f0,male> technology is not destiny
