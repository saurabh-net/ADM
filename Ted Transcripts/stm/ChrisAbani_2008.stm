ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 33.90 37.10 <o,f0,male> look away from the darkest things about us because
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 37.84 45.51 <o,f0,male> i really believe that we're never more beautiful than when we're most ugly because that's really the moment we really know what we're made of
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 48.35 60.92 <o,f0,male> chris said i grew up in nigeria with a whole generation in the eighties of students who were protesting a military dictatorship which has finally ended so it wasn't just me there was a whole generation of us
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 61.42 62.84 <o,f0,male> but what i've come to learn
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 63.53 69.32 <o,f0,male> is that the world is never saved in grand messianic gestures but in the simple
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 79.72 82.49 <o,f0,male> in south africa they have a phrase called
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 86.24 98.07 <o,f0,male> only way for me to be human is for you to reflect my humanity back at me but if you're like me my humanity is more like a window i don't really see it i don't pay attention to it until
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 99.41 106.64 <o,f0,male> like a bug that's dead on the window then suddenly i see it and usually it's never good it's usually when i'm cussing in traffic
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 107.75 114.89 <o,f0,male> someone who is trying to drive their car and drink coffee and send emails and make notes so
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 115.99 122.01 <o,f0,male> what ubuntu really says is that there is no way for us to be human without other people
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 124.40 126.54 <o,f0,male> very complicated so i thought i should
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 127.82 132.38 <o,f0,male> some stories i should tell you some stories about remarkable people so i thought i'd start with my mother
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 134.59 135.47 <o,f0,male> and she was dark
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 136.65 140.61 <o,f0,male> my mother was english my parents met in oxford in the fifties and my mother moved to nigeria and
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 141.49 144.78 <o,f0,male> she was five foot two very feisty and very english
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 145.34 154.34 <o,f0,male> this is how english my mother is or was she just passed she came out to california to los angeles to visit me and we went to malibu which she thought was very
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 156.50 158.09 <o,f0,male> and then we went to a fish restaurant
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 158.85 164.48 <o,f0,male> and we had chad the surfer dude serving us and he came up and my mother said do you have any specials
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 174.85 177.10 <o,f0,male> my mother turned to me and said what
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 179.87 182.42 <o,f0,male> i said english mum and she shook her head and said
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 193.90 195.02 <o,f0,male> so this woman
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 195.82 200.10 <o,f0,male> who converted from the church of england to catholicism when she married my father
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 200.53 203.10 <o,f0,male> and there's no one more rabid than a catholic convert
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 203.80 211.10 <o,f0,male> decided to teach in the rural areas in nigeria particularly among igbo women the billings ovulation method
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 211.84 215.35 <o,f0,male> which was the only approved birth control by the catholic church
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 218.51 219.41 <o,f0,male> wasn't too good
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 219.74 221.60 <o,f0,male> so she took me along to translate
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 227.09 229.27 <o,f0,male> never discuss their period with their husbands
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 238.54 239.91 <o,f0,male> how swollen is your vulva
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 245.88 248.23 <o,f0,male> she never would have thought of herself as a feminist my mother
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 249.58 252.75 <o,f0,male> but she always used to say anything a man can do i can fix
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 260.18 260.56 <o,f0,male> and
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 263.01 274.31 <o,f0,male> when my father complained about this situation where she's taking a seven year old boy to teach this birth control you know he used to say oh you're turning him into you're teaching him how to be a woman my mother said someone has
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 277.66 279.83 <o,f0,male> this woman during the biafran war
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 280.67 284.54 <o,f0,male> we were caught in the war it was my mother with five little children
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 285.63 291.51 <o,f0,male> it takes her one year through refugee camp after refugee camp to make her way to an airstrip where we can fly out of the country
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 292.91 304.95 <o,f0,male> at every single refugee camp she has to face off soldiers who want to take my elder brother mark who was nine and make him a boy soldier can you imagine this five foot two woman standing up to men with guns who want to kill us
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 307.08 310.29 <o,f0,male> all through that one year my mother never cried one time not
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 311.27 315.26 <o,f0,male> but when we were in lisbon in the airport about to fly to england
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 320.36 331.26 <o,f0,male> it was basically see through with five really hungry looking kids came over and asked her what had happened and she told this woman and so this woman emptied out her suitcase and
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 331.64 336.66 <o,f0,male> all of her clothes to my mother and to us and the toys of her kids who didn't like that very much
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 350.13 356.12 <o,f0,male> any kind of horror but the simple act of kindness from a complete stranger will unstitch you
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 361.68 364.59 <o,f0,male> the old women in my father 's village after this war
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 370.88 378.16 <o,f0,male> and they would sing these dirges made up of these names dirges so melancholic that they would scorch you
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 379.02 381.08 <o,f0,male> and they would sing them only when they planted the
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 382.04 383.87 <o,f0,male> as though they were seeding the hearts of the dead
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 385.98 393.08 <o,f0,male> but when it came for harvest time they would sing these joyful songs that were made up of the names of every child who had been born that
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 406.11 407.86 <o,f0,male> these women enacted
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 408.40 409.78 <o,f0,male> a lot of transformation
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 417.59 419.57 <o,f0,male> and the word for marriage was the same one
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 424.44 425.57 <o,f0,male> rebuilding rwanda
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 426.72 431.09 <o,f0,male> did you also know that after apartheid when the new government went into the parliament houses
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 434.94 438.26 <o,f0,male> which would seem to suggest that apartheid was entirely the business of men
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 439.67 440.39 <o,f0,male> all of this to say
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 445.05 446.15 <o,f0,male> never really counted
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 460.43 462.40 <o,f0,male> always rites of passage for young men
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 463.14 470.75 <o,f0,male> men were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women that's essentially what it is and a lot of rituals involved killing
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 471.90 476.78 <o,f0,male> little animals progressing along so when i turned thirteen and i mean it made sense it was
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 477.35 486.74 <o,f0,male> agrarian community somebody had to kill the animals there was no whole foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at so when i turned thirteen it was my turn now to kill a goat
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 489.45 491.69 <o,f0,male> this weird sensitive kid who couldn't really do it
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 492.92 502.73 <o,f0,male> but i had to do it and i was supposed to do this alone but a friend of mine called emmanuel who was significantly older than me who 'd been a boy soldier during the biafran war decided to come with me
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 505.12 505.88 <o,f0,male> which sort of
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 506.68 516.14 <o,f0,male> made me feel good because he'd seen a lot of things now when i was growing up he used to tell me stories about how he used to bayonet people and their intestines would fall out but they would keep running
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 517.32 522.54 <o,f0,male> so this guy comes with me and i don't know if you've ever heard a goat or seen one
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 522.94 524.30 <o,f0,male> they sound like human beings
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 528.53 530.15 <o,f0,male> my friend brad kessler says
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 531.24 534.51 <o,f0,male> we didn't become human until we started keeping goats
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 536.52 538.46 <o,f0,male> a goat 's eyes are like a child
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 544.13 546.83 <o,f0,male> puts his hand over the mouth of the goat covers
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 555.01 561.00 <o,f0,male> this guy who 'd seen so much and who to whom the killing of a goat must have seemed such a quotidian experience
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 561.45 564.00 <o,f0,male> still found it in himself to try to protect me
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 567.31 576.37 <o,f0,male> i was a wimp i cried for a very long time and afterwards he didn't say a word he just sat there watching me cry for an hour and then afterwards he said to me
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 576.79 577.99 <o,f0,male> it will always be difficult
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 579.50 582.36 <o,f0,male> but if you cry like this every time you will die of
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 584.53 588.23 <o,f0,male> just know that it is enough sometimes to know that it is difficult
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 599.48 602.10 <o,f0,male> i was born two days after christmas
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 602.98 609.24 <o,f0,male> so growing up you know i had a cake and everything but i never got any presents because born two days after christmas
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 610.46 623.26 <o,f0,male> about nine and my uncle had just come back from germany and we had the catholic priest over my mother was entertaining him with tea and my uncle suddenly says where are chris presents and
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 627.29 634.32 <o,f0,male> but he was desperate to show that he'd just come back so he summoned me up and he said go into the bedroom my bedroom take anything you want out of the
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 637.80 638.96 <o,f0,male> he thought i'd take a book
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 640.18 641.72 <o,f0,male> but i found an inflatable sheep
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 654.21 655.66 <o,f0,male> waving this buzzing sheep around
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 663.27 668.77 <o,f0,male> was completely unflustered just stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said it 's all right daphne i'm scottish
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 686.31 687.84 <o,f0,male> my last days in prison
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 696.61 698.27 <o,f0,male> my cellmate was fourteen years old
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 699.45 700.50 <o,f0,male> the name was john james
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 703.03 705.19 <o,f0,male> if a family member committed a crime
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 710.83 713.02 <o,f0,male> so here was this fourteen year old kid on death row
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 718.28 723.77 <o,f0,male> and he had smuggled in two comics two comic books spiderman and x men he was obsessed
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 724.70 730.65 <o,f0,male> and when he got tired of reading them he started to teach the men in death row how to read
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 731.04 732.25 <o,f0,male> with these comic books
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 732.95 743.89 <o,f0,male> and so i remember night after night you'd hear all these men these really hardened criminals huddled around john james reciting take that spidey
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 761.22 764.28 <o,f0,male> say how do you know and he said oh i heard it on the
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 770.22 771.60 <o,f0,male> they handcuffed him to a chair
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 798.82 800.03 <o,f0,male> that they built their own gods
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 801.48 802.98 <o,f0,male> come together as a community
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 805.73 813.07 <o,f0,male> and their wish would then be brought to a priest who would find a ritual object and the appropriate sacrifices would be made
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 817.60 820.73 <o,f0,male> became unruly and began to ask for human sacrifice
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 822.14 823.14 <o,f0,male> destroy the god
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 823.84 825.28 <o,f0,male> they would knock down the shrine
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 835.31 837.36 <o,f0,male> we're building gods that have gone rampant
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 838.55 839.75 <o,f0,male> time we started knocking them
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 841.70 842.54 <o,f0,male> their names
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 843.97 847.09 <o,f0,male> it doesn't require a tremendous thing
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 847.52 854.33 <o,f0,male> all it requires is to recognize among us every day the few of us that can see are surrounded by people
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 858.46 859.56 <o,f0,male> amazing people
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 860.48 861.72 <o,f0,male> who offer all of us
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 862.33 863.55 <o,f0,male> the mirror to our own
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 865.25 866.64 <o,f0,male> i want to end with a poem
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 867.11 868.35 <o,f0,male> by an american poet

ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 895.50 897.52 <o,f0,male> out of the sight of the overseer
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 899.11 900.50 <o,f0,male> he pushes his tongue
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 902.45 904.46 <o,f0,male> where his tooth would be if he
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 907.92 910.87 <o,f0,male> in that space where his tooth would be
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 911.51 913.29 <o,f0,male> where his land would be
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 913.91 915.71 <o,f0,male> his house his wife
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 918.57 919.87 <o,f0,male> beautiful daughter
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 922.03 924.29 <o,f0,male> he wipes sorrow from his face
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 925.11 929.03 <o,f0,male> and puts his thirsty finger to his thirsty tongue
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 929.47 931.30 <o,f0,male> and tastes the salt
ChrisAbani_2008 1 ChrisAbani_2008 934.17 936.18 <o,f0,male> i call a name that could be his
