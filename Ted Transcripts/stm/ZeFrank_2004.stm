ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 178.93 185.34 <o,f0,male> this fund was supposed to be used for the rehabilitation of water reserves all over the country before the outbreak of war
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 185.88 192.37 <o,f0,male> when the war broke out the rebel leader demanded that the fund be given to him my father insisted it was not in his possession
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 193.66 195.65 <o,f0,male> and he was killed because of his refusal to release the

ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 264.73 269.51 <o,f0,male> this is really embarrassing i was told backstage that i have eighteen minutes
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 270.17 271.61 <o,f0,male> i only prepared fifteen
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 273.89 276.89 <o,f0,male> so if it's cool i'd like to just wait for three
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 300.06 300.87 <o,f0,male> serfaas
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 306.19 307.46 <o,f0,male> are you a virgin

ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 353.55 354.96 <o,f0,male> some google guys last night
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 355.58 357.49 <o,f0,male> really cool we were getting wasted
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 361.24 371.31 <o,f0,male> and they were telling me that google software has gotten so advanced that based on your interaction with google over your lifetime they can actually predict what you are going to say
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 374.83 375.58 <o,f0,male> and i was like
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 379.32 381.53 <o,f0,male> but they said no but don't
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 384.13 388.98 <o,f0,male> but they slipped up and they said that i could just type in what was i going to say next
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 389.48 390.98 <o,f0,male> and my name and it would tell me
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 402.11 405.08 <o,f0,female> was i going to say
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 406.99 411.30 <o,f0,female> and ze frank that's me am i feeling
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 413.52 415.03 <o,f0,male> am i feeling lucky
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 420.88 422.40 <o,f0,female> oh
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 438.99 439.95 <o,f0,male> on a thursday i
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 440.06 446.99 <o,f0,male> sent out a link to a website that featured those clips to seventeen of my closest friends as part of my an invitation to my
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 469.33 475.38 <o,f0,male> i received a call from earthlink that said due to a ten cents per megabyte overage charge i owed them thirty thousand dollars
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 477.78 481.30 <o,f0,male> needless to say i was able to leave my job
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 492.39 494.36 <o,f0,male> more of as like an internet guru or
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 495.91 496.83 <o,f0,male> swami
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 498.54 500.95 <o,f0,male> i i knew i had something
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 512.84 513.03 <o,f0,male> about
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 513.18 515.55 <o,f0,male> what makes websites popular and
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 516.77 521.02 <o,f0,male> you know it's it's unfortunate that i don't have more time
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 521.40 524.06 <o,f0,male> i can come back next year
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 536.88 540.79 <o,f0,male> and it's been an amazing opportunity to kind of get to know
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 543.24 550.22 <o,f0,male> you know it's like a microscope to the rest of the world you can kind of peer into other people 's lives and
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 551.32 553.24 <o,f0,male> i also feel like i get a lot of inspiration
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 554.49 560.03 <o,f0,male> from the average user for example somebody wrote me they said hey ze if you ever come to boulder
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 560.39 562.72 <o,f0,male> you should rock out with us and i said why wait
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 567.07 572.36 <o,f0,male> and they said hey ze thanks for rocking out but i meant the kind of rocking out where we'd be naked
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 574.51 581.96 <o,f0,male> and that was embarrassing but you know it's kind of a collaboration between me and the fans so i said
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 591.58 596.27 <o,f0,male> you're saying you're saying holy crap how is his presentation so smooth
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 599.70 603.09 <o,f0,male> and i have to say that it's not all me this year i guess
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 604.22 609.59 <o,f0,male> chris has to take some credit here because in years past i guess there's been some sort of subpar speakers at
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 616.98 618.68 <o,f0,male> which really allowed us
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 618.93 627.48 <o,f0,male> as speakers to get there in the trenches and practice at home so that we would be ready for this experience and i've got to say that
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 628.20 630.34 <o,f0,male> you know it's really really great to be here
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 637.87 638.89 <o,f0,male> not just the good stuff
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 641.60 647.30 <o,f0,male> you can do heckler mode hey moron get off the stage
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 663.23 664.13 <o,f0,male> case you run over time
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 666.30 668.32 <o,f0,male> just one last thing i'd like to say i 'd really
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 677.53 678.01 <o,f0,male> and
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 704.97 708.47 <o,f0,male> all this stuff this internet stuff and you're not making any money
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 711.50 713.47 <o,f0,male> why and i say mom dad
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 717.64 720.00 <o,f0,male> trying you know i don't know if you're
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 720.24 734.02 <o,f0,male> all aware of this but the video the video game market kids are playing these video games oh but supposedly there's tons of money i mean like i think one hundred thousand dollars or so a year is being spent on these things so
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 735.29 738.76 <o,f0,male> i decided to try my hand i came up with a few games
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 741.16 743.00 <o,f0,male> is called atheist i figured it 'd be
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 746.82 749.19 <o,f0,male> move around and say some things
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 765.64 766.67 <o,f0,male> done this before i tried
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 774.70 775.24 <o,f0,male> you come back
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 782.25 793.51 <o,f0,male> and this is great because you know for a quarter you can play this for a long time and chris had said in an email that you know we should really bring something new to ted something that we haven't shown anyone so
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 796.27 800.98 <o,f0,male> made this for ted it's christian it's the third in the series i'm hoping it's going to do well this year
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 807.15 808.92 <o,f0,male> have a preference
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 815.09 821.97 <o,f0,male> so you can wait for the second coming which is a random number between one and five hundred million
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 826.35 829.91 <o,f0,male> so really what are we talking about here oh tech joy
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 832.79 836.87 <o,f0,male> tech joy to me means something because i get a lot of joy out of tech
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 839.12 844.57 <o,f0,male> making things using technology and i'm being serious here even though i'm using my sarcastic voice i
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 847.68 856.96 <o,f0,male> making things you know making things actually does give me a lot of joy it's the process of creation that keeps me sort of a bubble and a half above perpetual anxiety
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 857.09 864.97 <o,f0,male> in my life and it's that feeling of being about eighty percent complete on a project where you know you still have something to do but it's not finished and you're not
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 879.88 888.32 <o,f0,male> in a culture of guru ship it's so hard to use some software because you know it's unapproachable people feel like they have to read the manual so
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 888.69 896.67 <o,f0,male> i try to i try to create these very minimal activities that allow people to express themselves and hopefully
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 914.22 925.30 <o,f0,male> try to create meaningful environments for people to express themselves here i created a contest called when office supplies attack which i think really resonated with the
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 926.93 928.34 <o,f0,male> working population
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 929.79 933.05 <o,f0,male> over five hundred entries in three weeks
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 938.28 942.20 <o,f0,male> again people from all over the country doing the watch is particularly incredible
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 945.85 958.52 <o,f0,male> online drawing tools you've probably seen a lot of them i think they're wonderful i think it's a chance for people to get to play with crayons and all that kind of stuff but i'm interested in the process the process of creating as the real event that i'm interested in
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 958.82 968.58 <o,f0,male> and the problem is that a lot of people suck at drawing and they get bummed out at this sort of you know stick figure awful little thing that they created
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 969.28 974.73 <o,f0,male> and eventually it just makes them stop playing with it or draw you know they draw penises and things like that
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 976.24 987.93 <o,f0,male> so the scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool in other words it's a helping tool you can draw your simple stick figure and then it collaborates with you to create sort of like a post war german etching
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 990.82 1001.03 <o,f0,male> you can in fact it's tuned to be better at drawing things that look worse so we go ahead and we start scribbling
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 1002.29 1006.79 <o,f0,male> and so the idea is that you can really you know
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 1013.20 1016.75 <o,f0,male> and here are some of my favorites this is the little trap marionette
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 1017.48 1018.30 <o,f0,male> that was submitted to
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 1030.08 1034.85 <o,f0,male> i mean this is incredible this is an eleven year old girl drew this and submitted it it's just
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 1039.96 1047.07 <o,f0,male> is not a joke but i think it's a it's a really fun and wonderful thing so
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 1047.97 1055.62 <o,f0,male> this is called the fiction project this is an online space which is it's basically a refurbished message board that
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 1065.69 1068.37 <o,f0,male> at a different at a different time i think that the
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 1069.13 1073.81 <o,f0,male> now tied up tied down mistress cruel approaches me now tied down it's up
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 1074.45 1076.24 <o,f0,male> it's it's an amazing way
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 1078.37 1081.97 <o,f0,male> if you come home and your spouse or whoever it is
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 1084.10 1085.47 <o,f0,male> says let 's talk
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 1087.45 1090.71 <o,f0,male> that like chills you to the very core
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 1091.72 1101.06 <o,f0,male> but it's peripheral activities like these that allow people to get together doing fun things they actually get to know each other and it is sort of like low threshold
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 1102.32 1108.96 <o,f0,male> activities that i think are the key to bringing up some of our bonding social capital that we're lacking and very very quickly i love puppets
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 1112.07 1122.46 <o,f0,male> music lotte reiniger an amazing shadow puppeteer in the twenties that started doing more elaborate things i became interested in puppets and i just want to show one last thing to you
ZeFrank_2004 1 ZeFrank_2004 1126.40 1127.74 <o,f0,female> ladies and gentlemen
