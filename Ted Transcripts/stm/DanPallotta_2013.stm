DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 14.55 18.39 <o,f0,male> social innovation and social entrepreneurship
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 18.99 24.51 <o,f0,male> i happen to have triplets they 're little they 're five years old
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 24.83 28.93 <o,f0,male> sometimes i tell people i have triplets they say really how many
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 29.6 33.93 <o,f0,male> here 's a picture of the kids that 's sage and annalisa and rider
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 34.35 38.81 <o,f0,male> now i also happen to be gay
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 40.27 45.03 <o,f0,male> being gay and fathering triplets is by far the most socially innovative socially entrepreneurial
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 45.03 47.99 <o,f0,male> thing i have ever
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 70.8 85 <o,f0,male> but before i do that i want to ask if we even believe that the nonprofit sector has any serious role to play in changing the world a lot of people say now that business will lift up the developing economies and social business will take care of the rest
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 85.41 90.46 <o,f0,male> and i do believe that business will move the great mass of humanity forward
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 90.49 98.54 <o,f0,male> but it always leaves behind that ten percent or more that is most disadvantaged or unlucky
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 99.29 110.36 <o,f0,male> and social business needs markets and there are some issues for which you just can 't develop the kind of money measures that you need for a market i sit on the board of a center for the developmentally disabled
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 110.49 112.63 <o,f0,male> and these people want laughter
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 112.85 115.08 <o,f0,male> and compassion and they want love
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 117.26 118.83 <o,f0,male> how do you monetize that
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 119.88 128.13 <o,f0,male> and that 's where the nonprofit sector and philanthropy come in philanthropy is the market for love
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 128.36 133.38 <o,f0,male> it is the market for all those people for whom there is no other market coming
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 133.6 148.39 <o,f0,male> and so if we really want like buckminster fuller said a world that works for everyone with no one and nothing left out then the nonprofit sector has to be a serious part of the conversation but it doesn 't seem to be working
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 148.99 164.63 <o,f0,male> why have our breast cancer charities not come close to finding a cure for breast cancer or our homeless charities not come close to ending homelessness in any major city why has poverty remained stuck at twelve percent of the u s population for forty years
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 165.79 170.38 <o,f0,male> and the answer is these social problems are massive in scale
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 170.72 176.42 <o,f0,male> our organizations are tiny up against them and we have a belief system that keeps them tiny
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 177.2 182.92 <o,f0,male> we have two rulebooks we have one for the nonprofit sector and one for the rest of the economic world
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 183 190.82 <o,f0,male> it 's an apartheid and it discriminates against the nonprofit sector in five different areas the first being compensation
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 191.71 207.38 <o,f0,male> so in the for profit sector the more value you produce the more money you can make but we don 't like nonprofits to use money to incentivize people to produce more in social service we have a visceral reaction to the idea that anyone would make very much money helping other people
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 208.1 213.52 <o,f0,male> interesting that we don 't have a visceral reaction to the notion that people would make a lot of money not helping other people
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 213.91 217.06 <o,f0,male> you know you want to make fifty million dollars selling
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 232.09 238.91 <o,f0,male> and we think of this as our system of ethics but what we don 't realize is that this system has a powerful side effect
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 239 247.32 <o,f0,male> which is it gives a really stark mutually exclusive choice between doing very well for yourself and your family
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 247.32 263.91 <o,f0,male> or doing good for the world to the brightest minds coming out of our best universities and sends tens of thousands of people who could make a huge difference in the nonprofit sector marching every year directly into the for profit sector because they 're not willing to make that kind of lifelong economic sacrifice
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 264.34 270.8 <o,f0,male> businessweek did a survey looked at the compensation packages for mbas ten years of business school
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 271.18 278.5 <o,f0,male> and the median compensation for a stanford mba with bonus at the age of thirty eight was four hundred thousand dollars
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 278.78 289.15 <o,f0,male> meanwhile for the same year the average salary for the ceo of a dollar five million plus medical charity in the u s was two hundred and thirty two thousand dollars and for a hunger charity eighty four thousand dollars
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 299.51 302.94 <o,f0,male> some people say well that 's just because those mba types are greedy
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 303.08 305.34 <o,f0,male> not necessarily they might be smart
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 305.86 317.97 <o,f0,male> it 's cheaper for that person to donate one hundred thousand dollars every year to the hunger charity save fifty thousand dollars on their taxes so still be roughly two hundred and seventy thousand dollars a year ahead of the game
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 317.97 328.72 <o,f0,male> now be called a philanthropist because they donated one hundred thousand dollars to charity probably sit on the board of the hunger charity indeed probably supervise the poor sob who decided to become the ceo of
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 337.62 353.18 <o,f0,male> the second area of discrimination is advertising and marketing so we tell the for profit sector spend spend spend on advertising until the last dollar no longer produces a penny of value but we don 't like to see our donations spent on advertising in charity our attitude is
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 353.18 362.69 <o,f0,male> well look if you can get the advertising donated you know at four o 'clock in the morning i 'm okay with that but i don 't want my donations spent on advertising i want it go to the needy
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 362.69 369.3 <o,f0,male> as if the money invested in advertising could not bring in dramatically greater sums of money to serve the needy
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 369.68 379.51 <o,f0,male> in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety s my company created the long distance aidsride bicycle journeys and the sixty mile long breast cancer three day walks
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 379.51 392.01 <o,f0,male> and over the course of nine years we had one hundred and eighty two thousand ordinary heroes participate and they raised a total of five hundred and eighty one million dollars
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 394.79 405.64 <o,f0,male> they raised more money more quickly for these causes than any events in history all based on the idea that people are weary of being asked to do the least they can possibly do people are
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 405.64 412.14 <o,f0,male> yearning to measure the full distance of their potential on behalf of the causes that they care about deeply
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 415.64 427.54 <o,f0,male> we got that many people to participate by buying full page ads in the new york times in the boston globe in primetime radio and tv advertising do you know how many people we would have gotten if we put up flyers in the laundromat
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 428.76 446.29 <o,f0,male> charitable giving has remained stuck in the u s at two percent of gdp ever since we started measuring it in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s that 's an important fact because it tells us that in forty years the nonprofit sector has not been able to wrestle any market share away from the for profit sector
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 446.73 454.47 <o,f0,male> and if you think about it how could one sector possibly take market share away from another sector if it isn 't really allowed to market
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 455.28 465.56 <o,f0,male> and if we tell the consumer brands you may advertise all the benefits of your product but we tell charities you cannot advertise all the good that you do where do we think the consumer dollars are going to flow
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 466.21 473.24 <o,f0,male> the third area of discrimination is the taking of risk in pursuit of new ideas for generating revenue
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 473.94 479.94 <o,f0,male> so disney can make a new dollar two hundred million movie that flops and nobody calls the attorney general
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 480.57 490.64 <o,f0,male> but you do a little dollar one million community fundraiser for the poor and it doesn 't produce a seventy five percent profit to the cause in the first twelve months and your character is called into question
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 491.12 501.45 <o,f0,male> so nonprofits are really reluctant to attempt any brave daring giant scale new fundraising endeavors for fear that if the thing fails their reputations will be dragged through the mud
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 501.54 505.09 <o,f0,male> well you and i know when you prohibit failure you kill innovation
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 505.68 514.3 <o,f0,male> if you kill innovation in fundraising you can 't raise more revenue if you can 't raise more revenue you can 't grow and if you can 't grow you can 't possibly solve large social problems
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 515.4 517.61 <o,f0,male> the fourth area is time
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 517.9 523.53 <o,f0,male> so amazon went for six years without returning any profit to investors and people had patience
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 523.53 541.11 <o,f0,male> they knew that there was a long term objective down the line of building market dominance but if a nonprofit organization ever had a dream of building magnificent scale that required that for six years no money was going to go to the needy it was all going to be invested in building this scale we would expect a crucifixion
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 542.35 561.47 <o,f0,male> and the last area is profit itself so the for profit sector can pay people profits in order to attract their capital for their new ideas but you can 't pay profits in a nonprofit sector so the for profit sector has a lock on the multi trillion dollar capital markets and the nonprofit sector is starved for growth and risk and idea capital
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 577.23 592.04 <o,f0,male> you don 't have the same amount of time to find them as the for profit sector and you don 't have a stock market with which to fund any of this even if you could do it in the first place and you 've just put the nonprofit sector at an extreme disadvantage to the for profit sector on every level
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 594.09 608.78 <o,f0,male> if we have any doubts about the effects of this separate rule book this statistic is sobering from one thousand nine hundred and seventy to two thousand and nine the number of nonprofits that really grew that crossed the dollar fifty million annual revenue barrier is one hundred and forty four
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 609 614.44 <o,f0,male> in the same time the number of for profits that crossed it is forty six thousand one hundred and thirty six
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 614.97 616.48 <o,f0,male> so we 're dealing with social
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 616.48 623.21 <o,f0,male> problems that are massive in scale and our organizations can 't generate any scale all of the scale goes to coca cola and burger king
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 624.19 626.87 <o,f0,male> so why do we think this way
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 627.58 641.42 <o,f0,male> well like most fanatical dogma in america these ideas come from old puritan beliefs the puritans came here for religious reasons or so they said but they also came here because they wanted to make a lot of money
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 641.86 651.92 <o,f0,male> they were pious people but they were also really aggressive capitalists and they were accused of extreme forms of profit making tendencies compared to the other colonists
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 655.4 663.77 <o,f0,male> so they were taught literally to hate themselves they were taught that self interest was a raging sea that was a sure path to eternal damnation
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 664.38 672.89 <o,f0,male> well this created a real problem for these people right here they 've come all the way across the atlantic to make all this money making all this money will get you sent directly to hell
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 673.23 685.25 <o,f0,male> what were they to do about this well charity became their answer it became this economic sanctuary where they could do penance for their profit making tendencies at five cents on the dollar
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 685.86 690.34 <o,f0,male> so of course how could you make money in charity if charity was your penance for making money
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 691 701.65 <o,f0,male> financial incentive was exiled from the realm of helping others so that it could thrive in the area of making money for yourself and in four hundred years nothing has intervened
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 701.65 704.83 <o,f0,male> to say that 's counterproductive and that 's unfair
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 706.46 714.91 <o,f0,male> now this ideology gets policed by this one very dangerous question which is what percentage of my donation goes to the cause versus overhead
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 726.85 730.73 <o,f0,male> but it absolutely is especially if it 's being used for growth
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 731.79 746.19 <o,f0,male> now this idea that overhead is somehow an enemy of the cause creates this second much larger problem which is it forces organizations to go without the overhead things they really need to grow in the interest of keeping overhead low
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 746.49 758.62 <o,f0,male> so we 've all been taught that charities should spend as little as possible on overhead things like fundraising under the theory that well the less money you spend on fundraising the more money there is available for the cause
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 759.18 764.09 <o,f0,male> well that 's true if it 's a depressing world in which this pie cannot be made any bigger
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 764.94 784.55 <o,f0,male> but if it 's a logical world in which investment in fundraising actually raises more funds and makes the pie bigger then we have it precisely backwards and we should be investing more money not less in fundraising because fundraising is the one thing that has the potential to multiply the amount of money available for the cause that we care about so deeply
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 785.72 792.13 <o,f0,male> i 'll give you two examples we launched the aidsrides with an initial investment of fifty thousand dollars in risk capital
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 792.41 801.99 <o,f0,male> within nine years we had multiplied that one thousand nine hundred and eighty two times into one hundred and eight million dollars after all expenses for aids services
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 803.01 808.62 <o,f0,male> we launched the breast cancer three days with an initial investment of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars in risk capital
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 808.78 818.79 <o,f0,male> within just five years we had multiplied that five hundred and fifty four times into one hundred and ninety four million dollars after all expenses for breast cancer research
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 818.79 830.67 <o,f0,male> now if you were a philanthropist really interested in breast cancer what would make more sense go out and find the most innovative researcher in the world and give her three hundred and fifty thousand dollars for research
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 830.67 839.09 <o,f0,male> or give her fundraising department the three hundred and fifty thousand dollars to multiply it into one hundred and ninety four million dollars for breast cancer research
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 839.13 849.25 <o,f0,male> two thousand and two was our most successful year ever we netted for breast cancer alone that year alone seventy one million dollars after all expenses
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 849.62 851.61 <o,f0,male> and then we went out of business
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 851.93 854.19 <o,f0,male> suddenly and traumatically
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 855.09 856.62 <o,f0,male> why well
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 856.62 864.84 <o,f0,male> the short story is our sponsor split on us they wanted to distance themselves from us because we were being crucified in the media
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 864.84 880.71 <o,f0,male> for investing forty percent of the gross in recruitment and customer service and the magic of the experience and there is no accounting terminology to describe that kind of investment in growth and in the future other than this demonic label of overhead
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 882.53 889.66 <o,f0,male> so on one day all three hundred and fifty of our great employees lost their jobs
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 892.45 894.22 <o,f0,male> because they were labeled overhead
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 895.65 906.53 <o,f0,male> our sponsor went and tried the events on their own the overhead went up net income for breast cancer research went down by eighty four percent or sixty million dollars in one year
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 907.79 913.31 <o,f0,male> this is what happens when we confuse morality with frugality
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 915.18 929.06 <o,f0,male> we 've all been taught that the bake sale with five percent overhead is morally superior to the professional fundraising enterprise with forty percent overhead but we 're missing the most important piece of information which is what is the actual size of these pies
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 929.43 933.33 <o,f0,male> who cares if the bake sale only has five percent overhead if it 's tiny
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 934.11 943.87 <o,f0,male> what if the bake sale only netted seventy one dollars for charity because it made no investment in its scale and the professional fundraising enterprise netted seventy one million dollars because it did
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 944.38 948.73 <o,f0,male> now which pie would we prefer and which pie do we think people who are hungry would prefer
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 950.16 953.33 <o,f0,male> here 's how all of this impacts the big picture
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 953.78 960.96 <o,f0,male> i said that charitable giving is two percent of gdp in the united states that 's about three hundred billion dollars a year but
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 960.96 973.92 <o,f0,male> only about twenty percent of that or sixty billion dollars goes to health and human services causes the rest goes to religion and higher education and hospitals and that sixty billion dollars is not nearly enough to tackle these problems
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 974.16 983.37 <o,f0,male> but if we could move charitable giving from two percent of gdp up just one step to three percent of gdp
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 983.37 985.14 <o,f0,male> by investing in that growth
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 985.16 1000.77 <o,f0,male> that would be an extra one hundred and fifty billion dollars a year in contributions and if that money could go disproportionately to health and human services charities because those were the ones we encouraged to invest in their growth that would represent a tripling of contributions to that sector
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 1001.06 1005.45 <o,f0,male> now we 're talking scale now we 're talking the potential for real change
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 1005.95 1014.98 <o,f0,male> but it 's never going to happen by forcing these organizations to lower their horizons to the demoralizing objective of keeping their overhead low
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 1016.94 1022.74 <o,f0,male> our generation does not want its epitaph to read we kept charity overhead low
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 1042.33 1059.14 <o,f0,male> ask about the scale of their dreams their apple google amazon scale dreams how they measure their progress toward those dreams and what resources they need to make them come true regardless of what the overhead is who cares what the overhead is if these problems are actually getting solved
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 1060.11 1071.4 <o,f0,male> if we can have that kind of generosity a generosity of thought then the non profit sector can play a massive role in changing the world for all those citizens
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 1071.69 1074.22 <o,f0,male> most desperately in need of it to change
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 1077.6 1080.96 <o,f0,male> and if that can be our generation 's enduring legacy
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 1082.18 1084.5 <o,f0,male> that we took responsibility
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 1085.37 1097.1 <o,f0,male> for the thinking that had been handed down to us that we revisited it we revised it and we reinvented the whole way humanity thinks about changing things forever for everyone
DanPallotta_2013 1 DanPallotta_2013 1097.8 1102.22 <o,f0,male> well i thought i would let the kids sum up what that would be
