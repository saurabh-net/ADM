KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 16.48 22.91 <o,f0,female> so a funny thing happened on my way to becoming a brilliant world class neuropsychologist
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 23.47 24.84 <o,f0,female> i had a baby
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 25.44 39.14 <o,f0,female> that's not to say i ever went on to become a brilliant world class neuropsychologist sorry ted but i did go on to be a reasonably astute arguably world class worrier
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 39.94 51.25 <o,f0,female> one of my girlfriends in graduate school marie said kim i figured it out it's not that you're more neurotic than everyone else it's just that you're more honest about how neurotic you are
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 51.64 57.48 <o,f0,female> so in the spirit of full disclosure i brought some pictures to share awwww
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 59.44 61.60 <o,f0,female> i'll just say july
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 67.50 67.88 <o,f0,male> zzzzzzip
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 69.39 76.34 <o,f0,female> for safety water wings an inch of water
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 77.90 83.83 <o,f0,female> and then finally all suited up for the ninety minute drive to copper mountain so
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 84.46 90.75 <o,f0,female> get kind of a feel for this so my baby vander is eight years old now and
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 102.88 110.79 <o,f0,female> because this is what i do this is what i teach it's what i study it's what i treat and i know that kids get concussed every year
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 120.36 129.63 <o,f0,female> and so when kids sustain a concussion we talk about them getting dinged or getting their bell rung but what is it that we're really talking about let 's take
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 170.95 179.47 <o,f0,female> how many g 's close seventy two would it be crazy
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 179.60 191.14 <o,f0,female> to know one hundred and three g 's the average concussive impact is ninety five g 's now when the kid on the right doesn't get up
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 191.65 201.13 <o,f0,female> we know they've had a concussion but how about the kid on the left or the athlete that leaves the field of play how do we know if he or she has sustained a concussion
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 201.71 210.09 <o,f0,female> how do we know that legislation that would require that they be pulled from play cleared for return to play applies to them
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 210.85 220.99 <o,f0,female> the definition of concussion doesn't actually require a loss of consciousness it requires only a change in consciousness and that can be any one or a number of symptoms including
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 221.60 227.94 <o,f0,female> feeling foggy feeling dizzy hearing a ringing in your ear being more impulsive or hostile than usual
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 228.93 237.32 <o,f0,female> so given all of that and given how darn neurotic i am how do i get any sleep at all because i know our brains are
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 239.95 253.65 <o,f0,female> designed to recover from an injury if god forbid any of us left here tonight and sustained a concussion most of us would go on to fully recover inside of a couple hours to a couple of weeks
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 254.27 267.93 <o,f0,female> but kids are more vulnerable to brain injury in fact high school athletes are three times more likely to sustain catastrophic injuries relative even to their college age peers and it takes them longer to return to a symptom free baseline
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 270.82 273.31 <o,f0,female> first injury their risk for
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 273.89 281.32 <o,f0,female> injury is exponentially greater from there their risk for a third injury greater still and so on
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 283.24 290.56 <o,f0,female> really alarming part we don't fully understand the long term impact of multiple injuries
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 291.25 298.22 <o,f0,female> you guys may be familiar with this research that's coming out of the nfl in a nutshell this research suggests that
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 298.83 309.74 <o,f0,female> among retired nfl players with three or more career concussions the incidents of early onset dementing disease is much greater than it is for the general population
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 320.20 329.67 <o,f0,female> it weird that my forty six year old husband is forever losing his keys isn't it weird that my forty seven year old husband is forever losing the car
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 330.30 337.93 <o,f0,female> isn't it weird that my forty eight year old husband is forever losing his way home in the car from the driveway
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 338.49 349.49 <o,f0,female> so i may have forgotten to mention that my son is an only child so it's going to be really important that he be able to drive me around
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 352.53 364.38 <o,f0,female> so how do we guarantee the safety of our kids how can we one hundred percent guarantee the safety of our kids let me tell you what i've come up with
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 370.83 371.15 <o,f0,female> if
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 371.45 374.61 <o,f0,female> only my little boy 's right there and he 's like she 's not
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 377.79 383.45 <o,f0,female> so in all seriousness should my kid play football should your kid play football
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 383.70 394.38 <o,f0,female> i don't know but i do know there are three things you can do the first study up you have to be familiar with the issues we're talking about today
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 395.01 404.57 <o,f0,female> there are some great resources out there the cdc has a program heads up it's at cdc gov heads up is specific to concussion in kids
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 405.01 411.77 <o,f0,female> the second is a resource i'm personally really proud of we've just rolled this out in the last couple months co kids with brain injury
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 412.64 423.25 <o,f0,female> this is a great resource for student athletes teachers parents professionals athletic and coaching staff it's a great place to start if you have questions
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 424.22 427.89 <o,f0,female> the second thing is speak up just
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 428.45 438.02 <o,f0,female> ago a bill introduced by senator kefalas that would have required athletes kids under eighteen to wear a helmet when they're riding their bike died in committee
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 439.77 446.60 <o,f0,female> it died in large part because it lacked constituent buy in it lacked stakeholder traction
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 447.07 456.95 <o,f0,female> now i'm not here to tell you what kind of legislation you should or shouldn 't support but i am going to tell you that if it matters to you your legislators need to know
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 472.30 481.82 <o,f0,female> suit up wear a helmet the only way to prevent a bad outcome is to prevent that first injury from happening
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 492.81 506.69 <o,f0,female> and tom knows that that little bit of foam in a bike helmet can reduce the g force of impact by half now i thought that it was because i have this totally compelling helmet crusade right this epiphany of tom 's
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 507.20 515.05 <o,f0,female> as it turns out it occurred to tom that a twenty dollar helmet is a good way to protect one hundred thousand dollar graduate education
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 517.60 518.41 <o,f0,female> so
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 520.50 521.95 <o,f0,male> should vander play football
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 523.47 530.36 <o,f0,female> i can't say no but i can guarantee that every time he leaves the house that kid 's wearing a helmet
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 531.95 534.34 <o,f0,male> like to the car or
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 536.72 543.35 <o,f0,female> so whether athlete scholar over protected kid neurotic mom or otherwise
KimGorgens_2010X 1 KimGorgens_2010X 543.68 550.26 <o,f0,female> here 's my baby vander reminding you to mind your matter
