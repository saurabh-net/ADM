DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 15.93 32.23 <o,f0,female> go to parties it doesn 't usually take very long for people to find out that i 'm a scientist and i study sex and then i get asked questions and the questions usually have a very particular format they start with the phrase
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 32.23 36.92 <o,f0,female> a friend told me and then they end with the phrase is this true
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 37.18 56.81 <o,f0,female> and most of the time i 'm glad to say that i can answer them but sometimes i have to say i 'm really sorry but i don 't know because i 'm not that kind of a doctor that is i 'm not a clinician i 'm a comparative biologist who studies anatomy and my job is to look at lots of different species of animals
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 56.81 72.45 <o,f0,female> and try to figure out how their tissues and organs work when everything 's going right rather than trying to figure out how to fix things when they go wrong like so many of you and what i do is i look for similarities and differences in the solutions that they 've evolved for fundamental biological problems
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 72.45 90.8 <o,f0,female> so today i 'm here to argue that this is not at all an esoteric ivory tower activity that we find at our universities but that broad study across species tissue types and organ systems can produce insights that have direct implications for human health
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 90.8 102.68 <o,f0,female> and this is true both of my recent project on sex differences in the brain and my more mature work on the anatomy and function of penises and now you know why i 'm fun at parties
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 113.68 125.66 <o,f0,female> now i 'm sure as everyone in the audience already knows i did have to explain it to my nine year old late last week penises are structures that transfer sperm from one individual to another
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 125.66 141.9 <o,f0,female> and the slide behind me barely scratches the surface of how widespread they are in animals there 's an enormous amount of anatomical variation you find muscular tubes modified legs modified fins as well as the mammalian fleshy inflatable cylinder that we 're all familiar with
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 146.67 159.61 <o,f0,female> and i think we see this tremendous variation because it 's a really effective solution to a very basic biological problem and that is getting sperm in a position to meet up with eggs and form zygotes
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 159.61 168.1 <o,f0,female> now the penis isn 't actually required for internal fertiliztion but when internal fertilization evolves penises often follow
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 168.1 175.55 <o,f0,female> and the question i get when i start talking about this most often is what made you interested in this subject
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 175.55 179.38 <o,f0,female> and the answer is skeletons
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 179.38 197.44 <o,f0,female> you wouldn 't think that skeletons and penises have very much to do with one another and that 's because we tend to think of skeletons as stiff lever systems that produce speed or power and my first forays into biological research doing dinosaur paleontology as an undergraduate were really squarely in that realm
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 197.44 216.84 <o,f0,female> but when i went to graduate school to study biomechanics i really wanted to find a dissertation project that would expand our knowledge of skeletal function i tried a bunch of different stuff a lot of it didn 't pan out but then one day i started thinking about the mammalian penis and it 's really an odd sort of structure
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 216.84 222.78 <o,f0,female> before it can be used for internal fertilization its mechanical behavior has to change in a really dramatic fashion
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 222.79 233.42 <o,f0,female> most of the time it 's a flexible organ it 's easy to bend but before it 's brought into use during copulation it has to become rigid it has to become difficult to bend
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 233.42 250.53 <o,f0,female> and moreover it has to work a reproductive system that fails to function produces an individual that has no offspring and that individual is then kicked out of the gene pool and so i thought here 's a problem that just cries out for a skeletal system
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 250.53 253.75 <o,f0,female> not one like this one
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 253.75 257.22 <o,f0,female> but one like this one
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 257.22 263.94 <o,f0,female> because functionally a skeleton is any system that supports tissue and transmits forces
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 263.94 277.84 <o,f0,female> and i already knew that animals like this earthworm indeed most animals don 't support their tissues by draping them over bones instead they 're more like reinforced water balloons they use a skeleton that we call a hydrostatic skeleton
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 277.84 293.91 <o,f0,female> and a hydrostatic skeleton uses two elements the skeletal support comes from an interaction between a pressurized fluid and a surrounding wall of tissue that 's held in tension and reinforced with fibrous proteins and the interaction is crucial
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 293.91 303.62 <o,f0,female> without both elements you have no support if you have fluid with no wall to surround it and keep pressure up you have a puddle
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 303.62 309.47 <o,f0,female> and if you have just the wall with no fluid inside of it to put the wall in tension you 've got a little wet rag
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 309.47 313.19 <o,f0,female> when you look at a penis in cross section
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 328.39 343.87 <o,f0,female> but at the time when i started this project the best explanation i could find for penal erection was that the wall surrounded these spongy tissues and the spongy tissues filled with blood and pressure rose and voila it became erect
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 343.87 361.09 <o,f0,female> and that explained to me expansion made sense more fluid you get tissues that expand but it didn 't actually explain erection because there was no mechanism in this explanation for making this structure hard to bend
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 361.09 370.58 <o,f0,female> and no one had systematically looked at the wall tissue so i thought wall tissue 's important in skeletons it has to be part of the explanation and this was the
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 387.93 407.36 <o,f0,female> so he sat me down and he warned me he was like be careful going down this path i 'm not sure this project 's going to pan out because he was afraid i was walking into a trap i was taking on a socially embarrassing question with an answer that he thought might not be particularly interesting
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 407.37 415.25 <o,f0,female> and that was because every hydrostatic skeleton that we had found in nature up to that point had the same basic elements it had the central fluid
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 415.25 429.56 <o,f0,female> it had the surrounding wall and the reinforcing fibers in the wall were arranged in crossed helices around the long axis of the skeleton so the image behind me shows a piece of tissue in one of these cross helical skeletons
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 450.64 459.4 <o,f0,female> and these skeletons have a particular set of behaviors which i 'm going to demonstrate in a film it 's a model skeleton that i made out of a piece of cloth
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 467.11 477.74 <o,f0,female> and those fibers can reorient as the skeleton moves which means the skeleton 's flexible it lengthens shortens and bends really easily in response to internal or external forces
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 477.74 496.9 <o,f0,female> now my adviser 's concern was what if the penile wall tissue is just the same as any other hydrostatic skeleton what are you going to contribute what new thing are you contributing to our knowledge of biology and i thought yeah he does have a really good point here so i spent a long long time thinking about it and one thing kept bothering me and
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 528.77 548.73 <o,f0,female> i was really surprised at this everyone i showed it was really surprised at this why was everyone surprised at this that 's because we knew theoretically that there was another way of arranging fibers in a hydrostatic skeleton and that was with fibers at zero degrees and ninety degrees to the long axis of the structure
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 548.73 555.39 <o,f0,female> the thing is no one had ever seen it before in nature and now i was
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 574.7 581.84 <o,f0,female> and you 'll see that unlike the cross helical model this model resists extension and contraction and resists bending
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 581.84 593.51 <o,f0,female> now what that tells us is that wall tissues are doing so much more than just covering the vascular tissues they 're an integral part of the penile skeleton if the wall around the erectile tissue wasn 't there
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 601.17 617.16 <o,f0,female> it 's an observation with obvious medical applications in humans as well but it 's also relevant in a broad sense i think to the design of prosthetics soft robots basically anything where changes of shape and stiffness are important so to sum up
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 617.16 625.9 <o,f0,female> twenty years ago i had a college adviser tell me when i went to the college and said i 'm kind of interested in anatomy they said anatomy 's a dead science
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 625.9 639.7 <o,f0,female> he couldn 't have been more wrong i really believe that we still have a lot to learn about the normal structure and function of our bodies not just about its genetics and molecular biology but up here in the meat end of the scale
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 639.7 652.67 <o,f0,female> we 've got limits on our time we often focus on one disease one model one problem but my experience suggests that we should take the time to apply ideas broadly between systems and just see where it takes us
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 652.67 660.35 <o,f0,female> after all if ideas about invertebrate skeletons can give us insights about mammalian reproductive systems
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 660.35 667.67 <o,f0,female> there could be lots of other wild and productive connections lurking out there just waiting to be found thank you
