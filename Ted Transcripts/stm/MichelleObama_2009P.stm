MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 45.26 55.41 <o,f0,female> not only on the relationship between governments but the common language and the values that we share and i'm reminded of that by watching you all today
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 56.99 69.40 <o,f0,female> during my visit i've been especially honored to meet some of britain 's most extraordinary women women who are paving the way for all of you and i'm honored to meet you

MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 75.36 87.69 <o,f0,female> and although the circumstances of our lives may seem very distant with me standing here as the first lady of the united states of america and you just getting through school
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 88.20 95.40 <o,f0,female> i want you to know that we have very much in common for nothing in my life 's path
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 96.26 103.18 <o,f0,female> would have predicted that i'd be standing here as the first african american first lady of the united states of america
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 103.67 105.51 <o,f0,female> there is nothing in my story
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 105.94 114.15 <o,f0,female> that would land me here i wasn't raised with wealth or resources or any social standing to speak of
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 115.28 121.14 <o,f0,female> i was raised on the south side of chicago that's the real part of chicago
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 122.57 125.31 <o,f0,female> and i was the product of a working class community
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 125.78 135.84 <o,f0,female> my father was a city worker all of his life and my mother was a stay at home mom and she stayed at home to take care of me and my older brother
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 136.80 143.93 <o,f0,female> neither of them attended university my dad was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in the prime of his life
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 144.63 154.62 <o,f0,female> but even as it got harder for him to walk and get dressed in the morning i saw him struggle more and more my father never complained about his struggle
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 155.23 165.52 <o,f0,female> he was grateful for what he had he just woke up a little earlier and worked a little harder and my brother and i were raised with all that you really need
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 166.31 175.96 <o,f0,female> love strong values and a belief that with a good education and a whole lot of hard work that there was nothing that we could not do
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 177.16 179.93 <o,f0,female> i am an example of what's possible
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 180.68 188.53 <o,f0,female> when girls from the very beginning of their lives are loved and nurtured by the people around them
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 189.32 202.42 <o,f0,female> i was surrounded by extraordinary women in my life grandmothers teachers aunts cousins neighbors who taught me about quiet strength and dignity
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 203.02 213.35 <o,f0,female> and my mother the most important role model in my life who lives with us at the white house and helps to care for our two little daughters malia and sasha
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 214.55 225.18 <o,f0,female> she's an active presence in their lives as well as mine and is instilling in them the same values that she taught me and my brother things like compassion
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 236.62 244.27 <o,f0,female> i was also fortunate enough to be cherished and encouraged by some strong male role models as well
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 245.40 252.88 <o,f0,female> my father my brother uncles and grandfathers the men in my life taught me some important things as well
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 253.46 259.94 <o,f0,female> they taught me about what a respectful relationship should look like between men and women
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 260.47 270.70 <o,f0,female> they taught me about what a strong marriage feels like that it's built on faith and commitment and an admiration for each other 's unique gifts
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 271.37 281.78 <o,f0,female> they taught me about what it means to be a father and to raise a family and not only to invest in your own home but to reach out and help
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 283.18 292.52 <o,f0,female> raise kids in the broader community and these were the same qualities that i looked for in my own husband barack obama
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 294.05 303.85 <o,f0,female> and when we first met one of the things that i remember is that he took me out on a date and his date was to go with him to a community meeting
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 305.33 305.92 <o,f0,female> i know
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 310.45 313.97 <o,f0,female> but when we met barack was a community organizer he worked
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 320.74 330.04 <o,f0,female> as he talked to the residents in that community center he talked about two concepts he talked about the world as it is and the world as it should be
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 331.14 338.27 <o,f0,female> and i talked about this throughout the entire campaign what he said that all too often is that we accept
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 339.19 348.97 <o,f0,female> the distance between those two ideas and sometimes we settle for the world as it is even when it doesn't reflect our values and aspirations
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 349.95 358.38 <o,f0,female> but barack reminded us on that day all of us in that room that we all know what our world should look like
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 360.09 364.55 <o,f0,female> we know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like we all know
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 365.43 378.80 <o,f0,female> and he urged the people in that meeting in that community to devote themselves to closing the gap between those two ideas to work together to try to make the world as it is and the world as it should be
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 379.42 388.98 <o,f0,female> one and the same and i think about that today because i am reminded and convinced that all of you in this school
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 389.45 397.57 <o,f0,female> are very important parts of closing that gap you are the women who will build the world as it should be
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 398.65 406.54 <o,f0,female> you're going to write the next chapter in history not just for yourselves but for your generation and generations to come
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 407.85 411.18 <o,f0,female> and that's why getting a good education is so important
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 411.75 414.07 <o,f0,female> that's why all of this that you're going through
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 414.51 420.88 <o,f0,female> the ups and the downs the teachers that you love and the teachers that you don't why it's so important
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 421.43 429.32 <o,f0,female> because communities and countries and ultimately the world are only as strong as the health of their women
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 438.46 448.05 <o,f0,female> the difference between a struggling family and a healthy one is often the presence of an empowered woman or women at the center of that family
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 448.49 460.08 <o,f0,female> the difference between a broken community and a thriving one is often the healthy respect between men and women who appreciate the contributions each other makes to society
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 460.98 471.70 <o,f0,female> the difference between a languishing nation and one that will flourish is the recognition that we need equal access to education for both boys and girls
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 472.33 479.99 <o,f0,female> and this school named after the u k s first female doctor and the surrounding buildings named for mexican artist

MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 497.08 506.88 <o,f0,female> their passions to feed their own souls they allowed for no obstacles as the sign said back there without limitations
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 507.52 511.87 <o,f0,female> they knew no other way to live than to follow their dreams
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 512.73 514.22 <o,f0,female> and having done so
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 514.77 516.11 <o,f0,female> these women
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 517.59 519.36 <o,f0,female> moved many obstacles
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 519.88 529.29 <o,f0,female> and they opened many new doors for millions of female doctors and nurses and artists and authors all of whom have followed them
MichelleObama_2009P 1 MichelleObama_2009P 530.13 532.53 <o,f0,female> and by getting a good education
