LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 16.50 28.77 <o,f0,female> who are we that is the big question and essentially we are just an upright walking big brained super intelligent ape this could be
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 29.66 31.68 <o,f0,female> we belong to the family called the hominidae
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 32.63 39.19 <o,f0,female> we are the species called homo sapiens sapiens and it's important to remember that
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 39.78 47.57 <o,f0,female> in terms of our place in the world today and our future on planet earth we are one species
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 48.78 54.61 <o,f0,female> of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet earth today
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 55.17 63.29 <o,f0,female> and that's just a tiny fraction of all species that have ever lived on the planet in past times we're one species out of
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 75.97 77.00 <o,f0,female> planet earth today
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 77.45 85.80 <o,f0,female> except for the bonobos and it's important to remember that because the bonobos are so human and they share ninety nine percent of their genes
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 86.26 93.56 <o,f0,female> and we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes it's important to remember
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 93.82 102.68 <o,f0,female> that we evolved now i know that's a dirty word for some people but we evolved from common ancestors with the gorillas
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 104.06 105.54 <o,f0,female> the chimpanzee
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 106.59 108.86 <o,f0,female> and also the bonobos
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 112.14 120.94 <o,f0,female> we have a common past and we have a common future and it is important to remember that all of these great apes
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 121.75 127.57 <o,f0,female> have come on as long and as an interesting evolutionary journey as we ourselves have
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 128.16 138.25 <o,f0,female> today and it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity and it's this journey that has been the focus of the past three generations of my family
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 138.59 145.29 <o,f0,female> as we've been in east africa looking for the fossil remains of our ancestors to try and piece together our
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 146.76 155.38 <o,f0,female> and this is how we look for them a group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly out across vast areas
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 155.99 163.46 <o,f0,female> of africa looking for small fragments of bone fossil bone that may be on the surface
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 163.79 170.80 <o,f0,female> that's an example of what we may do as we walk across the landscape in northern kenya looking for fossils
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 172.39 184.27 <o,f0,female> many of you in the audience can see the fossil that's in this picture but if you look very carefully there is a jaw lower jaw of a four point one million year old upright walking ape as it was found
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 184.65 186.38 <o,f0,female> at lake turkana on the west side
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 189.74 194.45 <o,f0,female> it's extremely time consuming labor intensive and it is something that
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 195.23 203.07 <o,f0,female> a lot more people to begin to piece together our past we still really haven't got a very complete picture of it
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 203.93 212.46 <o,f0,female> we find a fossil we mark it today we've got great technology we have gps we mark it with a gps fix and we also take
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 213.16 224.84 <o,f0,female> digital photograph of the specimen so we could essentially put it back on the surface exactly where we found it and we can bring all this information into big gis packages today
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 225.82 233.26 <o,f0,female> when we then find something very important like the bones of a human ancestor we begin to excavate it extremely
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 233.89 240.54 <o,f0,female> and slowly using dental picks and fine paintbrushes and all the sediment is then put through these screens
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 240.88 249.72 <o,f0,female> and where we go again through it very carefully looking for small bone fragments and it's then washed and these things are so exciting they are so often
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 250.38 257.47 <o,f0,female> the only or the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains and here 's a very special moment when
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 257.89 262.08 <o,f0,female> my mother and myself were digging up some remains
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 263.32 268.68 <o,f0,female> human ancestors and it is one of the most special things to ever do with your mother
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 273.36 278.88 <o,f0,female> not many people can say that but now let me take you back to africa
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 280.35 281.78 <o,f0,female> two million years ago
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 282.32 289.70 <o,f0,female> i'd just like to point out if you look at the map of africa it does actually look like a hominid skull
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 290.59 291.39 <o,f0,female> in its shape
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 296.01 305.80 <o,f0,female> now we're going to go to the east african and the rift valley it essentially runs up from the gulf of aden or runs down to lake malawi
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 306.78 317.86 <o,f0,female> and the rift valley is a depression it's a basin and rivers flow down from the highlands into the basin carrying sediment preserving
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 318.13 326.11 <o,f0,female> the bones of animals that lived there if you want to become a fossil you actually need to die somewhere where your bones will be rapidly buried you then
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 326.48 336.08 <o,f0,female> that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface and then you hope that one of us lot will walk around and find small pieces of
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 337.85 342.39 <o,f0,female> so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much as we do know today
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 342.72 352.87 <o,f0,female> about our ancestors because it's incredibly difficult a for these things to become to be preserved and secondly for them to have been brought back up to the surface and we really
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 368.42 375.32 <o,f0,female> north here there's a big river that flows into the lake that's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains of the animals that lived there
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 375.67 386.75 <o,f0,female> fossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin which represents some twenty thousand square miles that's a huge job that we've got on our hands
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 388.13 394.64 <o,f0,female> two million years ago at lake turkana homo erectus one of our human ancestors actually lived
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 394.83 402.60 <o,f0,female> in this region you can see some of the major fossil sites that we've been working in the north but essentially two million years ago
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 405.04 410.99 <o,f0,female> in the far right corner lived alongside three other species of
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 414.86 418.27 <o,f0,female> and here is a skull of a homo erectus which i just
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 424.03 425.07 <o,f0,female> but it is not
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 426.89 432.52 <o,f0,female> being a single species on planet earth is the norm in fact if you go back in time it is
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 433.39 441.45 <o,f0,female> that there are multiple species of hominids or of human ancestors that coexist at any one time where did these things come from
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 442.11 450.00 <o,f0,female> that's what we're still trying to find answers to and it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species and
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 460.63 461.76 <o,f0,female> that have been found
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 462.63 473.60 <o,f0,female> from lake turkana but i was very lucky to have been brought up in kenya essentially accompanying my parents to lake turkana in search of human remains and we were able
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 474.05 479.75 <o,f0,female> to dig up when we got old enough fossils such as this a slender snouted crocodile
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 480.93 486.20 <o,f0,female> and we dug up giant tortoises and elephants and things like that but when i was twelve as i was in this
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 487.04 492.72 <o,f0,female> a very exciting expedition was in place on the west side when they found essentially
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 493.59 494.27 <o,f0,female> skeleton
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 497.89 503.93 <o,f0,female> i could relate to this homo erectus skeleton very well because i was the same age that
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 504.29 505.74 <o,f0,female> he was when he died
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 508.23 510.32 <o,f0,female> him to be
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 511.43 525.26 <o,f0,female> dark skinned his brothers certainly were able to run long distances chasing prey probably sweating heavily as they did so he was very able to use stones effectively as tools and
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 525.69 532.84 <o,f0,female> this individual himself this one that i'm holding up here actually had a bad back he'd probably had an injury as a child
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 533.84 544.91 <o,f0,female> he had a scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after quite carefully by other female and probably much smaller members of his family group to have got to where he did
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 545.82 559.20 <o,f0,female> in life age twelve unfortunately for him he fell into a swamp and couldn't get out essentially his bones were rapidly buried and beautifully preserved and he remained there
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 560.09 569.08 <o,f0,female> until one point six million years later when this very famous fossil hunter kamoya kimeu walked along a small hillside
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 569.35 578.22 <o,f0,female> and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface amongst the pebbles recognized it as being hominid
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 584.36 591.52 <o,f0,female> was begun immediately and more and more little bits of skull started to be extracted from the sediment
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 591.70 598.69 <o,f0,female> and what was so fun about it was this the skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 599.48 602.45 <o,f0,female> and fairly recently the tree had grown up
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 603.26 614.38 <o,f0,female> that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside and so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this holding it in place and preventing it from washing away down slope
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 615.46 622.73 <o,f0,female> we began to find limb bones we found finger bones the bones of the pelvis vertebrae ribs
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 624.75 626.38 <o,f0,female> ever been seen before
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 627.22 633.97 <o,f0,female> in homo erectus it was truly exciting he had a body very similar to our own
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 634.85 638.29 <o,f0,female> he was on the threshold of becoming human
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 639.60 644.59 <o,f0,female> well shortly afterwards members of his species started to move northwards
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 644.88 651.37 <o,f0,female> out of africa and you start to see fossils of homo erectus in georgia china
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 652.08 654.48 <o,f0,female> and also in parts of indonesia
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 654.82 655.74 <o,f0,female> so homo erectus was
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 657.32 662.08 <o,f0,female> human ancestor to leave africa and begin its spread across the globe
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 664.48 676.71 <o,f0,female> some exciting finds again as i mentioned from dmanisi in the republic of georgia but also surprising finds recently announced from the island of flores in indonesia where a group of these
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 679.92 686.52 <o,f0,female> and have become dwarfed and they're only about a meter in height but they lived only eighteen thousand years ago
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 687.44 690.69 <o,f0,female> and that is truly extraordinary to think about
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 700.72 703.60 <o,f0,female> we evolved essentially from an african stock again
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 704.90 718.58 <o,f0,female> about two hundred thousand years as a fully fledged us and we only left africa about seventy thousand years ago and until thirty thousand years ago at least three upright walking apes shared the
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 720.38 729.70 <o,f0,female> the question now is well who are we we're certainly a polluting wasteful aggressive species with a few nice things thrown in
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 730.16 731.24 <o,f0,female> perhaps
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 742.66 751.32 <o,f0,female> is this a good evolutionary adaptation or is it going to lead us to being the shortest lived hominid species on planet earth
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 752.15 762.26 <o,f0,female> what is it that really makes us us i think it's our collective intelligence it's our ability to write things down our language and our consciousness
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 764.43 770.77 <o,f0,female> from very primitive beginnings with a very crude toolkit of stones we now have a
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 800.48 801.55 <o,f0,female> has reminded us
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 803.05 811.94 <o,f0,female> have reached extraordinary numbers of people on this planet human ancestors really only survive on planet earth if you look at the
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 812.47 820.43 <o,f0,female> fossil record for about on average a million years at a time we've only been around for the past two hundred thousand years as a species yet
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 820.72 831.05 <o,f0,female> we've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people and last year our population grew by eighty million i mean these are extraordinary numbers
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 831.71 842.02 <o,f0,female> you can see here again taken from al gore 's book but what's happened is our technology has removed the checks and balances on our population growth
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 842.98 851.54 <o,f0,female> we have to control our numbers and i think this is as important as anything else that's being done in the world today but we have to control our numbers because we
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 852.41 854.61 <o,f0,female> really hold it together as a species
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 856.03 865.11 <o,f0,female> my father so appropriately put it that we are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices that are bad for our survival as a species
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 865.76 867.67 <o,f0,female> can we hold it together
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 870.99 877.88 <o,f0,female> it's important to remember that we all evolved in africa we all have an african origin
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 878.80 882.36 <o,f0,female> we have a common past and we share a common future
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 884.08 885.83 <o,f0,female> speaking we're just a
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 887.69 891.22 <o,f0,female> sitting on the edge of a precipice and we have
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 894.05 895.41 <o,f0,female> and the technology
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 895.91 901.44 <o,f0,female> our hands to communicate what needs to be done to hold it together today
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 902.95 907.58 <o,f0,female> we could tell every single human being out there if we really wanted to but will we do that
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 908.52 911.23 <o,f0,female> or will we just let nature take its course
LouiseLeakey_2008 1 LouiseLeakey_2008 912.67 922.61 <o,f0,female> well to end on a very positive note i think evolutionarily speaking this is probably a fairly good thing in the end i'll leave it at that thank you very much
