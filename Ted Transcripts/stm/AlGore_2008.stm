AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 16.15 17.34 <o,f0,male> i have given
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 18.17 29.58 <o,f0,male> the slide show that i gave here two years ago about two thousand times i'm giving a short slide show this morning that i'm giving for the very first time
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 114.50 117.89 <o,f0,male> on our house and dug the geothermal wells and did all of that
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 118.75 119.71 <o,f0,male> other stuff
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 120.63 128.99 <o,f0,male> but as important as it is to change the light bulbs it is more important to change the laws and when we
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 137.55 138.45 <o,f0,male> in order
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 139.04 148.05 <o,f0,male> to be optimistic about this we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy in
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 196.30 210.00 <o,f0,male> many years ago when i was a young congressman i spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge of nuclear arms control the nuclear arms race and the military historians taught me during that quest
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 211.47 214.23 <o,f0,male> that military conflicts are typically
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 214.79 216.62 <o,f0,male> put into three categories
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 217.51 218.52 <o,f0,male> local battles
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 219.90 221.71 <o,f0,male> regional or theater wars
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 222.49 226.39 <o,f0,male> and the rare but all important global world war
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 237.24 250.16 <o,f0,male> a different organizational model environmental challenges fall into the same three categories and most of what we think about are local environmental problems air pollution water pollution hazardous waste dumps
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 250.66 260.26 <o,f0,male> but there are also regional environmental problems like acid rain from the midwest to the northeast and from western europe to the arctic and
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 491.11 495.55 <o,f0,male> not because venus is slightly closer to the sun it's three times hotter than mercury which is right next to the
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 955.13 957.51 <o,f0,male> you've seen this slide before but there's a change
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 959.57 964.14 <o,f0,male> the only two countries that didn't ratify and now there's only one
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1045.45 1047.23 <o,f0,male> heard a couple of days ago
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1047.94 1050.44 <o,f0,male> about the value of
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1072.83 1075.27 <o,f0,male> have to somehow understand
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1076.44 1081.78 <o,f0,male> that history has presented us with a choice
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1087.55 1090.10 <o,f0,male> figuring out how to save her life
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1091.11 1092.97 <o,f0,male> while she was distracted
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1093.76 1096.90 <o,f0,male> by the amazing experience that she was going through
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1097.83 1100.28 <o,f0,male> we now have a culture of distraction
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1101.71 1104.23 <o,f0,male> but we have a planetary emergency
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1105.65 1107.82 <o,f0,male> and we have to find a way
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1108.32 1118.31 <o,f0,male> to create in the generation of those alive today a sense of generational mission i wish i could find the words to convey this
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1120.42 1122.34 <o,f0,male> this was another hero generation
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1123.61 1126.14 <o,f0,male> that brought democracy to the planet
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1127.68 1129.89 <o,f0,male> another that ended slavery
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1134.98 1135.86 <o,f0,male> we can do this
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1169.58 1170.92 <o,f0,male> have the capacity
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1172.18 1174.01 <o,f0,male> at moments of great challenge
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1174.81 1182.66 <o,f0,male> to set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge that history is presenting to us
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1187.68 1189.29 <o,f0,male> sometimes i hear people
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1196.58 1199.06 <o,f0,male> by saying oh this is so terrible
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1200.25 1201.54 <o,f0,male> what a burden we have
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1203.20 1205.53 <o,f0,male> i would like to ask you to re frame that
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1212.48 1213.93 <o,f0,male> had the opportunity
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1215.78 1217.82 <o,f0,male> to rise to a challenge
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1219.32 1222.43 <o,f0,male> that is worthy of our best efforts
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1226.53 1228.68 <o,f0,male> challenge that can pull from us
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1229.95 1232.06 <o,f0,male> more than we knew we could do
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1234.64 1242.34 <o,f0,male> i think we ought to approach this challenge with a sense of profound joy and gratitude
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1243.48 1245.57 <o,f0,male> that we are the generation
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1246.91 1250.22 <o,f0,male> about which a thousand years from now
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1254.66 1256.43 <o,f0,male> and poets and singers
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1257.64 1261.34 <o,f0,male> will celebrate by saying they were the ones
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1300.04 1309.88 <o,f0,male> so many people at ted there is deep pain that basically a design issue at the end of the day a design issue on a voting form
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1310.34 1317.62 <o,f0,male> one bad design issue meant that your voice wasn't being heard like that in the last eight years in a position where you could make these things come true
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1321.23 1322.49 <o,f0,male> you have no idea
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1328.13 1331.78 <o,f0,male> when you look at what the leading candidates in your own party are doing now i mean
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1332.94 1336.42 <o,f0,male> are you excited by their plans on global
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1345.56 1355.05 <o,f0,male> the answer to the question is hard for me because on the one hand i think that we should feel
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1356.49 1357.91 <o,f0,male> really great about the fact
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1358.96 1360.34 <o,f0,male> that the
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1374.82 1386.36 <o,f0,male> and forward leaning position on the climate crisis all three have offered leadership and all three are very different from the approach taken by the current administration
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1386.77 1395.80 <o,f0,male> and i think that all three have also been responsible in putting forward plans and proposals
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1399.96 1400.51 <o,f0,male> the
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1401.06 1407.78 <o,f0,male> campaign dialogue that as illustrated by the questions that was put together by the league of conservation voters by the way the analysis of all the questions
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1408.08 1415.61 <o,f0,male> and by the way the debates have all been sponsored by something that goes by the orwellian label clean coal
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1418.90 1424.05 <o,f0,male> every single debate has been sponsored by clean coal now even lower emissions
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1425.35 1432.72 <o,f0,male> the richness and fullness of the dialogue in our democracy has not laid the basis for the kind of bold
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1433.50 1442.04 <o,f0,male> that is really needed so they're saying the right things and they may whichever of them is elected may do the right thing but let me tell you
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1456.86 1461.50 <o,f0,male> only one out of one hundred senators was willing to vote to confirm
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1462.33 1464.57 <o,f0,male> to ratify that treaty
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1465.32 1467.58 <o,f0,male> whatever the candidates say
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1468.32 1471.60 <o,f0,male> has to be laid alongside what the people say
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1472.69 1481.19 <o,f0,male> this challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization co two is the exhaling breath of our civilization literally
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1481.57 1488.17 <o,f0,male> and now we mechanized that process changing that pattern requires a scope
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1488.84 1497.23 <o,f0,male> a scale a speed of change that is beyond what we have done in the past so that's why i began by saying
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1498.25 1506.67 <o,f0,male> be optimistic in what you do but be an active citizen demand change the light bulbs but change the laws
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1507.00 1512.89 <o,f0,male> change the global treaties we have to speak up we have to solve this democracy
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1515.38 1524.05 <o,f0,male> this we have sclerosis in our democracy and we have to change that use the internet go on the internet
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1524.73 1530.07 <o,f0,male> connect with people become very active as citizens have a moratorium we shouldn 't have any new
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1536.62 1548.76 <o,f0,male> we have to quickly build these renewable sources now nobody is talking on that scale but i do believe that between now and november it is possible this alliance for climate protection
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1550.21 1561.24 <o,f0,male> launch a nationwide campaign grassroots mobilization television ads internet ads radio newspaper with partnerships with everybody from the girl scouts to the hunters and fishermen
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1562.14 1563.16 <o,f0,male> we need help
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1567.05 1571.37 <o,f0,male> your own personal role going forward al is there something more than that you would like to be doing
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1572.26 1575.06 <o,f0,male> i have prayed that
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1577.54 1579.84 <o,f0,male> would be able to find the answer
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1596.29 1600.88 <o,f0,male> it does depend on all of us but again not just with the light bulbs
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1603.59 1604.89 <o,f0,male> most of us here
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1605.47 1606.65 <o,f0,male> are americans
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1607.73 1609.15 <o,f0,male> we have a democracy
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1610.67 1615.04 <o,f0,male> we can change things but we have to actively change
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1615.78 1617.66 <o,f0,male> what's needed really is
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1618.30 1620.49 <o,f0,male> a higher level of consciousness
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1621.38 1625.68 <o,f0,male> and that's hard to that's hard to create but it is coming
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1633.77 1636.25 <o,f0,male> if you want to go far go together
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1637.94 1638.96 <o,f0,male> we have to go far
AlGore_2008 1 AlGore_2008 1656.53 1658.35 <o,f0,male> thank you so much for coming to ted
