BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 19.75 32.35 <o,f0,male> when i first began recording wild soundscapes forty five years ago i had no idea that ants insect larvae sea anemones and viruses created a sound signature
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 32.35 41.6 <o,f0,male> but they do and so does every wild habitat on the planet like the amazon rainforest you 're hearing behind me in fact
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 41.6 51.81 <o,f0,male> temperate and tropical rainforests each produce a vibrant animal orchestra that instantaneous and organized expression of insects
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 51.81 68.64 <o,f0,male> reptiles amphibians birds and mammals and every soundscape that springs from a wild habitat generates its own unique signature one that contains incredible amounts of information and it 's some of that information i want to share with you today
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 68.64 84.98 <o,f0,male> the soundscape is made up of three basic sources the first is the geophony or the nonbiological sounds that occur in any given habitat like wind in the trees water in a stream waves at the ocean shore movement of the earth
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 84.98 98.07 <o,f0,male> the second of these is the biophony the biophony is all of the sound that 's generated by organisms in a given habitat at one time and in one place
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 98.07 111.93 <o,f0,male> and the third is all of the sound that we humans generate that 's called anthrophony some of it is controlled like music or theater but most of it is chaotic and incoherent
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 111.93 115.39 <o,f0,male> which some of us refer to as noise
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 115.39 123.88 <o,f0,male> there was a time when i considered wild soundscapes to be a worthless artifact they were just there but they had no significance
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 123.88 138.28 <o,f0,male> well i was wrong what i learned from these encounters was that careful listening gives us incredibly valuable tools by which to evaluate the health of a habitat across the entire spectrum of life
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 158.59 173.51 <o,f0,male> to me this was a little like trying to understand the magnificence of beethoven 's fifth symphony by abstracting the sound of a single violin player out of the context of the orchestra and hearing just that one part
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 173.51 184.86 <o,f0,male> fortunately more and more institutions are implementing the more holistic models that i and a few of my colleagues have introduced to the field of soundscape ecology
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 184.86 200.45 <o,f0,male> when i began recording over four decades ago i could record for ten hours and capture one hour of usable material good enough for an album or a film soundtrack or a museum installation
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 200.45 213.36 <o,f0,male> now because of global warming resource extraction and human noise among many other factors it can take up to one thousand hours or more to capture the same thing
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 213.36 226.99 <o,f0,male> fully fifty percent of my archive comes from habitats so radically altered that they 're either altogether silent or can no longer be heard in any of their original form
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 226.99 237.1 <o,f0,male> the usual methods of evaluating a habitat have been done by visually counting the numbers of species and the numbers of individuals within each species in a given area
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 237.1 248.6 <o,f0,male> however by comparing data that ties together both density and diversity from what we hear i 'm able to arrive at much more precise fitness outcomes
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 248.6 267.82 <o,f0,male> and i want to show you some examples that typify the possibilities unlocked by diving into this universe this is lincoln meadow lincoln meadow 's a three and a half hour drive east of san francisco in the sierra nevada mountains at about two thousand meters altitude and i 've been recording there for many years
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 267.82 283.24 <o,f0,male> in one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight a logging company convinced local residents that there would be absolutely no environmental impact from a new method they were trying called selective logging taking out a tree here and there rather than clear cutting a whole area
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 283.24 298.31 <o,f0,male> with permission granted to record both before and after the operation i set up my gear and captured a large number of dawn choruses to very strict protocol and calibrated recordings because i wanted a really good baseline this is
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 345.52 365.35 <o,f0,male> well a year later i returned and using the same protocols and recording under the same conditions i recorded a number of examples of the same dawn choruses and now this is what we 've got this is after selective logging you can see that the stream is still represented in the bottom third of the page but notice what 's missing
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 365.35 368.23 <o,f0,male> in the top two thirds
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 373.94 377.43 <o,f0,male> coming up is the sound of a woodpecker
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 382.45 398.24 <o,f0,male> well i 've returned to lincoln meadow fifteen times in the last twenty five years and i can tell you that the biophony the density and diversity of that biophony has not yet returned to anything like it was before the operation
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 398.24 415.45 <o,f0,male> but here 's a picture of lincoln meadow taken after and you can see that from the perspective of the camera or the human eye hardly a stick or a tree appears to be out of place which would confirm the logging company 's contention that there 's nothing of environmental impact however
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 415.51 420.81 <o,f0,male> our ears tell us a very different story
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 420.81 427.78 <o,f0,male> young students are always asking me what these animals are saying and really i 've got no idea but i can
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 436.95 449.51 <o,f0,male> i was walking along the shore in alaska and i came across this tide pool filled with a colony of sea anemones these wonderful eating machines relatives of coral and jellyfish
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 449.51 456.47 <o,f0,male> and curious to see if any of them made any noise i dropped a hydrophone an underwater microphone covered in rubber
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 456.47 470.54 <o,f0,male> down the mouth part and immediately the critter began to absorb the microphone into its belly and the tentacles were searching out of the surface for something of nutritional value the static like sounds that are very low that you 're going to hear right now
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 475.4 480.91 <o,f0,male> yeah but watch when it didn 't find anything to eat
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 491.29 505.41 <o,f0,male> at the end of its breeding cycle the great basin spadefoot toad digs itself down about a meter under the hard panned desert soil of the american west where it can stay for many seasons until conditions are just right for it to emerge again
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 505.41 516.35 <o,f0,male> and when there 's enough moisture in the soil in the spring frogs will dig themselves to the surface and gather around these large vernal pools in great numbers
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 516.35 526.06 <o,f0,male> and they vocalize in a chorus that 's absolutely in sync with one another and they do that for two reasons the first is
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 526.06 540.43 <o,f0,male> competitive because they 're looking for mates and the second is cooperative because if they 're all vocalizing in sync together it makes it really difficult for predators like coyotes foxes and owls to single out any individual for a meal
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 540.43 546.1 <o,f0,male> this is a spectrogram of what the frog chorusing looks like when it 's in a very healthy pattern
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 562.18 580.56 <o,f0,male> and it 's a favorite habitat of these toads and it 's also favored by u s navy jet pilots who train in their fighters flying them at speeds exceeding one thousand one hundred kilometers an hour and altitudes only a couple hundred meters above ground level of the mono basin very fast very low
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 580.56 589.69 <o,f0,male> and so loud that the anthrophony the human noise even though it 's six and a half kilometers from the frog pond you just heard a second ago
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 589.69 606.11 <o,f0,male> it masked the sound of the chorusing toads you can see in this spectrogram that all of the energy that was once in the first spectrogram is gone from the top end of the spectrogram and that there 's breaks in the chorusing at two and a half four and a half and six and a half seconds
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 606.11 611.86 <o,f0,male> and then the sound of the jet the signature is in yellow at the very bottom of the page
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 621.83 638.2 <o,f0,male> now at the end of that flyby it took the frogs fully forty five minutes to regain their chorusing synchronicity during which time and under a full moon we watched as two coyotes and a great horned owl came in to pick off a few of their numbers
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 638.2 651.58 <o,f0,male> the good news is that with a little bit of habitat restoration and fewer flights the frog populations once diminishing during the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s and early ninety s have pretty much returned to normal
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 651.58 655.43 <o,f0,male> i want to end with a story told by a beaver
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 666.66 682.88 <o,f0,male> a colleague of mine was recording in the american midwest around this pond that had been formed maybe sixteen thousand years ago at the end of the last ice age it was also formed in part by a beaver dam at one end that held that whole ecosystem together in a very delicate
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 682.88 691.83 <o,f0,male> balance and one afternoon while he was recording there suddenly appeared from out of nowhere
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 691.83 709.72 <o,f0,male> a couple of game wardens who for no apparent reason walked over to the beaver dam dropped a stick of dynamite down it blowing it up killing the female and her young babies horrified my colleagues remained behind to gather his thoughts
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 718.01 736.13 <o,f0,male> the lone surviving male beaver swimming in slow circles crying out inconsolably for its lost mate and offspring this is probably the saddest sound i 've ever heard coming from any organism human or other
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 754.47 763.77 <o,f0,male> yeah well there are many facets to soundscapes among them the ways in which animals taught us to dance and sing which i 'll save for another time
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 763.77 782.09 <o,f0,male> but you have heard how biophonies help clarify our understanding of the natural world you 've heard the impact of resource extraction human noise and habitat destruction and where environmental sciences have typically tried to understand the world from what we see
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 782.1 786.18 <o,f0,male> a much fuller understanding can be got from what we hear
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 799.72 810.19 <o,f0,male> in a matter of seconds a soundscape reveals much more information from many perspectives from quantifiable data to cultural inspiration
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 810.19 824.75 <o,f0,male> visual capture implicitly frames a limited frontal perspective of a given spatial context while soundscapes widen that scope to a full three hundred and sixty degrees completely enveloping us
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 824.75 832.95 <o,f0,male> and while a picture may be worth one thousand words a soundscape is worth one thousand pictures
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 832.95 845.55 <o,f0,male> and our ears tell us that the whisper of every leaf and creature speaks to the natural sources of our lives which indeed may hold the secrets of love
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 845.57 849.8 <o,f0,male> for all things especially our own humanity and
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 852.34 855.62 <o,f0,male> the last word goes to a jaguar from the amazon
BernieKrause_2013G 1 BernieKrause_2013G 869.07 876.79 <o,f0,female> you
