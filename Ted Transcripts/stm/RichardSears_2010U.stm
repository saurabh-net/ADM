RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 29.02 38.60 <o,f0,male> and one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff you take about eight or so carbon atoms about twenty hydrogen atoms you put them together in exactly the right way
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 47.12 54.91 <o,f0,male> now as far as it goes there's a lot of oil out there in the world here 's my little pocket map of where it's all located
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 55.49 69.35 <o,f0,male> a bigger one for you to look at but this is it this is the oil in the world geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is this is about one hundred trillion gallons of crude oil still to be developed and produced in the world today
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 69.79 79.10 <o,f0,male> now that's just one story about oil and we could end it there and say well oil 's going to last forever because well there's just a lot of it but there's actually more to the story than
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 79.40 87.75 <o,f0,male> oh by the way if you think you're very far from some of this oil one thousand meters below where you're all sitting is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 88.08 97.81 <o,f0,male> come talk to me about it i'll fill in some of the details if you want so that's one of the stories of oil there's just a lot of it but what about oil where is it in the energy system
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 99.22 110.14 <o,f0,male> here 's a little snapshot of one hundred and fifty years of oil and it's been a dominant part of our energy system for most of those one hundred and fifty years now here 's another little secret i'm going to tell you about
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 124.47 133.64 <o,f0,male> now it's about thirty five percent it's been declining and i believe it will continue to decline gasoline consumption in the u s probably peaked in two thousand and seven and is declining
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 134.15 142.10 <o,f0,male> so oil is playing a less significant role every year and so twenty five years ago there was a peak oil
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 142.81 149.46 <o,f0,male> just like in the nineteen twenties there was a peak coal and a hundred years before that there was a peak wood
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 150.35 158.31 <o,f0,male> is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems and what's been taking up the slack in the last few decades well a lot of natural gas
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 158.76 165.70 <o,f0,male> and a little bit of nuclear for starters and what goes on in the future well i think out ahead of us a few decades
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 166.26 171.80 <o,f0,male> peak gas and beyond that peak renewables
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 172.33 180.28 <o,f0,male> tell you another little very important story about this picture now i'm not pretending that energy use in total isn't increasing it
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 202.16 209.71 <o,f0,male> and that continues into the future with the renewables that we're developing today reaching maybe thirty percent of primary energy by mid century
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 228.55 239.20 <o,f0,male> start in central texas here 's a piece of limestone i picked it up outside of marble falls texas it's about four hundred million years old and it's just limestone nothing really special about it now here 's a piece of chalk
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 266.04 267.69 <o,f0,male> off the coast of california
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 268.90 276.53 <o,f0,male> comes this it's abalone shell now millions of abalone every year make this shell oh by the way
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 276.83 289.62 <o,f0,male> just in case you weren't already guessing it's calcium carbonate it's the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this but it's not the same stuff it's different it's thousands of times maybe three thousand times tougher
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 290.51 299.62 <o,f0,male> and why because the lowly abalone is able to lay down the calcium carbonate crystals in layers making this beautiful iridescent
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 300.17 307.55 <o,f0,male> mother of pearl very specialized material that the abalone self assembles millions of abalone
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 307.76 315.17 <o,f0,male> all the time every day every year this is pretty incredible stuff all the same what's different how the molecules are put together
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 316.06 324.75 <o,f0,male> now what does this have to do with energy here 's a piece of coal and i'll suggest that this coal is about as exciting as this chalk
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 326.45 327.13 <o,f0,male> now
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 335.81 343.60 <o,f0,male> nature hasn't every built those perfect materials yet because nature didn't need to nature didn't need to because unlike the abalone shell
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 343.83 352.43 <o,f0,male> the survival of the species didn't depend on building those materials until maybe now when it might just matter so
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 353.74 361.06 <o,f0,male> when we think about the future of energy imagine what would it be like if instead of this
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 361.55 368.53 <o,f0,male> we could build the energy equivalent of this just by rearranging the molecules differently
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 370.06 378.38 <o,f0,male> is my story the oil will never run out it's not because we have a lot of it it's not because we're going to build a bajillion windmills
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 378.80 393.10 <o,f0,male> it's because well thousands of years ago people invented ideas they had ideas innovations technology and the stone age ended not because we ran out of stones
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 394.15 400.82 <o,f0,male> it's ideas it's innovation it's technology that will end the age of oil long before we run out of oil thank you very much
