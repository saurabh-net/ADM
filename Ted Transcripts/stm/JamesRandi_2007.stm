JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 17.69 24.33 <o,f0,female> good morning happy to see so many fine folks out here and so many smiling faces i
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 25.89 34.04 <o,f0,female> have a very peculiar background attitude and approach to the real world because i am a conjurer now i prefer that term over
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 54.49 62.07 <o,f0,female> how do we go about that sort of thing we depend on the fact that audiences such as yourselves will make assumptions
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 62.53 68.01 <o,f0,female> for example when i walked up here and i took the microphone from the stand and switched it on
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 68.43 77.04 <o,f0,female> you assumed this is a microphone which it is not as a matter of fact this is something that about half of you more than half of you will not be
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 79.89 83.97 <o,f0,female> it makes a very bad microphone i've tried it many times
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 84.66 96.22 <o,f0,female> the other assumption that you made and this little lesson is to show you that you will make assumptions not only that you can but that you will when they are properly suggested to you you believe i'm looking at you
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 96.79 107.21 <o,f0,female> wrong i'm not looking at you i can't see you i know you're out there they told me backstage it's a full house and such i know you're there because i can hear you but i can't see you because i normally wear glasses
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 107.54 116.12 <o,f0,female> these are not glasses these are empty frames quite empty frames now why would a grown man appear before you wearing empty frames on his face
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 116.90 124.26 <o,f0,female> to fool you ladies and gentlemen to deceive you to show you too can make assumptions don't you ever forget
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 125.07 133.95 <o,f0,female> now i have to do something first of all switch to real glasses so i can actually see you which would probably be a convenience i don't know i haven't had a good look well it's not that great
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 136.40 143.15 <o,f0,female> to do something now which seems a little bit strange for a magician but i'm going to take some medication this is
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 144.00 146.71 <o,f0,female> a full bottle of calms forte
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 161.22 161.71 <o,f0,female> the
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 167.55 174.55 <o,f0,female> thirty two tablets of calm 's forte now that i've done that i'll explain it in a moment i must tell you that
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 177.91 185.11 <o,f0,female> i'm an actor who plays a specific part i play the part of a magician a wizard if you will a real wizard
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 190.93 192.65 <o,f0,female> an ancient prince of denmark
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 193.23 195.27 <o,f0,female> named hamlet you would be insulted
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 195.97 202.64 <o,f0,female> and rightly so why would a man assume that you would believe something bizarre like this but there exists out there
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 203.02 212.05 <o,f0,female> a very large population of people who will tell you that they have psychic magical powers that they can predict the future
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 212.26 220.59 <o,f0,female> that they can make contact with the deceased oh they also say they will sell you astrology or other fortunetelling methods
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 221.00 228.76 <o,f0,female> oh they gladly sell you that yes and they also say that they can give you perpetual motion machines and free energy systems
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 228.99 236.27 <o,f0,female> they claim to be psychics or sensitives whatever they can but the one thing that has made a big comeback just recently
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 237.23 240.88 <o,f0,female> is this business of speaking with the dead
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 242.98 246.96 <o,f0,female> now to my innocent mind dead implies
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 253.08 256.74 <o,f0,female> these people they tend to tell you that not only can they communicate with
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 259.20 263.97 <o,f0,female> they can hear the dead as well and they can relay this information back to the living
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 265.32 266.59 <o,f0,female> i wonder if that's true
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 267.14 280.53 <o,f0,female> i don't think so because this subculture of people use exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do exactly the same the same physical methods the same psychological methods and they have effectively
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 292.37 305.38 <o,f0,female> billions of dollars are spent every year all over the globe on these charlatans now i have two questions i would like to ask these people if i had the opportunity to do so first question
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 305.85 315.12 <o,f0,female> if i want to ask them to call up because they do hear them through the ear they listen to the spirits like this i'm going to ask you to call up the ghost of my grandmother because when she
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 315.30 322.79 <o,f0,female> died she had the family will and she secreted it someplace we don't know where it is so we ask granny where is the will granny what is granny say
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 322.98 334.49 <o,f0,female> she says i 'm in heaven and it's wonderful i'm here with all my old friends my deceased friends and my family and all the puppy dogs and the kittens i used to have when i was a little girl and i love you and i'll always be with you
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 336.27 338.11 <o,f0,female> and she didn't answer the damn question
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 339.05 346.16 <o,f0,female> where is the will now she could easily have said oh it in the library on the second shelf behind the encyclopedia but she doesn't say that
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 346.51 353.63 <o,f0,female> no she doesn 't she doesn't bring any useful information to us we paid a lot of money for that information be we didn't get
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 354.73 356.66 <o,f0,female> the second question that i'd like to ask
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 357.26 369.82 <o,f0,female> rather simple suppose i ask them to contact the spirit of my deceased father in law as an example why do they insist on saying remember they speak into his ear why do they say my name starts with j or
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 371.66 381.57 <o,f0,female> is this a hunting game hunting and fishing what is it is it twenty questions no it's more like one hundred and twenty questions but it is a cruel vicious
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 382.83 386.24 <o,f0,female> absolutely conscienceless i'll be all
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 388.58 390.37 <o,f0,female> game that these people play
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 391.07 400.85 <o,f0,female> and they take advantage of the innocent the naive the grieving the needy people out there now this is a process that is called cold reading
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 406.34 420.40 <o,f0,female> praagh is his name james van praagh he 's one of the big practitioners of this sort of thing john edward sylvia browne and rosemary altea they are other operators there are hundreds of them all over the earth but in this country james van praagh is very big and what does he
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 421.47 423.79 <o,f0,female> to tell you how the deceased got deceased
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 424.40 435.87 <o,f0,female> the people he 's talking to through his ear you see so what he says is very often is like this he says he tells me he tells me before he passed that he had trouble breathing
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 436.68 444.50 <o,f0,female> folks that's what dying is all about you stop breathing and then you're dead it's that simple
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 444.61 452.53 <o,f0,female> and that's the kind of information they're going to bring back to you i don't think so now these people will make guesses they'll say things like why am i getting
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 466.13 473.27 <o,f0,female> folks often ask us at the james randi educational foundation they call me they say why are you so concerned about this mister randi isn't it just a lot of fun
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 473.72 476.55 <o,f0,female> no it is not fun it is a cruel farce
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 477.22 491.03 <o,f0,female> now it may bring a certain amount of comfort but that comfort lasts only about twenty minutes or so and then the people look in the mirror and they say i just paid a lot of money for that reading and what did she say to me i love you
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 491.27 499.91 <o,f0,female> they always say that they don't get any information they don't get any value for what they spend now sylvia browne is the big operator we call her the talons
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 500.83 502.24 <o,f0,female> sylvia browne thank you
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 503.11 514.84 <o,f0,female> sylvia browne is the big operator in this field at this very moment now sylvia browne just to show you she actually gets seven hundred dollars for a twenty minute reading
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 525.48 534.51 <o,f0,female> will call you sometime in the next two years you can tell it's her hello this is sylvia browne that's her you can tell right away now
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 550.37 554.95 <o,f0,female> because the bottom line is the sponsors love it and he will expose her
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 555.20 566.14 <o,f0,female> to television publicity all the time now what does sylvia browne give you for that seven hundred dollars she gives you the names of your guardian angels that's first now without that how could we possibly function
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 566.84 575.09 <o,f0,female> she gives you the names of previous lives who you were in previous lives duh turns out that the women
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 585.59 587.39 <o,f0,female> nothing is ever said about
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 587.73 599.78 <o,f0,female> a fourteen year old bootblack in the streets of london who died of consumption he isn't worth bringing back obviously and the strange thing folks you may have noticed this too you see these folks on television
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 600.28 607.65 <o,f0,female> they never call anybody back from hell everyone comes back from heaven but never from hell
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 608.40 612.09 <o,f0,female> they call back any of my friends they're not going to we'll you see the story
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 614.71 616.90 <o,f0,female> now sylvia browne is an exception
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 618.78 626.33 <o,f0,female> one way because the james randi educational foundation my foundation offers a one million dollar prize in negotiable bonds very simply
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 627.23 635.47 <o,f0,female> all you have to do is prove any paranormal occult or supernatural event of any kind under proper observing conditions it's very easy win the million dollars
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 645.45 648.93 <o,f0,female> she did this on the larry king live show on cnn six
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 649.95 658.38 <o,f0,female> and a half years ago and we haven't heard from her since strange she said that first of all she didn't know how to contact me
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 659.67 662.29 <o,f0,female> a professional psychic who speaks to dead people
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 666.74 667.98 <o,f0,female> you may have noticed
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 669.06 680.99 <o,f0,female> well pretty well anyway she couldn't reach me now she says she doesn't want to reach me because i'm a godless person all the more reason to take the million dollars wouldn't you think sylvia
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 681.83 695.93 <o,f0,female> these people need to be stopped seriously now they need to be stopped because this is a cruel farce we get people coming to the foundation all the time they're ruined financially and emotionally because they've given their money and their faith to these people
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 696.48 699.60 <o,f0,female> now i popped some pills earlier i have to explain that
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 705.03 711.54 <o,f0,female> you've heard of it it's an alternative form of healing right homeopathy actually consists and that's what this is
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 713.41 720.44 <o,f0,female> calm 's forte thirty two caplets of sleeping pills i forgot to tell you that i just ingested six and a half
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 720.91 722.79 <o,f0,female> days worth of sleeping pills
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 726.21 737.81 <o,f0,female> that certainly is a fatal dose it says right on the back here in case of overdose contact your poison control center immediately and it gives an eight hundred number keep you seats it's going to be okay i don't really need it
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 738.29 742.39 <o,f0,female> because i've been doing this stunt for audiences all over the world
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 743.29 745.12 <o,f0,female> for the last eight or ten years
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 745.43 750.08 <o,f0,female> taking fatal doses of homeopathic sleeping pills why don't they effect me
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 756.99 768.66 <o,f0,female> may surprise you what is homeopathy it's taking a medicine that really works and diluting it down well beyond avogadro 's limit diluting it down to the point where there's none
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 771.16 781.28 <o,f0,female> now folks this is not just a metaphor i'm going to give you now it's true it's exactly equivalent to taking one three hundred and twenty five milligram aspirin tablet
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 787.97 797.50 <o,f0,female> and waiting two years or so until the solution is homogeneous then when you get a headache you take a sip of this water and voila it is gone
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 800.15 807.98 <o,f0,female> now that is true that is what homeopathy is all about and another claim that they make you'll love this one the more dilute the medicine is they say
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 808.28 809.94 <o,f0,female> the more powerful it is
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 810.85 818.83 <o,f0,female> now wait a minute we heard about a guy in florida the poor man he was on homeopathic medicine he died of an overdose he forgot to take his pill
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 822.53 823.22 <o,f0,female> work on
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 825.90 838.96 <o,f0,female> it's a ridiculous thing it is absolutely ridiculous i don't know what we're doing believing in all this nonsense over all these years now let me tell you the james randi educational foundation is waving this very big
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 840.07 846.58 <o,f0,female> but i must say the fact that nobody has taken us up on this offer doesn't mean the powers don't exist
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 848.47 860.21 <o,f0,female> out there maybe these people are just independently wealthy well with sylvia browne i would think so you know seven hundred dollars for a twenty minute reading over the telephone that's more than lawyers make
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 861.25 870.28 <o,f0,female> i mean that's a fabulous amount of money these people don't need the million dollars perhaps but wouldn't you think they'd like to take it just to make me look silly
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 871.04 875.60 <o,f0,female> just to get rid of this godless person out there that sylvia browne talks about all the time
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 876.26 887.95 <o,f0,female> i think that something needs to be done about this we really would love to have suggestions from you folks on how to contact federal state and local authorities to get them to do something
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 888.42 902.16 <o,f0,female> if you find out now i understand we see people even today speaking to us about aids epidemics and starving kids around the world and impure water supplies people have to suffer with those are very important
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 909.03 917.14 <o,f0,female> as arthur c clarke said you know the rotting of the human mind the business of believing in the paranormal and the occult and the supernatural
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 917.42 925.21 <o,f0,female> all of this total nonsense this medieval thinking i think something should be done about that and it all lies in education
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 934.30 940.91 <o,f0,female> because it pleases the sponsors it's the bottom line the dollar line that's what they're looking at
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 941.28 949.84 <o,f0,female> we really must do something about this i'm willing to take your suggestions and i'm willing to have you tune in to our webpage
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 950.34 951.48 <o,f0,female> it's www
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 953.56 961.80 <o,f0,female> go in there and look at the archives and you will begin to understand much more of what i've been talking about today you will see the records that we have
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 978.88 988.85 <o,f0,female> solved any of their problems yes there could be a rotting of the american mind and of the minds all the way around the earth if we don't start to think sensibly about these things
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 989.89 1003.98 <o,f0,female> now we've offered this carrot as i say we've dangled the carrot we're waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it oh we get lots of them hundreds of them every year come by these are your dowsers and people who think that they can talk to the dead as well but they're amateurs
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 1004.29 1012.52 <o,f0,female> they don't know how to evaluate their own so called powers the professionals never come near us except that case of sylvia browne
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 1013.11 1016.15 <o,f0,female> that i told you about a moment ago she did accept
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 1016.38 1017.66 <o,f0,female> and then backed away
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 1021.47 1022.70 <o,f0,female> i'm james randi
JamesRandi_2007 1 JamesRandi_2007 1027.79 1028.33 <o,f0,female> thank you
