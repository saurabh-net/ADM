ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 27.92 42.26 <o,f0,male> i go on the podium you know this little office of the conductor or rather a cubicle an open space cubicle with a lot of space and in front of all that noise you do a very small gesture something like this not very pomp not
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 42.38 49.11 <o,f0,male> very sophisticated this and suddenly out of the chaos order noise becomes music
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 55.17 64.20 <o,f0,male> all those great people here virtuosos they make noise they need me to do that not really if it were that i would just save you the talk and
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 65.39 74.42 <o,f0,male> gesture so you could go out to the world and do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want and you have perfect harmony it doesn't work let 's look at the first
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 74.97 81.23 <o,f0,male> think it's a good example of harmony and then speak a little bit about how it comes about
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 138.08 141.77 <o,f0,male> was that nice so that was a sort of
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 144.09 149.60 <o,f0,male> for the success i mean obviously the orchestra musicians playing beautifully
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 153.18 157.98 <o,f0,male> they don't often even look at the conductor then you have the clapping audience
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 158.21 164.42 <o,f0,male> yeah actually taking part in doing the music you know viennese audiences usually don't interfere with the music
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 164.74 168.49 <o,f0,male> this is the closest to an oriental bellydancing feast that
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 174.35 182.22 <o,f0,male> all the time you know arthur rubinstein the pianist used to say that anywhere in the world people that have the flu they go to the doctor in tel aviv they come to my
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 191.11 204.54 <o,f0,male> regular just to be part of that to become part of the orchestra and that's great you know audiences like you yeah make the event but what about the conductor what can you say the conductor was doing actually
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 206.51 212.99 <o,f0,male> he was happy and i often show this to senior management people get
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 214.05 226.94 <o,f0,male> you come to work how come you're so happy something must be wrong there yeah but he 's spreading happiness and i think the happiness the important thing is this happiness does not come from only his own story and his joy of the music
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 227.46 239.69 <o,f0,male> the joy is about enabling other people 's stories to be heard at the same time you have the story of the orchestra as a professional body you have the story of the audience as a community
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 240.29 251.49 <o,f0,male> yeah you have the stories of the individuals in the orchestra and in the audience and then you have other stories unseen people who build this wonderful concert hall people who made those
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 308.24 312.23 <o,f0,male> very short but you could see it's a completely different figure right he 's awesome he 's so
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 315.07 321.20 <o,f0,male> so clear maybe a little bit over clear can we have a little demonstration would you be my orchestra for a second
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 325.86 328.74 <o,f0,male> and i'll stop you okay ready
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 333.89 339.10 <o,f0,male> more redundant than i already feel so please wait for the conductor now look at me
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 352.64 353.57 <o,f0,male> is a vacancy for
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 371.14 374.14 <o,f0,male> so not only the instruction is clear but also the
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 383.76 394.00 <o,f0,male> to a certain point when muti is asked why do you conduct like this he says i 'm responsible responsible in front of him no he doesn't really mean him he means mozart which is
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 396.75 397.11 <o,f0,female> from the
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 403.39 411.21 <o,f0,male> for mozart this is going to be the only story to be told it's mozart as i riccardo muti understand it and you know what happened to
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 412.61 423.54 <o,f0,male> three years ago he got a letter signed by all seven hundred employees of la scala musical employees i mean the musicians saying you 're a great conductor we don't want to work with you please resign
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 424.97 434.21 <o,f0,male> why because you don't let us develop you're using us as instruments not as partners and our joy of music etc etc so he had to resign isn't that nice
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 440.05 444.74 <o,f0,male> can you do it with less control or with a different kind of control let 's
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 446.27 446.47 <o,f0,male> the
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 505.83 512.43 <o,f0,male> the whole idea is really to let it happen by itself do not interfere but how does it happen
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 514.36 519.41 <o,f0,male> you see him turning pages in the score now either he is senile and doesn't remember his own
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 519.63 523.89 <o,f0,male> music because he wrote the music or he is actually transferring a very strong
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 524.16 526.85 <o,f0,male> message to them saying come on guys you have to play by
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 528.25 538.21 <o,f0,male> so it's not about my story it's not about your story it's only the execution of the written music no interpretation interpretation is the real story of the
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 538.67 544.85 <o,f0,male> so no he doesn't want that that's a different kind of control let 's see another super conductor
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 580.85 587.54 <o,f0,male> what's different did you see the eyes closed did you see the hands did you see this kind of
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 603.49 604.22 <o,f0,female> do
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 607.02 609.43 <o,f0,male> concentrate close my eyes come
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 613.41 613.77 <o,f0,male> why
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 623.74 625.44 <o,f0,male> no cynicism this is a german orchestra
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 628.52 629.09 <o,f0,male> then they look at
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 634.46 637.02 <o,f0,female> what this guy wants and
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 637.84 648.79 <o,f0,male> that they really look at each other and the first players of the orchestra lead the whole ensemble in playing together and when karajan is asked about it he actually says yes the worst damage i can do
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 649.95 656.63 <o,f0,male> is to give them a clear instruction because that would prevent the
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 657.67 664.65 <o,f0,male> the listening to each other that is needed for an orchestra now that's great what about the eyes why are the eyes closed
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 666.59 674.36 <o,f0,male> is a wonderful story about karajan conducting in london and he cues in a flute player like this the guy has no idea what to do
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 690.74 694.53 <o,f0,female> you know you have no authority to change anything it's my music
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 695.21 708.42 <o,f0,male> the real music is only in karajan 's head and you have to guess my mind so you are under tremendous pressure because i don't give you instruction and yet you have to guess my mind so it's a different kind of a very spiritual but yet very firm control
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 709.35 713.64 <o,f0,male> can we do it in another way of course we can let 's go back to the first conductor we've seen
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 776.94 786.34 <o,f0,male> but isn't that controlling in the same way no it's not because he is not telling them what to do when he does this it's not take your stradivarius and like jimi hendrix
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 786.88 797.84 <o,f0,male> smash it on the floor it's not that he says this is the gesture of the music i'm opening a space for you to put in another layer of interpretation that is another story
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 798.28 811.33 <o,f0,male> but how does it really work together if it doesn't give them instructions it's like being on a rollercoaster yeah you're not really given any instructions but the forces of the process itself keep you in place that's what he does
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 812.20 824.74 <o,f0,male> the interesting thing is of course the rollercoaster does not really exist it's not a physical thing it's in the players heads and that's what make them into partners you have the plan in your head you know what to do
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 825.01 834.21 <o,f0,male> though kleiber is not conducting you but here and there and that you know what to do and you become a partner building the rollercoaster yeah with sound
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 834.54 841.87 <o,f0,male> as you actually take the ride this is very exciting for those players they do need to go to a sanatorium for two weeks later
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 843.26 856.29 <o,f0,male> is very tiring yeah but it's the best music making like this but of course it's not only about motivation and giving them a lot of physical energy you also have to be very professional
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 856.68 861.84 <o,f0,male> and look again at this kleiber can we have the next video quickly you'll see what happens when
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 898.66 899.47 <o,f0,male> after the concert
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 902.23 907.46 <o,f0,male> when it's needed the authority is there it's very important but authority is not enough to make people
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 939.34 939.76 <o,f0,male> there
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 966.39 969.34 <o,f0,male> a kind of a compliment we all like to get it's not feedback
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 973.23 975.37 <o,f0,male> the second thing is
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 988.82 996.60 <o,f0,male> not only creates a process but also creates the conditions in the world in which this process takes place
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 997.02 1005.10 <o,f0,male> so again the oboe player is completely autonomous and therefore happy and proud of his work and creative and all of that and
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 1005.43 1017.87 <o,f0,male> the level in which kleiber is in control is in a different level so control is no longer a zero sum game you have this control you have this control and all you put together in partnership brings about the best music
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 1018.52 1026.18 <o,f0,male> so kleiber is about process kleiber is about conditions in the world but you need to have process and content to create the meaning
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 1026.49 1036.71 <o,f0,male> lenny bernstein my own personal maestro since he was a great teacher lenny bernstein always started from the meaning look at this
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 1096.80 1105.57 <o,f0,male> the face of muti at the beginning well he had a wonderful expression but only one did you see lenny 's face you know why
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 1106.07 1118.77 <o,f0,male> because the meaning of the music is pain and you're playing a painful sound and you look at lenny and he 's suffering but not in a way that you want to stop it's suffering like enjoying himself in a jewish way
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 1128.65 1137.10 <o,f0,male> more baton now it's about you the player telling the story now it's a reversed thing you're telling the story and you're telling the story and even briefly
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 1137.40 1143.98 <o,f0,male> you become the storyteller to which the community the whole community listens to and bernstein enables that
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 1145.71 1154.53 <o,f0,male> now if you are doing all the things we talked about together and maybe some others you can get to this wonderful point of doing without doing
ItayTalgam_2009G 1 ItayTalgam_2009G 1155.14 1165.71 <o,f0,male> and for the last video i think this is simply the best title my friend peter says if you love something give it away so please
