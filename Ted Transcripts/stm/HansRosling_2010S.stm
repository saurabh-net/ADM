HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 29.42 33.36 <o,f0,female> i'm going to talk now about how world population has changed from that
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 33.57 35.09 <o,f0,female> year and into the future
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 35.81 42.56 <o,f0,female> but i will not use digital technology as i've done during my first five tedtalks instead i
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 43.90 55.19 <o,f0,female> and i am today launching a brand new analog teaching technology that i picked up from ikea this box this box contains one billion people
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 67.25 75.17 <o,f0,female> and they lived away then there was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 77.93 79.60 <o,f0,female> people were healthy
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 93.44 96.22 <o,f0,female> this was the economic level at which sweden was
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 96.65 100.65 <o,f0,female> but in contrast to this in the developing world far away
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 101.01 105.58 <o,f0,female> the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 106.24 107.53 <o,f0,female> and they were saving
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 108.01 109.98 <o,f0,male> to be able to buy a pair of shoes
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 111.36 114.32 <o,f0,male> there was an enormous gap in the world when i grew up
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 115.22 126.63 <o,f0,male> and this gap between the west and the rest has created a mindset of the world which we still use linguistically when we talk about the west and the developing world
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 127.79 133.22 <o,f0,male> but the world has changed and it's overdue to upgrade that mindset and that
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 141.95 151.25 <o,f0,male> up to two thousand and ten is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population just look how many
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 151.80 153.20 <o,f0,male> the world population has
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 154.35 155.59 <o,f0,male> since i went to school
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 157.32 159.20 <o,f0,male> and of course there's been economic growth
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 164.07 173.36 <o,f0,male> so the western population moved over to here and now their aspiration is not only to have a car now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination and they want to fly
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 175.12 185.83 <o,f0,female> so this is where they are today and the most successful of the developing countries they have moved on you know and they have become emerging economies we call them and they are now buying cars
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 187.33 196.98 <o,f0,female> happened a month ago was that the chinese company geely they acquired the volvo company and then finally the swedes understood that something big had happened in the world
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 202.43 205.15 <o,f0,female> and the tragedy is that the two billion over here
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 207.10 211.87 <o,f0,male> for food and shoes they are still almost as poor as they were fifty years ago
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 212.93 219.46 <o,f0,male> the new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions the three billions here which are also becoming emerging
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 220.81 226.88 <o,f0,male> because they are quite healthy relatively well educated and they already also have two or three children per woman
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 229.54 232.75 <o,f0,male> aspiration now is of course to buy a bicycle
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 233.40 235.84 <o,f0,male> and then later on they would like to have a motorbike
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 237.32 240.59 <o,f0,male> but this is the world we have today
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 241.14 242.31 <o,f0,male> no longer any gap
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 243.41 249.53 <o,f0,male> the distance from the poorest here the very poorest to the very richest over here is wider than ever
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 249.98 255.00 <o,f0,male> but there is a continuous world from walking biking driving to
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 261.82 264.86 <o,f0,male> this is the new world we have today in two thousand and ten
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 271.32 273.64 <o,f0,male> i'm going to project into two thousand and fifty
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 274.97 276.61 <o,f0,male> i was in shanghai recently
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 277.35 282.14 <o,f0,male> and i listened to what's happening in china and it's pretty sure that they will catch up
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 305.13 315.46 <o,f0,male> we invest in the right green technology so that we can avoid severe climate change and energy can still be relatively cheap then they will move all the way
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 316.36 319.45 <o,f0,male> and they will start to buy electric cars
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 320.67 322.31 <o,f0,male> this is what we will find
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 323.08 324.94 <o,f0,male> so what about the poorest two billion
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 325.51 327.05 <o,f0,male> what about the poorest two billion
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 329.01 330.02 <o,f0,male> they move on
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 331.05 337.23 <o,f0,male> here population comes in because there we already have two to three children per woman family planning is widely used
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 342.36 347.27 <o,f0,male> so these two billion will in the next decades increase to three billion
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 347.89 348.51 <o,f0,male> and they
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 350.51 355.11 <o,f0,male> four billion there is nothing but a nuclear war
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 355.45 357.95 <o,f0,male> of a kind we've never seen that can stop this from
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 359.33 360.40 <o,f0,male> because we already have
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 363.52 375.41 <o,f0,male> and only if get out of poverty they get education they get improved child survival they can buy a bicycle and a cellphone and come here then population growth will stop in two thousand and
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 376.20 383.42 <o,f0,male> we cannot have people on this level looking for food and shoes because then we get continued population growth
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 383.89 387.97 <o,f0,male> and let me show you why by converting back to the old time
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 400.49 409.01 <o,f0,male> dark blue is africa brown is europe green is the middle east and this light blue is south asia that's india and this is china
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 421.13 428.12 <o,f0,male> the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school sixty percent seventy percent eighty percent ninety
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 439.26 448.40 <o,f0,male> child survival small families and all the rest the rainbow of developing countries with very large families and poor child
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 449.96 461.01 <o,f0,female> what has happened i start the world here we go can you see as the years pass by child survival is increasing they get soap hygiene education vaccination and penicillin and then family planning
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 462.30 471.58 <o,f0,female> they get up to ninety percent child survival then families decrease and most of the arab countries in the middle east is falling down there look bangladesh catching up with india
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 474.13 486.49 <o,f0,male> world joins the western world with good child survival and small family size but we still have the poorest billion can you see the poorest billion those boxes i had over here
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 487.92 495.50 <o,f0,male> they are still up here and they still have a child survival of only seventy to eighty percent meaning that if you have six children
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 521.07 531.07 <o,f0,male> actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world we can stop at nine billion if we do the right things child survival is the new green
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 531.76 535.02 <o,f0,male> it's only by child survival that we will stop population growth
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 539.19 540.32 <o,f0,male> i'm not an optimist
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 541.54 542.65 <o,f0,male> neither am i a
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 543.36 552.97 <o,f0,male> a very serious possibilist it's a new category where we take emotion apart and we just work analytically with the world it can be
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 565.09 567.82 <o,f0,male> and look at the position of the old west
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 569.77 572.96 <o,f0,male> box was all alone leading the world living its own life
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 576.25 581.85 <o,f0,male> the role of the old west in the new world is to become the foundation of the
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 583.41 585.27 <o,f0,male> nothing more nothing less
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 586.29 587.62 <o,f0,male> a very important role
HansRosling_2010S 1 HansRosling_2010S 588.30 590.93 <o,f0,male> do it well and get used to it thank you very much
