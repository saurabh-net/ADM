JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 16.26 20.08 <o,f0,male> i ask for a show of hands or a clapping
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 23.37 27.35 <o,f0,male> i 'm interested in how many are three to twelve years old
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 48.61 50.67 <o,f0,male> dinosaurs are kind of funny you know
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 96.61 101.72 <o,f0,male> that 's sort of the theme big different and gone
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 102.32 103.84 <o,f0,male> the title of my talk
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 103.94 119.15 <o,f0,male> shape shifting dinosaurs the cause of a premature extinction now i assume that we remember dinosaurs and there 's lots of different shapes lots of different kinds a long time ago
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 119.79 127.33 <o,f0,male> back in the early one thousand nine hundred s museums were out looking for dinosaurs they went out and gathered them up
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 130.26 134.11 <o,f0,male> every museum wanted a little bigger or better one than anybody else
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 134.28 138.17 <o,f0,male> so if the museum in toronto went out and collected
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 145.92 152.04 <o,f0,male> and a better one and that happened for all museums so everyone was out looking for all these bigger and better dinosaurs
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 168.81 170.59 <o,f0,male> where are all the little ones
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 173.71 176.35 <o,f0,male> and they thought about it and they even wrote papers about it
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 177.25 179.56 <o,f0,male> where are the little dinosaurs
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 188.88 191.16 <o,f0,male> go to a museum you 'll see
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 191.66 194.03 <o,f0,male> see how many baby dinosaurs there are
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 194.72 199.35 <o,f0,male> people assumed and this was actually a problem people assumed that
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 200.14 205.37 <o,f0,male> if they had little dinosaurs if they had juvenile dinosaurs they 'd be easy to identify
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 210.72 213.3 <o,f0,male> but all they had were big dinosaurs
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 214.05 217.11 <o,f0,male> and it comes down to a couple of things first off
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 218 220.64 <o,f0,male> scientists have egos
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 220.75 224.66 <o,f0,male> and scientists like to name dinosaurs
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 238.74 244.02 <o,f0,male> and what happened of course is we ended up with a whole bunch of different dinosaurs
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 245.74 247.82 <o,f0,male> in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 249.36 260.06 <o,f0,male> a light went on in somebody 's head dr peter dodson at the university of pennsylvania actually realized that dinosaurs
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 260.61 263.16 <o,f0,male> grew kind of like birds do
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 263.71 267.41 <o,f0,male> which is different than the way reptiles grow
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 270.1 272.32 <o,f0,male> the cassowary as an example
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 272.46 285.46 <o,f0,male> and it 's kind of cool if you look at the cassowary or any of the birds that have crests on their heads they actually grow to about eighty percent adult size before the crest starts to grow
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 292.61 298.32 <o,f0,male> in what we call ontogeny so allometric cranial ontogeny
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 305.4 307.87 <o,f0,male> one that was eighty percent grown
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 308.53 314.18 <o,f0,male> and you didn 't know that it was going to grow up to a cassowary you would think they were two different animals
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 316.91 318.82 <o,f0,male> so this was a problem and
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 318.9 324.05 <o,f0,male> peter dodson pointed this out using some duck billed dinosaurs
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 328.85 336.51 <o,f0,male> a baby and an adult and make an average of what it should look like if it grew in sort of a linear fashion
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 337.16 341.08 <o,f0,male> it would have a crest about half the size of the adult
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 356.96 359.64 <o,f0,male> taken that taken peter dodson 's work and
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 360.02 363.91 <o,f0,male> gone on with that then we would have a lot less dinosaurs than we have
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 364.76 369.17 <o,f0,male> but scientists have egos they like to name things
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 374.46 386.8 <o,f0,male> now we have a way of actually testing to see whether a dinosaur or any animal is a young one or an older one and that 's by actually cutting into their bones
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 387.03 394.65 <o,f0,male> but cutting into the bones of a dinosaur is hard to do as you can imagine because
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 407.46 409.23 <o,f0,male> they 're very well taken care of
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 411.3 415.45 <o,f0,male> they don 't like it if you come in and want to saw them open and look inside
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 420.7 424.48 <o,f0,male> i have a museum and i collect dinosaurs
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 425.25 428.45 <o,f0,male> and i can saw mine open so that 's what i do
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 435.77 438.45 <o,f0,male> if you cut open a little dinosaur
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 438.5 449.57 <o,f0,male> it 's very spongy inside like a and if you cut into an older dinosaur it 's very massive you can tell it 's mature bone so it 's real easy to tell them apart
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 461.16 475.24 <o,f0,male> there 's this unit of rock called the hell creek formation that produces the last dinosaurs that lived on earth and there are twelve of them that everyone recognizes i mean the twelve primary dinosaurs that went extinct
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 475.24 478.82 <o,f0,male> and so we will evaluate
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 479.24 484.34 <o,f0,male> and that 's sort of what i 've been doing so my students my staff we 've been
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 485.39 487 <o,f0,male> cutting them open
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 496.64 498.43 <o,f0,male> dinosaur 's skull do you
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 521.06 532.69 <o,f0,male> and the assumption is is that they 're related like cousins or whatever but no one ever considered that they might be more closely related
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 533.06 537.16 <o,f0,male> in other words people looked at them and they saw the differences
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 537.65 552 <o,f0,male> and you all know that if you are going to determine whether you 're related to your brother or your sister you can 't do it by looking at differences you can only determine relatedness by looking for similarities so
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 552.32 555.39 <o,f0,male> people were looking at these and they were talking about how different they are
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 565.89 570.62 <o,f0,male> and then stygimoloch another dinosaur from the same age lived at the same time
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 571.21 575.79 <o,f0,male> has spikes sticking out the back of its head it 's got a little tiny dome
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 575.82 578.52 <o,f0,male> and it 's got a bunch of gnarly stuff on its nose
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 588.06 594.26 <o,f0,male> here 's a dinosaur that has spikes sticking out of its head no dome and gnarly stuff on its nose
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 594.57 600.62 <o,f0,male> nobody noticed the gnarly stuff sort of looked alike but they did look at these three and they said
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 600.65 606.58 <o,f0,male> these are three different dinosaurs and dracorex is probably the most primitive of them and the other one is
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 607.27 618.09 <o,f0,male> more primitive than the other it 's unclear to me how they actually sorted these three of them out but if you line them up if you just take those three skulls and just line them up
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 618.38 622.38 <o,f0,male> they line up like this dracorex is the littlest one
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 629.49 631.2 <o,f0,male> that should give me a clue
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 648.5 650.54 <o,f0,male> and look it was spongy inside
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 651.44 656.47 <o,f0,male> really spongy inside i mean it is a juvenile and it 's growing really fast
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 657 668.29 <o,f0,male> so it is going to get bigger if you cut open stygimoloch it is doing the same thing the dome that little dome is growing really fast it 's inflating very fast
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 668.64 679.47 <o,f0,male> what 's interesting is the spike on the back of the dracorex was growing very fast as well the spikes on the back of the stygimoloch are actually resorbing which means they 're getting smaller
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 687.4 693.04 <o,f0,male> and its little bumps on the back of its head were also resorbing so
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 693.11 701.41 <o,f0,male> just with these three dinosaurs you can easily as a scientist we can easily hypothesize that it is just a growth series
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 701.55 703.07 <o,f0,male> of the same animal
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 728.3 734 <o,f0,male> so a colleague of mine at berkley he and i were looking at triceratops and
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 734.06 744.78 <o,f0,male> before the year two thousand now remember triceratops was first found in the one thousand eight hundred s before two thousand no one had ever seen a juvenile triceratops
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 745.41 748.38 <o,f0,male> there 's a triceratops in every museum in the world
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 749 752.34 <o,f0,male> but no one had ever collected a juvenile
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 765.01 767.14 <o,f0,male> they 're all over the place
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 767.73 770.67 <o,f0,male> so we have a whole bunch of them at our museum
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 791.41 794.8 <o,f0,male> and then as they grow older the horns grow forward
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 794.97 807.81 <o,f0,male> and that 's pretty cool if you look along the edge of the frill they have these little triangular bones that actually grow big as triangles and then they flatten against the frill pretty much like the
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 810.89 817.14 <o,f0,male> and then because the juveniles are in my collection i cut them open
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 827.27 832.76 <o,f0,male> the adult triceratops was also spongy and this is a skull that is two meters long
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 835.92 846.56 <o,f0,male> but there 's another dinosaur that is found in this formation that looks like a triceratops except it 's bigger and it 's called torosaurus
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 876.26 879.52 <o,f0,male> so one of my graduate students john scannella
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 884.39 888.94 <o,f0,male> the hole starting to form in triceratops and
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 888.96 901.11 <o,f0,male> of course it 's open in torosaurus so he found the transitional ones between triceratops and torosaurus which was pretty cool so now we know that torosaurus
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 901.19 903.97 <o,f0,male> is actually a grownup triceratops
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 905.02 912.4 <o,f0,male> now when we name dinosaurs when we name anything the original name gets to stick and the second name is
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 912.4 914.49 <o,f0,male> thrown out so
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 915.01 918.46 <o,f0,male> torosaurus is extinct
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 918.57 926.39 <o,f0,male> triceratops if you 've heard the news a lot of the newscasters got it all wrong they thought torosaurus should be kept and triceratops thrown out
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 948.41 958.65 <o,f0,male> we look at the bone histology the bone histology tells us that edmontosaurus is a juvenile or at least a sub adult and the other one is
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 966.48 970.86 <o,f0,male> so we can just keep doing this and the last one is
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 999.76 1002.21 <o,f0,male> it must be true they must be different
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 1006.47 1011.2 <o,f0,male> and sure enough nanotyrannus has juvenile bone and
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 1011.51 1014.27 <o,f0,male> the bigger one has more mature bone
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 1014.61 1028.12 <o,f0,male> it looks like it could still get bigger and at the museum of the rockies where we work i have four t rexes so i can cut a whole bunch of them but i didn 't have to cut any of them really because i just lined up their jaws
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 1028.12 1035.75 <o,f0,male> and it turned out the biggest one had twelve teeth and the next smallest one had thirteen and the next smallest had fourteen
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 1035.75 1041.59 <o,f0,male> and of course nano has seventeen and we just went out and looked at other people 's collections and we found one that
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 1042.19 1044.55 <o,f0,male> has sort of fifteen teeth
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 1044.61 1046.12 <o,f0,male> so again
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 1046.34 1048.04 <o,f0,male> real easy to say that
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 1062.42 1064.13 <o,f0,male> when it comes down to our
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 1064.8 1067.08 <o,f0,male> end cretaceous we have seven left
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 1088.19 1090.42 <o,f0,male> and they 're not happy with
