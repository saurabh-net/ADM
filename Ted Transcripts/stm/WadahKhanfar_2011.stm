WadahKhanfar_2011 1 WadahKhanfar_2011 823.68 831.65 <o,f0,male> how would you characterize the historical significance of what 's happened is this a story of the year a story of the decade or something
WadahKhanfar_2011 1 WadahKhanfar_2011 831.65 850.22 <o,f0,male> more wadah khanfar actually this may be the biggest story that we have ever covered we have covered many wars we have covered a lot of tragedies a lot of problems a lot of conflict zones a lot of hot spots in the region because we were centered at the middle of it but this is a story it is a great story it is beautiful it is not something
WadahKhanfar_2011 1 WadahKhanfar_2011 850.22 862.18 <o,f0,male> that you only cover because you have to cover a great incident you are witnessing change in history you are witnessing the birth of a new era and this is what the story 's all about
WadahKhanfar_2011 1 WadahKhanfar_2011 865.16 872.01 <o,f0,male> skeptical or think this may just be an intermediate stage before much more alarming chaos
WadahKhanfar_2011 1 WadahKhanfar_2011 872.22 882.78 <o,f0,male> you really believe that if there are democratic elections in egypt now that a government could emerge that espouses some of the values you 've spoken about so inspiringly
WadahKhanfar_2011 1 WadahKhanfar_2011 946.69 951.33 <o,f0,male> do if they want to connect or make a difference and they believe in what 's happening here
WadahKhanfar_2011 1 WadahKhanfar_2011 968.15 988.05 <o,f0,male> of accessing our website from various parts of the world fifty percent of it is coming from america because we discovered that people care and people would like to know they are receiving the stream through our internet unfortunately in the united states we are not covering but washington d c at this moment in time for al jazeera english
WadahKhanfar_2011 1 WadahKhanfar_2011 988.05 1007.99 <o,f0,male> but i can tell you this is the moment to celebrate through connecting ourselves with those people in the street and expressing our support to them and expressing this kind of feeling universal feeling of supporting the weak and the oppressed to create a much better future for all
