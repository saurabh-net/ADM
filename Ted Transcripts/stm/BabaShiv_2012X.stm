BabaShiv_2012X 1 BabaShiv_2012X 44.92 55.14 <o,f0,male> the most horrifying and agonizing part of the whole experience was we were making decisions after decisions after decisions that were being thrust upon us
BabaShiv_2012X 1 BabaShiv_2012X 66.44 80.07 <o,f0,male> and these were being pressed upon us by the doctors now you could ask this question why were the doctors doing this now a simplistic answer would be the doctors are doing this because they want to protect themselves legally
BabaShiv_2012X 1 BabaShiv_2012X 80.6 82.76 <o,f0,male> i think that is too simplistic
BabaShiv_2012X 1 BabaShiv_2012X 82.76 99.28 <o,f0,male> these are well meaning doctors some of them have gone on to become very good friends they probably were simply following the wisdom that has come down the ages this adage that when you 're making decisions especially decisions of importance it 's best to be in charge it 's best to be in control it 's best to be in the driver 's seat
BabaShiv_2012X 1 BabaShiv_2012X 99.82 114.57 <o,f0,male> and we were certainly in the driver 's seat making all these decisions and let me tell you if some of you had been there it was a most agonizing and harrowing experience which got me thinking i said is there any validity to this whole adage
BabaShiv_2012X 1 BabaShiv_2012X 130.94 136.28 <o,f0,male> and since i study human decision making i said i 'm going to run some studies
BabaShiv_2012X 1 BabaShiv_2012X 144.9 148.26 <o,f0,male> i want to tell you that what you 're going to do in the study is
BabaShiv_2012X 1 BabaShiv_2012X 166.01 178.54 <o,f0,male> now why do you have to consume the tea why because it makes a lot of sense in order to solve these puzzles effectively if you think about it your mind needs to be in two states simultaneously right it needs to be alert
BabaShiv_2012X 1 BabaShiv_2012X 179.2 189.65 <o,f0,male> for which caffeine is very good simultaneously it needs to be calm not agitated calm for which chamomile is very good
BabaShiv_2012X 1 BabaShiv_2012X 189.65 206.78 <o,f0,male> now comes the between subjects design the ab design the ab testing so what i 'm going to do is randomly assign you to one of two groups so imagine that there is an imaginary line out here so everyone here will be group a everyone out here will be group b
BabaShiv_2012X 1 BabaShiv_2012X 240.97 252.68 <o,f0,male> so if you think about it this is an extreme case scenario because in the real world whenever you are taking passenger 's seat very often the driver is going to be someone you trust an expert etc so this is an extreme case scenario
BabaShiv_2012X 1 BabaShiv_2012X 266.07 275.07 <o,f0,male> now you 're going to have thirty minutes to solve fifteen puzzles here 's an example of the puzzle you 're going to solve
BabaShiv_2012X 1 BabaShiv_2012X 295.88 298.66 <o,f0,male> and then you have to unstick yourself
BabaShiv_2012X 1 BabaShiv_2012X 303.12 309.51 <o,f0,male> because we want this to be difficult and i 'll tell you why momentarily now here 's another example
BabaShiv_2012X 1 BabaShiv_2012X 323.25 341.76 <o,f0,male> now the question we 're asking here is in terms of the outcome in terms of the number of puzzles solved will you in the driver 's seat end up solving more puzzles because you are in control you could decide which tea you will choose or would you be better off in terms of the number of puzzles solved
BabaShiv_2012X 1 BabaShiv_2012X 379.77 395.25 <o,f0,male> second you have thirty minutes to solve these are you taking the entire thirty minutes or are you giving up before the thirty minutes elapse you will be more likely to give up before the thirty minutes elapse compared to you so you 're putting in less juice and therefore the outcome fewer puzzles solved
BabaShiv_2012X 1 BabaShiv_2012X 433.18 436.16 <o,f0,male> you know the feedback whether you 're solving the puzzles or not
BabaShiv_2012X 1 BabaShiv_2012X 540.45 553.23 <o,f0,male> on the somber note i want to finish up on a more upbeat note it has now been five years slightly more than five years and the good news thank god is that the cancer is still in remission
