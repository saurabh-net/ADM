GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 73.33 75.51 <o,f0,male> it is absolutely possible
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 78.38 80.52 <o,f0,male> those of us in education
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 102.79 105.39 <o,f0,male> i grew up in the inner city
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 105.43 107.56 <o,f0,male> and there were kids
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 116.61 119.43 <o,f0,male> and those schools are still lousy today
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 120.15 122.96 <o,f0,male> fifty six years later
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 123.07 128.02 <o,f0,male> and you know something about a lousy school it 's not like a bottle of wine
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 159.85 161.52 <o,f0,male> and they say we 'll we 're going to do
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 162.1 164.2 <o,f0,male> what we did last year this year
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 164.96 166.89 <o,f0,female> what kind of business model is that
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 171.12 173.37 <o,f0,male> between ten and three
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 187.26 190.02 <o,f0,male> who created that business model
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 206.96 214.03 <o,f0,female> and they don 't care whether or not geoff is upset he can 't go to the bank go find another bank they all operate the same way
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 233.87 240.12 <o,f0,male> so i was a little slow and i did not trust technology and when they first came out with those new contraptions
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 264.1 268.06 <o,f0,male> when we were having folks being crippled by polio
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 271.37 273.58 <o,f0,male> the same way then that we 're doing right now
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 309.03 310.63 <o,f0,male> we should do something
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 329.68 338.68 <o,f0,male> for years i went to look i went the harvard ed school i thought i knew something they said it was the agrarian calendar and people had but let me tell you why that doesn 't make sense
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 354.62 358.92 <o,f0,male> well it just turns out in the one thousand eight hundred and forty s we did have schools were open all year
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 366.36 372.04 <o,f0,male> so this is not something that is ordained from the education gods
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 378.38 380 <o,f0,male> to use science
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 415.71 421.68 <o,f0,male> my wife yvonne and i we have four kids three grown ones and a fifteen year old
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 429.84 444.02 <o,f0,male> we didn 't know how critical those first three years were we didn 't know what was happening in those young brains we didn 't know the role that language a stimulus and response call and response how important that was in developing those children we know that
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 470.61 473.12 <o,f0,male> lots of places
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 476.56 486.44 <o,f0,male> you know we provide health services and people are always fussing at me about you know because i 'm all into accountability and data and all of that good stuff but
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 486.65 495.12 <o,f0,male> we do health services and i have to raise a lot of money people used to say when they 'd come fund us geoff why do you provide these health services i used to make stuff up
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 530.59 535.08 <o,f0,male> and you 've never read a study from mit that says giving your kid
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 567.93 573.31 <o,f0,female> i mean you 're educators you work you say you think you 've got it great no and you find out they didn 't get
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 586.15 588.22 <o,f0,male> july maybe june
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 619.72 622.29 <o,f0,male> so how much money did we just spend on all
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 642.99 646.97 <o,f0,male> because in my older years i 've become somewhat of a clairvoyant
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 648.5 650.82 <o,f0,male> i can predict school scores
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 651.03 652.61 <o,f0,male> you take me to any school
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 653.19 658.14 <o,f0,male> i 'm really good at inner city schools that are struggling and you tell me last year
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 658.19 661.77 <o,f0,male> forty eight percent of those kids were on grade level
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 662.67 668.74 <o,f0,male> and i say okay what 's the plan what did we do from last year to this year you say we 're doing the same thing i 'm going to make a prediction
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 684.01 693.02 <o,f0,male> teachers need real information right now about what 's happening to their kids the high stakes is today because you can do something about it
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 721.79 724.78 <o,f0,male> and here 's the rub some of it 's not going to work
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 725.28 729.15 <o,f0,male> you know people tell me yeah those charter schools a lot of them don 't work
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 735.94 739.42 <o,f0,male> out the science and things not working
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 755.45 757.51 <o,f0,male> the latest and greatest thing
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 764.43 767.16 <o,f0,male> that thing lasted all of three weeks
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 775.9 778.43 <o,f0,male> not a person not a soul
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 783 786.84 <o,f0,male> that shouldn 't stop you from pushing the science forward
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 786.87 791.28 <o,f0,male> our job as educators there 's some stuff we know that we can do
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 791.56 798.5 <o,f0,male> and we 've got to do better the evaluation we have to start with kids earlier we have to make sure that we provide the support to young people
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 798.61 801.7 <o,f0,male> we 've got to give them all of these opportunities so
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 807.16 810.98 <o,f0,male> innovating until we really nail this science down
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 811.06 815.11 <o,f0,male> is something that is absolutely critical and this is something by the way
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 815.35 818.73 <o,f0,male> that i think is going to be a challenge for our entire field
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 820.77 824.23 <o,f0,male> cannot wait another fifty years to get this right
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 824.47 826.77 <o,f0,male> we have run out of time
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 835.49 837.81 <o,f0,male> continue this foolishness
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 859.18 864.29 <o,f0,male> when the safety of america is threatened we will spend any amount of money
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 865.14 869.81 <o,f0,male> the real safety of our nation is preparing this next generation
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 869.83 885.24 <o,f0,male> so that they can take our place and be the leaders of the world when it comes to thinking and technology and democracy and all that stuff we care about i dare say it 's a pittance
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 887.22 892.77 <o,f0,male> what it would require for us to really begin to solve some of these problems
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 926.27 935.51 <o,f0,male> this year 's seniors will have one hundred percent graduating high school last i heard we had ninety three percent accepted to college we 'd better get that other seven percent
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 942.02 948.09 <o,f0,male> so that 's just how this goes applause jl so how do you stick with them after they leave high school gc well you know one of the bad problems we have in this country
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 958.96 960.89 <o,f0,male> in many ways mimics what
GeoffreyCanada_2013S 1 GeoffreyCanada_2013S 960.89 962.41 <o,f0,male> a good parent does
