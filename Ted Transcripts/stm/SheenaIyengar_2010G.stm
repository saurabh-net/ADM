SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 27.69 29.36 <o,f0,female> of operations is in the u s
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 41.51 47.58 <o,f0,female> i knew even then that i would encounter cultural differences and misunderstandings but they popped up when i least
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 49.06 53.54 <o,f0,female> my first day i went to a restaurant and i ordered a cup of green tea with sugar
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 54.69 56.22 <o,f0,female> a pause the waiter said
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 56.83 59.06 <o,f0,female> one does not put sugar in green tea
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 71.69 73.99 <o,f0,female> put sugar in green tea
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 75.42 81.61 <o,f0,female> i understand i said that the japanese do not put sugar in their green tea but i'd like to
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 96.35 103.31 <o,f0,female> i am very sorry we do not have sugar well since i couldn't have
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 103.84 108.17 <o,f0,female> the way i wanted it i ordered a cup of coffee which the waiter brought over promptly
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 111.19 112.94 <o,f0,female> packets of
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 114.72 120.48 <o,f0,female> failure to procure myself a cup of sweet green tea was not due to a simple misunderstanding
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 121.10 126.03 <o,f0,female> this was due to a fundamental difference in our ideas about choice
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 136.23 143.72 <o,f0,female> the american way to quote burger king is to have it your way because as starbucks says happiness is in your choices
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 145.84 150.96 <o,f0,female> but from the japanese perspective it's their duty to protect those who don't know any better
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 153.63 156.85 <o,f0,female> in this case the ignorant gaijin from making
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 159.10 165.23 <o,f0,female> let 's face it the way i wanted my tea was inappropriate according to cultural standards and they were doing their best to help me save
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 172.51 175.37 <o,f0,female> they think that choice as seen through the american lens
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 189.99 192.20 <o,f0,female> they don't even hold true at america 's own borders
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 194.35 197.90 <o,f0,female> some of these assumptions and the problems associated with them
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 202.63 204.18 <o,f0,female> how they were shaped by your
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 207.80 211.51 <o,f0,female> if a choice affects you then you should be the one to make it
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 212.01 219.98 <o,f0,female> this is the only way to ensure that your preferences and interests will be most fully accounted for it is essential for success
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 228.59 231.86 <o,f0,female> their guns regardless of what other people want or recommend
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 232.43 234.54 <o,f0,female> it's called being true to yourself
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 235.57 239.65 <o,f0,female> but do all individuals benefit from taking such an approach to choice
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 241.20 245.16 <o,f0,female> and i did a series of studies in which we sought the answer to this very question
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 258.46 263.49 <o,f0,female> group came in and they were greeted by miss smith who showed them six big piles of anagram
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 264.33 270.42 <o,f0,female> the kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do and they even got to choose which marker they would write their answers with
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 272.27 276.31 <o,f0,female> group of children came in they were brought to the same room shown the same
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 286.27 290.92 <o,f0,female> they were told that their anagrams and their and markers had been chosen by their mothers
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 305.58 313.39 <o,f0,female> with this procedure we were able to ensure that the kids across the three groups all did the same activity making it easier for us to compare performance
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 314.52 320.56 <o,f0,female> such small differences in the way we administered the activity yielded striking differences in how well they
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 328.88 333.24 <o,f0,female> as compared to when it was chosen for them by miss smith or their mothers
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 334.01 339.55 <o,f0,female> it didn't matter who did the choosing if the task was dictated by another their performance
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 343.96 344.92 <o,f0,female> when they were told that their
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 345.55 347.21 <o,f0,female> been consulted
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 348.92 352.32 <o,f0,female> named mary said you asked my mother
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 357.83 366.93 <o,f0,female> asian american children performed best when they believed their mothers had made the choice second best when they chose for themselves
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 371.42 375.30 <o,f0,female> named natsumi even approached miss smith as she was leaving the room and
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 378.90 380.08 <o,f0,female> did it just like she said
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 402.77 405.19 <o,f0,female> if they had a concept of being true to one 's
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 418.77 420.67 <o,f0,female> or you could say that the
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 421.76 424.88 <o,f0,female> were shaped by the preferences of specific others
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 434.90 437.29 <o,f0,female> clearly divided from others
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 438.02 444.71 <o,f0,female> when in contrast two or more individuals see their choices and their outcomes as intimately connected
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 445.90 449.96 <o,f0,female> they may amplify one another 's success by turning choosing into a
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 461.73 464.55 <o,f0,female> that is exactly what the american paradigm
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 482.47 484.36 <o,f0,female> but it is a mistake to assume that
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 486.90 487.73 <o,f0,female> of choosing alone
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 489.86 493.67 <o,f0,female> second assumption which informs the american view of choice goes something like
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 504.04 505.57 <o,f0,female> with twenty seven million
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 506.55 510.65 <o,f0,female> match com with what is it fifteen million date possibilities now
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 512.26 513.61 <o,f0,female> you will surely find the
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 543.92 547.15 <o,f0,female> coke diet coke sprite seven to be exact
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 553.89 554.74 <o,f0,female> really caught me off
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 556.72 560.86 <o,f0,female> oh but it doesn't matter it's all just soda that's just one choice
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 570.86 571.74 <o,f0,female> how many choices
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 582.99 590.71 <o,f0,female> when i put out juice and water in addition to these seven sodas now they perceived it as only three choices juice water and
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 593.03 598.67 <o,f0,female> the die hard devotion of many americans not just to a particular flavor of soda but to a particular brand
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 607.85 610.76 <o,f0,female> you and i know that coke is the better choice
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 651.93 654.60 <o,f0,female> and images do you associate with choice
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 655.50 656.37 <o,f0,female> from warsaw said
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 657.89 659.01 <o,f0,female> for me it is fear
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 659.41 661.03 <o,f0,female> there are some dilemmas you see
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 661.28 662.80 <o,f0,female> i am used to no choice
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 663.99 669.01 <o,f0,female> bohdan from kiev said in response to how he felt about the new consumer marketplace
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 669.55 672.80 <o,f0,female> it is too much we do not need everything that is there
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 674.08 677.81 <o,f0,female> a sociologist from the warsaw survey agency explained
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 682.21 686.12 <o,f0,female> all around them they were never given a chance to learn how to react
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 687.36 690.19 <o,f0,female> and tomasz a young polish man said
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 690.62 698.97 <o,f0,female> i don't need twenty kinds of chewing gum i don't mean to say that i want no choice but many of these choices are quite artificial
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 700.72 704.21 <o,f0,female> in reality many choices are between things that are
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 707.83 713.86 <o,f0,female> the value of choice depends on our ability to perceive differences between the
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 737.97 740.22 <o,f0,female> see how one choice is unlike another
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 740.80 743.70 <o,f0,female> when there are too many choices to compare and contrast
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 755.15 759.11 <o,f0,female> choice no longer offers opportunities but imposes constraints
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 767.72 771.88 <o,f0,female> choice can develop into the very opposite of everything it represents in
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 773.29 777.37 <o,f0,female> when it is thrust upon those who are insufficiently prepared for it
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 810.89 815.73 <o,f0,female> my studies have shown that when you give people ten or more options when they're making a choice
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 829.90 831.04 <o,f0,female> brings me to the
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 847.23 853.07 <o,f0,female> outside chicago a young couple susan and daniel mitchell were about to have their first baby
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 854.71 855.12 <o,f0,female> a name for
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 860.18 865.23 <o,f0,female> was seven months pregnant she started to experience contractions and was rushed to the emergency room
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 866.18 867.82 <o,f0,female> the baby was delivered through a
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 869.13 873.49 <o,f0,female> but barbara suffered cerebral anoxia a loss of oxygen to the brain
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 880.23 882.89 <o,f0,female> the doctors gave the mitchells a choice
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 884.52 891.93 <o,f0,female> they could either remove barbara off the life support in which case she would die within a matter of hours or
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 892.37 894.43 <o,f0,female> they could keep her on life support
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 894.91 903.24 <o,f0,female> in which case she might still die within a matter of days if she survived she would remain in a permanent vegetative state
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 903.88 905.44 <o,f0,female> never able to walk
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 905.90 908.05 <o,f0,female> talk or interact with others
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 925.29 926.51 <o,f0,female> they had all suffered
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 927.00 928.43 <o,f0,female> the same tragedy
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 937.91 941.21 <o,f0,female> the doctors decided whether and when the life support would be
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 942.61 946.18 <o,f0,female> while in the united states the final decision rested with the
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 952.81 954.77 <o,f0,female> cope with the loss of their loved one
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 961.99 966.34 <o,f0,female> were more likely to express negative emotions as compared to their french
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 971.86 973.33 <o,f0,female> for so little time
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 973.74 977.92 <o,f0,female> he taught us so much he gave us a new perspective on life
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 985.96 986.42 <o,f0,female> another
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 993.90 995.31 <o,f0,female> and another parent said
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 996.12 998.75 <o,f0,female> i feel as if i've played a role in an execution
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1000.59 1003.37 <o,f0,female> but when the american parents were asked if they would
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1007.26 1008.63 <o,f0,female> they all said no
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1009.88 1011.36 <o,f0,female> they could not imagine
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1020.99 1023.08 <o,f0,female> number of cases they were even clinically
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1025.31 1034.04 <o,f0,female> these parents could not contemplate giving up the choice because to do so would have gone contrary to everything they had been taught
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1042.24 1044.42 <o,f0,female> her essay the white album
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1045.09 1046.20 <o,f0,female> joan didion writes
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1051.43 1053.33 <o,f0,female> we interpret what we see
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1057.82 1062.55 <o,f0,female> we live entirely by the imposition of a narrative line upon disparate images
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1063.23 1065.95 <o,f0,female> by the ideas with which we have learned to freeze
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1066.34 1068.47 <o,f0,female> the shifting phantasmagoria
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1068.89 1071.08 <o,f0,female> which is our actual experience
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1076.19 1081.81 <o,f0,female> the story upon which the american dream depends is the story of limitless choice
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1097.74 1103.04 <o,f0,female> it's a great story and it's understandable why they would be reluctant to revise it
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1104.19 1106.11 <o,f0,female> but when you take a close look
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1106.53 1107.93 <o,f0,female> you start to see the holes
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1108.50 1112.29 <o,f0,female> and you start to see that the story can be told in many other ways
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1113.80 1117.93 <o,f0,female> americans have so often tried to disseminate their ideas of choice
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1131.94 1136.77 <o,f0,female> the actual experience that we try to understand and organize through narrative
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1137.49 1139.19 <o,f0,female> varies from place to place
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1150.19 1155.31 <o,f0,female> could benefit from incorporating new perspectives into their own narrative
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1163.30 1166.64 <o,f0,female> that it is poetry that is lost in translation
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1167.75 1170.96 <o,f0,female> this suggests that whatever is beautiful and moving
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1171.91 1174.18 <o,f0,female> whatever gives us a new way to see
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1174.56 1178.24 <o,f0,female> cannot be communicated to those who speak a different language
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1194.36 1197.74 <o,f0,female> we have far more to gain than to lose
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1198.34 1201.69 <o,f0,female> by engaging in the many translations of
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1209.95 1211.48 <o,f0,female> the many versions that
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1212.37 1214.30 <o,f0,female> and the many that have yet to be written
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1215.56 1217.17 <o,f0,female> no matter where we're from
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1218.08 1225.92 <o,f0,female> and what your narrative is we all have a responsibility to open ourselves up to a wider array of what choice
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1236.10 1237.42 <o,f0,female> it teaches us when
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1240.44 1244.66 <o,f0,female> that much closer to realizing the full potential of choice
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1252.74 1254.79 <o,f0,female> if we learn to speak to one another
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1258.34 1260.40 <o,f0,female> we can begin to see choice
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1268.10 1269.10 <o,f0,female> thank you
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1284.93 1292.19 <o,f0,male> detail about your biography that we have not written in the program book but by now it's evident to everyone in this room you're blind and
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1292.59 1305.36 <o,f0,male> i guess one of the questions on everybody 's mind is how does that influence your study of choosing because that's an activity that for most people is associated with visual inputs like aesthetics and color and so on
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1307.18 1321.02 <o,f0,female> funny that you should ask that because one of the things that's interesting about being blind is you actually get a different vantage point when you observe the way sighted people make choices and as you just mentioned there's lots of choices out there that are very visual these days
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1321.34 1330.78 <o,f0,female> yeah i as you would expect get pretty frustrated by choices like what nail polish to put on because i have to rely on what other people suggest and i can't decide
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1344.05 1349.33 <o,f0,female> i asked these two ladies and the one lady told me well you should definitely wear ballet slippers well what does it look like
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1349.81 1352.12 <o,f0,female> it's a very elegant shade of pink
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1352.65 1356.45 <o,f0,female> okay great the other lady tells me to wear adorable
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1356.96 1357.88 <o,f0,female> what does it look like
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1361.28 1363.80 <o,f0,female> and so i asked them well how do i tell them apart
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1370.19 1374.53 <o,f0,female> thing they had consensus on well if i could see them i would clearly be able to tell them apart
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1377.97 1384.00 <o,f0,female> wondered was whether they were being affected by the name or the contents of the color so i decided to do a little
SheenaIyengar_2010G 1 SheenaIyengar_2010G 1411.94 1418.53 <o,f0,female> the women that could tell them apart when the labels were off they picked adorable and when the labels were on
