SunniBrown_2011 1 SunniBrown_2011 12.39 20.34 <o,f0,female> i just want to tell you my story i spend a lot of time teaching adults how to use visual language and doodling in the workplace
SunniBrown_2011 1 SunniBrown_2011 20.34 28.12 <o,f0,female> and naturally i encounter a lot of resistance because it 's considered to be anti intellectual and counter to serious learning
SunniBrown_2011 1 SunniBrown_2011 28.12 43.44 <o,f0,female> but i have a problem with that belief because i know that doodling has a profound impact on the way that we can process information and the way that we can solve problems so i was curious about why there was a disconnect between the way our society perceives doodling
SunniBrown_2011 1 SunniBrown_2011 57.75 63.64 <o,f0,female> in the eighteenth century it became a verb and it meant to swindle or ridicule or to make fun of someone
SunniBrown_2011 1 SunniBrown_2011 63.64 72.21 <o,f0,female> in the nineteenth century it was a corrupt politician and today we have what is perhaps our most offensive definition at least to me which is the following
SunniBrown_2011 1 SunniBrown_2011 72.21 89.1 <o,f0,female> to doodle officially means to dawdle to dilly dally to monkey around to make meaningless marks to do something of little value substance or import and my personal favorite to do nothing no wonder people are averse to doodling at work
SunniBrown_2011 1 SunniBrown_2011 89.1 93.57 <o,f0,female> doing nothing at work is akin to masturbating at work it 's totally inappropriate
SunniBrown_2011 1 SunniBrown_2011 109.36 125.26 <o,f0,female> and unfortunately the press tends to reinforce this norm when they 're reporting on a doodling scene of an important person at a confirmation hearing and the like they typically use words like discovered or caught or found out as if there 's some sort of criminal act being committed
SunniBrown_2011 1 SunniBrown_2011 125.43 144.13 <o,f0,female> and additionally there is a psychological aversion to doodling thank you freud in the one thousand nine hundred and thirty s freud told us all that you could analyze people 's psyches based on their doodles this is not accurate but it did happen to tony blair at the davos forum in two thousand and five when his doodles were of course discovered and
SunniBrown_2011 1 SunniBrown_2011 144.13 146.78 <o,f0,female> he was labeled the following things now
SunniBrown_2011 1 SunniBrown_2011 170.22 181.49 <o,f0,female> and i 'm not comfortable with that and so because of that belief that i think needs to be burst i 'm here to send us all hurtling back to the truth and here 's the truth doodling is an incredibly powerful tool
SunniBrown_2011 1 SunniBrown_2011 181.49 184.29 <o,f0,female> and it is a tool that we need to remember and to re learn
SunniBrown_2011 1 SunniBrown_2011 184.61 198.41 <o,f0,female> so here 's a new definition for doodling and i hope there 's someone in here from the oxford english dictionary because i want to talk to you later here 's the real definition doodling is really to make spontaneous marks to help yourself think that is why millions of people doodle
SunniBrown_2011 1 SunniBrown_2011 198.73 214.62 <o,f0,female> here 's another interesting truth about the doodle people who doodle when they 're exposed to verbal information retain more of that information than their non doodling counterparts we think doodling is something you do when you lose focus but in reality it is a preemptive measure to stop you from losing focus
SunniBrown_2011 1 SunniBrown_2011 214.71 226.97 <o,f0,female> additionally it has a profound effect on creative problem solving and deep information processing there are four ways that learners intake information so that they can make decisions they are visual
SunniBrown_2011 1 SunniBrown_2011 242.53 259.68 <o,f0,female> the incredible contribution of the doodle is that it engages all four learning modalities simultaneously with the possibility of an emotional experience that is a pretty solid contribution for a behavior equated with doing nothing this is so nerdy but this made me cry when i discovered this
SunniBrown_2011 1 SunniBrown_2011 259.68 264.81 <o,f0,female> so they did anthropological research into the unfolding of artistic activity in children
SunniBrown_2011 1 SunniBrown_2011 264.81 284.72 <o,f0,female> and they found that across space and time all children exhibit the same evolution in visual logic as they grow in other words they have a shared and growing complexity in visual language that happens in a predictable order and i think that is incredible i think that means doodling is native to us and we simply are denying ourselves that instinct
SunniBrown_2011 1 SunniBrown_2011 285.35 292.23 <o,f0,female> and finally a lot a people aren 't privy to this but the doodle is a precursor to some of our greatest cultural assets
SunniBrown_2011 1 SunniBrown_2011 292.23 297.67 <o,f0,female> this is but one this is frank gehry the architect 's precursor to the guggenheim in abu dhabi
SunniBrown_2011 1 SunniBrown_2011 297.67 313.16 <o,f0,female> so here is my point under no circumstances should doodling be eradicated from a classroom or a boardroom or even the war room on the contrary doodling should be leveraged in precisely those situations where information density is very high
SunniBrown_2011 1 SunniBrown_2011 313.16 329.87 <o,f0,female> and the need for processing that information is very high and i will go you one further because doodling is so universally accessible and it is not intimidating as an art form it can be leveraged as a portal through which we move people into higher levels of visual literacy
SunniBrown_2011 1 SunniBrown_2011 329.87 336.82 <o,f0,female> my friends the doodle has never been the nemesis of intellectual thought in reality it is one of its greatest allies
