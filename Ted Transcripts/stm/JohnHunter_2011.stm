JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 17.21 23.34 <o,f0,male> to be here i feel so fortunate i 've been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 23.48 33.45 <o,f0,male> i called my wife leslie and i said you know there 's so many good people trying to do so much good it feels like i 've landed in a colony of angels
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 51.95 65.02 <o,f0,male> and she 's a very high tech superintendent she uses smart boards she blogs she tweets she does facebook she does all this sort of high tech stuff she 's a technology leader and instructional leader but in her office there 's this old
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 65.3 77.48 <o,f0,male> wooden weather worn table kitchen table peeling green paint it 's kind of rickety and i said pam you 're such a modern cutting edge person why is this old table in your office
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 78.1 80.71 <o,f0,male> and she told me she said you know i grew up
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 80.84 88.91 <o,f0,male> in southwestern virginia in the coal mines and the farmlands of rural virginia and this table was in my grandfather 's kitchen
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 89.93 98.76 <o,f0,male> and we 'd come in from playing he 'd come in from plowing and working and we 'd sit around that table every night and as i grew up i heard so much knowledge and so many
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 98.76 100.58 <o,f0,male> insights and so much wisdom
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 100.79 114.12 <o,f0,male> come out around this table i began to call it the wisdom table and when he passed on i took this table with me and brought it to my office and it reminds me of him it reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 114.71 126.1 <o,f0,male> the project i 'm going to tell you about is called the world peace game and essentially it is also an empty space and i 'd like to think of it as a twenty first century wisdom table
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 206.59 211.72 <o,f0,male> and i was so shocked so stunned i got up and said well thank you but what do i do
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 219.89 222 <o,f0,male> and i said what do i do and her answer
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 222.69 229.73 <o,f0,male> shocked me it stunned me her answer set the template for the entire career i was to have after that
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 242.29 245.08 <o,f0,male> in gifted education in that way
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 246.21 257.43 <o,f0,male> and she cleared such a space that i endeavored from then on to clear a space for my students an empty space whereby they could create and make meaning out of their own understanding
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 262.94 276.38 <o,f0,male> was teaching many years later and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker his name is chris farina chris farina is here today at his own cost chris could you stand up and let them see you a young visionary filmmaker who 's made
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 298.15 309.89 <o,f0,male> this film out so we made a film and it turns out to be more than a story about me more than a story about one teacher it 's a story that 's a testament to teaching and teachers
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 317.95 319.53 <o,f0,male> i saw myself
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 319.62 321.41 <o,f0,male> literally disappear
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 321.53 323.34 <o,f0,male> what i saw was
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 324.08 326.65 <o,f0,male> my teachers coming through me
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 330.24 337.1 <o,f0,male> geometry teacher in high school mr rucell 's wry smile under his handlebar mustache that 's the smile i use that 's his smile
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 337.43 345.85 <o,f0,male> i saw jan polo 's flashing eyes and they weren 't flashing in anger they were flashing in love intense love for her students
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 346.25 351.14 <o,f0,male> and i have that kind of flash sometimes and i saw miss ethel j banks
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 351.14 362.53 <o,f0,male> who wore pearls and high heels to elementary school every day and you know she had that old school teacher stare you know the one
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 373.3 377.92 <o,f0,male> i didn 't use that stare very often but i do have it in my repertoire
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 384.08 392.45 <o,f0,male> my own parents my first teachers my father very inventive spatial thinker that 's my brother malcolm there on the right
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 393.23 398.5 <o,f0,male> and my mother who taught me in fourth grade in segregated schools in virginia
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 398.5 408.49 <o,f0,male> who was my inspiration and really i feel as though when i see the film i have a gesture she does like this
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 419.5 433.43 <o,f0,male> and so that gesture of my mother 's continues through many generations it 's an amazing feeling to have that lineage and so i 'm here standing on the shoulders of many people i 'm not here alone there are many people on this stage right now
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 435.66 439.9 <o,f0,male> and so this world peace game i 'd like to tell you about
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 439.9 450.29 <o,f0,male> it started out like this it 's just a four foot by five foot plywood board in an inner city urban school one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight i was creating a lesson for students
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 462.41 478.25 <o,f0,male> so i thought well they like to play games i 'll make something i didn 't say interactive we didn 't have that term in one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight but something interactive and so we made the game and it has since evolved to a four foot by four foot by four foot
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 478.25 483.26 <o,f0,male> plexiglass structure and it has four plexiglass layers
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 483.66 502.35 <o,f0,male> there 's an outer space layer with black holes and satellites and research satellites and asteroid mining there 's an air and space level with clouds that are big puffs of cotton we push around and territorial air spaces and air forces a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it even an undersea level with submarines and undersea mining
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 515.22 522.86 <o,f0,male> and a cfo or comptroller i choose the prime minister based on my relationship with them i offer them the job they can turn it down
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 522.86 532.26 <o,f0,male> and then they choose their own cabinet there 's a world bank arms dealers and a united nations there 's also a weather goddess who controls a random stock market and random weather
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 536.94 549.99 <o,f0,male> page crisis document with fifty interlocking problems so that if one thing changes everything else changes i throw them into this complex matrix and they trust me because we have a deep rich relationship together
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 551.41 553.39 <o,f0,male> and so with all these crises
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 553.65 557.05 <o,f0,male> we have let 's see ethnic and minority tensions
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 557.05 576.7 <o,f0,male> we have chemical and nuclear spills nuclear proliferation there 's oil spills environmental disasters water rights disputes breakaway republics famine endangered species and global warming if al gore is here i 'm going to send my fourth graders from agnor hurt and venable schools to you because they solved global warming in a week
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 581.96 584.51 <o,f0,male> and they 've done it several times
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 588.82 603.23 <o,f0,male> some child it 's basically a troublemaker and i have my troublemaker put to use because they on the surface are trying to save the world and their position in the game but they 're also trying to undermine everything
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 609.86 624.5 <o,f0,male> the saboteur is there and we also read from sun tzu 's the art of war fourth graders understand it nine years old and they handle that and use that to understand how to not follow at first they do the paths to power and destruction
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 624.5 626.5 <o,f0,male> the path to war
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 626.5 644.77 <o,f0,male> they learn to overlook short sighted reactions and impulsive thinking to think in a long term more consequential way stewart brand is here and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a coevolution quarterly article on a peace force and in the game sometimes students actually form a peace force
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 644.81 654.94 <o,f0,male> i 'm just a clock watcher i 'm just a clarifier i 'm just a facilitator the students run the game i have no chance to make any policy whatsoever once they start playing
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 654.94 658.63 <o,f0,male> so i 'll just share with you
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 677.43 696.64 <o,f0,male> can 't tell them anything because i don 't know the answer and i admit the truth to them right up front i don 't know and because i don 't know they 've got to dig up the answer and so i apologize to them as well i say i 'm so sorry boys and girls but the truth is we have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape and we hope you can
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 696.64 699.74 <o,f0,male> fix it for us and maybe this game will help you learn how to do
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 724.25 732.04 <o,f0,male> it 's a serious question who is really in charge i 've learned to cede control of the classroom over to the students over time
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 749.06 755.14 <o,f0,male> so i 'll just share with you some stories very quickly of some magical things that have happened
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 755.67 769.17 <o,f0,male> in this game we had a little girl and she was the defense minister of the poorest nation and the defense minister she had the tank corps and air force and so forth and she was next door to a very wealthy oil rich neighbor
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 769.17 785.63 <o,f0,male> without provocation suddenly she attacked against her prime minister 's orders the next door neighbor 's oil fields she marched into the oil field reserves surrounded it without firing a shot and secured it and held it and that neighbor was unable to conduct any military operations because their fuel supply was locked up
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 786.43 791.66 <o,f0,male> we were all upset with her why are you doing this this is the world peace game what is wrong with you
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 831.21 834.61 <o,f0,male> so a few game days later it came to light
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 834.61 853.04 <o,f0,male> that we found out this major country was planning a military offensive to dominate the entire world had they had their fuel supplies they would have done it she was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a philosophical decision
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 853.04 855.06 <o,f0,male> to attack in a peace game
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 855.65 862.23 <o,f0,male> now she used a small war to avert a larger war so we stopped and had a very good philosophical discussion about whether that was right
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 862.71 872.62 <o,f0,male> conditional good or not right that 's the kind of thinking that we put them in the situations i could not have designed that in teaching it it came about spontaneously through their collective
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 932.24 934.8 <o,f0,male> by the third sentence she was in tears
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 935.9 937.55 <o,f0,male> i was in tears
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 939 945.72 <o,f0,male> everybody understood that when we lose somebody the winners are not gloating we all lose
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 946.16 952.57 <o,f0,male> and it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding i 'll show you what my friend david says about this he 's been in many battles
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 986.97 1002.89 <o,f0,male> i get chills every time i see that that 's the kind of engagement you want to have happen and i can 't design that i can 't plan that and i can 't even test that but it 's self evident assessment we know that 's an authentic assessment of learning
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 1016.5 1022.36 <o,f0,male> we had played the game one session after school for many weeks about seven weeks
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 1022.36 1032.63 <o,f0,male> and we had essentially solved all fifty of the interlocking crises the way the game is won is all fifty problems have to be solved and every country 's asset value has to be increased above its starting point
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 1032.63 1045.15 <o,f0,male> some are poor some are wealthy there are billions the world bank president was a third grader one time he says how many zeros in a trillion i 've got to calculate that right away but he was setting fiscal policy in that game for high school players who were playing with him
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 1091.95 1096.45 <o,f0,male> principal walks in i 'm out of a job the parents were looking
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 1121.05 1123.09 <o,f0,male> and he says yes
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 1123.09 1128.02 <o,f0,male> and the game is won spontaneous compassion
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 1128.02 1130.66 <o,f0,male> that could not be planned for
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 1130.66 1149.95 <o,f0,male> that was unexpected and unpredictable every game we play is different some games are more about social issues some are more about economic issues some games are more about warfare but i don 't try to deny them that reality of being human i allow them to go there and through their own experience learn in a bloodless way
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 1150.18 1152.2 <o,f0,male> how not to do
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 1152.37 1157.05 <o,f0,male> what they consider to be the wrong thing and they find out what is right their own way their own selves
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 1158.59 1160.31 <o,f0,male> and so in this game
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 1160.56 1164.15 <o,f0,male> i 've learned so much from it but i would say that
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 1166.18 1169.03 <o,f0,male> if only they could
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 1169.03 1176.27 <o,f0,male> pick up a critical thinking tool or creative thinking tool from this game and leverage something good for the world
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 1177.31 1181.94 <o,f0,male> they may save us all if only
JohnHunter_2011 1 JohnHunter_2011 1183.27 1187.89 <o,f0,male> and on behalf of all of my teachers on whose shoulders i 'm standing
