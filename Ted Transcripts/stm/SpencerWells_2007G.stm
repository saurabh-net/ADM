SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 23.17 25.38 <o,f0,male> these are a few of the languages that
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 26.19 33.49 <o,f0,male> spoken little bits of over the course of the last six weeks as i've been to seventeen countries i think i'm up to on this crazy tour i've been doing
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 34.24 41.21 <o,f0,male> checking out various aspects of the project that we're doing and i'm going to tell you a little bit about later on and visiting some pretty incredible places
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 42.10 48.75 <o,f0,male> places like mongolia cambodia new guinea south africa tanzania twice i was here a month ago
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 49.55 62.91 <o,f0,male> and the opportunity to make a whirlwind tour of the world like that is utterly amazing for lots of reasons you see some incredible stuff and you get to make these spot comparisons between people all around the globe
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 63.47 68.28 <o,f0,male> and the thing that you really take away from that the kind of surface thing that you take away from it
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 69.01 78.94 <o,f0,male> is not that we're all one although i'm going to tell you about that but rather how different we are there is so much diversity around the globe six thousand different languages
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 93.47 105.30 <o,f0,male> well that's what i'm going to talk about today is how we're using the tools of genetics population genetics in particular to tell us how we generated this diversity and how long it took
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 106.04 115.64 <o,f0,male> now the problem of human diversity like all big scientific questions how do you explain something like that can be broken down into sub questions and you can ferret away at those little sub questions
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 130.74 135.80 <o,f0,male> and the second question is related but slightly different if we do spring from a common source
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 136.07 145.13 <o,f0,male> how did we come to occupy every corner of the globe and in the process generate all of this diversity the different ways of life the different appearances the different languages around the world
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 157.92 172.39 <o,f0,male> therefore probable that africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee and as these two species are now man 's nearest allies it's somewhat more probable that our early progenitors lived on the african continent than elsewhere so we're done we can go home
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 172.85 175.37 <o,f0,male> finished the origin question well not quite
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 200.16 208.32 <o,f0,male> the apes that left at that time ended up in southeast asia became the gibbons and orangutans and the ones that stayed on in africa evolved into the gorillas the chimpanzees and us so yes
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 208.89 222.54 <o,f0,male> if you're talking about our common ancestry with apes it's very clear by looking at the fossil record we started off here but that's not really the question i'm asking i'm asking about our human ancestry things that we would recognize as being like us if they were sitting here in the room
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 223.24 237.51 <o,f0,male> they were peering over your shoulder you wouldn't leap back like that what about our human ancestry because if we go far enough back we share a common ancestry with every living thing on earth dna ties us all together so we share ancestry with barracuda bacteria
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 238.09 251.29 <o,f0,male> and mushrooms if you go far enough back over a billion years what we're asking about though is human ancestry how do we study that well historically it has been studied using the science of paeleoanthropology digging things up out of the ground
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 251.76 262.85 <o,f0,male> and largely on the basis of morphology the way things are shaped often skull shape saying this looks a little bit more like us than that so this must be my ancestor this must be who i'm directly descended from
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 263.84 272.01 <o,f0,male> the field of paeleoanthropology i'll argue gives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry but it doesn't give us the probabilities that we really want
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 279.95 295.45 <o,f0,male> all dug up just west of here in olduvai gorge by the leakey family and they're all dating to roughly the same time from left to right we've got homo erectus homo habilis and australopithecus now called paranthropus boisei the robust australopithecine three extinct species same place same time
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 296.05 300.94 <o,f0,male> that means that not all three could be my direct ancestor which one of these guys am i actually related to
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 307.20 318.05 <o,f0,male> well a different approach has been to look at morphology in humans using the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently again largely skull shape the first person to do this systematically
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 318.71 328.06 <o,f0,male> was linnaeus carl von linne a swedish botanist who in the eighteenth century took it upon himself to categorize every living organism on the planet you think you've got a tough job
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 328.89 337.35 <o,f0,male> and he did a pretty good job he categorized about twelve thousand species in systema naturae he actually coined the term homo sapiens it means wise man in latin
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 337.67 349.79 <o,f0,male> but looking around the world at the diversity of humans he said well you know we seem to come in discreet sub species or categories and he talked about africans and americans and asians and europeans and a blatantly
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 350.03 357.22 <o,f0,male> racist category he termed monstrosus which basically included all the people he didn't like including imaginary folk like elves
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 359.93 369.27 <o,f0,male> it's easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well intentioned but ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist working in the pre darwinian era
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 369.88 378.73 <o,f0,male> except if you had taken physical anthropology as recently as twenty or thirty years ago in many cases you would have learned basically that same classification of humanity human races
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 379.21 384.64 <o,f0,male> that according to physical anthropologists of thirty forty years ago carlton coon is the best example
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 385.15 393.17 <o,f0,male> had been diverging from each other this was in the post darwinian era for over a million years since the time of homo erectus but based on what data
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 393.83 407.83 <o,f0,male> very little very little morphology and a lot of guesswork well what i'm going to talk about today what i'm going to talk about now is a new approach to this problem instead of going out and guessing about our ancestry digging things up out of the ground possible ancestors and
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 415.82 428.12 <o,f0,male> what we need to do is turn the problem on its head because what we're really asking is a genealogical problem or a genealogical question what we're trying to do is construct a family tree for everybody alive today
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 428.88 434.15 <o,f0,male> as any genealogist will tell you anybody have a member of the family or maybe you have tried to construct a family tree
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 444.43 454.21 <o,f0,male> adding these ever more distant relationships but eventually no matter how good you are at digging up the church records and all that stuff you hit what the genealogists call a brick wall
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 454.58 466.13 <o,f0,male> a point beyond which you don't know anything else about your ancestors and you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history that we have to feel our way through with whispered guidance who were these people who came before
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 466.81 478.50 <o,f0,male> we have no written record well actually we do written in our dna in our genetic code we have an historical document that takes us back in time to the very earliest days of our species and that's what we study
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 479.01 488.78 <o,f0,male> now a quick primer on dna i suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist it is a very long linear molecule a coded version of how to make another copy of you
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 497.14 506.94 <o,f0,male> how long is it well it's billions of these subunits in length a haploid genome we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes a haploid genome is around three point two billion nucleotides in length
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 507.45 517.84 <o,f0,male> and the whole thing if you add it all together is over six billion nucleotides long if you take all the dna out of one cell in your body and stretch it end to end it's around two meters long
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 518.78 525.56 <o,f0,male> if you take all the dna out of every cell in your body and you stretch it end to end it would reach from here to the moon and back thousands of times
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 534.35 541.16 <o,f0,male> book you can think of war and peace now multiply it by one hundred and imagine copying that by hand
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 553.42 562.17 <o,f0,male> or a c for a t same thing happens to our dna as it's being passed on through the generations it doesn't happen very often we have a proofreading mechanism built in
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 562.54 574.40 <o,f0,male> but when it does happen and these changes get transmitted down through the generations they become markers of descent if you share a marker with someone it means you share an ancestor at some point in the past the person who first had that change in their dna
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 596.92 604.21 <o,f0,male> all the way back to the very first woman the y chromosome the piece of dna that makes men men traces a purely paternal line of descent
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 612.66 622.04 <o,f0,male> now even if these are simplified versions of the real trees they're still kind of complicated so let 's simplify them turn them on their sides combine them so that they look like a tree with the root at the bottom and the branches going up
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 622.69 633.94 <o,f0,male> what's the take home message well the thing that jumps out at you first is that the deepest lineages in our family trees are found within africa among africans
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 634.66 647.28 <o,f0,male> that means that africans have been accumulating this mutational diversity for longer and what that means is that we originated in africa it's written in our dna every piece of dna we look at has greater diversity within
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 648.13 656.12 <o,f0,male> than outside of africa and at some point in the past a sub group of africans left the african continent to go out and populate the rest of the world
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 656.98 664.90 <o,f0,male> now how recently do we share this ancestry was it millions of years ago which we might suspect by looking at all this incredible variation around the world
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 665.70 675.45 <o,f0,male> no the dna tells a story that's very clear within the last two hundred thousand years we all share an ancestor a single person mitochondrial eve you might have heard about her
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 676.34 685.85 <o,f0,male> in africa an african woman who gave rise to all the mitochondrial diversity in the world today but what's even more amazing is that if you look at the y chromosome side the male side of the story
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 686.46 696.59 <o,f0,male> the y chromosome adam only lived around sixty thousand years ago that's only about two thousand human generations the blink of an eye in an evolutionary sense
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 697.34 704.36 <o,f0,male> that tells us we were all still living in africa at that time this was an african man who gave rise to all the y chromosome diversity around the world
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 704.60 715.36 <o,f0,male> it's only within the last sixty thousand years that we have started to generate this incredible diversity we see around the world such an amazing story we're all effectively part of an extended african family
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 716.17 729.04 <o,f0,male> now that seems so recent why didn't we start to leave earlier why didn't homo erectus evolve into separate species or sub species rather human races around the world why was it that we seem to have come out of africa so recently
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 729.72 741.02 <o,f0,male> well that's a big question these why questions particularly in genetics and the study of history in general are always the big ones the ones that are tough to answer and so when all else fails talk about the weather
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 741.51 755.27 <o,f0,male> what was going on to the world 's weather around sixty thousand years ago well we were going into the worst part of the last ice age the last ice age started roughly one hundred and twenty thousand years ago it went up and down and it really started to accelerate around seventy thousand years ago lots of evidence from
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 780.19 794.36 <o,f0,male> now africa is the most tropical continent on the planet about eighty five percent of it lies between cancer and capricorn and there aren't a lot of glaciers here except on the high mountains here in east africa so what was going on here we weren't covered in ice in africa
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 814.78 828.41 <o,f0,male> so the whole world was drying out the sea levels were dropping and africa was turning into desert the sahara was much bigger then than it is now and the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets compared to what we have today
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 828.89 840.39 <o,f0,male> the evidence from genetic data is that the human population around this time roughly seventy thousand years ago crashed to fewer than two thousand individuals we nearly went extinct we were hanging on by our fingernails
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 858.34 869.45 <o,f0,male> now at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists or physical anthropologists in the audience basically there's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 884.86 892.66 <o,f0,male> but then fifty sixty seventy thousand years ago somewhere in that region all hell breaks loose art makes its appearance
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 893.00 902.69 <o,f0,male> the stone tools become much more finely crafted the evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species at particular times of the year the population size started to expand
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 903.34 913.36 <o,f0,male> probably according to what many linguists believe fully modern language syntactic language subject verb object that we use to convey complex ideas like i'm doing now appeared around that time
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 913.61 922.36 <o,f0,male> we became much more social the social networks expanded this change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in africa
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 934.55 945.51 <o,f0,male> you're it the reason you're alive today is because of those changes in our brains that took place in africa probably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now around sixty seventy thousand years ago
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 946.43 957.64 <o,f0,male> allowing us not only to survive in africa but to expand out of africa and early coastal migration along the south coast of asia leaving africa around sixty thousand years ago reaching australia very rapidly by fifty thousand years ago
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 969.97 980.86 <o,f0,male> in killing the animals hunting the animals on those meat locker savannahs moving up following the grasslands into the middle east around forty five thousand years ago during one of the rare wet phases in the sahara
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 981.41 990.56 <o,f0,male> migrating eastward following the grasslands because that's what they were adapted to live on and when they reached central asia they reached what was effectively a steppe super highway
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 990.59 997.45 <o,f0,male> a grassland super highway the grasslands at that time this was during the last ice age stretched basically from germany all the way over to korea
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1006.82 1019.65 <o,f0,male> siberia inside the arctic circle during the last ice age temperature was at seventy a eighty a even one hundred a perhaps migrating into the americas ultimately reaching that final frontier an amazing story and it
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1020.55 1034.98 <o,f0,male> first in africa the changes that allowed us to do that the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us allowing us to create novel cultures allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one i've just been on
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1036.08 1044.06 <o,f0,male> now that story i just told you is literally a whirlwind tour of how we populated the world the great paleolithic wanderings of our species
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1044.41 1053.63 <o,f0,male> and that's the story that i told a couple of years ago in my book the journey of man and a film that we made with the same title and as we were
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1055.77 1068.12 <o,f0,male> i started talking to the folks at ng about this work and they got really excited about it they liked the film but they said you know we really see this as kind of the next wave in the study of human origins where we all came from
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1081.95 1092.07 <o,f0,male> and i said well you know what i've sketched out here is just that it is a very coarse sketch of how we migrated around the planet and it's based on a few thousand people we've sampled from
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1092.31 1102.43 <o,f0,male> you know a handful of populations around the world studied a few genetic markers and there are lots of gaps on this map we've just connected the dots what we need to do is increase our sample size
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1102.69 1107.85 <o,f0,male> by an order of magnitude or more hundreds of thousands of dna samples from people all over the world
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1118.33 1128.64 <o,f0,male> the field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples people who have lived in the same location for a long period of time retain a connection to the place where they live that many of the rest of us have lost
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1129.05 1140.64 <o,f0,male> so my ancestors come from all over northern europe i live in the eastern seaboard of north america when i'm not traveling where am i indigenous to nowhere really my genes are all jumbled up but there are people who retain that link to their ancestors
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1150.16 1159.42 <o,f0,male> but in addition we wanted to open up this study to anybody around the world how often do you get to participate in a big scientific project the human genome project or a mars rover mission
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1159.64 1168.13 <o,f0,male> in this case you actually can you can go onto our website nationalgeographic com genographic you can order a kit you can test your own dna
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1168.69 1176.88 <o,f0,male> and you can actually submit those results to the database and tell us a little about your genealogical background have the data analyzed as part of the scientific effort
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1177.71 1188.44 <o,f0,male> now this is all a nonprofit enterprise so the money that we raise after we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components gets plowed back into the project the majority going to something we call the legacy fund
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1188.95 1199.19 <o,f0,male> a charitable entity basically a grant giving entity that gives money back to indigenous groups around the world for educational cultural projects initiated by them they apply to this fund
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1207.77 1215.44 <o,f0,male> the most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public two hundred and ten thousand people have ordered these participation kits since we launched two years ago
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1215.63 1225.41 <o,f0,male> which has raised about five million dollars the majority of which at least half is going back into the legacy fund we've just awarded the first legacy grants totaling around five hundred thousand dollars
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1235.29 1242.65 <o,f0,male> so the project is going very very well and i urge you to check out the website and watch this space thank you very much
