JR_2011 1 JR_2011 16.27 26.93 <o,f0,male> i was in my studio in paris and the phone rang and i heard hey jr you won the ted prize two thousand and eleven you have to make a wish to save the world
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 56.19 70.23 <o,f0,male> told her look amy tell the ted guys i just won 't show up i can 't do anything to save the world she said hey jr your wish is not to save the world but to change the world oh all right
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 78.42 82.08 <o,f0,male> not always in a good way but they do what about art
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 82.46 84.04 <o,f0,male> could art change the world
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 86.88 90.05 <o,f0,male> i started when i was fifteen years old and at that time
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 90.27 95.8 <o,f0,male> i was not thinking about changing the world i was doing graffiti writing my name everywhere
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 95.98 97.77 <o,f0,male> using the city as a canvas
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 99.59 104.11 <o,f0,male> i was going in the tunnels of paris on the rooftops with my friends
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 104.6 107.56 <o,f0,male> each trip was an excursion was an adventure
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 108.09 114.83 <o,f0,male> it was like leaving our mark on society to say i was here on the top of a building
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 132.68 134.9 <o,f0,male> that 's how at seventeen years old
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 135.44 138.03 <o,f0,male> i started pasting them and i did my first
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 173.93 184.04 <o,f0,male> that 's on the champs elysees i was quite proud of that one because i was just eighteen and i was just up there on the top of the champs elysees then when the photo left the frame was still there
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 196.14 202.09 <o,f0,male> everyone was glued to the tv watching disturbing frightening images
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 206.44 208.42 <o,f0,male> i mean these kids without control
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 228.01 243.25 <o,f0,male> revealed by a burning car a pasting i 'd done a year earlier an illegal one still there i mean these were the faces of my friends i know those guys all of them are not angels but they 're not monsters either
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 245.17 259.75 <o,f0,male> so it was kind of weird to see those images and those eyes stare back at me through a television so i went back there with a twenty eight mm lens it was the only one i had at that time but with that lens
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 259.75 265.7 <o,f0,male> you have to be as close as ten inches from the person so you can do it only with their trust
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 270.9 274.83 <o,f0,male> they were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 286.28 296.06 <o,f0,male> and then i pasted huge posters everywhere in the bourgeois area of paris with the name age even building number
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 317.22 323.18 <o,f0,male> own image that 's where i realized the power of paper and glue
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 331 332.94 <o,f0,male> so could art change the world
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 334.21 337.78 <o,f0,male> a year later i was listening to all the noise
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 338.07 346.9 <o,f0,male> about the middle east conflict i mean at that time trust me they were only referring to the israeli and palestinian conflict so with my friend marco we decided to go there
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 347.33 352.66 <o,f0,male> and see who are the real palestinians and who are the real israelis are they so different
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 353.62 357.36 <o,f0,male> when we got there we just went in the street started talking with people
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 364.02 369.58 <o,f0,male> so we decided to take portraits of palestinians and israelis doing the same jobs
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 385.81 400.07 <o,f0,male> i decided to paste in eight israeli and palestinian cities and on both sides of the wall we launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever we called the project face two face
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 401.25 403.06 <o,f0,male> the experts said no way
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 409.25 412.1 <o,f0,male> we said okay let 's try and push as far as we can
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 413.28 420 <o,f0,male> i love the way that people will ask me how big will my photo be it will be as big as your house
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 429.26 439.73 <o,f0,male> down no wait i 'm going to find you a solution so he went to the church of nativity and brought back an old ladder that was so old that it could have seen jesus being born
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 453.01 456.38 <o,f0,male> we had all sorts of help from all walks of life
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 460.1 469.17 <o,f0,male> okay for example that 's palestine we 're in ramallah right now we 're pasting portraits so both portraits in the streets in a crowded market people come around us
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 469.48 482.76 <o,f0,male> and start asking what are you doing here oh we 're actually doing an art project and we are placing an israeli and a palestinian doing the same job and those ones are actually two taxi drivers and then there was always a silence
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 483.1 490.92 <o,f0,male> you mean you 're pasting an israeli face doing a face right here well yeah yeah that 's part of the project
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 533.25 535.72 <o,f0,male> face two face demonstrated that
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 548.07 562.32 <o,f0,male> in the middle east i experienced my work in places without many museums so this direction in the street were kind of interesting so i decided to go further in this direction and go in places where there were zero museums
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 582.98 585.55 <o,f0,male> i called that project women are heroes
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 604.94 606.74 <o,f0,male> i just took their pictures
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 614.88 619.78 <o,f0,male> most of the places i went to i decided to go there because i 've heard about it
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 644.79 649.44 <o,f0,male> they brought them to an enemy favela where they get chopped into pieces
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 671.38 673.01 <o,f0,male> so we just walked around
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 684.6 687.04 <o,f0,male> so i went out and i started with the kids
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 687.76 692.28 <o,f0,male> i just took a few photos of the kids and the next day i came with the posters and we pasted them
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 692.36 695.02 <o,f0,male> the day after i came back and they were already scratched
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 695.5 700.18 <o,f0,male> but that 's okay i wanted them to feel that this art belongs to them
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 702.34 716.52 <o,f0,male> then the next day i held a meeting on the main square and some women came they were all linked to the three kids that got killed there was the mother the grandmother the best friend they all wanted to shout the story
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 719.24 727.15 <o,f0,male> after that day everyone in the favela gave me the green light i took more photos and we started the project
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 727.15 734.79 <o,f0,male> the drug lords were kind of worried about us filming in the place so i told them you know what i 'm not interested in filming the violence and the weapons
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 743.06 750.3 <o,f0,male> so that 's a really symbolic pasting because that 's the first one we did that you couldn 't see from the city and that 's where the three kids got arrested
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 750.98 762.54 <o,f0,male> and that 's the grandmother of one of them and on that stairs that 's where the traffickers always stand and there 's a lot of exchange of fire everyone there understood the project
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 791.76 794.29 <o,f0,male> we just did a project and then left
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 794.86 804.27 <o,f0,male> so the media wouldn 't know so how can we know about the project so they had to go and find the women and get an explanation from them
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 810.13 814.88 <o,f0,male> we kept traveling we went to africa sudan sierra leone liberia kenya
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 815.97 826.9 <o,f0,male> in war torn places like monrovia people come straight to you i mean they want to know what you 're up to they kept asking me what is the purpose of your project are you an ngo are you the media
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 831.07 833.99 <o,f0,male> question why is it in black and white don 't you have color in france
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 842.21 850.32 <o,f0,male> and to a man who did not understand i heard someone say you know you 've been here for a few hours trying to understand discussing with your fellows
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 890.7 895.26 <o,f0,male> you might have seen images about the post election violence that happened there in two thousand and eight
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 904.14 907.5 <o,f0,male> paper doesn 't prevent the rain from leaking inside the house
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 944.62 959.08 <o,f0,male> okay india before i start that just so you know each time we go to a place we don 't have a tourist agent so we set up like commandos we 're a group of friends who arrive there and we try to paste on the walls but there are places where you just can 't paste on a wall
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 960.2 967.95 <o,f0,male> in india it was just impossible to paste i heard culturally and because of the law they would just arrest us at the first pasting
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 968.66 981.21 <o,f0,male> so we decided to paste white white on the walls so imagine white guys pasting white papers so people would come to us and ask us hey what are you up to oh you know we 're just doing art
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 1021.84 1027.06 <o,f0,male> each project that 's a film from women are heroes
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 1043.6 1052.22 <o,f0,male> and
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 1060.58 1062.79 <o,f0,female> the
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 1086.38 1098.93 <o,f0,male> and
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 1130.87 1132.78 <o,f0,male> kept that dynamic after we left
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 1132.99 1139.08 <o,f0,male> for example we did books not for sale that all the community would get but to get it they would have
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 1142.65 1144.49 <o,f0,male> we did that in most of the places we go back
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 1144.49 1162.48 <o,f0,male> regularly and so in providencia for example in the favela we have a controlled center running there in kibera each year we cover more roofs because of course when we left the people who were just at the edge of the project said hey what about my roof so we decided to come the year after and keep doing the project
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 1191.77 1204.06 <o,f0,male> and what 's interesting is that fine line that i have with images and advertising we just did some pasting in los angeles on another project in the last weeks and i was even invited to cover the moca museum
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 1204.42 1216.22 <o,f0,male> but yesterday the city called them and said look we 're going to have to tear it down because this can be taken for advertising and because of the law it has to be taken down but tell me advertising for what
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 1218.03 1221.85 <o,f0,male> the people i photograph were proud to participate in the project
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 1254.38 1267.66 <o,f0,male> my artwork anymore i use man ray helen levitt giacomelli other people 's artwork it doesn 't matter today if it 's your photo or not the importance is what you do with the images
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 1314.28 1316.69 <o,f0,male> actually the fact that art cannot change
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 1317.32 1325.17 <o,f0,male> things makes it a neutral place for exchanges and discussions and then enables you to change the world
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 1337.43 1342.02 <o,f0,male> i presume that you belong to the second category and that 's good because
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 1342.66 1346.65 <o,f0,male> for that project i 'm going to ask you to take the photos
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 1356.8 1362.2 <o,f0,male> i wish for you to stand up for what you care about
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 1362.56 1370.61 <o,f0,male> by participating in a global art project and together we 'll turn the world inside out
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 1371.18 1373.6 <o,f0,male> and this starts right now yes
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 1391.62 1397.6 <o,f0,male> upload it i 'll give you all the details and i 'll send you back your poster join by groups
JR_2011 1 JR_2011 1397.97 1400.31 <o,f0,male> and reveal things to the world
