LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 16.31 21.99 <o,f0,female> 'm here today to talk about a disturbing question which has an equally disturbing answer
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 23.18 25.46 <o,f0,female> my topic is the secrets of domestic
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 26.61 28.62 <o,f0,female> and the question i 'm going to tackle
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 28.7 32.03 <o,f0,female> is the one question everyone always asks
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 34.25 37.99 <o,f0,female> why does she stay why would anyone stay with a man who beats her
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 37.99 41.39 <o,f0,female> i 'm not a psychiatrist a social worker
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 41.44 43.25 <o,f0,female> or an expert in domestic violence
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 43.55 46.17 <o,f0,female> i 'm just one woman with a story to tell
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 46.75 56.39 <o,f0,female> i was twenty two i had just graduated from harvard college i had moved to new york city for my first job as a writer and editor at seventeen magazine
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 57.75 62.16 <o,f0,female> i had my first apartment my first little green american express card
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 62.48 64.75 <o,f0,female> and i had a very big secret
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 65.28 66.99 <o,f0,female> my secret was
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 71.4 75.21 <o,f0,female> pointed at my head by the man who i thought was my soulmate
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 75.31 77.61 <o,f0,female> many many times
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 78.21 80.33 <o,f0,female> the man who i loved
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 80.44 82.02 <o,f0,female> more than anybody on earth
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 83 86.38 <o,f0,female> held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 86.57 88.93 <o,f0,female> more times than i can even remember
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 89.36 92.24 <o,f0,female> i 'm here to tell you the story of crazy love
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 92.34 98.5 <o,f0,female> a psychological trap disguised as love one that millions of women and even a few
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 98.74 100.31 <o,f0,female> fall into every year
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 100.84 118.51 <o,f0,female> it may even be your story i don 't look like a typical domestic violence survivor i have a b a in english from harvard college an mba in marketing from wharton business school i 've spent most of my career working for fortune five hundred companies including johnson johnson leo burnett and the washington post
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 118.69 124.94 <o,f0,female> i 've been married for almost twenty years to my second husband and we have three kids together
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 125.27 129.87 <o,f0,female> my dog is a black lab and i drive a honda odyssey minivan
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 136.83 143.05 <o,f0,female> all races all religions all income and education levels it 's everywhere
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 143.27 152.02 <o,f0,female> and my second message is that everyone thinks domestic violence happens to women that it 's a women 's issue not exactly
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 152.5 155.17 <o,f0,female> over eighty five percent of abusers are men
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 155.43 162.27 <o,f0,female> and domestic abuse happens only in intimate interdependent long term relationships
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 162.52 168.27 <o,f0,female> in other words in families the last place we would want or expect to find violence
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 168.38 185.95 <o,f0,female> which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing i would have told you myself that i was the last person on earth who would stay with a man who beats me but in fact i was a very typical victim because of my age i was twenty two and in the united states
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 185.98 194.73 <o,f0,female> women ages sixteen to twenty four are three times as likely to be domestic violence victims as women of other ages
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 194.76 204.96 <o,f0,female> and over five hundred women and girls this age are killed every year by abusive partners boyfriends and husbands in the united states
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 206.78 213.36 <o,f0,female> i was also a very typical victim because i knew nothing about domestic violence its warning signs or its patterns
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 213.92 216.03 <o,f0,female> i met conor
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 216.16 218.64 <o,f0,female> on a cold rainy january night
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 218.83 221.84 <o,f0,female> he sat next to me on the new york city subway
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 222.3 223.82 <o,f0,female> and he started chatting me up
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 223.89 229.8 <o,f0,female> he told me two things one was that he too had just graduated from an ivy league school
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 229.85 233.7 <o,f0,female> and that he worked at a very impressive wall street bank
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 234.09 240.93 <o,f0,female> but what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting was that he was smart and funny
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 241.09 249.11 <o,f0,female> and he looked like a farm boy he had these big cheeks these big apple cheeks and this wheat blond hair and he seemed so sweet
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 250 258.61 <o,f0,female> one of the smartest things conor did from the very beginning was to create the illusion that i was the dominant partner in the relationship
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 259.19 263.92 <o,f0,female> he did this especially at the beginning by idolizing me
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 264.47 283.55 <o,f0,female> we started dating and he loved everything about me that i was smart that i 'd gone to harvard that i was passionate about helping teenage girls and my job he wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my hopes and dreams conor believed in me as a writer and a woman in a way that no one else
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 296.5 312.61 <o,f0,female> he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused by his stepfather and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade even though he was very smart and he 'd spent almost twenty years rebuilding his life which is why
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 312.74 318.55 <o,f0,female> that ivy league degree and the wall street job and his bright shiny future meant so much to him
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 318.78 321.02 <o,f0,female> if you had told me
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 321.27 323.2 <o,f0,female> that this smart
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 323.27 326.47 <o,f0,female> funny sensitive man who adored me
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 326.66 330.78 <o,f0,female> would one day dictate whether or not i wore makeup
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 330.86 333.18 <o,f0,female> how short my skirts were
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 333.28 338.19 <o,f0,female> where i lived what jobs i took who my friends were and where i spent christmas
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 338.48 345.08 <o,f0,female> i would have laughed at you because there was not a hint of violence or control or anger in conor
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 348.85 352.76 <o,f0,female> that the first stage in any domestic violence relationship
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 352.79 355.22 <o,f0,female> is to seduce and charm the victim
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 355.68 362.59 <o,f0,female> i also didn 't know that the second step is to isolate the victim now conor did not
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 362.62 365.65 <o,f0,female> come home one day and announce
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 383.96 387.01 <o,f0,female> instead conor came home one friday evening
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 387.4 391.89 <o,f0,female> and he told me that he had quit his job that day his dream job
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 392.44 396.12 <o,f0,female> and he said that he had quit his job because of me
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 396.16 415.41 <o,f0,female> because i had made him feel so safe and loved that he didn 't need to prove himself on wall street anymore and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his abusive dysfunctional family and move to a tiny town in new england where he could start his life over with me by his side
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 415.41 418.75 <o,f0,female> now the last thing i wanted to do was leave new york
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 419.5 421.6 <o,f0,female> and my dream job
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 421.68 425.32 <o,f0,female> but i thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 431.2 433.56 <o,f0,female> i had no idea
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 433.69 435.53 <o,f0,female> i was falling into crazy love
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 435.55 442.55 <o,f0,female> that i was walking headfirst into a carefully laid physical financial and psychological trap
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 443.01 452.23 <o,f0,female> the next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence and see how she reacts
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 453.56 455.32 <o,f0,female> and here 's where those guns come in
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 455.59 458.36 <o,f0,female> as soon as we moved to new england
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 458.47 461.11 <o,f0,female> you know that place where connor was supposed to feel so safe
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 463.53 466.59 <o,f0,female> he bought three guns he kept one in the glove compartment of our car
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 467.31 469.82 <o,f0,female> he kept one under the pillows on our bed
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 470.11 472.92 <o,f0,female> and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 473.09 483.26 <o,f0,female> and he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma he 'd experienced as a young boy he needed them to feel protected but those guns were really a message for me
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 483.37 490.28 <o,f0,female> and even though he hadn 't raised a hand to me my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 491.96 494.75 <o,f0,female> conor first physically attacked
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 502.76 508.59 <o,f0,female> i was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment and i got frustrated
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 508.7 514.49 <o,f0,female> and conor used my anger as an excuse to put both of his hands around my neck
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 514.86 518.6 <o,f0,female> and to squeeze so tightly that i could not breathe or scream
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 518.7 520.51 <o,f0,female> and he used the chokehold
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 520.51 523.82 <o,f0,female> to hit my head repeatedly against the wall
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 524.78 526.93 <o,f0,female> five days later
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 527.57 529.94 <o,f0,female> the ten bruises on my neck had just faded
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 535.99 539.85 <o,f0,female> despite what had happened i was sure we were going to live happily ever
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 554.35 558 <o,f0,female> it was an isolated incident and he was never going to hurt me again
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 558.06 561.07 <o,f0,female> it happened twice more on the honeymoon
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 561.45 565.3 <o,f0,female> the first time i was driving to find a secret beach
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 567.25 570.11 <o,f0,female> and i got lost and he punched me in the side of my head so hard
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 570.25 574.16 <o,f0,female> that the other side of my head repeatedly hit the driver 's side window
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 574.53 578.18 <o,f0,female> and then a few days later driving home from our honeymoon
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 578.69 580.44 <o,f0,female> he got frustrated by traffic
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 580.82 590.1 <o,f0,female> and he threw a cold big mac in my face conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 590.1 601.72 <o,f0,female> i was mistaken in thinking that i was unique and alone in this situation one in three american women experiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 602 607.4 <o,f0,female> and the cdc reports that fifteen million children are abused every year
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 613 615.51 <o,f0,female> back to my question
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 621.1 623.38 <o,f0,female> i didn 't know he was abusing
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 623.56 637.31 <o,f0,female> even though he held those loaded guns to my head pushed me down stairs threatened to kill our dog pulled the key out of the car ignition as i drove down the highway poured coffee grinds on my head
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 637.76 643.33 <o,f0,female> as i dressed for a job interview i never once thought of myself as a battered wife
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 644.48 650.23 <o,f0,female> instead i was a very strong woman in love with a deeply troubled man
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 650.3 652.05 <o,f0,female> and i was the only person on earth
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 652.45 654.81 <o,f0,female> who could help conor face his demons
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 655.45 659.13 <o,f0,female> the other question everybody asks is
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 661.41 663.44 <o,f0,female> why didn 't i walk out
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 663.59 670.43 <o,f0,female> i could have left any time to me this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 670.49 673.68 <o,f0,female> because we victims know something you usually don 't
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 674.07 682.51 <o,f0,female> it 's incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser because the final step in the domestic violence pattern is kill her
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 683.35 691.02 <o,f0,female> over seventy percent of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has ended the relationship
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 695.85 699.32 <o,f0,female> other outcomes include long term stalking
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 699.38 719.36 <o,f0,female> even after the abuser remarries denial of financial resources and manipulation of the family court system to terrify the victim and her children who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend unsupervised time with the man who beat their mother
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 720.05 722.84 <o,f0,female> and still we ask why doesn 't she just leave
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 724.05 726.02 <o,f0,female> i was able to leave
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 726.17 730.86 <o,f0,female> because of one final sadistic beating that broke through my denial
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 731.99 735.62 <o,f0,female> i realized that the man who i loved so much
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 735.81 737.69 <o,f0,female> was going to kill me if i let him
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 738.1 740.06 <o,f0,female> so i broke the silence
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 740.49 742.82 <o,f0,female> i told everyone
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 752.04 753.56 <o,f0,female> and i 'm here today
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 753.66 755.46 <o,f0,female> because you all helped me
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 757.56 769.69 <o,f0,female> we tend to stereotype victims as grisly headlines self destructive women damaged goods the question why does she stay
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 769.8 772.97 <o,f0,female> is code for some people for
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 781.08 783.96 <o,f0,female> but since publishing crazy love
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 1 LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X 784.16 789.31 <o,f0,female> i have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also got out
