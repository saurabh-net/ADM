CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 29.37 45.16 <o,f0,male> i found myself never having time for all the projects that i wanted to work on on my own and one day i was at work and i saw a talk by stefan sagmeister on ted and it was called the power of time off and he spoke about how every seven years he takes a year off from work so he could
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 45.16 53.08 <o,f0,male> do his own creative projects and i was instantly inspired and i just said i have to do that i have to take a year off i need to
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 65.58 73.75 <o,f0,male> basically i 'm recording one second of every day of my life for the rest of my life chronologically compiling these one second
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 73.92 77.57 <o,f0,male> tiny slices of my life into one single continuous video
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 83.42 88.98 <o,f0,male> the purpose of this project is one i hate not remembering things that i 've done in the past
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 103.57 107.07 <o,f0,male> if i wasn 't doing anything interesting i would probably forget to record the video
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 107.19 123.5 <o,f0,male> so the day the first time that i forgot it really hurt me because it 's something that i really wanted to from the moment that i turned thirty i wanted to keep this project going until forever and having missed that one second i realized it just kind of
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 123.92 128.11 <o,f0,male> created this thing in my head where i never forgot ever again
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 147.36 154.12 <o,f0,male> this has really invigorated me day to day when i wake up to try and do something interesting with my day
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 162.29 165.32 <o,f0,male> now one of the things that i have issues with is that
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 166.13 181.53 <o,f0,male> as the days and weeks and months go by time just seems to start blurring and blending into each other and you know i hated that and visualization is the way to trigger memory
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 190.74 205.74 <o,f0,male> you know this project for me is a way for me to bridge that gap and remember everything that i 've done even just this one second allows me to remember everything else i did that one day it 's difficult sometimes to pick that one second on a good day i 'll have
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 205.74 215.08 <o,f0,male> maybe three or four seconds that i really want to choose but i 'll just have to narrow it down to one but even narrowing it down to that one allows me to remember the other three anyway
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 215.23 229.52 <o,f0,male> it 's also kind of a protest a personal protest against the culture we have now where people just are at concerts with their cell phones out recording the whole concert and they 're disturbing you they 're not even enjoying the show they 're watching the concert through their cell phone
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 229.52 237.76 <o,f0,male> i hate that i admittedly used to be that guy a little bit back in the day and i 've decided that the best way
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 237.85 247.15 <o,f0,male> for me to still capture and keep a visual memory of my life and not be that person is to just record that one second that will allow me to trigger that
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 247.15 254.02 <o,f0,male> memory of yeah that concert was amazing i really loved that concert and it just takes a quick quick second
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 257.22 270.54 <o,f0,male> i was on a three month road trip this summer it was something that i 've been dreaming about doing my whole life just driving around the u s and canada and just figuring out where to go the next day and it was kind of outstanding
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 270.54 283.06 <o,f0,male> i actually ran out i spent too much money on my road trip for the savings that i had to take my year off so i had to i went to seattle and i spent some time with friends working on a really neat project
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 292.2 308.68 <o,f0,male> one of the reasons that i took my year off was to spend more time with my family and this really tragic thing happened where my sister in law her intestine suddenly strangled one day and we took her to the emergency room and she was
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 319.34 322.63 <o,f0,male> it helped me realize something else during this project is that
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 337.47 352.66 <o,f0,male> but we rarely do that when we 're having a bad day and something horrible is happening and i found that it 's actually been very very important to record even just that one second of a really bad moment it really helps you appreciate the good times
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 352.86 354.73 <o,f0,male> it 's not always a good day
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 378.15 387.48 <o,f0,male> i try to capture the moment as much as possible as the way that i saw it with my own eyes i started a rule of first person perspective
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 387.64 399 <o,f0,male> early on i think i had a couple of videos where you would see me in it but i realized that wasn 't the way to go the way to really remember what i saw was to record it as i actually saw it
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 408.14 411.42 <o,f0,male> now a couple of things that i have in my head about this project are
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 417.72 421.12 <o,f0,male> i turned thirty one last week which is there
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 423.72 436.63 <o,f0,male> i think it would be interesting to see what everyone did with a project like this i think everyone would have a different interpretation of it i think everyone would benefit from just having that one second to remember every day personally i 'm tired of
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 444.61 457.81 <o,f0,male> and it 's something that 's i never want to forget another day that i 've ever lived and this is my way of doing that and it 'd be really interesting also to see if you could just type in on a website june eighteen two thousand
