TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 12.95 13.89 <o,f0,male> i would like to
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 14.71 23.63 <o,f0,male> tell you about a project which i started about sixteen years ago and it's about making new forms of life
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 24.88 27.37 <o,f0,male> and these are made of this kind of
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 28.69 33.93 <o,f0,male> electricity tube we call it in holland and we can start a film
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 34.61 35.46 <o,f0,male> about that
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 50.51 51.02 <o,f0,male> i want
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 54.31 60.81 <o,f0,male> forms of life on the beaches and they should survive over there on their own in the future
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 64.50 65.68 <o,f0,male> to live on their own
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 73.39 74.47 <o,f2,male> walk on their own
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 77.04 81.44 <o,f0,female> the mechanical beasts will not get their energy from food but from the wind
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 82.25 85.82 <o,f0,female> the wind will move feathers on their back which will drive their feet
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 86.33 92.31 <o,f0,female> the beast walks sideways on the wet sand of the beach with its nose pointed into the wind
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 100.17 102.17 <o,f0,female> and walks in the opposite direction
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 143.24 145.01 <o,f0,male> is a herd and
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 145.79 155.00 <o,f0,male> it is built according genetical codes and it is a sort of race and each and every animal is different and the winning codes
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 156.62 160.27 <o,f0,male> this is the wave going from left to right you can see this one
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 164.76 172.85 <o,f0,male> and now it goes from yes now it goes from left to right this is a new generation a new family which is able to store
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 174.25 182.80 <o,f0,male> so the wings pump up air in lemonade bottles which are on top of that and they can use that energy
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 182.96 191.62 <o,f0,male> in case the wind falls away and the tide is coming up and there is still a little bit of energy to reach the dunes and save their lives
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 193.01 194.68 <o,f0,male> because they are drowned very easily
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 200.13 201.55 <o,f0,male> i could show you this animal
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 218.35 224.66 <o,f0,male> the proportion of the tubes in this animal is very important for the walking
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 224.85 236.40 <o,f0,male> there are eleven numbers which i call the eleven holy numbers these are the distances of the tubes which makes it walk that way in fact it's a new invention of the wheel
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 236.77 244.99 <o,f0,male> it works the same as a wheel the axis of a wheel is staying on the same level and this hip is staying on the same level as well
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 246.60 254.34 <o,f0,male> better than a wheel because when you try to drive with your bicycle on the beach you will notice it's very
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 254.99 256.59 <o,f0,male> hard to do and
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 258.49 260.34 <o,f0,male> the feet just step over the sand
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 262.48 264.60 <o,f0,male> to touch every piece of the ground in between
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 265.73 268.99 <o,f0,male> so five thousand years after the invention of the wheel
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 277.33 279.02 <o,f0,male> very heavy loads can be
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 289.55 289.75 <o,f0,male> the
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 298.11 307.42 <o,f0,male> on the stored winds in the bottles it has a feeler where it can feel obstacles and turn around and that stuff you see is going to it the other way
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 318.55 319.99 <o,f0,male> have the feeler here
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 331.42 334.35 <o,f0,male> they have to survive all the dangers of the beach
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 336.21 338.54 <o,f0,male> big dangers is the sea this is the sea
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 339.48 340.23 <o,f0,male> and it must
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 340.95 341.76 <o,f0,male> the water
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 343.92 346.89 <o,f0,male> this is the water feeler and what's very important is this
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 348.17 351.85 <o,f0,male> it sucks in air normally
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 352.47 359.82 <o,f0,male> but when it swallows water it feels the resistance of it so imagine that the animal is walking
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 365.13 369.39 <o,f0,male> as soon as it touches the water you should hear a sort of
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 384.12 388.49 <o,f0,male> so if it doesn't feel it will be drowned ok
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 394.57 396.36 <o,f0,male> we have the brain of the animal
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 398.07 406.85 <o,f0,male> in fact it is a step counter and it counts the steps it's a binary step counter so as soon it has been to the
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 409.68 413.09 <o,f0,male> it changes the pattern of zeroes and ones here
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 415.67 420.74 <o,f0,male> it knows always where it is on the beach so it's very simple brain
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 434.11 435.26 <o,f0,male> the biggest
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 438.68 440.04 <o,f0,male> the storms
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 441.37 443.64 <o,f0,male> this is a part of the nose of
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 449.64 452.76 <o,f0,male> and when the nose is fixed of the animal the whole animal is fixed
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 455.13 456.20 <o,f0,male> when the storm is coming
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 468.23 473.10 <o,f0,male> the whole animal is fixed the wind may turn but the animal will turn always its nose into the wind
TheoJansen_2007 1 TheoJansen_2007 477.76 485.48 <o,f0,male> now another couple of years and these animals will survive on their own i still have to help them a lot thank you very much
