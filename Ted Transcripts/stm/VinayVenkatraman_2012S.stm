VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 23.22 27.42 <o,f0,male> alternate visions of how to create a digitally inclusive society
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 27.45 32.19 <o,f0,male> that 's what we 're after and we do this because we actually believe
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 32.21 41.25 <o,f0,male> that silicon technology today is mostly about a culture of excess it 's about the fastest and the most efficient and the most dazzling gadget you can have
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 44.57 51.06 <o,f0,male> can hardly reach the most basic of this technology to even address fundamental needs in life
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 51.34 55.66 <o,f0,male> including health care education and all these kinds of
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 55.69 57.37 <o,f0,male> very fundamental issues
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 57.51 63.23 <o,f0,male> so before i start i want to talk about a little anecdote a little story about a man i met
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 74.74 91.98 <o,f0,male> he has this little ten square meter store where so much is being done it 's incredible because i couldn 't believe my eyes when i once just happened to bump into him basically what he does is he has all these services for micro payments and booking tickets and all kinds of basic things that you would
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 91.98 96.67 <o,f0,male> go online for but he does it for people offline and connects to the digital world
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 107.41 111.43 <o,f0,male> with a few of his employees where they can fix almost anything
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 111.81 118.46 <o,f0,male> any cell phone any gadget you can bring them they can fix it and it 's pretty incredible because i took my iphone there
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 118.63 120.83 <o,f0,male> and he was like yeah do you want an upgrade
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 144.53 152.91 <o,f0,male> rewrite the circuitry re flash the firmware do whatever you want to with the phone and they can fix anything so quickly you can hand over a phone
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 152.93 155.41 <o,f0,male> this morning and you can go pick it up after lunch
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 155.42 161.63 <o,f0,male> and it was quite incredible but then we were wondering whether this is a local phenomenon or is truly global
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 161.64 171.33 <o,f0,male> and over time we started understanding and systematically researching what this tinkering ecosystem is about because that is something that 's happening not just in one street corner
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 174.62 184.83 <o,f0,male> it 's even happening in africa like for example in cape town we did extensive research on this even here in doha i found this little nook where you can get alarm clocks and watches fixed
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 191.67 193.6 <o,f0,male> it 's this entire ecosystem
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 193.7 199.19 <o,f0,male> of low cost parts and supplies that are produced all over the world literally and then
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 199.2 215.45 <o,f0,male> redistributed to basically service this industry and you can even buy salvaged parts basically you don 't have to necessarily buy brand new things you have condemned computers that are stripped apart and you can buy salvaged components and things that you can reassemble in a new configuration
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 216.05 217.61 <o,f0,male> but what does this new
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 217.62 233.65 <o,f0,male> sort of approach give us that 's the real question because this is something that 's been there part of every society that 's deprived of enough resources but there 's an interesting paradigm there 's the traditional crafts and then there 's the technology crafts we call it the technology crafts because these are emerging
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 233.66 236.37 <o,f0,male> they 're not something that 's been established it 's not
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 236.6 243.97 <o,f0,male> something that 's institutionalized it 's not taught in universities it 's taught by word of mouth and it 's an informal education system around
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 248.97 255.07 <o,f0,male> the main thing is a fix it locally culture which is fantastic because it means that your product or your service doesn 't have
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 273.16 277.67 <o,f0,male> other kinds of extendable ideas into really simple devices
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 289.41 291.41 <o,f0,male> in small digital shops
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 291.5 293.88 <o,f0,male> across the planet in most developing countries
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 310.28 313.25 <o,f0,male> schools in very remote parts of india
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 313.46 325.19 <o,f0,male> so there is this amazing concept called the one teacher school which is basically a single teacher who is a multitasker who teaches this amazing little social setting it 's an informal school but it 's really about holistic education
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 325.5 332.09 <o,f0,male> the only thing that they don 't have is access to resources they don 't even have a textbook sometimes and they don 't even have a proper curriculum
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 332.34 333.92 <o,f0,male> so we said what can we do
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 333.93 335.57 <o,f0,male> to empower this teacher
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 335.75 342.89 <o,f0,male> to do more how to access the digital world instead of being the sole guardian of information be a facilitator to all this information
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 343.1 352.05 <o,f0,male> so we said what are the steps required to empower the teacher how do you make this teacher into a digital gateway and how do you design an inexpensive multimedia platform
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 352.07 354.85 <o,f0,male> that can be constructed locally and serviced locally
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 355.15 360.54 <o,f0,male> so we walked around we went and scavenged the nearby markets and we tried to understand
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 360.75 363.27 <o,f0,male> what can we pick up that will make this happen
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 385.68 388.6 <o,f0,male> the flashlight gives us this really intense bright l e d
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 391.98 395.62 <o,f0,male> and the lunch box is a nice little package in which you can put everything inside
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 396.25 401.41 <o,f0,male> and a bunch of mini speakers to sort of amplify the sound large enough believe me those little classrooms
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 433.04 435.1 <o,f0,male> systematically field tested
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 435.22 438.31 <o,f0,male> because in the field testing we learned some important lessons
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 442.83 446.53 <o,f0,male> luminosity was an issue when you have too much bright sunlight outside
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 446.53 449.54 <o,f0,male> often the roofs are broken so you don 't have enough
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 449.72 452.2 <o,f0,male> darkness in the classroom to do these things
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 470.01 476.82 <o,f0,male> and the other key thing that we did was make this box run off a usb key because we realized that even though there was gprs and all that
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 479.3 488.48 <o,f0,male> it was much more efficient to send the data on a little usb key by surface mail it might take a few days to get there but at least it gets there in high definition
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 498.04 504.5 <o,f0,male> education this kind of a technique or metrology can actually be applied to other kinds of areas and i 'm going to tell you one more little story
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 504.92 510.82 <o,f0,male> it 's about this little device called a medi meter it 's basically a little health care screening tool that we developed
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 526.17 528.81 <o,f0,male> inform people to basically
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 529.23 531.47 <o,f0,male> how to lead a better life but also
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 539.71 543.45 <o,f0,male> but the problem with that is that we realized after a bunch of research
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 550.28 553.73 <o,f0,male> but what happens at the public health care system is this
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 555.94 558.26 <o,f0,male> and too many people who overload the system
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 558.33 569.23 <o,f0,male> simply because there 's not enough doctors and facilities for the population that 's being referred so everything from a common cold to a serious case of malaria gets almost the same level of attention
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 569.31 570.89 <o,f0,male> and there 's no priorities
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 571.21 574.09 <o,f0,male> so we said come on there 's got to be a better way of doing this for sure
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 574.43 584.45 <o,f0,male> so we said what can we do with the asha worker that 'll allow this asha worker to become an interesting filter but not just a filter a really well thought through referral system
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 584.59 587.33 <o,f0,male> that allows load balancing of the network
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 589.36 594.7 <o,f0,male> patients to different sources of health care based on the severity or the criticalness of those situations
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 595.29 598.72 <o,f0,male> so the real key question was how do we empower this woman
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 598.85 601.11 <o,f0,male> how do we empower her with simple tools
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 601.24 607.2 <o,f0,male> that 's not diagnostic but more screening in nature so she at least knows how to advise the patients better
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 607.38 610.37 <o,f0,male> and that 'll make such a huge difference on the system because
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 610.53 612.65 <o,f0,male> the amount of waiting time
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 613 621.81 <o,f0,male> and the amount of distances that people need to travel often sometimes seven to fifteen kilometers sometimes by foot to get a simple health check done
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 622.04 628.54 <o,f0,male> is very very detrimental in the sense that it really dissuades people from getting access to health care
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 628.66 630.72 <o,f0,male> so if there was something that she could do
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 630.82 640.71 <o,f0,male> that would be amazing so what we did was that we converted this device into a medical device i want to demo this actually because it 's a very simple process
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 641 642.66 <o,f0,male> bruno do you want to join us
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 724.02 730.29 <o,f0,male> so that was a very simple three step screening process that could basically change the equation of how public health care works
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 743.25 749.11 <o,f0,male> so essentially the three things that are required to make this conversion from this guy
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 760.46 764.08 <o,f0,male> basically something that you can scavenge for very low cost
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 774.39 781.04 <o,f0,male> and that 's what is all required with a little bit of local tinkering talent to convert the device into something else
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 800.52 811.67 <o,f0,male> but most importantly what we are trying to do right now is we are trying to scale this up because there are over two hundred and fifty thousand asha workers on the ground who are these amazing foot soldiers and if we can give
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 811.67 821.97 <o,f0,male> at least a fraction of them the access to these things it just changes the way the economics of public health care works and it changes the way systems actually function not just
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 822.28 828.05 <o,f0,male> on a systematic planning level but also in a very grassroots bottom up level
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 828.16 831.28 <o,f0,male> so that 's it and we hope to do this in a big way thank you
