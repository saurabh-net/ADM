ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 17.18 28.64 <o,f0,female> that's what i do in life telling stories writing novels and today i would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 29.57 36.18 <o,f0,female> but before i go there please allow me to share with you glimpses of my personal story i will do so with the help of
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 36.49 44.25 <o,f0,female> words of course but also a geometrical shape the circle so throughout my talk you will come across several circles
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 45.70 47.74 <o,f0,female> i was born in strasbourg france
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 58.63 70.49 <o,f0,female> now in the early nineteen seventies in ankara that was a bit unusual our neighborhood was full of large families where fathers were the heads of households so i grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee in
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 72.59 81.58 <o,f0,female> in fact i grew up observing two different kinds of womanhood on the one hand was my mother a well educated secular modern westernized turkish woman
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 81.97 90.14 <o,f0,female> on the other hand was my grandmother who also took care of me and was more spiritual less educated and definitely less rational
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 90.40 104.80 <o,f0,female> this was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future and melted lead into mysterious shapes to fend off the evil eye many people visited my grandmother people with severe acne on their faces or warts on their hands
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 105.18 115.31 <o,f0,female> each time my grandmother would utter some words in arabic take a red apple and stab it with as many rose thorns as the number of warts she wanted to remove
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 115.69 122.21 <o,f0,female> then one by one she would encircle these thorns with dark ink a week later the patient would come
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 122.50 130.26 <o,f0,female> for a follow up examination now i'm aware that i should not be saying such things in front of an audience of scholars and scientists
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 130.76 139.96 <o,f0,female> but the truth is of all the people who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions i did not see anyone go back unhappy or unhealed
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 140.60 148.63 <o,f0,female> i asked her how she did this was it the power of praying in response she said yes praying is effective but also beware of the power of
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 149.82 163.93 <o,f0,female> from her i learned among many other things one very precious lesson that if you want to destroy something in this life be it an acne a blemish or the human soul all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls it will dry
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 165.54 173.09 <o,f0,female> now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle we all do we're born into a certain family nation class
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 181.40 182.24 <o,f0,female> up inside
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 198.17 209.25 <o,f0,female> means we are surrounded with our mirror image now one other thing women like my grandma do in turkey is to cover mirrors with velvet or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 230.77 241.30 <o,f0,female> the rich and the poor east and west alike we tend to form clusters based on similarity and then we produce stereotypes about other clusters of people
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 241.63 250.09 <o,f0,female> in my opinion one way of transcending these cultural ghettos is through the art of storytelling stories cannot demolish frontiers
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 250.59 259.24 <o,f0,female> but they can punch holes in our mental walls and through those holes we can get a glimpse of the other and sometimes even like what we see
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 259.77 268.19 <o,f0,female> i started writing fiction at the age of eight my mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook and asked me if i'd be interested in keeping a personal journal
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 268.70 279.23 <o,f0,female> in retrospect i think she was slightly worried about my sanity i was constantly telling stories at home which was good except i told this to imaginary friends around me which was not so good
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 279.85 293.68 <o,f0,female> i was an introverted child to the point of communicating with colored crayons and apologizing to objects when i bumped into them so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my day to day experiences and emotions
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 294.27 306.14 <o,f0,female> what she didn't know was that i thought my life was terribly boring and the last thing i wanted to do was to write about myself instead i began to write about people other than me and things that never really
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 306.80 315.89 <o,f0,female> and thus began my life long passion for writing fiction so from the very beginning fiction for me was less of an autobiographical manifestation
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 316.29 324.92 <o,f0,female> a transcendental journey into other lives other possibilities and please bear with me i'll draw a circle and come back to this point
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 325.61 339.13 <o,f0,female> now one other thing happened around this same time my mother became a diplomat so from this small superstitious middle class neighborhood of my grandmother i was zoomed into this posh international school where i was the only turk
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 340.13 348.71 <o,f0,female> it was here that i had my first encounter with what i call the representative foreigner in our classroom there were children from all nationalities
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 349.14 355.76 <o,f0,female> yet this diversity did not necessarily lead to a cosmopolitan egalitarian classroom democracy
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 365.64 379.77 <o,f0,female> we were like a miniature united nations which was fun except whenever something negative with regards to a nation or a religion took place the child who represented it was mocked ridiculed and bullied endlessly
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 380.08 391.70 <o,f0,female> and i should know because during the time that i attended that school a military takeover happened in my country a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the pope and turkey got zero points in the eurovision song
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 394.40 401.95 <o,f0,female> i skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sailor during those days i also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 402.26 412.27 <o,f0,female> the other children asked me about the movie midnight express which i had not seen they inquired how many cigarettes a day i smoked because they thought all turks were heavy smokers
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 412.64 423.37 <o,f0,female> and they wondered at what age i would start covering my hair i came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country politics cigarettes and the veil
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 424.48 432.05 <o,f0,female> after spain we went to jordan germany and ankara again everywhere i went i felt like my imagination was the only
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 432.98 441.42 <o,f0,female> i could take with me stories gave me a sense of center continuity and coherence the three big cs that i otherwise lacked
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 441.90 449.77 <o,f0,female> in my mid twenties i moved to istanbul the city i adore i lived in a very vibrant diverse neighborhood where i wrote several of my
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 460.30 472.71 <o,f0,female> there was the local grocer there a grumpy old man who didn't sell alcohol and didn't speak to marginals he was sitting next to a transvestite with a long black wig and mascara running down
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 473.95 482.85 <o,f0,female> i watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trembling hands and offer one to her and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 483.07 496.23 <o,f0,female> a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite smoking together on the sidewalk in the face of death and destruction our mundane differences evaporated and we all became one even if for a few hours
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 497.04 505.23 <o,f0,female> but i've always believed that stories too have a similar effect on us i'm not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake but when we are reading a good novel
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 505.61 515.88 <o,f0,female> we leave our small cozy apartments behind go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been biased against
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 524.62 532.26 <o,f0,female> as a linguistic one i started writing fiction in english i'm not an immigrant refugee or exile they ask me why i do this
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 532.67 541.96 <o,f0,female> but the commute between languages gives me the chance to recreate myself i love writing in turkish which to me is very poetic and very emotional
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 542.28 549.28 <o,f0,female> and i love writing in english which to me is very mathematical and cerebral so i feel connected to each language in a different way
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 549.69 562.15 <o,f0,female> for me like millions of other people around the world today english is an acquired language when you're a late comer to a language what happens is you live there with a continuous
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 562.53 572.90 <o,f0,female> and perpetual frustration as late comers we always want to say more you know crack better jokes say better things but we end up saying less because there's a gap between the mind and the
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 573.57 584.87 <o,f0,female> and that gap is very intimidating but if we manage not to be frightened by it it's also stimulating and this is what i discovered in boston that frustration was very stimulating
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 585.28 591.25 <o,f0,female> at this stage my grandmother who had been watching the course of my life with increasing anxiety started to
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 592.35 600.15 <o,f0,female> daily prayers that i urgently get married so that i could settle down once and for all and because god loves her i did get married
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 616.01 628.41 <o,f0,female> i guess one part of me has always been a nomad physically and spiritually stories accompany me keeping my pieces and memories together like an existential glue yet as much as i love stories
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 628.98 639.74 <o,f0,female> recently i've also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story and this is a subject that i would love to think about together
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 640.23 649.85 <o,f0,female> when my first novel written in english came out in america i heard an interesting remark from a literary critic i liked your book he said but i wish you had written it differently
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 653.29 662.35 <o,f0,female> i asked him what he meant by that he said well look at it there's so many spanish american hispanic characters in it but there's only one turkish character and it's a man
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 662.84 670.90 <o,f0,female> now the novel took place on a university campus in boston so to me it was normal that there be more international characters in it than turkish characters
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 671.28 685.05 <o,f0,female> but i understood what my critic was looking for and i also understood that i would keep disappointing him he wanted to see the manifestation of my identity he was looking for a turkish woman in the book because i happened to be one
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 685.44 696.64 <o,f0,female> we often talk about how stories change the world but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated read and
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 697.78 705.51 <o,f0,female> many authors feel this pressure but non western authors feel it more heavily if you're a woman writer from the muslim world like me
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 705.80 712.92 <o,f0,female> then you are expected to write the stories of muslim women and preferably the unhappy stories of unhappy muslim women
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 713.36 721.84 <o,f0,female> you're expected to write informative poignant and characteristic stories and leave the experimental and avant garde to your western
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 722.67 736.15 <o,f0,female> what i experienced as a child in that school in madrid is happening in the literary world today writers are not seen as creative individuals on their own but as the representatives of their respective cultures
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 736.42 744.93 <o,f0,female> a few authors from china a few from turkey a few from nigeria we're all thought to have something very distinctive if not peculiar
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 767.15 780.67 <o,f0,female> when identity politics tries to put labels on us it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger there's a fuzzy category called multicultural literature in which all authors from outside the western world are lumped together
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 781.32 793.55 <o,f0,female> never forget my first multicultural reading in harvard square about ten years ago we were three writers one from the philippines one turkish and one indonesian like a joke you know and
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 795.72 807.06 <o,f0,female> the reason why we were brought together was not because we shared an artistic style or a literary taste it was only because of our passports multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 820.29 828.57 <o,f0,female> quickly add that this tendency to see a story as more than a story does not solely come from the west it comes from everywhere
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 828.89 837.35 <o,f0,female> and i experienced this firsthand when i was put on trial in two thousand and five for the words my fictional characters uttered in a novel
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 837.61 850.91 <o,f0,female> i had intended to write a constructive multi layered novel about an armenian and a turkish family through the eyes of women my micro story became a macro issue when i was prosecuted
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 851.38 863.16 <o,f0,female> some people criticized others praised me for writing about the turkish armenian conflict but there were times when i wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction it was just a story
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 863.41 872.81 <o,f0,female> and when i say just a story i'm not trying to belittle my work i want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is not as a means to an end
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 873.88 882.70 <o,f0,female> entitled to their political opinions and there are good political novels out there but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 883.33 890.46 <o,f0,female> chekhov said the solution to a problem and the correct way of posing the question are two completely separate things
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 891.84 903.42 <o,f0,female> and only the latter is an artist 's responsibility identity politics divides us fiction connects one is interested in sweeping generalizations the other in nuances
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 903.74 912.18 <o,f0,female> one draws boundaries the other recognizes no frontiers identity politics is made of solid bricks fiction is flowing water
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 922.48 936.23 <o,f0,female> with each new person in the story the meddah would change his voice impersonating that character everybody could go and listen you know ordinary people even the sultan muslims and non muslims stories cut across all boundaries
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 938.72 947.03 <o,f0,female> which were very popular throughout the middle east north africa the balkans and asia today stories continue to transcend borders
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 947.34 957.55 <o,f0,female> when palestinian and israeli politicians talk they usually don't listen to each other but a palestinian reader still reads a novel by a jewish author and vice versa
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 958.11 967.07 <o,f0,female> connecting and empathizing with the narrator literature has to take us beyond if it cannot take us there it is not good literature
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 967.98 981.02 <o,f0,female> books have saved the introverted timid child that i was that i once was but i'm also aware of the danger of fetishizing them when the poet and mystic rumi met his spiritual companion shams of
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 981.74 993.96 <o,f0,female> one of the first things the latter did was to toss rumi 's books into water and watch the letters dissolve the sufis say knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself is far worse than ignorance
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 994.34 1008.18 <o,f0,female> the problem with today 's cultural ghettos is not lack of knowledge we know a lot about each other or so we think but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves it makes us elitist distant and disconnected
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 1020.23 1030.48 <o,f0,female> like that my fiction as well one part of it is rooted in istanbul with strong turkish roots but the other part travels the world connecting to different cultures in
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 1031.77 1045.67 <o,f0,female> to think of my fiction as both local and universal both from here and everywhere now those of you who have been to istanbul have probably seen topkapi palace which was the residence of ottoman sultans for more than four hundred years
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 1046.19 1054.73 <o,f0,female> in the palace just outside the quarters of the favorite concubines there's a called the gathering place of djinn it's between buildings
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 1055.22 1069.41 <o,f0,female> i'm intrigued by this concept we usually distrust those areas that fall in between things we see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 1069.72 1077.58 <o,f0,female> but my point is perhaps that elusive space is what writers and artists need most when i write fiction
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 1077.69 1085.89 <o,f0,female> i cherish elusiveness and changeability i like not knowing what will happen ten pages later i like it when my characters surprise me
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 1086.24 1100.25 <o,f0,female> i might write about a muslim woman in one novel and perhaps it will be a very happy story and in my next book i might write about a handsome gay professor in norway as long as is comes from our hearts we can write about anything
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 1115.36 1124.89 <o,f0,female> is it that in creative writing courses today the very first thing we teach students is write what you know perhaps that's not the right way to start at all
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 1133.97 1144.93 <o,f0,female> we should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write what we can feel we should get out of our cultural ghetto and go visit the next one and the next
ElifShafak_2010G 1 ElifShafak_2010G 1160.85 1169.45 <o,f0,female> be friends for once let us make life easy on us let us be lovers and loved ones the earth shall be left to no one
