ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 16.12 19.43 <o,f0,female> i wanted to share with you today is my challenge
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 19.55 21.15 <o,f0,female> as an iranian artist
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 21.5 23.63 <o,f0,female> as an iranian woman artist
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 23.83 27.03 <o,f0,female> as an iranian woman artist living in exile
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 53.92 55.75 <o,f0,female> if you 're living outside like me
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 68.23 73.82 <o,f0,female> psychological and political space to distance ourselves from the reality
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 81.08 91.35 <o,f0,female> herself also in the position of being the voice the speaker of my people even if i have indeed no access to my own country
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 112.44 115.3 <o,f0,female> we are there to take pride and insist
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 124.29 125.95 <o,f0,female> our atrocious government
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 147.57 154.05 <o,f0,female> because we are considered as artists central to the cultural political social discourse in iran
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 154.14 156.06 <o,f0,female> we are there to inspire
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 156.18 159.09 <o,f0,female> to provoke to mobilize
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 159.56 161.15 <o,f0,female> to bring hope
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 168.21 170.09 <o,f0,female> art is our weapon
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 171.59 174.45 <o,f0,female> culture is a form of resistance
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 175 177.49 <o,f0,female> i envy sometimes the artists of the west
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 178.02 179.79 <o,f0,female> for their freedom of expression
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 180.11 183.89 <o,f0,female> for the fact that they can distance themselves from the question of politics
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 190.14 192.47 <o,f0,female> but also i worry about the west
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 206.12 209.15 <o,f0,female> and culture is beyond communication
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 210.8 215.56 <o,f0,female> my journey as an artist started from a very very personal place
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 215.69 220.69 <o,f0,female> i did not start to make social commentary about my country
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 262.43 269.53 <o,f0,female> i was facing my own personal dilemmas and questions i became immersed in the study of the islamic revolution
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 284.12 302.82 <o,f0,female> the political transformation so in a way by studying a woman you can read the structure and the ideology of the country so i made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse the subject
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 309.14 313.69 <o,f0,female> of love of god faith but violence and crime and cruelty
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 329.19 333.39 <o,f0,female> of the government or the ideology of the islamic revolution
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 346.85 350.01 <o,f0,female> and i fell into a life in exile
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 401.23 416.52 <o,f0,female> who are all looking for an idea of change freedom and democracy while the country of iran equally as if another character also struggled for an idea of freedom and democracy and independence from the foreign interventions
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 422.29 425.03 <o,f0,female> about our history as a country
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 436.55 439.57 <o,f0,female> by the american government by the british government
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 453.06 455.24 <o,f0,female> in the way we had intellectual life
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 456.96 460.46 <o,f0,female> and most of all in the way that we fought for democracy
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 461.31 463.76 <o,f0,female> these are some of the shots actually from my film
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 505.71 509.81 <o,f0,female> these are some of the images and the characters of the film
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 530.37 532.66 <o,f0,female> what is unbelievably ironic
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 593.76 598.87 <o,f0,female> i then discovered why i take so much inspiration from iranian women
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 611.76 616.3 <o,f0,female> i stand here to say that iranian women have found a new voice
ShirinNeshat_2010W 1 ShirinNeshat_2010W 616.92 619.95 <o,f0,female> and their voice is giving me my voice
