NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 16.75 19.58 <o,f0,male> as an architect you design for
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 22.73 24.31 <o,f0,male> with an awareness of the
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 28.02 29.22 <o,f0,male> which is essentially
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 29.97 31.00 <o,f0,male> unknown
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 33.06 34.79 <o,f0,male> the green agenda is probably
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 35.88 39.42 <o,f0,male> the most important agenda and issue of the day
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 40.15 41.47 <o,f0,male> and i'd like to share some
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 44.64 52.90 <o,f0,male> over the last forty years we celebrate our fortieth anniversary this year and to explore and to touch on some
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 69.08 77.09 <o,f0,female> said in the past many many years ago before anybody even invented the concept of a green agenda
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 77.85 79.58 <o,f0,female> that it wasn't about fashion
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 80.48 81.72 <o,f0,female> it was about survival
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 91.47 93.59 <o,f0,female> all the projects which have
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 94.13 97.60 <o,f0,female> in some way been inspired by that agenda
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 98.23 98.67 <o,f0,female> are about
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 103.39 109.32 <o,f0,female> the places and the spaces which determine the quality of life i
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 110.60 115.84 <o,f0,female> rarely actually quote anything so i'm going to try and find a piece of paper if i
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 116.54 119.32 <o,f0,female> can which somebody at the end of last year
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 120.21 121.04 <o,f0,female> ventured the
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 130.87 132.93 <o,f0,female> guy called thomas friedman who wrote
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 133.76 135.79 <o,f0,female> in the herald tribune
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 136.57 138.57 <o,f0,female> about two thousand and six he said
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 140.90 147.74 <o,f0,female> i think the most important thing to happen in two thousand and six was that living and thinking green hit main street
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 149.24 152.03 <o,f0,male> we reached a tipping point this year
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 152.65 156.72 <o,f0,female> living acting designing investing and manufacturing green
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 157.19 169.68 <o,f0,female> came to be understood by a critical mass of citizens entrepreneurs and officials as the most patriotic capitalistic geo political and competitive thing they could do hence my motto
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 170.17 171.34 <o,f0,female> green is the new
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 171.82 177.22 <o,f0,female> red white and blue and i asked myself in a way looking back
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 178.38 179.82 <o,f0,female> when did that
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 181.85 185.84 <o,f0,female> awareness of the planet and its fragility
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 193.96 199.54 <o,f0,female> for the first time man could look back at planet earth and in a way it was
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 205.89 217.68 <o,f0,female> before the kind of collapse of the communist system i was privileged to meet a lot of cosmonauts in space city and other places in russia and interestingly as i think back
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 218.15 225.86 <o,f0,female> they were the first true environmentalists they were filled with a kind of pioneering passion
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 227.38 231.25 <o,f0,female> fired about the problems of the aral sea and
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 232.80 236.55 <o,f0,female> period it was in a way a number of things were happening buckminster fuller
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 237.29 249.87 <o,f0,female> was the kind of green guru again a word that had not been coined he was a design scientist if you like a poet but he foresaw all the things that are happening now
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 257.98 259.66 <o,f0,female> it was at that time
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 262.08 264.61 <o,f0,female> an awareness fired by
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 265.45 268.05 <o,f0,female> bucky 's prophecies his concerns
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 269.13 278.17 <o,f0,female> as a citizen as a kind of citizen of the planet that influenced my thinking and what we were doing at that time and it's
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 289.27 302.48 <o,f0,female> this probably coincided with the time when you had the planet earth 's sourcebook and you had the hippy movement and there are some of those qualities in this drawing which seeks to sum up
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 302.71 312.76 <o,f0,female> the recommendations and all the components are there which are now in common parlance in our vocabulary you know thirty odd years later
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 313.55 317.74 <o,f0,female> wind energy recycling biomass solar cells
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 320.40 329.20 <o,f0,female> in parallel at that time there was a very kind of exclusive design club people who were really
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 329.89 341.82 <o,f0,female> design conscious were inspired by the work of dieter rams and the objects that he would create for the company called braun this is going back the mid fifties sixties and
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 346.40 351.79 <o,f0,female> everything would be miniaturized and technology would make an incredible style access to
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 353.75 362.04 <o,f0,female> to amenities it was very very difficult to imagine that everything that we see in this image would be very very stylishly packaged
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 362.45 371.65 <o,f0,female> and that and more besides would be in the palm of your hand and i think that that digital revolution now is coming to the point
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 372.86 381.87 <o,f0,female> as the virtual world which brings so many people together here finally connects with the physical world there is the
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 383.68 392.96 <o,f0,female> reality that that has become humanized so that digital world has all the friendliness all the immediacy the orientation
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 393.33 402.14 <o,f0,female> of the analog world probably summed up in a way by the stylish or alternative available here as we generously had
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 403.07 416.05 <o,f0,female> gifted at lunchtime the maxin which is a further kind of development and again inspired by the incredible sort of sensual feel a very very beautiful object so something which in
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 417.85 430.66 <o,f0,female> was very exclusive has now become interestingly quite inclusive and the reference to the ipod as iconic and in a way evocative of performance delivery
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 443.43 451.07 <o,f0,female> hybrid energy conscious vehicle which rivals the ipod as an iconic product and i think it's very tempting to
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 451.68 461.59 <o,f0,female> in a way seduce ourselves and as architects or anybody involved with the design process that the answer to our problems lies with buildings buildings are important but
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 463.49 475.76 <o,f0,female> component of a much bigger picture in other words as i might seek to demonstrate if you could achieve the impossible the equivalent of perpetual motion you could design a carbon free house for example
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 476.17 488.68 <o,f0,female> that would be the answer unfortunately it's not the answer it's only the beginning of the problem you cannot separate the buildings out from the infrastructure of cites and the mobility of transit for example
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 489.29 498.74 <o,f0,female> if in that bucky inspired phrase we draw back and we look at planet earth and we take a kind of typical industrialized society
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 498.90 507.21 <o,f0,female> then the energy consumed would be split between the buildings forty four percent transport thirty four percent and industry
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 507.68 518.45 <o,f0,female> but again that only shows part of the picture if you looked at the buildings together with the associated transport in other words the transport of people which is twenty six percent
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 518.90 526.26 <o,f0,female> then seventy percent of the energy consumption is influenced by the way that our cites and infrastructure work together
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 527.92 536.42 <o,f0,female> so the problems of sustainability cannot be separated from the nature of the cities of which the buildings are
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 537.63 543.47 <o,f0,female> for example if you take and you make a comparison between a recent kind of
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 545.64 553.38 <o,f0,female> what i'll call simplistically a north american city and detroit is not a bad example it is very car dependent
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 553.78 565.84 <o,f0,female> the city goes out in annular rings consuming more and more green space and more and more roads and more and more energy in the transport of people between the city center
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 566.24 575.65 <o,f0,female> which again the city center as it becomes deprived of the living and just becomes commercial again becomes dead if you compared detroit
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 576.11 582.95 <o,f0,female> with a city of a northern european example and munich is not a bad example of that
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 583.97 592.53 <o,f0,female> with the greater dependence on walking and cycling then a city which is
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 593.23 604.29 <o,f0,female> really only twice as dense is only using one tenth of the energy in other words you take these comparable examples and the energy leap is enormous
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 606.71 610.30 <o,f0,female> basically if you wanted to generalize you can demonstrate
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 611.03 616.84 <o,f0,female> that as the density increases along the bottom there that the
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 617.59 626.16 <o,f0,female> energy consumed reduces dramatically of course you can't separate this out from issues like social diversity mass transit
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 626.52 635.75 <o,f0,female> the ability to be able to walk a convenient distance the quality of civic spaces but again you can see detroit in yellow
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 635.97 644.41 <o,f0,female> the top extraordinary consumption down below copenhagen and copenhagen although it's a dense city is not dense compared
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 644.92 651.88 <o,f0,female> with the really dense cities and in the year two thousand a rather interesting thing happened
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 652.22 660.07 <o,f0,female> you had for the first time mega cities five million or more which were occurring in the developing world
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 660.47 668.09 <o,f0,female> and now out of typically forty six cities thirty three of those mega cities are in the developing world
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 668.41 682.29 <o,f0,female> so you have to ask yourself the environmental impact of for example china or india if you take china and you just take beijing you can see on that traffic system
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 682.64 689.68 <o,f0,female> and the pollution associated with the consumption of energy as the
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 693.67 696.49 <o,f0,female> at the price of the bicycles in other words
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 696.84 703.51 <o,f0,female> if you put onto the roads as is currently happening one thousand new cars every day
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 704.28 712.14 <o,f0,female> statistically it's the biggest booming auto market in the world and the half a billion
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 720.51 730.07 <o,f0,female> urbanization is extraordinary accelerated pace so if we think of the transition in
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 731.99 746.32 <o,f0,female> of the movement from the land to the cities which took two hundred years then that same process is happening in twenty years in other words it is accelerating by a factor of ten
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 748.18 755.83 <o,f0,female> and quite interestingly over something like a sixty year period we're seeing
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 756.27 763.13 <o,f0,female> the doubling in life expectancy over that period where the urbanization has trebled
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 763.82 777.97 <o,f0,female> if i pull back from that global picture and i look at the implication over a similar period of time in terms of the technology which as a tool is a tool for designers and i cite
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 778.48 786.46 <o,f0,female> our own experience as a company and i just illustrate that by a small selection of projects
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 787.61 797.15 <o,f0,female> how do you measure that change of technology how does it affect the design of buildings and particularly how can it lead
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 797.41 805.34 <o,f0,female> to the creation of buildings which consume less energy create less pollution and are more socially responsible
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 806.51 820.82 <o,f0,female> that story in terms of buildings started in the late sixties early seventies the one example i take is a corporate headquarters for a company called willis and faber in a small market town in
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 823.37 831.14 <o,f0,female> the northeast of england commuting distance with london and here the first thing you can see is that this
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 831.39 839.72 <o,f0,female> building the roof is a very warm kind of overcoat blanket a kind of insulating garden which is also
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 840.16 846.28 <o,f0,female> about the celebration of public space in other words for this community they have this garden in the sky so
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 846.97 858.74 <o,f0,female> the humanistic ideal is very very strong in all this work encapsulated perhaps by one of my early sketches here where you can see greenery you can see sunlight
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 859.16 870.51 <o,f0,female> you have a connection with nature and nature is part of the generator the driver for this building and symbolically the colors of the interior are green and yellow
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 881.83 893.28 <o,f0,female> in two thousand and one this building received an award and the award was about a celebration for a building which had been in use over a long period of time and
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 894.77 907.80 <o,f0,female> the people who 'd created it came back the project managers the company chairmen then and they were saying you know the architects norman was always going on about designing for the future and you know it didn't seem to cost us any more so
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 908.34 910.48 <o,f0,female> we humored him we kept him happy
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 911.83 920.08 <o,f0,female> the image at the top what it doesn't if you look at it in detail really what it's just saying is you can wire this building
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 937.67 941.07 <o,f0,female> to build new buildings for the new technology
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 941.47 950.11 <o,f0,female> we were fortunate because in a way our building was future proofed it anticipated change even though those changes were not known
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 951.20 952.43 <o,f0,female> round about that
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 953.24 955.79 <o,f0,female> design period leading up to this building
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 956.13 962.47 <o,f0,female> i did a sketch which we pulled out of the archive recently and i was saying and i wrote
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 963.05 970.79 <o,f0,female> but we don't have the time and we really don't have the immediate expertise at a technical level in other words we didn't have the technology
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 971.27 981.79 <o,f0,female> to do what would be really interesting on that building and that would be to create a kind of three dimensional bubble a really interesting overcoat that would
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 990.82 999.70 <o,f0,female> as a green building is very much a pioneering building and if i fast forward in time what is interesting is that the technology is now available
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1000.10 1002.38 <o,f0,female> and celebratory the
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1003.85 1007.19 <o,f0,female> library of the free university which opened last year
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1007.69 1010.44 <o,f0,female> is an example of that and again
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1010.78 1022.85 <o,f0,female> the transition from one of the many thousands of sketches and computer images to the reality and a combination of devices here the kind of heavy mass concrete of these book stacks
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1023.33 1031.21 <o,f0,female> and the way in which that is enclosed by this skin which enables the building
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1031.43 1042.17 <o,f0,female> to be ventilated to consume dramatically less energy and where it's really working with the forces of nature and what is interesting is that this is
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1044.03 1051.61 <o,f0,female> hugely popular by the people who use it again coming back to that thing about the lifestyle and
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1052.51 1059.90 <o,f0,female> in a way the ecological agenda is very much at one with the spirit so it's not a kind of
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1060.66 1067.14 <o,f0,female> sacrifice quite the reverse i think it's a great it's a celebration and you can measure
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1067.80 1074.93 <o,f0,female> the performance in terms of energy consumption of that building against a typical library
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1075.67 1086.50 <o,f0,female> if i show another aspect of that technology then in a completely different context this apartment building in the alps in switzerland
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1092.82 1100.88 <o,f0,female> because of the technology the computing ability the ability to prefabricate make high performance components out of timber
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1101.90 1108.30 <o,f0,female> very much at the cutting edge and just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology the ability to plot
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1109.34 1111.07 <o,f0,female> points in the
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1114.95 1118.48 <o,f0,female> and to transmit to transfer
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1119.45 1121.68 <o,f0,female> that information now
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1124.28 1130.06 <o,f0,female> into the factory so if you cross the border just across the border a small factory
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1130.58 1139.89 <o,f0,female> in germany and here you can see the guy with his computer screen and those points in space are communicated
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1140.13 1148.27 <o,f0,female> and on the left are the cutting machines which then in the factory enable those individual pieces to be fabricated
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1148.92 1156.74 <o,f0,female> plus or minus very very few millimeters to be slotted together on site and then interestingly
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1157.68 1165.80 <o,f0,female> building to then be clad in the oldest technology which is the kind of hand cut shingles
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1166.09 1174.22 <o,f0,female> one quarter of a million of them applied by hand as the final finish and again
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1174.43 1184.84 <o,f0,female> the way in which that works as a building for those of us who can enjoy the spaces to live and visit there if
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1185.44 1189.87 <o,f0,female> i made the leap into these new technologies then how did we
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1190.31 1199.62 <o,f0,female> what happened before that i mean you know what was life like before the mobile phone the things that you take for granted
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1200.34 1207.41 <o,f0,female> well obviously the building still happened i mean this is a glimpse of the interior of our hong kong bank
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1219.16 1228.26 <o,f0,female> in the absence of computers you have to physically model so for example we would put models under an artificial sky
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1229.14 1231.16 <o,f0,female> for wind tunnels we would literally
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1231.32 1232.88 <o,f0,female> put them in a wind tunnel
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1234.72 1243.37 <o,f0,female> and the many kilometers of cable and so on and the turning point was probably in our terms when we had
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1244.13 1248.85 <o,f0,female> the first computer and that was at the time that we
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1249.47 1251.55 <o,f0,female> sought to redesign
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1252.52 1265.57 <o,f0,female> reinvent the airport this is terminal four at heathrow typical of any terminal big heavy roof blocking out the sunlight lots of machinery big pipes whirring machinery
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1266.81 1279.09 <o,f0,female> and stanstead the green alternative which uses natural light is a friendly place you know where you are you can relate to the outside and for a large part of its cycle
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1279.54 1289.31 <o,f0,female> not needing electric light electric light which in turn creates more heat which creates more cooling loads and so on and at that particular point in time
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1290.69 1298.56 <o,f0,female> this was one of the few solitary computers and that's a little image of the tree of stanstead
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1305.55 1316.29 <o,f0,female> and if you looked very closely you'd see that people were drawing with pencils and they were pushing you know big rulers and triangles it's not that long ago seventeen years
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1316.45 1317.89 <o,f0,female> and here we are now
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1333.24 1335.66 <o,f0,female> every week we have
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1336.86 1340.70 <o,f0,female> the equivalent of eighty four million disks
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1341.17 1354.11 <o,f0,female> which record our archival information on past current and future projects that reaches twenty one kilometers into the sky this is the view you would get if you looked down on that
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1354.46 1365.84 <o,f0,female> but meanwhile as you know wonderful protagonists like al gore are noting the inexorable rise in temperature
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1368.22 1374.51 <o,f0,female> that interestingly those buildings which are celebratory and very very relevant to this place
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1375.42 1377.46 <o,f0,female> our reichstag project
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1377.97 1385.99 <o,f0,female> which has a very familiar agenda i'm sure as a public place where we sought to
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1386.57 1390.36 <o,f0,female> in a way through a process of advocacy
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1393.25 1397.60 <o,f0,female> between society and politicians public space
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1398.21 1403.05 <o,f0,female> and maybe its hidden agenda an energy manifesto something that would be free
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1403.56 1417.42 <o,f0,female> completely free of fuel as we know it so it would be totally renewable and again the humanistic sketch the translation into the public space but this very very much a part of the ecology but here
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1418.04 1428.17 <o,f0,female> not having to model it for real obviously wind tunnel had a place but the ability now with the computer to explore to plan
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1428.56 1442.19 <o,f0,female> to see how that would work in terms of the forces of nature natural ventilation to be able to model the chamber below and to look at biomass a combination of biomass aquifers
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1444.67 1445.19 <o,f0,female> oil
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1446.96 1460.15 <o,f0,female> process that quite interestingly was developed in eastern germany at the time of its dependence on the soviet bloc so really retranslating that technology and developing something
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1460.63 1474.60 <o,f0,female> which was so clean it was virtually pollution free you can measure it again you can compare how that building in terms of its emission in tons of carbon dioxide per year at the time that we took that project over seven thousand
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1475.26 1482.45 <o,f0,female> what it would have been with natural gas and finally with the vegetable oil four hundred and fifty tons i mean a ninety four percent reduction virtually clean
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1482.70 1491.69 <o,f0,female> we can see the same processes at work in terms of the commerce bank its dependence on natural ventilation the way that you can model those gardens the way they spiral around
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1492.05 1504.90 <o,f0,female> but again very much about the lifestyle the quality something that would be more enjoyable as a place to work and again we can measure the reduction in terms of energy consumption
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1506.12 1515.56 <o,f0,female> there is an evolution here between the projects and swiss re again develops that a little bit further the project in the city in london
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1515.97 1522.52 <o,f0,female> and this sequence shows the buildup of that model but what it shows first which i think is quite interesting
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1522.90 1531.73 <o,f0,female> is that here you see the circle you see the public space around it what are the other ways of putting the same amount of space on the site
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1532.07 1533.63 <o,f0,female> if for example you
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1534.81 1537.15 <o,f0,female> seek to do a building which
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1538.19 1540.11 <o,f0,female> goes right to the edge of the pavement
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1540.95 1542.54 <o,f0,female> it's the same amount of space
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1543.98 1546.38 <o,f0,female> and finally you profile this
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1546.93 1556.28 <o,f0,female> you cut grooves into it the grooves become the kind of green lungs which give views which give light ventilation
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1556.73 1564.95 <o,f0,female> make the building fresher and you enclose that with something that also is central to its appearance which is a mesh
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1565.46 1569.36 <o,f0,female> of triangulated structures again
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1569.76 1581.49 <o,f0,female> in a long connection evocative of some of those works of buckminster fuller and the way in which triangulation can increase performance and also give that building its sense of identity
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1583.56 1591.68 <o,f0,female> and here if we look at a detail of the way that the building opens up and breathes into those atria the way in which now with a computer
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1592.03 1601.01 <o,f0,female> we can model the forces we can see the high pressure the low pressure the way in which the building behaves rather like an aircraft wing
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1601.32 1610.90 <o,f0,female> so it also has the ability all the time regardless of the direction of the wind to be able to make the building fresh and efficient
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1611.39 1611.70 <o,f0,female> and
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1634.65 1646.82 <o,f0,female> and i'm just going to give two images out of a kind of company research project it's been well known that the dead sea is dying
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1648.13 1656.66 <o,f0,female> the level is dropping rather like the aral sea and the dead sea is obviously much lower than the
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1657.60 1667.32 <o,f0,female> oceans and seas around it so there has been a project which rescues the dead sea by creating a pipeline a pipe
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1668.74 1678.41 <o,f0,female> sometimes above the surface sometimes buried that will redress that and will feed from the gulf of aqaba into the dead sea
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1678.85 1688.06 <o,f0,female> and our translation of that using a lot of the thinking built up over the forty years is to say what if that instead of being just a pipe
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1688.47 1695.38 <o,f0,female> what if it is a lifeline what if it is the equivalent depending on where you are of the grand canal
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1695.91 1703.06 <o,f0,female> in terms of tourists habitation desalination agriculture in other words water is the lifeblood
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1703.39 1711.18 <o,f0,female> and if you just go back to the previous image and you look at this area of volatility and hostility that
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1712.03 1720.53 <o,f0,female> a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture could have the affect of bringing all those warring factions together
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1737.01 1746.85 <o,f0,female> whether that communication is the virtual world or it is the physical world then it's absolutely central to society and how do we make more legible
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1747.84 1758.20 <o,f0,female> in this growing world especially in some of the places that i'm talking about china for example which in the next ten years will create four hundred new
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1759.32 1767.62 <o,f0,female> what form do they take how do you make them more friendly at that scale hong kong i refer to as a kind of
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1768.34 1775.95 <o,f0,female> analog experience in a digital age because you always have a point of reference so what happens when we take that
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1776.31 1777.91 <o,f0,female> and you expand
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1779.67 1784.77 <o,f0,female> into the chinese society and what is interesting
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1785.20 1794.70 <o,f0,female> is that that produces in a way perhaps the ultimate mega building it is physically the largest project on the planet at the moment two hundred and fifty
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1804.97 1812.24 <o,f0,female> plus the new un built terminal five and the challenge here is a building that will be green
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1812.62 1820.88 <o,f0,female> that is compact despite its size and is about the human experience of travel is about
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1822.75 1828.06 <o,f0,female> coming back to that starting point is very very much about the lifestyle and
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1828.72 1838.55 <o,f0,female> perhaps these in the end as celebratory spaces as hubert was talking over lunch as we sort of engaged in conversation talked about this talked about cities
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1839.10 1844.54 <o,f0,female> was saying absolutely correctly these are the new cathedrals and
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1845.07 1848.61 <o,f0,female> in a way one aspect of this conversation
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1850.20 1855.06 <o,f0,female> was triggered on new year 's eve when i was talking about the
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1856.77 1858.86 <o,f0,female> agenda in china
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1859.71 1861.76 <o,f0,female> in terms of its
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1862.54 1870.29 <o,f0,female> green ambitions and aspirations and i was voicing the thought that it just crossed my mind that new year 's eve a sort of symbolic
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1870.88 1877.94 <o,f0,female> turning point as we move from two thousand and six to two thousand and seven that maybe you know the future was
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1878.36 1887.40 <o,f0,female> the most powerful innovative sort of nation the way in which somebody like kennedy inspirationally could say we put a man on the moon you know who is going to say that
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1888.06 1900.98 <o,f0,female> we cracked this thing of the dependence on fossil fuels with all that being held to ransom by rogue regimes and so on and that's a concerted platform it's more than one device you know it's renewable
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 1901.32 1914.65 <o,f0,female> and i voiced the thought that maybe at the turn of the year i thought that the inspiration was more likely to come from those other larger countries out there the chinas the indias the asian pacific tigers thank you very much
