LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 15.81 28.06 <o,f0,female> speaking to you about what i call the mesh it 's essentially a fundamental shift in our relationship with stuff with the things in our lives and it 's starting to look at not always and not for everything
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 28.06 43.87 <o,f0,female> but in certain moments of time access to certain kinds of goods and service will trump ownership of them and so it 's the pursuit of better things easily shared and we come from a long tradition of sharing we 've shared transportation
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 43.87 51.98 <o,f0,female> we 've shared wine and food and other sorts of fabulous experiences in coffee bars in amsterdam
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 51.98 70.39 <o,f0,female> we 've also shared other sorts of entertainment sports arenas public parks concert halls libraries universities all these things are share platforms but sharing ultimately starts and ends with what i refer to as the mother of all share platforms
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 70.39 89.48 <o,f0,female> and as i think about the mesh and i think about well what 's driving it how come it 's happening now i think there 's a number of vectors that i want to give you as background one is the recession that the recession has caused us to rethink our relationship with the things in our lives relative to the value so
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 89.48 92.84 <o,f0,female> starting to align the value with the true cost
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 92.84 101.26 <o,f0,female> secondly population growth and density into cities more people smaller spaces less stuff
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 101.26 109.29 <o,f0,female> climate change we 're trying to reduce the stress in our personal lives and in our communities and on the planet
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 109.29 116.62 <o,f0,female> also there 's been this recent distrust of big brands global big brands in a bunch of different industries
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 116.62 133.47 <o,f0,female> and that 's created an opening research is showing here in the states and in canada and western europe that most of us are much more open to local companies or brands that maybe we haven 't heard of whereas before we went with the big brands that we were sure we trusted
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 133.47 139.95 <o,f0,female> and last is that we 're more connected now to more people on the planet than ever before
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 139.95 143.21 <o,f0,female> except for if you 're sitting next to someone
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 161.73 170.18 <o,f0,female> and move things that way it 's also web and mobile allow us to be connected and create all kinds of platforms and systems
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 170.18 180.12 <o,f0,female> and the investment of those technologies and that infrastructure is really our inheritance it allows us to engage in really new and interesting ways
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 180.12 184.07 <o,f0,female> and so for me a mesh company the classic mesh company
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 184.07 197.78 <o,f0,female> brings together these three things our ability to connect to each other most of us are walking around with these mobile devices that are gps enabled and web enabled allows us to find each other and find things in time and space and third
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 197.78 209.49 <o,f0,female> is that physical things are readable on a map so restaurants a variety of venues but also with gps and other technology like rfid and it continues to expand beyond that
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 209.49 225.21 <o,f0,female> we can also track things that are moving like a car a taxicab a transit system a box that 's moving through time and space and so that sets up for making access to get goods and services more convenient and less costly in many cases than owning them
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 225.21 231.6 <o,f0,female> for example i want to use zipcar how many people here have experienced car sharing or bike sharing
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 251.2 258.24 <o,f0,female> brought it to cambridge and they started two women robin chase being the other person who started
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 271.11 287.52 <o,f0,female> they made it fresh they made it aspirational if you were a member of the club when you 're a member of a club you 're a zipster the cars they picked didn 't look like ex cop cars that were hollowed out or something they picked these sexy cars they targeted to universities they made sure that
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 287.52 297.84 <o,f0,female> the demographic for who they were targeting and the car was all matching it was a very nice experience and the cars were clean and reliable and it all worked and so from a branding perspective
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 297.84 303.17 <o,f0,female> they got a lot right but they understood fundamentally that they are not a car
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 313.37 331.81 <o,f0,female> but when you 're sharing a car and you have a car share service you might use an e v to commute you get a truck because you 're doing a home project when you pick your aunt up at the airport you get a sedan and you 're going to the mountains to ski you get different accessories put on the car for doing that sort of thing
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 331.81 339.37 <o,f0,female> meanwhile these guys are sitting back collecting all sorts of data about our behavior and how we interact with the service
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 339.37 344.12 <o,f0,female> and so it 's not only an option for them but i believe it 's an imperative
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 344.12 362.51 <o,f0,female> for zipcar and other mesh companies to actually just wow us to be like a concierge service because we give them so much information and they are entitled to really see how it is that we 're moving they 're in really good shape to anticipate what we 're going to want next
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 362.51 368.56 <o,f0,female> and so what percent of the day do you think the average person uses a car what percentage
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 386.66 403.41 <o,f0,female> and so basically even if you think it 's ten percent ninety percent of the time something that costs us a lot of money personally and also we organize our cities around it and all sorts of things ninety percent of the time it 's sitting around so for this reason i think
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 403.41 414.87 <o,f0,female> one of the other themes with the mesh is essentially that if we squeeze hard on things that we 've thrown away there 's a lot of value in those things what set up with zipcar zipcar started in two thousand
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 414.87 427.17 <o,f0,female> in the last year two thousand and ten two car companies started one that 's in the u k called whipcar and the other one relayrides in the u s they 're both peer to peer car sharing services
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 427.18 430.48 <o,f0,female> because the two things that really work for car sharing is one
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 445.69 453.25 <o,f0,female> zipcar started a decade earlier in two thousand it took them six years to get one thousand cars in service
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 453.25 470.65 <o,f0,female> whipcar which started april of last year it took them six months to get one thousand cars in the service so really interesting people are making anywhere between two hundred and seven hundred dollars a month letting their neighbors use their car when they 're not using it so it 's like vacation rentals for cars
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 473.41 479.1 <o,f0,female> since i 'm here and i hope some people in the audience are in the car business
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 489.7 502.82 <o,f0,female> it would be really great if any minute now you guys could start rolling share ready cars off because it just creates more flexibility it allows us as owners to have other options and i think we 're going there anyway
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 502.82 513.58 <o,f0,female> the opportunity and the challenge with mesh businesses and those are businesses like zipcar or netflix that are full mesh businesses or other ones where you have a lot of the car companies
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 523.04 526.23 <o,f0,female> is to make sharing irresistible
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 534.48 549.56 <o,f0,female> we know also because we 're connected in social networks that it 's easy to create delight in one little place it 's contagious because we 're all connected to each other so if i have a terrific experience and i tweet it or i tell five people standing next to me
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 549.56 554.19 <o,f0,female> news travels the opposite as we know is also true often more true
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 554.19 561.18 <o,f0,female> so here we have ludotruck which is in l a doing the things that gourmet food trucks do and they 've gathered quite a following
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 561.18 580.07 <o,f0,female> in general and maybe again it 's because i 'm a tech entrepreneur i look at things as platforms platforms are invitations so creating craigslist or itunes and the iphone developer network there are all these networks facebook as well these platforms invite all sorts of developers and all sorts of
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 580.07 598.83 <o,f0,female> people to come with their ideas and their opportunity to create and target an application for a particular audience and honestly it 's full of surprises because i don 't think any of us in this room could have predicted the sorts of applications that have happened at facebook around facebook for example
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 598.83 603.45 <o,f0,female> two years ago when mark announced that they were going to go with a platform
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 603.45 609.46 <o,f0,female> so in this way i think that cities are platforms and certainly detroit is a platform
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 609.46 618.74 <o,f0,female> the invitation of bringing makers and artists and entrepreneurs it really helps stimulate this fiery creativity and helps a city to thrive
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 618.74 637.22 <o,f0,female> it 's inviting participation and cities have historically invited all sorts of participation now we 're saying that there 's other options as well so for example city departments can open up transit data google has made available transit data api and so there 's about seven or eight cities already in the u s
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 637.22 644.36 <o,f0,female> that have provided the transit data and different developers are building applications so i was having a coffee in portland
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 644.36 662.92 <o,f0,female> and half of a latte in and the little board in the cafe all of a sudden starts showing me that the next bus is coming in three minutes and the train is coming in sixteen minutes and so it 's reliable real data that 's right in my face where i am so i can finish the latte
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 671.35 678.18 <o,f0,female> that space is not vital the areas around it lack vitality and vibrancy and engagement
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 688.42 702.45 <o,f0,female> essentially there are all sorts of restaurants in oakland near where i live there 's a pop up general store every three weeks and they do a fantastic job of making a very social
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 702.45 716.34 <o,f0,female> event happening for foodies super fun and it happens in a very transitional neighborhood subsequent to that after it 's been going for about a year now they actually started to lease and
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 716.34 721.54 <o,f0,female> create and extend an area that was edgy artsy is now starting
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 721.54 725.38 <o,f0,female> to become much cooler and engage a lot more people so
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 725.38 736.48 <o,f0,female> this is an example the crafty fox is this woman who 's into crafts and she does these pop up crafts fairs around london but these sorts of things are happening in many different environments
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 736.48 751.17 <o,f0,female> from my perspective one of the things pop up stores do is create perishability and urgency it creates two of the favorite words of any businessperson sold out and the opportunity to really focus trust and attention
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 753.27 770.23 <o,f0,female> so a lot of what we see in the mesh and a lot of what we have in the platform that we built allows us to define refine and scale it allows us to test things as an entrepreneur to go to market to be in conversation with people listen refine something and go back
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 770.23 778.47 <o,f0,female> it 's very cost effective and it 's very mesh y the infrastructure enables that
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 778.47 787.67 <o,f0,female> in closing and as we 're moving towards the end i just also want to encourage and i 'm willing to share my failures as well though not from the stage
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 803.73 813.43 <o,f0,female> is by sharing failures and one quick example is velib in two thousand and seven came forward in paris with a very bold proposition
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 813.43 824.03 <o,f0,female> a very big bike sharing service they made a lot of mistakes they had some number of big successes but they were very transparent or they had to be in the way that they
LisaGansky_2011S 1 LisaGansky_2011S 843.76 848.96 <o,f0,female> so the opportunity when we 're connected is also to share failures and successes
