MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 24.02 30.79 <o,f0,male> all the services we use all the connectivity all the entertainment all the business all the commerce
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 31.97 36.04 <o,f0,male> and it 's happening during our lifetimes
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 36.04 48.95 <o,f0,male> i 'm pretty sure that one day we 'll be writing history books hundreds of years from now this time our generation will be remembered as the generation that got online
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 61.86 65.96 <o,f0,male> with security and problems with privacy
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 71.16 76.15 <o,f0,male> so let me show you something
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 76.15 88.65 <o,f0,male> this here is brain this is a floppy disk five and a quarter inch floppy disk infected by brain a it 's the first virus we ever found for pc computers
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 92.23 95.1 <o,f0,male> where brain came from we know
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 95.36 99.77 <o,f0,male> because it says so inside the code let 's take a look
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 106.08 119.91 <o,f0,male> all right that 's the boot sector of an infected floppy and if we take a closer look inside we 'll see that right there it says welcome to the dungeon
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 119.91 132.72 <o,f0,male> and then it continues saying one thousand nine hundred and eighty six basit and amjad and basit and amjad are first names pakistani first names in fact there 's a phone number
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 154.44 165.71 <o,f0,male> so let 's see here 's a couple of photos i took while i was in pakistan this is from the city of lahore which is around three hundred kilometers south from abbottabad where bin laden was caught here 's a typical
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 165.71 176.34 <o,f0,male> street view and here 's the street or road leading to this building which is seven hundred and thirty nizam block at allama iqbal town and i knocked on the door
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 189.38 192.02 <o,f0,male> so here standing up is basit
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 192.02 198.45 <o,f0,male> sitting down is his brother amjad these are the guys who wrote the first pc virus now of course
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 198.91 205.49 <o,f0,male> we had a very interesting discussion i asked them why i asked them how they feel about what they started
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 243.24 252.54 <o,f0,male> mount some drives go over there what we have here is a list of old viruses so let me just run some viruses on my computer for example
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 288 297.96 <o,f0,male> so it used to be fairly easy to know that you 're infected by a virus when the viruses were written by hobbyists and teenagers
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 297.96 302.84 <o,f0,male> today they are no longer being written by hobbyists and teenagers
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 302.84 320.6 <o,f0,male> today viruses are a global problem what we have here in the background is an example of our systems that we run in our labs where we track virus infections worldwide so we can actually see in real time that we 've just blocked viruses in sweden and taiwan and russia and elsewhere in fact
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 320.9 323.62 <o,f0,male> if i just connect back to our lab systems
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 323.62 337.77 <o,f0,male> through the web we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viruses how many new examples of malware we find every single day here 's the latest virus we 've found in a file called server exe and we found it
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 345.88 353.91 <o,f0,male> it 's just massive we find tens of thousands even hundreds of thousands and that 's the last twenty minutes of malware every single day
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 370.2 374.47 <o,f0,male> this is a website operating in moscow where
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 374.47 391 <o,f0,male> these guys are buying infected computers so if you are a virus writer and you 're capable of infecting windows computers but you don 't know what to do with them you can sell those infected computers somebody else 's computers to these guys and they 'll actually pay you money for those computers
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 391 396.56 <o,f0,male> so how do these guys then monetize those infected computers
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 396.56 414.08 <o,f0,male> well there 's multiple different ways such as banking trojans which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking or keyloggers keyloggers silently sit on your computer hidden from view and they record everything you type
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 414.23 428.67 <o,f0,male> so you 're sitting on your computer and you 're doing google searches every single google search you type is saved and sent to the criminals every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals same thing with every single password and so on
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 445.54 461.74 <o,f0,male> here 's an example of a file we found from a server a couple of weeks ago that 's the credit card number that 's the expiration date that 's the security code and that 's the name of the owner of the card once you gain access to other people 's credit card information you can just go online and buy whatever you want with this information
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 461.74 473.21 <o,f0,male> and that obviously is a problem we now have a whole underground marketplace and business ecosystem built around online crime
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 495.1 502.58 <o,f0,male> these guys were running an operation called i m u a cybercrime operation through which they netted millions they are both
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 502.58 516.65 <o,f0,male> right now on the run nobody knows where they are u s officials just a couple of weeks ago froze a swiss bank account belonging to mr jain and that bank account had fourteen point nine million u s dollars on it
