BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 19.98 21.9 <o,f0,male> and i 'd like to share
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 21.92 25.49 <o,f0,male> a forty five year old love story
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 33.62 40.8 <o,f0,male> i went to a very elitist snobbish expensive education in india
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 41.04 43.15 <o,f0,male> and that almost destroyed me
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 47.17 51.32 <o,f0,male> i was all set to be a diplomat teacher doctor
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 70.99 75.8 <o,f0,male> and then i thought out of curiosity i 'd like to go and live and work and just see what a village is like
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 76.42 78.1 <o,f0,male> so in one thousand nine hundred and sixty five
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 82.6 85.03 <o,f0,male> and i saw starvation
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 85.39 87.68 <o,f0,male> people dying of hunger for the first time
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 98.95 100.76 <o,f0,male> mother went into a coma
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 117.09 118.73 <o,f0,male> and i wanted to give something back
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 124.32 128.89 <o,f0,male> no job no money no security no prospect i said i want to live
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 129.45 131.55 <o,f0,male> and dig wells for five years
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 132.79 139.15 <o,f0,male> dig wells for five years you went to the most expensive school and college in india and you want to dig wells for five years
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 139.15 141.13 <o,f0,male> she didn 't speak to me for
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 148.74 150.35 <o,f0,male> but then
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 150.42 155.08 <o,f0,male> i was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills that very poor people have
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 158.43 164.54 <o,f0,male> which is never identified respected applied on a large scale and i thought i 'd start a barefoot college
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 165 166.8 <o,f0,male> college only for the poor
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 167.04 170.74 <o,f0,male> what the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 177.37 181.42 <o,f0,male> and said are you running from the police
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 205.51 209.92 <o,f0,male> i said no i want to actually start a college only for the poor
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 210.62 217.78 <o,f0,male> what the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college so the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 217.84 219.5 <o,f0,male> they said please
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 219.54 224.64 <o,f0,male> don 't bring anyone with a degree and qualification into your college
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 225.18 232.44 <o,f0,male> so it 's the only college in india where if you should have a ph d or a master 's you are disqualified to come
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 233.46 238.08 <o,f0,male> you have to be a cop out or a wash out
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 242.21 251.61 <o,f0,male> you have to have a dignity of labor you have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community and provide a service to the community so we started
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 256.77 259.93 <o,f0,male> who is a professional a professional is someone
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 259.96 263.9 <o,f0,male> who has a combination of competence confidence and belief
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 268.13 269.77 <o,f0,male> a water diviner is a professional a traditional midwife
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 273.7 284.38 <o,f0,male> is a professional these are professionals all over the world you find them in any inaccessible village around the world and we thought that these people should come into the mainstream and show
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 284.52 286.31 <o,f0,male> that the knowledge and skills that they have
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 313.28 317.85 <o,f0,male> and no one can get more than dollar one hundred a month you come for the money
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 320.45 323.08 <o,f0,male> work and the challenge you 'll come to the barefoot
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 335.03 336.76 <o,f0,male> the teacher is the learner
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 336.92 338.86 <o,f0,male> and the learner is the teacher
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 339.41 341.82 <o,f0,male> and it 's the only college where we don 't give a certificate
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 342.06 345.01 <o,f0,male> you are certified by the community you serve
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 345.25 348.31 <o,f0,male> you don 't need a paper to hang on the wall to show
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 348.33 350.49 <o,f0,male> that you are an engineer
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 353.3 363.06 <o,f0,male> so when i said that they said well show us what is possible what are you doing this is all mumbo jumbo if you can 't show it on the ground so we built the first
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 368.08 371.71 <o,f0,male> it was built by twelve barefoot architects who can 't read and write
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 378.54 381.73 <o,f0,male> they got the aga khan award for architecture in two thousand and two
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 391.38 394.08 <o,f0,male> we are the only ones who actually returned the award
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 404.07 405.67 <o,f0,male> i asked a forester
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 406.05 410 <o,f0,male> high powered paper qualified expert i said what can you
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 410.02 417.42 <o,f0,male> build in this place he had one look at the soil and said forget it no way not even worth it no water rocky soil
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 418.31 423.94 <o,f0,male> i was in a bit of a spot and i said okay i 'll go to the old man in village and say what should i grow in this spot
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 424.41 430.07 <o,f0,male> he looked quietly at me and said you build this you build this you put this and it 'll work this is what it looks like today
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 430.07 433.6 <o,f0,male> went to the roof
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 434 435.72 <o,f0,male> and all the women said clear out
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 465.33 467.4 <o,f0,male> all the power comes from the sun
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 481.17 484.89 <o,f0,male> by a priest a hindu priest who 's only done eight years
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 484.99 486.62 <o,f0,male> of primary schooling
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 487 491.23 <o,f0,male> never been to school never been to college he knows more about solar than
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 491.23 493.96 <o,f0,male> anyone i know anywhere in the world
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 511.21 518.06 <o,f0,male> who actually fabricate the most sophisticated solar cooker it 's a parabolic scheffler solar cooker
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 520.61 523.31 <o,f0,male> unfortunately they 're almost half german
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 532.83 540.02 <o,f0,male> absolutely to the last inch they can make that cooker and we have sixty meals twice a day of solar cooking
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 559.7 565.33 <o,f0,male> very little water is wasted all the roofs are connected underground to a four hundred thousand liter tank
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 565.36 566.98 <o,f0,male> and no water is wasted
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 573.13 576.11 <o,f0,male> sixty percent of children don 't go to school
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 576.12 579.51 <o,f0,male> because they have to look after animals sheep goats
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 584.64 586.35 <o,f0,male> at night for the children
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 586.39 590.15 <o,f0,male> because the night schools of tilonia over seventy five thousand children
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 590.18 608.44 <o,f0,male> have gone through these night schools because it 's for the convenience of the child it 's not for the convenience of the teacher and what do we teach in these schools democracy citizenship how you should measure your land what you should do if you 're arrested what you should do if your animal is sick
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 608.44 613.51 <o,f0,male> this is what we teach in the night schools but all the schools are solar lit
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 614.04 615.8 <o,f0,male> every five years
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 621.94 624.29 <o,f0,male> participate in a democratic process
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 628.98 632.35 <o,f0,male> the prime minister is twelve years old
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 637.85 639.91 <o,f0,male> she has a cabinet
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 642.68 648.86 <o,f0,male> and they actually monitor and supervise one hundred and fifty schools for seven thousand children
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 649.68 651.61 <o,f0,male> she got the world 's children 's prize
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 651.97 657.12 <o,f0,male> five years ago and she went to sweden first time ever going out of her village never seen
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 660.92 669.51 <o,f0,male> and the queen of sweden who 's there turned to me and said can you ask this child where she got her confidence from she 's only twelve years old and she 's not dazzled by anything
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 673.61 676.55 <o,f0,male> turned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 712.98 715.59 <o,f0,male> he is my psychoanalyst he is my teacher
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 719.91 722.81 <o,f0,male> he 's my donor he actually raises money solves my disputes
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 755.66 761.86 <o,f0,male> so this decentralized demystified approach of solar electrifying villages
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 781.47 785.05 <o,f0,male> because there 's no place it was all snowed up on both sides
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 790.42 792.32 <o,f0,male> and she thought for a minute and said
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 801.83 804.44 <o,f0,male> one lesson we learned in india
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 818.76 821 <o,f0,male> men are compulsively mobile
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 821.57 823.09 <o,f0,male> and they all want a certificate
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 831.28 833.62 <o,f0,male> because they want to leave the village
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 833.64 835.66 <o,f0,male> and go to a city looking for a job
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 836.7 839.24 <o,f0,male> so we came up with a great solution
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 840.05 842 <o,f0,male> train grandmothers
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 849.99 851.96 <o,f0,male> telegraph no

BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 889.44 891.56 <o,f0,male> you don 't choose the spoken word
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 891.87 893.63 <o,f0,male> you use sign language
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 900.38 903.21 <o,f0,male> they go back and solar electrify their own village
BunkerRoy_2011G 1 BunkerRoy_2011G 966.01 974.82 <o,f0,male> and there was this minister driving down in the dead of night comes across this village comes back goes into the village says well what 's the story they said
