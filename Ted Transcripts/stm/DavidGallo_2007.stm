DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 27.86 34.91 <o,f0,male> and we used to see the most mysterious animals out the window that you couldn't describe these blinking lights a world of bioluminescence like fireflies
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 36.08 40.73 <o,f0,male> doctor edith witter she's now at the research conservation association was able to
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 40.90 50.51 <o,f0,male> come up with a camera that could capture some of these incredible animals and that's what you're seeing here on the screen that's all bioluminescence so like i said just like fireflies there's a flying turkey
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 52.83 58.08 <o,f0,male> the tree i know i'm a geologist by training but i love that
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 59.51 71.96 <o,f0,male> of the bioluminescence they use to avoid being eaten some they use to attract prey but all of it from an artistic point of view is positively amazing and a lot of what goes on inside here 's a fish with glowing eyes pulsating eyes
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 73.10 75.63 <o,f0,male> some of the colors are designed to hypnotize
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 84.80 93.64 <o,f0,male> that's the unknown world and today we've only explored three percent of what's out in the oceans already we've found the world 's highest mountains the world 's deepest valleys
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 100.36 108.84 <o,f0,male> we find more life we think and diversity and density than the tropical rainforest which tells us that we don't know much about this planet at all there's still ninety seven percent
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 120.81 126.74 <o,f0,male> as a kid i knew them as calamari mostly this is an octopus this is the work of doctor roger hanlon at the marine
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 127.79 138.62 <o,f0,male> and it's just fascinating how cephalopods with their eyes incredible eyes sense their surroundings look at light look at patterns there's an octopus moving across the reef finds a spot to settle down curls up
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 144.44 153.63 <o,f0,male> in the next bit we're going to see a couple squid this is a squid now males when they fight if they're really aggressive they turn white and these two males are fighting they do it by bouncing their butts together which is an interesting
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 155.26 163.71 <o,f0,male> a male on the left and a female on the right now the male has managed to split his coloration so the female only always sees the kinder gentler squid
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 164.58 164.80 <o,f0,male> the
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 168.53 172.56 <o,f0,male> see it again let 's take a look at it again watch the coloration white on the right
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 174.30 180.96 <o,f0,male> on the left he takes a step back so he 's keeping off the other males by splitting his body and comes up on the other side
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 196.41 205.70 <o,f0,male> but they can do pretty amazing things here we're going to see one backing into a crevice and watch his tentacles he just pulls them in makes him look just like algae
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 219.38 221.10 <o,f0,male> ok just an amazing thing
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 222.90 230.11 <o,f0,male> here 's an octopus sometimes they don't want to be seen when they move because predators can see them here this guy can actually make himself look like a rock
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 253.29 260.94 <o,f0,male> and if you're an octopus or a cephalopod you really understand how to use your surroundings to hide in the next scene you're going to see a nice coral bottom
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 269.40 270.37 <o,f0,male> in the foreground
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 271.79 275.11 <o,f0,male> an octopus ain't that amazing
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 277.42 280.78 <o,f0,male> now roger spooked him so he took off in a cloud of ink
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 282.08 285.83 <o,f0,male> lands the octopus says oh i've been seen the best thing to do is to get as big as i can get
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 286.65 288.76 <o,f0,male> that big brown makes his eyespot very big
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 305.47 306.72 <o,f0,male> one two three
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 312.36 314.58 <o,f0,male> now he 's gone and so am i thank you very much
