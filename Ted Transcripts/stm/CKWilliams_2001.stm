CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 12.32 17.20 <o,f0,male> i thought i would read poems i have that relate to the subject of youth and age
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 18.71 28.82 <o,f0,male> sort of astonished to find out how many i have actually the first one is dedicated to spencer and his grandmother who was shocked by his work
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 29.53 30.67 <o,f0,male> my poem is called
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 32.74 35.76 <o,f0,male> my grandmother is washing my mouth out with soap
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 36.85 43.20 <o,f0,male> half a long century gone and still she comes at me with that thick cruel yellow bar
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 44.24 54.31 <o,f0,male> all because of a word i said not even said really only repeated but open she says open up her hand clawing at my head
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 55.83 65.03 <o,f0,male> i know now her life was hard she lost three children as babies then her husband died too leaving young sons and no money
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 65.56 76.12 <o,f0,male> she'd stand me in the sink to pee because there was never room in the toilet but oh her soap might its bitter burning have been what made me a poet
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 77.12 86.14 <o,f0,male> the street she lived on was unpaved her flat two cramped rooms and a fetid kitchen where she stalked and caught me
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 87.31 92.04 <o,f0,male> i admit that after she did it i never really loved her again
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 92.65 95.45 <o,f0,male> she lived to a hundred even then
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 96.18 103.46 <o,f0,male> all along it was the sadness the squalor but i never until now loved her again
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 106.14 110.37 <o,f0,male> when that was published in a magazine i got an irate letter from my
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 113.38 115.54 <o,f0,male> you have maligned a great woman
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 117.01 118.93 <o,f0,female> it took some
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 127.62 128.82 <o,f0,male> in those days
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 129.59 134.24 <o,f0,male> those days which exist for me only as the most elusive memory now
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 134.69 145.25 <o,f0,male> when often the first sound you'd hear in the morning would be a storm of birdsong then the soft clop of the hooves of the horse hauling a milk wagon down your block
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 145.63 154.23 <o,f0,male> and the last sound at night as likely as not would be your father pulling up in his car having worked late again always late
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 154.59 163.77 <o,f0,male> and going heavily down to the cellar to the furnace to shake out the ashes and damp the draft before he came upstairs to fall into bed
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 165.02 177.42 <o,f0,male> those long ago days women my mother my friends mothers our neighbors all the women i knew wore often much of the day what were called housedresses cheap
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 177.84 189.65 <o,f0,male> printed pulpy seemingly purposefully shapeless light cotton shifts that you wore over your nightgown and when you had to go look for a child hang wash on the line
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 189.82 200.33 <o,f0,male> or run down to the grocery store on the corner under a coat the twisted hem of the nightgown always lank and yellowed dangling beneath
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 201.63 212.40 <o,f0,male> more than the curlers some of the women seemed constantly to have in their hair in preparation for some great event a ball one would think that never came to pass
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 212.93 223.59 <o,f0,male> more than the way most women 's faces not only were never made up during the day but seemed scraped bleached and with their plucked eyebrows scarily masklike
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 224.45 237.11 <o,f0,male> more than all that it was those dresses that made women so unknowable and forbidding adepts of enigmas to which men could have no access and boys no conception
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 238.49 247.26 <o,f0,male> only later would i see the dresses also as a proclamation that in your dim kitchen your laundry
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 247.49 260.23 <o,f0,male> your bleak concrete yard what you revealed of yourself was a fabulation your real sensual nature veiled in those sexless vestments was utterly your dominion
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 261.66 270.85 <o,f0,male> in those days one hid much else as well grown men didn't embrace one another unless someone had died and not always then
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 271.17 279.34 <o,f0,male> you shook hands or at a ball game thumped your friend 's back and exchanged blows meant to be codes for affection
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 280.31 289.17 <o,f0,male> of childhood you'd never again know the shock of your father 's whiskers on your cheek not until mores at last had evolved
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 289.43 297.70 <o,f0,male> and you could hug another man then hold on for a moment then even kiss your fathers bristles white and stiff now
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 298.82 305.29 <o,f0,male> what release finally the embrace though we were wary it seemed so audacious
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 305.52 316.60 <o,f0,male> how much unspoken joy there was in that affirmation of equality and communion no matter how much misunderstanding and pain had passed between you
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 318.67 331.20 <o,f0,male> we knew so little in those days as little as now i suppose about healing those hurts even the women in their best dresses with beads and sequins sewn on the bodices
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 331.59 340.84 <o,f0,male> even in lipstick and mascara their hair aflow could only stand wringing their hands begging for peace while father and son
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 341.18 349.26 <o,f0,male> like thugs like thieves like romans simmered and hissed and hated inflicting sorrows that endured
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 349.60 357.77 <o,f0,male> the worst anyway through the kiss and embrace bleeding from brother to brother into the generations
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 358.98 365.18 <o,f0,male> in those days there was still countryside close to the city farms cornfields cows
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 365.58 376.97 <o,f0,male> even not far from our building with its blurred brick and long shadowy hallway you could find tracts with hills and trees you could pretend were mountains and forests
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 377.52 382.46 <o,f0,male> or you could go out by yourself even to a half block long empty lot
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 382.72 391.68 <o,f0,male> into the bushes like a creature of leaves you'd lurk crouched crawling simplified savage alone
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 392.74 395.42 <o,f0,male> already there was wanting to be simpler
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 413.91 422.04 <o,f0,male> is another longish one about the old and the young it actually happened right at the time we met part of the poem takes place
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 425.18 428.57 <o,f0,male> space we shared and time we shared it's called the neighbor
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 430.26 436.91 <o,f0,male> her five horrid deformed little dogs who incessantly yap on the roof under my window
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 437.58 444.13 <o,f0,male> her cats god knows how many who must piss on her rugs her landing 's a sickening reek
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 444.77 458.11 <o,f0,male> her shadow once fumbling the chain on her door then the door slamming fearfully shut only the barking and the music jazz filtering as it does day and night into the hall
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 459.62 467.69 <o,f0,male> the time it was chris connor singing lush life how it brought back my college sweetheart my first real love
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 468.08 477.00 <o,f0,male> who till i left her played the same record and head on my shoulder hand on my thigh sang sweetly along
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 477.37 481.14 <o,f0,male> of regrets and depletions she was too young for
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 481.60 489.49 <o,f0,male> as i was too young later to believe in her pain it startled then bored then repelled me
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 490.73 503.73 <o,f0,male> my starting to fancy she'd ended up in this fire trap in the village that my neighbor was her my thinking we'd meet recognize one another become friends that i'd accomplish a penance
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 504.07 511.46 <o,f0,male> my seeing her it wasn't her at the mailbox gray yellow hair army pants under a
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 512.51 519.58 <o,f0,male> her turning away hiding her ravaged face in her hands muttering an inappropriate hi
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 542.55 547.49 <o,f0,male> come back darlings come back dear ones my sweet angels come back
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 549.76 557.63 <o,f0,male> medea she was next time i saw her sorceress tranced ecstatic stock still on the sidewalk
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 558.12 566.17 <o,f0,male> ragged coat hanging agape passersby flowing around her her mouth torn suddenly open as though in a
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 567.22 580.07 <o,f0,male> silently though as though only in her brain or breast had it erupted a cry so pure practiced detached it had no need of a voice or could no longer bear one
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 581.23 590.41 <o,f0,male> these invisible links that allure these transfigurations even of anguish that hold us the girl my old love
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 590.65 602.32 <o,f0,male> the last lost time i saw her when she came to find me at a party her drunkenly stumbling falling sprawling skirt hiked eyes veined red swollen with
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 602.73 613.01 <o,f0,male> tears her shame her dishonor my ignorant arrogant coarseness my secret pride my turning away
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 614.18 626.05 <o,f0,male> still life on a rooftop dead trees in barrels a bench broken dogs excrement sky what pathways through pain what junctures of vulnerability
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 626.35 636.27 <o,f0,male> what crossings and counterings too many lives in our lives already too many chances for sorrow too many unaccounted for pasts
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 636.77 645.77 <o,f0,male> behold me the god of frenzied inexhaustible love says rising in bloody splendor behold me
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 647.30 655.18 <o,f0,male> her making her way down the littered vestibule stairs one agonized step at a time my holding the door
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 655.41 664.34 <o,f0,male> her crossing the fragmented tiles faltering at the step to the street droning not looking at me can you help me
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 665.02 666.25 <o,f0,male> taking my arm
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 666.88 668.75 <o,f0,male> leaning lightly against me
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 669.36 674.62 <o,f0,male> her wavering step into the world her whispering thanks love
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 690.01 692.02 <o,f0,male> think i'll lighten up a little
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 694.03 697.45 <o,f0,male> another different kind of poem of youth and age
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 698.66 699.82 <o,f0,male> gas
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 702.77 714.00 <o,f0,male> nice i think when the blue haired lady in the doctor 's waiting room bends over the magazine table and farts just a little and violently blushes
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 714.57 726.51 <o,f0,male> wouldn't it be nice if intestinal gas came embodied in visible clouds so she could see that her really quite inoffensive pop had only barely grazed my face before it drifted away
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 728.85 740.40 <o,f0,male> besides for this to have happened now is a nice coincidence because not an hour ago while we were on our walk my dog was startled by a backfire and jumped straight up like a horse bucking
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 740.80 755.50 <o,f0,male> and that brought back to me the stable i worked on weekends when i was twelve and a splendid piebald stallion who whenever he was mounted would buck just like that though more hugely of course enormous gleaming resplendent
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 755.78 766.65 <o,f0,male> and the woman her face abashedly buried in her elle now reminded me i'd forgotten that not the least part of my awe consisted of the fact that with every jump
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 767.46 777.37 <o,f0,male> the horse would powerfully fart phwap phwap phwap something never mentioned in the dozens of books about horses and their riders i devoured
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 779.34 787.28 <o,f0,male> all that savage grandeur the steely glinting hooves the eruptions driven from the creature 's mighty innards
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 810.01 812.36 <o,f0,male> this is called thirst
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 814.82 817.88 <o,f0,male> many most of my poems actually are urban poems i happen to be
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 831.46 833.89 <o,f0,male> until finally one day she vanished
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 834.30 842.12 <o,f0,male> we regarded each other scrutinized one another me shyly obliquely trying not to be furtive
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 842.46 850.44 <o,f0,male> she boldly unblinkingly even pugnaciously wrathfully even when her bottle was empty
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 851.17 863.63 <o,f0,male> i was frightened of her i felt like a child i was afraid some repressed part of myself would go out of control and i'd be forever entrapped in the shocking seethe of her stench
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 864.47 871.41 <o,f0,male> not excrement merely not merely surface and orifice going unwashed rediffusion of
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 871.97 879.26 <o,f0,male> there was will in it and intention power and purpose a social ethical rage and rebellion
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 880.29 881.32 <o,f0,male> despair too though
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 884.49 891.91 <o,f0,male> sometimes i'd think i should take her home with me bathe her comfort her dress her she wouldn't have wanted me to i would think
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 892.74 900.27 <o,f0,male> instead i'd step into my train how rich i would think is the lexicon of our self absolving
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 900.59 908.15 <o,f0,male> how enduring our bland fatal assurance that reflection is righteousness being accomplished
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 908.89 915.08 <o,f0,male> the dance of our glances the clash pulling each other through our perceptual punctures
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 915.35 924.31 <o,f0,male> then holocaust holocaust host on host of ill injured presences squandered consumed
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 925.27 932.99 <o,f0,male> her vigil somewhere i know continues her occupancy her absolute faithful attendance
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 933.43 937.35 <o,f0,male> the dance of our glances challenge abdication
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 938.83 941.72 <o,f0,male> the perfume of our consternation
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 957.02 958.55 <o,f0,male> the title is this happened
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 974.72 979.92 <o,f0,male> you might fall almost banteringly chides her you might fall
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 980.46 991.73 <o,f0,male> and the young woman eighteen a girl really though she wouldn't think that as brilliant as she is first in her class and beautiful too she's often told
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 992.20 1002.51 <o,f0,male> smiles back and leans into the open window which wouldn't even be open if it were winter if it were winter someone would have closed it close it
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1003.49 1012.24 <o,f0,male> leans into the window farther still smiling farther and farther though it takes less time than this really an instant
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1012.53 1014.17 <o,f0,male> and lets herself fall
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1017.70 1025.28 <o,f0,male> a casual impulse a fancy never thought of until now hardly thought of even now no
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1025.64 1034.06 <o,f0,male> more than impulse or fancy the girl knows what she's doing the girl means something the girl means to mean because
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1034.31 1045.74 <o,f0,male> it occurs to her in that instant that beautiful or not bright yes or no she's not who she is she's not the person she is and the reason she suddenly knows
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1046.13 1057.06 <o,f0,male> is that there's been so much premeditation where she is so much plotting and planning there's hardly a person where she is or if there is it's not her
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1057.23 1066.68 <o,f0,male> or not wholly her it's a self inhabited lived in by her and seemingly even as she thinks it she knows what's been missing
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1067.23 1075.58 <o,f0,male> grace not premeditation but grace a kind of being in the world spontaneously with grace
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1077.05 1079.29 <o,f0,male> weightfully upon me was the world
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1080.11 1084.79 <o,f0,male> weightfully this self which graced the world yet never wholly itself
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1085.90 1092.67 <o,f0,male> weightfully this self which weighed upon me the release from which is what i desire and what i
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1094.14 1104.26 <o,f0,male> and the girl remembers in this infinite instant already now so many times divided the sadness she felt once hardly knowing she felt it
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1104.57 1117.81 <o,f0,male> to merely inhabit herself yes the girl falls absurd to fall even the earth with its compulsion to take unto itself all that falls must know that falling is absurd
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1142.20 1147.59 <o,f0,male> just one more i don't usually say that i like to just end but i'm afraid that ricky will come out here and
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1152.31 1157.23 <o,f0,male> this is called old man appropriately enough special
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1157.75 1170.97 <o,f0,male> big tits says the advertisement for a soft core magazine on our neighborhood newsstand but forget her breasts a lush fresh lipped blond skin glowing gold sprawls there
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1182.34 1190.03 <o,f0,male> coming of age in the american sensual darkness never seeing an unsmudged nipple an uncensored vagina
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1190.31 1202.67 <o,f0,male> has left me forever infected with an unquenchable lust of the eye always that erotic murmur i'm hardly myself if i'm not in a state of incipient desire
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1203.90 1215.72 <o,f0,male> god knows though there are worse twists your obsessions can take last year in israel a young ultra orthodox rabbi guiding some teenage girls through the shrine of the
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1216.69 1222.55 <o,f0,male> forbade them to look in one room because there were images in it he said were licentious
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1223.19 1237.26 <o,f0,male> the display was a photo men and women stripped naked some trying to cover their genitals others too frightened to bother lined up in snow waiting to be shot and thrown into a ditch
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1237.60 1239.31 <o,f0,male> the girls to my horror
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1239.80 1244.89 <o,f0,male> averted their gaze what carnal mistrust had their teacher taught them
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1245.96 1247.09 <o,f0,male> even that though
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1259.14 1269.38 <o,f0,male> i kept finding myself at her page that she died in the camps made her i didn't dare wonder why more present more precious
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1270.71 1281.24 <o,f0,male> died in the camps that too people or jews anyway kept from their children back then but it was like sex you didn't have to be told
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1282.36 1286.03 <o,f0,male> and death how close they can seem so
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1286.42 1298.83 <o,f0,male> constantly conscious now of death moving towards me sometimes i think i confound them my wife 's loveliness almost consumes me my passion for her goes beyond reasonable bounds
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1299.15 1312.17 <o,f0,male> when we make love her holding me everywhere all around me i'm there and not there my mind teems jumbles of faces voices impressions i live my life over
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1312.39 1313.96 <o,f0,male> as though i were drowning
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1314.70 1321.39 <o,f0,male> then i am drowning in despair at having to leave her this everything
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1321.72 1324.19 <o,f0,male> all unbearable awful
CKWilliams_2001 1 CKWilliams_2001 1326.58 1337.57 <o,f0,male> to be able to die with no special contrition not having been slaughtered or enslaved and not having to know history 's next mad rage or regression
