MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 18.56 20.92 <o,f0,male> now when i was a young man forty years ago
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 22.22 28.22 <o,f0,male> the country was very very poor with lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty we decided to do something about
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 29.37 31.65 <o,f0,male> but we didn't begin with a welfare program
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 32.24 37.47 <o,f0,male> or a poverty reduction program but we began with a family planning program
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 42.01 53.24 <o,f0,male> activity sets of activities so basically no one would accept family planning if their children didn't survive so the first step get to the children get to the mothers and then follow up with family planning
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 72.62 78.04 <o,f0,male> we said let 's do it the women said we agree we'll use pills but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 78.85 91.34 <o,f0,male> and we had very very few doctors we didn't take no as an answer we took no as a question we went to the nurses and the midwives who were also women and did a fantastic job at explaining how to use the pill
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 106.32 111.14 <o,f0,male> actually below that yellow sign i wish they hadn't wiped that because there was coca cola
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 112.95 119.86 <o,f0,male> we were so much bigger than coca cola in those days and no difference the people they chose were the people we chose
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 120.83 129.16 <o,f0,male> well known in the community they knew that customers were always right and they were terrific and they practiced the family planning themselves so they could supply pills and condoms
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 138.29 150.81 <o,f0,male> wherever there were people and you can see boats with the women selling things here 's the floating market selling bananas and crabs and also contraceptives wherever you find people you'll find contraceptives in thailand
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 152.04 166.11 <o,f0,male> and then we decided why not get to religion because in the philippines the catholic church was pretty strong and thai people were buddhist we went to them and they said look could you help us i'm there the one in blue not the yellow holding a bowl of holy water
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 168.05 170.35 <o,f0,male> to sprinkle holy water on pills and condoms
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 171.09 172.85 <o,f0,male> for the sanctity of the family
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 173.28 182.16 <o,f0,male> and this picture was sent throughout the country so some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves and the women were saying no wonder we have no side effects it's been
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 183.45 186.76 <o,f0,male> that was their perception and then we went to teachers
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 187.52 195.45 <o,f0,male> you need everybody to be involved in trying to provide whatever it is that make humanity a better place
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 195.76 204.15 <o,f0,male> so we went to the teachers over a quarter of a million were taught about family planning with a new alphabet a b for birth c for condom i for iud v for vasectomy
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 219.88 222.37 <o,f0,male> education class entertainment
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 222.55 229.79 <o,f0,male> and the kids were doing it in school too we had relay races with condoms we had children 's condom blowing championship and before long
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 229.91 238.15 <o,f0,male> the condom was know as the girl 's best friend in thailand for poor people diamonds don't make it so the condom is the girl 's best friend
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 246.73 255.43 <o,f0,male> women who practice family planning if you're pregnant take care of your pregnancy if you're not pregnant you can take a loan out from us and that was run by them and after
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 255.88 263.14 <o,f0,male> thirty five thirty six years it's still going on it's part of the village development bank it's not a real bank but it's a fund microcredit
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 263.40 271.92 <o,f0,male> we didn't need a big organization to run it it was run by the villagers themselves and you probably hardly see a thai man there it's always women women women women
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 273.17 278.12 <o,f0,male> and then we thought we'd help america because america 's been helping everyone whether they want help or not
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 284.24 291.48 <o,f0,male> and this is on the fourth of july we decided to provide vasectomy to all men but in particular american men to the front of the queue
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 291.85 299.03 <o,f0,male> right up to the ambassador 's residence during his and the hotel gave us the ballroom for it very appropriate room
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 303.34 315.28 <o,f0,male> and since it was near lunch time they said all right we'll give you some lunch of course it must be american cola you get two brands coke and pepsi and then the food is either hamburger or hotdog and i thought a hotdog will be more symbolic
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 317.57 324.60 <o,f0,male> and here is this then young man called willy bohm who worked for the usaid obviously he 's had his vasectomy because
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 326.58 332.73 <o,f0,male> and he was very happy it made a lot of news in america and it angered some people also i said don 't worry come over and i'll do the whole lot of
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 335.07 337.02 <o,f0,male> and what happened in all this thing
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 353.16 362.04 <o,f0,male> and so that's the case of everyone joining in we didn't have a strong government we didn't have lots of doctors but it's everybody 's job who can change attitude and behavior
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 362.42 372.29 <o,f0,male> then aids came along and hit thailand and we had to stop doing a lot of good things to fight aids but unfortunately the government was in denial denial denial so our
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 385.25 388.44 <o,f0,male> they help us in our fight against hiv
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 388.81 395.98 <o,f0,male> and after i gave them statistics they said yes okay you can use all the radio stations television stations and that's when we went onto the airwaves
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 431.42 439.44 <o,f0,male> and then aids education in all schools starting from university and these are high school kids teaching high school kids and the best teachers
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 439.98 447.74 <o,f0,male> not the boys and they were terrific and these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and hiv were known as mother theresa
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 448.48 456.80 <o,f0,male> and then we went down one more step these are primary school kids third fourth grade going to every household in the village every household in the whole of thailand
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 457.34 466.85 <o,f0,male> giving aids information and a condom to every household given by these young kids and no parents objected because we were trying to save lives and this
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 467.77 478.89 <o,f0,male> was a lifesaver and we said everyone needs to be involved so you have the companies also realizing that sick staff don't work and dead customers don't buy so they all trained and then we have this captain condom with his
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 480.96 489.83 <o,f0,male> going to schools and night spots and they loved him you need a symbol of something in every country every program you need a symbol and this is probably the best thing
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 494.88 504.51 <o,f0,male> and then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets everywhere everywhere in taxis you get condoms and also in traffic the policemen give you condoms our cops and
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 508.99 511.42 <o,f0,male> can you imagine new york policemen giving out condoms
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 511.98 520.15 <o,f0,male> of course i can and they'd enjoy it immensely i see them standing around right now everywhere imagine if they had condoms giving out to all sorts of people
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 520.45 528.38 <o,f0,male> and then new change we had hairbands clothing and the condom for your mobile phone during the rainy season
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 530.38 533.53 <o,f0,male> and these were the condoms that we introduced
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 535.43 545.08 <o,f0,male> one says weapon of mass protection we found you know somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction but we have found the weapon of mass protection the condom
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 545.47 555.95 <o,f0,male> and then it says here with the american flag don 't leave home without it but i have some to give out afterward but let me warn you these are thai sized so be very careful
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 559.25 561.88 <o,f0,male> so you can see that condoms
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 563.16 565.64 <o,f0,male> can do so many things look at this i gave this

MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 572.40 574.47 <o,f0,male> and then this is the picture i mentioned to
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 576.14 582.98 <o,f0,male> the weapon of mass protection and let the next olympics save some lives why just run around
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 587.15 593.43 <o,f0,male> and then finally in thailand we're buddhist we don't have a god so instead we say in rubber we trust
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 595.22 599.12 <o,f0,male> so you can see that we added everything to our endeavor to make life better for the people
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 599.65 608.92 <o,f0,male> we had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools because alcohol impairs judgment and then what happened after all this time everybody joined in
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 609.53 618.24 <o,f0,male> according to the u n new cases of hiv declined by ninety percent and according to the world bank seven point seven million lives
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 618.62 631.12 <o,f0,male> saved otherwise there wouldn't be many thais walking around today so it just showed you you could do something about it ninety percent of the funding came from thailand there was political commitment some financial commitment and everybody joined in
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 631.34 639.40 <o,f0,male> the fight so just don't leave it to the specialists and doctors and nurses we all need to help and then we decided to help people out of poverty now that we got
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 640.02 647.72 <o,f0,male> somewhat out of the way this time not with government alone but in cooperation with the business community because poor people are business people who
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 648.41 659.52 <o,f0,male> business skills and access to credit those are the things to be provided by the business community we're trying to turn them into barefoot entrepreneurs little business people the only way out of poverty
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 660.20 667.48 <o,f0,male> through business enterprise so that was done the money goes from the company into the village via tree planting it's not a free gift
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 667.75 675.81 <o,f0,male> they plant the trees and the money goes into their microcredit fund which we call the village development bank everybody joins in and they feel they own the
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 676.46 688.14 <o,f0,male> because they have brought the money in and before you can borrow the money you need to be trained and we believe if you want to help the poor those who are living in poverty access to credit must be a human right
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 688.57 696.98 <o,f0,male> access to credit must be a human right otherwise they'll never get out of poverty and then before getting a loan you must be trained here 's what we call a barefoot
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 698.46 705.53 <o,f0,male> teaching people how to do business so that when they borrow money they'll succeed with the business these are some of the businesses mushrooms crabs
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 706.59 718.83 <o,f0,male> vegetables trees fruits and this is very interesting nike ice cream and nike biscuits this is a village sponsored by nike they said they should stop making shoes and clothes make these better because we can afford them
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 720.72 722.00 <o,f0,male> and then we have silk
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 722.71 725.65 <o,f0,male> thai silk now we're making scottish tartans as you can see on the left
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 726.20 732.12 <o,f0,male> to sell to all people of scottish ancestors so anyone sitting in and watching tv get in touch with me
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 732.77 741.00 <o,f0,male> and then this is our answer to starbucks in thailand coffee and condoms see starbucks you awake we keep you awake and alive
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 742.89 746.07 <o,f0,male> can you imagine at every starbucks that you can also get condoms
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 751.26 765.20 <o,f0,male> and then now finally in education we want to change the school as being underutilized into a place where it's a lifelong learning center for everyone we call this our school based integrated rural development and it's a center a focal point
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 765.68 773.55 <o,f0,male> for economic and social development re do the school make it serve the community needs and here
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 774.18 785.11 <o,f0,male> a bamboo building all of them are bamboo this is a geodesic dome made of bamboo and i'm sure buckminster fuller would be very very proud to see a bamboo geodesic dome
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 785.41 792.18 <o,f0,male> and we use vegetables around the school ground so they raise their own vegetables and then finally i firmly believe
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 792.60 800.17 <o,f0,male> if we want the mdgs to work the millennium development goals we need to add family planning to it of course child mortality first
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 800.54 810.65 <o,f0,male> and then family planning everyone needs family planning service it's underutilized so we have now found the weapon of mass protection and we also ask the next olympics to be involved
MechaiViravaidya_2010X 1 MechaiViravaidya_2010X 811.44 816.41 <o,f0,male> in saving lives and then finally that is our network and these
