LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 15.23 29.71 <o,f0,male> i got to see the last case of killer smallpox in the world i was in india this past year and i may have seen the last cases of polio in the world there's nothing that makes you feel more
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 30.76 37.28 <o,f0,male> the blessing and the honor of working in a program like that than to know that something that horrible
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 37.90 39.46 <o,f0,male> no longer exists
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 45.26 52.47 <o,f0,male> dirty pictures they are difficult to watch but you should look at them with optimism
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 53.14 61.65 <o,f0,male> because the horror of these pictures will be matched by the uplifting quality of knowing that they no longer
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 77.42 84.13 <o,f0,male> i heard about a group of native americans who had taken over alcatraz island and a native american who wanted to give birth
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 84.58 94.31 <o,f0,male> on that island and no other doctor wanted to go and help her give birth i went out to alcatraz and i lived on the island for several weeks she gave
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 94.45 104.84 <o,f0,male> birth i caught the baby i got off the island i landed in san francisco and all the press wanted to talk to me because my three weeks on the island made me an expert in indian affairs
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 105.33 117.82 <o,f0,male> i wound up on every television show someone saw me on television they called me up and they asked me if i'd like to be in a movie and to play a young doctor for a bunch of rock and roll stars who were traveling in a bus ride from san francisco
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 118.14 126.48 <o,f0,male> to england and i said yes i would do that so i became the doctor in an absolutely awful movie called medicine ball caravan
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 127.58 139.82 <o,f0,male> now you know from the sixties you're either on the bus or you're off the bus i was on the bus my wife and i of thirty seven years joined the bus our bus ride took us from san francisco to london we switched buses at the big pond
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 141.27 146.35 <o,f0,male> we then got on two more buses and we drove through turkey and iran afghanistan
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 146.79 155.71 <o,f0,male> over the khyber pass into pakistan like every other young doctor this is us at the khyber pass and that's our bus we had some difficulty getting over the khyber pass
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 156.91 163.43 <o,f0,male> but we wound up in india and then like everyone else in our generation we went to live in a himalayan monastery
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 166.79 169.34 <o,f0,male> this is just like a residency program for those of you that are
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 172.62 175.18 <o,f0,male> we studied with a wise man
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 177.70 185.26 <o,f0,male> who then told me to get rid of the dress put on a three piece suit go join the united nations as a diplomat
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 186.40 194.31 <o,f0,male> and work for the world health organization and he made an outrageous prediction that smallpox would be eradicated and that this was god 's gift
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 194.65 201.24 <o,f0,male> to humanity because of the hard work of dedicated scientists and that prediction came true
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 201.81 208.82 <o,f0,male> and this little girl is rahima banu and she was the last case of killer smallpox in the world and this document
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 209.18 217.82 <o,f0,male> is the certificate that the global commission signed certifying the world to have eradicated the first disease in history
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 218.65 232.75 <o,f0,male> the key to eradicating smallpox was early detection early response i'm going to ask you to repeat that early detection early response can you say that early detection early response
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 244.53 254.56 <o,f0,male> more than two you're reading about larry page already somebody reads very fast in the year that larry page and sergey brin with whom i have a certain affection and a new
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 270.29 282.06 <o,f0,male> because it shows you to be the richest and the strongest and to be kings and queens of the world did not protect you from dying of smallpox never can you doubt that we are all in this together
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 282.85 296.09 <o,f0,male> but to see smallpox from the perspective of a sovereign is the wrong perspective you should see it from the perspective of a mother watching her child develop this disease and standing by helplessly day one
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 296.89 306.19 <o,f0,male> day two day three day four day five day six
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 307.33 315.11 <o,f0,male> mother and you're watching your child and on day six you see pustules that become hard
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 315.76 324.56 <o,f0,male> day seven they show the classic scars of smallpox umbilication day eight and al gore said earlier that the most
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 339.38 348.02 <o,f0,male> of this photograph and we took them hand to hand door to door to show people and ask them if there was smallpox in their house
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 348.42 355.27 <o,f0,male> because that was our surveillance system we didn't have google we didn't have web crawlers we didn't have computers
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 356.23 368.92 <o,f0,male> by day nine you look at this picture and you're horrified i look at this picture and i say thank god because it's clear that this is only an ordinary case of smallpox and i know this child will live
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 369.86 383.87 <o,f0,male> and by day thirteen the lesions are scabbing his eyelids are swollen but you know this child has no other secondary infection and by day twenty while he will be scarred for life he will live
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 393.82 404.63 <o,f0,male> and not be covered by lesions flat smallpox which killed one hundred percent of people who got it and hemorrhagic smallpox the most cruel of all which had a
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 406.01 414.87 <o,f0,male> for pregnant women i've probably had fifty women die they all had hemorrhagic smallpox i've never seen anybody die from it who wasn't a pregnant
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 451.11 458.92 <o,f0,male> twenty million people on the road at any time in buses and trains walking five hundred thousand villages one hundred and twenty million
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 468.67 475.86 <o,f0,male> cooling mother and it was wrong to bring strangers into your house when the deity was in the house
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 476.46 488.01 <o,f0,male> no incentive to report smallpox it wasn't just india that had smallpox deities smallpox deities were prevalent all over the world so how we eradicated smallpox
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 506.88 520.98 <o,f0,male> and that's what we did in india alone my one hundred and fifty thousand best friends and i went door to door with that same picture to every single house in india we made over one billion house calls
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 521.95 529.52 <o,f0,male> and in the process i learned something very important every time we did a house to house search
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 530.46 540.03 <o,f0,male> we had a spike in the number of reports of smallpox when we didn't search we had the illusion that there was no disease
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 540.35 549.10 <o,f0,male> when we did search we had the illusion that there was more disease a surveillance system was necessary because what we needed was
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 550.09 563.91 <o,f0,male> early detection early response so we searched and we searched and we found every case of smallpox in india we had a reward we raised the reward we continued to increase the reward
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 564.20 572.73 <o,f0,male> we had a scorecard that we wrote on every house and as we did that the number of reported cases in the world dropped to zero
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 576.50 585.03 <o,f0,male> we declared the globe free of smallpox it was the largest campaign in united nations history until the iraq war
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 586.13 593.17 <o,f0,male> hundred and fifty thousand people from all over the world doctors of every race religion culture and nation who fought
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 593.66 602.95 <o,f0,male> side by side brothers and sisters with each other not against each other in a common cause to make the world better
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 614.60 622.09 <o,f0,male> we may see polio eradicated but the key to eradicating polio is early detection early response
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 623.04 635.68 <o,f0,male> this may be the year we eradicate polio that will make it the second disease in history and david heymann who 's watching this on the webcast david keep on going we're close
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 643.78 651.50 <o,f0,male> i feel like hank aaron barry bonds can replace me any time let 's get another disease off the list of terrible things to worry about
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 652.14 661.05 <o,f0,male> i was just in india working on the polio program the polio surveillance program is four million people going door to door
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 664.97 679.19 <o,f0,male> early detection early response blindness the same thing the key to discovering blindness is doing epidemiological surveys and finding out the causes of blindness so you can mount the correct response
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 679.61 688.16 <o,f0,male> the seva foundation was started by a group of alumni of the smallpox eradication program who having
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 688.76 695.83 <o,f0,male> the highest mountain tasted the elixir of the success of eradicating a disease wanted to do it again
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 696.23 704.56 <o,f0,male> and over the last twenty seven years seva 's programs in fifteen countries have given back sight to more than two million blind people
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 705.99 719.16 <o,f0,male> because we wanted to apply these lessons of surveillance and epidemiology to something which nobody else was looking at as a public health issue blindness which heretofore had been thought of only as a clinical disease
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 721.78 722.11 <o,f0,female> eighty
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 733.52 742.38 <o,f0,male> and we conducted the first nepal survey ever done for health and the first nationwide blindness survey ever done and we had astonishing results
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 754.55 762.22 <o,f0,male> by cataract you can't cure or prevent what you don't know is there
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 762.49 771.07 <o,f0,male> in your ted packages there's a dvd infinite vision about doctor v and the aravind eye hospital i hope that you will take a look at it
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 771.59 782.41 <o,f0,male> aravind which started as a seva project is now the world 's largest and best eye hospital this year that one hospital will give back sight to more than three hundred thousand people in
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 790.09 793.13 <o,f0,male> of all terrible things this might be the worst
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 794.09 795.57 <o,f0,female> the key
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 795.66 810.27 <o,f0,male> to preventing or mitigating pandemic bird flu is early detection and rapid response we will not have a vaccine or adequate supplies of an antiviral to combat bird flu if it occurs in the next three years
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 811.62 818.68 <o,f0,male> stages the progress of a pandemic we are now at stage three on the pandemic alert stage
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 819.10 828.20 <o,f0,male> with just a little bit of human to human transmission but no human to human to human sustained transmission the moment who says
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 828.41 836.21 <o,f0,male> we've moved to category four this will not be like katrina the world as we know it will stop there'll be no airplanes flying
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 837.34 846.26 <o,f0,male> would you get in an airplane with two hundred and fifty people you didn't know coughing and sneezing when you knew that some of them might carry a disease that could kill you for which you had no
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 849.22 854.54 <o,f0,male> i did a study of the top epidemiologists in the world in october i asked them these are all
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 856.47 866.31 <o,f0,male> in influenza and i asked them the questions you'd like to ask them what do you think the likelihood is that there'll be a pandemic if it happens how bad do you think it will be
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 867.10 879.11 <o,f0,male> fifteen percent said they thought there'd be a pandemic within three years but much worse than that ninety percent said they thought there'd be a pandemic within your children or your grandchildren 's lifetime
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 880.63 891.05 <o,f0,male> and they thought that if there was a pandemic a billion people would get sick as many as one hundred and sixty five million people would die
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 891.19 898.83 <o,f0,male> there would be a global recession and depression as our just in time inventory system and the tight rubber band of globalization broke
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 899.80 906.16 <o,f0,male> and the cost to our economy of one to three trillion dollars would be far worse for everyone
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 906.53 915.37 <o,f0,male> than merely one hundred million people dying because so many more people would lose their job and their healthcare benefits that the consequences are almost unthinkable
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 917.54 926.25 <o,f0,male> and it's getting worse because travel is getting so much better let me show you a simulation
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 927.35 933.52 <o,f0,male> of what a pandemic looks like so we know what we're talking about let 's assume for
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 933.99 943.36 <o,f0,male> the first case occurs in south asia it initially goes quite slowly you get two or three discrete locations
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 944.58 952.15 <o,f0,male> then there'll be secondary outbreaks and the disease will spread from country to country so fast that you won 't know what
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 963.49 972.16 <o,f0,male> and grab it when it first started if we could find it early and we had early detection and early response and we could put each one of those viruses in jail
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 973.19 979.40 <o,f0,male> that's the only way to deal with something like a pandemic
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1005.26 1015.28 <o,f0,male> the epidemic but you can't always do that but there's an organization that has been able to find a way to learn when the first cases occur and that is called
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1015.79 1026.95 <o,f0,male> gphin it's the global public health information network and that simulation that i showed you that you thought was bird flu that was sars and sars is the pandemic that did not occur
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1027.70 1037.38 <o,f0,male> and it didn't occur because gphin found the pandemic to be of sars three months before
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1039.06 1046.61 <o,f0,male> actually announced it and because of that we were able to stop the sars pandemic and i think we owe a great debt of gratitude
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1046.74 1053.83 <o,f0,male> to gphin and to ron st john who i hope is in the audience some place over there who 's the founder
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1066.46 1078.88 <o,f0,male> has flown ron here from ottawa where gphin is located because not only did gphin find sars early but you may have seen last week that iran announced
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1079.35 1086.92 <o,f0,male> that they had bird flu in iran but gphin found the bird flu in iran not february fourteen but last september
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1087.18 1094.44 <o,f0,male> we need an early warning system to protect us against the things that are humanity 's worst nightmare
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1094.98 1107.89 <o,f0,male> and so my ted wish is based on the common denominator of these experiences smallpox early detection early response blindness polio early detection early response pandemic bird flu
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1108.24 1116.50 <o,f0,male> early detection early response it is a litany it is so obvious that our only way of dealing with these new diseases
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1117.11 1130.93 <o,f0,male> is to find them early and to kill them before they spread so my ted wish is for you to help build a global system an early warning system to protect us against humanity 's worst nightmares
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1131.85 1140.79 <o,f0,male> and what i thought i would call it is early detection but it should really be called
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1142.78 1143.79 <o,f0,male> total early detection
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1158.49 1167.22 <o,f0,male> in all seriousness because this idea is birthed in ted i would like it to be a legacy of ted
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1167.61 1174.56 <o,f0,male> and i'd like to call it the international system for total early disease detection
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1178.19 1178.50 <o,f0,male> and
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1180.62 1182.68 <o,f0,male> then becomes our mantra
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1185.56 1198.68 <o,f0,male> so instead of a hidden pandemic of bird flu we find it and immediately contain it instead of a novel virus caused by bio terror or bio error or shift or drift we find it
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1198.95 1207.84 <o,f0,male> and we contain it instead of industrial accidents like oil spills or the catastrophe in bhopal we find them and we respond
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1216.46 1224.44 <o,f0,male> and instead of a system which is owned by a government and hidden in the bowels of government let 's build an early detection system
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1224.69 1231.25 <o,f0,male> that's freely available to anyone in the world in their own language let 's make it transparent
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1232.04 1243.88 <o,f0,male> non governmental not owned by any single country or company housed in a neutral country with redundant backup in a different time zone and a different continent
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1263.14 1271.80 <o,f0,male> using text messages or sms or instant messaging to find out from people who are within one hundred meters of the rumor that you hear if it is in fact
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1272.02 1282.49 <o,f0,male> valid and let 's add satellite confirmation and we'll add gapminder 's amazing graphics to the front end and we'll grow it as a moral force in the world
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1282.98 1290.82 <o,f0,male> finding out those terrible things before anybody else knows about them and sending our response to them so that next year
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1301.69 1310.66 <o,f0,male> of this community and be proud that we have done everything we can to stop pandemics other catastrophes and change the world beginning right now
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1331.33 1336.79 <o,f0,male> an amazing presentation first of all just so everyone understands you're saying
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1338.31 1347.53 <o,f0,male> by creating web crawlers looking on the internet for patterns they can detect something suspicious
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1361.42 1368.05 <o,f0,male> as ron st john i hope you'll go and meet him in the dinner afterwards and talk to him when he started gphin
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1379.59 1387.38 <o,f0,male> one point five million chickens and birds and they stopped that outbreak in its tracks immediate detection immediate
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1388.43 1399.37 <o,f0,male> a number of years went by and there were a lot of rumors about bird flu ron and his team in ottawa began to crawl the web only crawling twenty thousand different
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1399.80 1409.37 <o,f0,male> websites mostly periodicals and they read about and heard about a concern of a lot of children who had high fever and symptoms of bird flu
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1409.96 1421.14 <o,f0,male> they reported this to who who took a little while taking action because who will only receive a report from a government because it's the united nations
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1421.72 1431.03 <o,f0,male> but they were able to point to who and let them know that there was this surprising and unexplained cluster of illnesses that looked like bird flu
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1431.48 1437.36 <o,f0,male> that turned out to be sars that's how the world found out about sars and because of that
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1437.57 1446.57 <o,f0,male> we were able to stop sars now what's really important is that before there was gphin one hundred percent of all the world 's reports of bad things
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1447.49 1460.65 <o,f0,male> talking about famine or you're talking about bird flu or you're talking about ebola one hundred percent of all those reports came from nations the moment these guys in ottawa on a budget of eight hundred thousand dollars a year got cracking
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1461.17 1470.16 <o,f0,male> seventy five percent of all the reports in the world came from gphin twenty five percent of all the reports in the world came from all the other one hundred and eighty nations
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1471.07 1481.27 <o,f0,male> now here 's what's real interesting after they'd been working for a couple years what do you think happened to those nations they felt pretty stupid so they started sending in their reports earlier now
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1493.21 1501.51 <o,f0,male> can you find it even earlier than gphin does now of course you can you saw that they found sars using their chinese web crawler
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1516.70 1527.08 <o,f0,male> so yes i want to take gphin i want to build on it i want to add all the languages of the world that we possibly can i want to make this open to everybody
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1527.45 1534.70 <o,f0,male> so that the health officer in nairobi or in patna bihar will have as much access to it as the folks in ottawa or in cdc
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1535.06 1544.33 <o,f0,male> and i want to make it part of our culture that there is a community of people who are watching out for the worst nightmares of humanity and that it's accessible to
