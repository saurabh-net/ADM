FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 16.63 28.90 <o,f0,female> going to talk about some of my discoveries around the world through my work these are not discoveries of planets or new technologies or science they're discoveries of people
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 29.48 31.88 <o,f0,female> and the way people are and new leadership
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 34.13 42.05 <o,f0,female> this is benki benki is a leader of the ashaninka nation his people live in brazil and in peru
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 42.90 53.63 <o,f0,female> benki comes from a village so remote up in the amazon that to get there either you have to fly and land on water or go by canoe for several days
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 54.46 64.56 <o,f0,female> i met benki three years ago in sao paulo when i'd brought him and other leaders from indigenous peoples to meet with me and leaders from around the world because we wanted to
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 73.70 83.99 <o,f0,female> for their dignity their spirit and their resistance starting with the incas and continuing through the nineteenth century with the rubber tappers
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 86.43 100.29 <o,f0,female> today 's biggest threat to the ashaninka people and to benki comes from illegal logging the people who come into the beautiful forest and cut down ancient mahogany trees float them down the river to world markets
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 101.44 107.13 <o,f0,female> knew this he could see what was happening to his forest to his environment because he was taken
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 107.49 115.69 <o,f0,female> under his grandfather 's wing when he was only two years old to begin to learn about the forest and the way of life of his people
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 116.44 126.08 <o,f0,female> his grandfather died when he was only ten and at that young age ten years old benki became the paje of his community
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 126.63 132.67 <o,f0,female> now in the ashaninka tradition and culture the paje is the most important person in the community
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 133.12 141.27 <o,f0,female> this is the person who contains within him all the knowledge all the wisdom of centuries and centuries of life
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 141.83 151.33 <o,f0,female> and not just about his people but about everything his people 's survival depended on the trees the birds the water the soil
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 151.55 158.44 <o,f0,female> the forest so when he was only ten and he became the paje he began to lead his people
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 159.12 165.07 <o,f0,female> he began to talk to them about the forest that they needed to protect the way of life they needed to nurture
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 177.47 188.87 <o,f0,female> eight years later when he was a young man of eighteen benki left the forest for the first time he went three thousand miles on an odyssey to rio to the earth summit
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 189.71 199.05 <o,f0,female> to tell the world what was happening in his tiny little corner and he went because he hoped the world would listen some did not everybody
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 199.55 209.10 <o,f0,female> but if you can imagine this young man with his headdress and his flowing robe learning a new language portuguese not to mention english going to rio
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 217.90 226.25 <o,f0,female> benki came back to his village full of ideas new technologies new research new ways of understanding what was going on
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 228.13 235.86 <o,f0,female> since that time he 's continued to work with his people and not only the ashaninka nation but all the peoples of the amazon and beyond
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 236.29 247.07 <o,f0,female> he 's built schools to teach children to care for the forest together he 's led the reforestation of over twenty five percent of the land that had been destroyed by the loggers
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 247.99 256.14 <o,f0,female> he 's created a cooperative to help people diversify their livelihoods and he 's brought the internet and satellite technology to the forest
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 256.67 264.15 <o,f0,female> both so that people themselves could monitor the deforestation but also that he could speak from the forest to the rest of the world
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 266.14 280.58 <o,f0,female> if you were to meet benki and ask him why are you doing this why are you putting yourself at risk why are you making yourself vulnerable to what is often a hostile world he would tell you as he told me
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 281.42 290.55 <o,f0,female> i asked myself he said what did my grandparents and my great grandparents do to protect the forest for me
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 294.23 304.46 <o,f0,female> so when i think of that i wonder what our grandchildren and our great grandchildren when they ask themselves that question i wonder how they will answer
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 305.92 315.93 <o,f0,female> for me the world is veering towards a future we don't much want when we really thing about it deep inside it's a future we don't know the details of
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 317.26 325.17 <o,f0,female> but it's a future that has signs just like benki saw the signs around him we know we are running out of what we need
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 325.92 336.90 <o,f0,female> we're running out of fresh water we're running out of fossil fuels we're running out of land we know climate change is going to affect all of us we don't know how but we know it will
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 360.88 367.77 <o,f0,female> egos systems of government figuring it out massive change and in addition to that we know
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 368.13 375.19 <o,f0,female> that five other really big countries are going to have a say in the future a say we haven't even really started to hear yet
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 376.71 380.49 <o,f0,female> china india russia south
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 390.02 403.64 <o,f0,female> but you know all that you know more than benki knew when he left his forest and went three thousand miles you also know that we can't just keep doing what we've always done because we'll get the results we've always gotten
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 404.27 414.49 <o,f0,female> and this reminds me of something i understand lord salisbury said to queen victoria over a hundred years ago when she was pressing him please change he said change
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 415.52 419.48 <o,f0,female> why change things are bad enough as they are
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 422.63 431.34 <o,f0,female> we have to change it's imperative to me when i look around the world that we need to change ourselves
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 431.77 439.90 <o,f0,female> we need new models of what it means to be a leader we need new models of being a leader and a human in the world
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 441.10 451.59 <o,f0,female> i started life as a banker now i don't admit to that to anybody but my very close friends but for the past eight years i've done something completely different
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 452.33 459.90 <o,f0,female> my work has taken me around the world where i've had the real privilege of meeting people like benki and many others
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 467.54 478.23 <o,f0,female> have different answers who understand the filters that they wear when they go out into the world this is sanghamitra sanghamitra comes from bangalore
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 478.89 489.78 <o,f0,female> i met sanghamitra eight years ago when i was in bangalore organizing a workshop with leaders of different ngo 's working in some of the hardest aspects of society
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 536.41 550.36 <o,f0,female> in india at that time it was skyrocketing and nobody understood why and everyone was actually very very afraid today there are still three million hiv positive people in india that's the second largest population in the world
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 552.38 554.52 <o,f0,female> when i asked sanghamitra how did you get
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 555.13 564.00 <o,f0,female> from english literature to hiv aids not an obvious path she said to me it 's all connected
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 565.46 578.92 <o,f0,female> literature makes one sensitive sensitive to people to their dreams and to their ideas since that time under her leadership samraksha has been a pioneer in all fields related to hiv aids
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 579.78 592.04 <o,f0,female> they have respite homes the first the first care centers the first counseling services and not just in urban seven million population bangalore but in the hardest to reach villages in the state of
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 593.28 602.91 <o,f0,female> even that wasn't enough she wanted to change policy at the government level ten of their programs that she pioneered are now government policy and funded by the government
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 603.43 612.33 <o,f0,female> they take care of twenty thousand odd people today in over one thousand villages around karnataka she works with people like murali krishna
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 620.62 628.42 <o,f0,female> but he saw the work the care the compassion that sanghramitra and her team brought to the village and he wanted to be part of it
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 629.16 638.33 <o,f0,female> he 's a leaders quest fellow and that helps him with his work they've pioneered a different approach to villages instead of handing out information in pamphlets as is so often the case
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 650.58 658.57 <o,f0,female> two weeks in the villages and she had a real breakthrough they were sitting in a circle talking about the dreams for the village and the young women
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 658.84 665.76 <o,f0,female> in the village spoke up and said we 've changed our dream our dream is for our
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 666.32 674.63 <o,f0,female> partners our husbands not to be given to us because of a horoscope but to be given to us because they've been tested for hiv
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 675.53 684.26 <o,f0,female> if you are lucky enough to meet sanghamitra and ask her why and how how have you achieved so much
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 685.93 697.64 <o,f0,female> she would look at you and very quietly very softly say it just happened it's the spirit inside
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 697.97 699.76 <o,f0,female> this is doctor fan jianchuan
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 715.78 727.30 <o,f0,female> he 's been a soldier a teacher a politician a vice mayor and a business man but if you sat down and asked him who are you really and what do you do he would tell you
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 728.03 738.02 <o,f0,female> a collector and i curate a museum i was lucky i heard about him for years and i finally met him earlier this year at his museum in chengdu
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 738.76 747.27 <o,f0,female> he 's been a collector all of his life starting when he was four or five in the early nineteen sixties now just think of the early nineteen sixties in china
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 748.03 754.44 <o,f0,female> over a lifetime through everything through the cultural revolution and everything afterward he 's kept collecting
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 754.83 762.61 <o,f0,female> so that he now has over eight million pieces in his museums documenting contemporary chinese history
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 763.29 771.37 <o,f0,female> these are pieces that you won 't find anywhere else in the world in part because they document parts of history chinese choose to forget
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 772.32 782.92 <o,f0,female> for example he 's got over one million pieces documenting the sino japanese war a war that's not talked about in china very much and whose heroes are not honored
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 783.96 792.39 <o,f0,female> why did he do all this because he thought a nation should never repeat the mistakes of the past so
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 792.92 806.63 <o,f0,female> from commissioning slightly larger than life bronze statues of the heroes of the sino japanese war including those chinese who then fought with each other and left mainland china to go to taiwan
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 807.34 819.96 <o,f0,female> to commemorating all the unknown ordinary soldiers who survived by asking them to take prints of their hands he is making sure one man is making sure that history is not forgotten
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 826.84 836.33 <o,f0,female> of documents and artifacts commemorating the u s role in fighting on the chinese side in that long war the flying tigers
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 848.32 857.50 <o,f0,female> the most sensitive buildings include a lifetime of collection about the cultural revolution a period that actually most chinese would prefer
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 857.60 863.63 <o,f0,female> to forget but he doesn't want his nation ever to forget
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 863.80 871.96 <o,f0,female> these people inspire me and they inspire me because they show us what is possible when you look at the world
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 872.34 879.78 <o,f0,female> change the way you look at your place in the world they looked outside and then they changed what was on the inside
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 880.80 892.74 <o,f0,female> they didn't go to business school they didn't read a manual how to be a good leader in ten easy steps but they have qualities we'd all recognize they have drive passion commitment
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 893.67 901.07 <o,f0,female> they've gone away from what they did before and they've gone to something they didn't know
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 901.76 913.44 <o,f0,female> they've tried to connect worlds they didn't know existed before they've built bridges and they've walked across them they have a sense of the great arc of time and their tiny place in it
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 913.78 923.61 <o,f0,female> they know people have come before them and will follow them and they know that they're part of a whole that they depend on other people it's not about them
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 926.14 932.01 <o,f0,female> them and they have humility it just happens
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 932.33 946.09 <o,f0,female> but we know it doesn't just happen don't we we know it takes a lot to make it happen and we know the direction the world is going in so i think we need succession planning on a global basis
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 946.18 956.71 <o,f0,female> we can't wait for the next generation the new joiners to come in and learn how to be the good leaders we need i think it has to start with us and we know just like they knew how hard it is
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 958.68 967.21 <o,f0,female> but the good news is that we don't have to figure it out as we go along we have models we have examples like benki and sanghamitri and jianchuan
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 967.95 977.18 <o,f0,female> we can look at what they've done if we look we can learn from what they've learned we can change the way we see ourselves in the world
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 1 FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S 978.18 988.54 <o,f0,female> and if we're lucky we can change the way our great grandchildren will answer benki 's question thank you
