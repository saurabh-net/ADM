NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 16.37 26.19 <o,f0,male> most people don't know that when i went to high school in this country i applied for university at a time when i was convinced i was going to be an artist and be a sculptor
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 26.75 31.63 <o,f0,male> and i came from a very privileged background i was very lucky my family was wealthy
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 32.22 39.66 <o,f0,male> and my father believed in one thing and that was to give us all as much education as we wanted and i announced i wanted to be a sculptor in paris
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 40.22 47.78 <o,f0,male> and he was a clever man he sort of said well that's ok but you've done very well in your math sats in fact i'd got an eight hundred
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 48.27 57.51 <o,f0,male> and he thought i did very well and i did too in the arts this was my passion and he said if you go to mit to which i had been given early admission
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 58.10 69.17 <o,f0,male> i will pay for every year you're at mit in graduate or undergraduate as much as you want i will pay for an equal number of years for you to live in paris and i thought that was the best deal in town so i accepted it immediately
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 69.79 81.93 <o,f0,male> and i decided that if i was good in art and i was good in mathematics i'd study architecture which was the blending of the two i went and told my headmaster that at prep school and i said to him what i was doing
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 82.29 90.28 <o,f0,male> that i was going to go study architecture because it was art and mathematics put together he said to me something that just went completely
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 90.50 99.32 <o,f0,male> my head he said you know i like grey suits and i like pin striped suits but i don't like grey pin striped suits
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 100.33 107.71 <o,f0,male> i thought what a turkey this guy is and i went off to mit i studied architecture then did a second degree in architecture
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 109.80 113.00 <o,f0,male> quickly realized that it wasn't architecture
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 113.22 124.81 <o,f0,male> that really the mixing of art and science was computers and that that really was the place to bring both and enjoyed a career doing that
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 125.27 136.75 <o,f0,male> and probably if i were to fill out jim citrin 's scale i'd put one hundred percent on the side of the equation where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 137.18 145.12 <o,f0,male> and after doing this for a long time and sort of the media lab passing the baton on i thought well maybe it's time for me to do a project
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 145.62 161.56 <o,f0,male> something that would be important but also something that would take advantage of all of these privileges that one had and in the case of the media lab knowing a lot of people knowing people who were either executives or wealthy and
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 162.05 172.16 <o,f0,male> also not having in my own case a career to worry about anymore my career i mean i'd done my career didn't have to worry about earning money didn't have to worry about what people thought about me
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 172.38 184.18 <o,f0,male> and i said boy let 's really do something that takes advantage of all these features and thought that if we could address education by leveraging the children and bringing
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 184.47 189.71 <o,f0,male> to the world the access of the computers that that was really the thing we should do
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 190.02 198.68 <o,f0,male> never shown this picture before and probably going to be sued for it it's taken at three o'clock in the morning without the permission of the company it's about two weeks old there they are
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 200.74 207.33 <o,f0,male> if you look at the picture you'll see they're stacked up those are conveyor belts that go around
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 220.11 228.23 <o,f0,male> thing moving on the assembly line because it's constant so they go around in this loop which is why you see them up there so this was great
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 245.82 259.09 <o,f0,male> one thing we learned was that these kids can absolutely jump into it just the same way as our kids do here and when people tell me who 's going to teach the teachers to teach the kids i say to myself what planet do you come from
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 260.34 268.21 <o,f0,male> not a person in this room i don't care how techie you are there's not a person in this room that doesn't give their laptop or cell phone to a kid to help them
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 269.51 276.94 <o,f0,male> we all need help even those of us who are very seasoned this picture of seymour twenty five years ago
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 293.46 301.40 <o,f0,male> and when they debug the programs they come the closest to learning about learning that was very important and in some sense we've lost that
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 302.02 311.79 <o,f0,male> kids don't program enough and boy if there's anything i hope this brings back it's programming to kids it's really important using applications is ok
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 312.08 318.02 <o,f0,male> but programming is absolutely fundamental this is being launched with three languages in it squeak logo
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 318.39 330.71 <o,f0,male> and a third that i've never even seen before the point being this is going to be very very intensive on the programming side this photograph is very important because it's much later this is in the early
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 332.13 341.35 <o,f0,male> my son dimitri who 's here many of you know dimitri went to cambodia set up this school that we had built just as the school connected it to the internet and these kids
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 341.89 347.29 <o,f0,male> had their laptops but it was really what spirited this plus the influence of
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 347.71 361.05 <o,f0,male> joe and others we started one laptop per child these are the same village in cambodia just a couple of months ago these kids are real pros there were just seven thousand machines out there being tested by kids
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 361.42 365.22 <o,f0,male> being a nonprofit is absolutely fundamental
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 378.04 390.89 <o,f0,male> the clarity of purpose is there the moral purpose is clear i can see any head of state any executive i want at any time because i'm not selling laptops ok i have no shareholders whether we sell it doesn't make
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 391.07 400.54 <o,f0,male> any difference whatsoever the clarity of purpose is absolutely critical and the second is very counterintuitive you can get the best people in the world
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 402.13 409.14 <o,f0,male> if you look at our professional services including search firms including communications including legal services including
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 409.47 421.55 <o,f0,male> banking they're all pro bono and it's not to save money we've got money in the bank it's because you get the best people you get the people who are doing it because they believe in the mission and they're the best people we
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 422.04 429.88 <o,f0,male> afford to hire a cfo we put out a job description for a cfo at zero salary and we had a queue of people
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 430.55 437.14 <o,f0,male> allows you to team up with people the un 's not going to be our partner if we're profit making so announcing this with kofi annan was very important
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 437.52 445.24 <o,f0,male> and the un allowed us to basically reach all the countries and this was the machine we were showing before i met
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 445.73 455.35 <o,f0,male> yves behar and while this machine in some sense is silly in retrospect it actually served a very important purpose that pencil yellow crank
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 467.28 475.57 <o,f0,male> crank it really is stupid to have it on board by the way in spite of what some people in the press don't get it didn't understand it we didn't take it off because we
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 475.79 483.40 <o,f0,male> didn't want to do having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want you want it a separate thing like the ac adaptor i didn't bring one with me but
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 484.32 496.67 <o,f0,male> they really work much better off board and then i could tell you lots about the laptop but i'll tell you just four things just keep in mind because there's other people including bill gates who said gee you've got a real computer that
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 497.27 506.08 <o,f0,male> computer is unlike anything you've had and does things there are four of them that you don't come close to and it's very important to be low power and i hope
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 513.81 522.70 <o,f0,male> dual mode display that sunlight display 's fantastic we were using it at lunch today in the sunlight and the more sunlight the better and that was really critical the mesh network it'll become
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 528.78 537.63 <o,f0,male> i wanted to go to art school and by the way when i graduated from mit i thought the worst and silliest thing to do would be to go to paris for six years so i didn't do that
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 546.08 558.24 <o,f0,male> most people make inexpensive products by taking cheap design cheap labor cheap components and making a cheap laptop and in english the word cheap has a double meaning which is really appropriate because it's cheap
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 558.64 570.59 <o,f0,male> in the pejorative sense as well as inexpensive but if you take a different approach and you think of very large scale integration very advanced materials very advanced manufacturing so you're pouring chemicals in one
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 571.11 579.78 <o,f0,male> ipods are spewing out the other and really cool design that's what we wanted to do and i can race through these and save a lot of time because yves and i obviously didn't compare notes
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 580.41 588.62 <o,f0,male> these are his slides and so i don't have to talk about them but it was really to us very important
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 588.80 596.62 <o,f0,male> as a strategy it wasn't just to kind of make it cute because somebody you know good design is very important yves showed one of the
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 598.35 608.14 <o,f0,male> power generating devices the mesh network the reason i and i won 't go into it in great detail but when we deliver laptops to kids in the remotest and
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 619.99 634.27 <o,f0,male> they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart if you're in the jungle it's about five hundred meters so if a kid bicycles home or walks a few miles they're going to be off the grid so to speak they're not going to be near another laptop so you have to nail these on to a tree and
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 634.72 641.75 <o,f0,male> sort of get it you don't call verizon or sprint you build your own network and that's very important the user interface
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 642.09 653.32 <o,f0,male> we are launching with eighteen keyboards english is by far the minority latin is relatively rare too you just look at some of the languages i'm willing to suspect some of you hadn't even heard of them before
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 653.69 662.76 <o,f0,male> is there anybody in the room one person unless you work with olpc is there anybody in the room that can tell me what language the keyboard is that's on the screen
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 669.28 674.17 <o,f0,male> yes you're right he 's right it's amharic it's ethiopian in ethiopia there's never been a keyboard
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 674.60 683.51 <o,f0,male> there is no keyboard standard because there's no market and this is the big difference again when you're a nonprofit you look at children as a mission not as a market
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 683.83 695.64 <o,f0,male> so we went to ethiopia and we helped them make a keyboard and this will become the standard ethiopian keyboard so what i want to end with is sort of what we're doing to roll it out and we changed strategy completely i decided
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 710.96 719.13 <o,f0,male> do a million in the case of gaddafi he'd do one point two million and that they would launch it we thought this is exactly the right strategy get it out
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 729.39 735.80 <o,f0,male> got the ministers went through a lot of the stuff this was a period in my life where i was traveling three hundred and thirty days per year
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 736.23 750.30 <o,f0,male> not something you'd envy or want to do in the case of libya it was a lot of fun meeting gaddafi in his tent the camel smells were unbelievable and it was forty five degrees centigrade i mean this was not what you'd call a cool experience and
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 750.85 760.24 <o,f0,male> former countries i say former because none of them really came through this summer there was a big difference between getting a head of state to have a photo opportunity make a press release
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 760.49 766.99 <o,f0,male> so we went to smaller ones uruguay bless their hearts small country not so rich president said he'd do it and guess what he did do
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 768.10 777.46 <o,f0,male> tender had nothing in it that related to us nothing specific about sunlight readable mesh network low power but just a vanilla laptop proposal and guess what we won it hands
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 795.79 802.05 <o,f0,male> and boom boom boom the president of mongolia and so what happens is these things start to happen with these countries
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 802.67 815.15 <o,f0,male> still not enough add up all those countries it didn't quite get to thing so we said let 's start a program in the united states so end of august early september we decide to do this we announced it near the
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 815.67 823.68 <o,f0,male> middle end just when the clinton initiative was taking place we thought that was a good time to announce it launched it on the twelfth of november
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 824.07 831.80 <o,f0,male> said it would be just for a short period until the twenty sixth we've extended it until the thirty one st and the give one get one program
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 832.25 839.91 <o,f0,male> is really important because it got a lot of people absolutely interested the first day it was just
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 846.06 856.93 <o,f0,male> get one but maybe give one hundred give one thousand and that's where you come in and that's where i think it's very important i don't want you all to go out and buy four hundred dollars worth of laptops
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 878.33 888.19 <o,f0,male> it's got to become viral ok use your mailing lists people in this room have extraordinary mailing lists get your friends to give one get one
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 888.48 894.32 <o,f0,male> if each one of you sends it to three or four hundred people that would be fantastic i won 't dwell on the pricing
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 894.84 903.66 <o,f0,male> at all just to say that when you do the give one get one a lot of press is a bit about they didn't make it it's one hundred and eighty eight dollars it's not one hundred
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 903.79 916.49 <o,f0,male> it will be one hundred in two years it will go below one hundred we've pledged not to add features but to bring that price down but it was the countries that wanted it to go up and we let them push it up for all sorts of reasons
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 916.91 925.42 <o,f0,male> so what you can do i've just said it don't just give one get one i just want to end with one last one this one is not even twenty four hours old or maybe it's twenty four hours
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 925.62 934.90 <o,f0,male> the first kids got their laptops they got them by ship and i'm talking now about seven thousand eight thousand at a time went out this week they went to
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 937.24 950.31 <o,f0,male> mexico and it's been slow coming and we're only making about five thousand a week but we hope we hope sometime in next year maybe by the middle of the year to hit a million a month
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 951.47 960.40 <o,f0,male> that number and a million isn't so much it's not a big number we're selling a billion cell phones worldwide this year but a million a month in laptop land is a big number
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 960.93 974.56 <o,f0,male> and the world production today everybody combined making laptops is five million a month so i'm standing here telling you that sometime next year we're going to make twenty percent of the world production and if we do that there are going to be a lot of lucky
NicholasNegroponte_2007P 1 NicholasNegroponte_2007P 974.76 988.97 <o,f0,male> kids out there and we hope if you have eg two years from now or whenever you have it again i won 't have bad breath and i will be invited back and will have hopefully by then maybe one hundred million out there to children thank you
