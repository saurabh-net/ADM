BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 22.74 32.34 <o,f0,male> well the topic i'm going to discuss is one which is in a certain sense very peculiar because it's very old roughness is part of human life
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 46.94 57.47 <o,f0,male> different kinds of mess now in fact by a complete fluke i got involved many years ago in a study of this form of complexity
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 58.01 66.31 <o,f0,male> and to my utter amazement i found traces very strong traces i must say of order in that
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 67.39 81.14 <o,f0,male> and so today i would like to present to you a few examples of what this represents i prefer the word roughness to the word irregularity because irregularity to someone who had latin
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 81.61 90.11 <o,f0,male> in my long past youth means the contrary of regularity but it is not so regularity is the contrary of
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 91.04 101.75 <o,f0,male> because the basic aspect of the world is very rough so let me show you a few objects some of them are artificial others of them are very real in a certain sense
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 103.35 110.91 <o,f0,male> now this is the real it's a cauliflower now why do i show a cauliflower a very ordinary and ancient vegetable
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 111.43 119.11 <o,f0,male> because old and ancient as it may be it's very complicated and it's very simple both at the same time
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 119.71 130.53 <o,f0,male> if you try to weigh it of course it's very easy to weigh it and when you eat it the weight matters but suppose you try to measure its surface
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 131.71 142.40 <o,f0,male> very interesting if you cut with a sharp knife one of the florets of a cauliflower and look at it separately you think of a whole cauliflower but smaller
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 142.85 153.00 <o,f0,male> and then you cut again again again again again again again again again and you still get small cauliflowers so the experience of humanity has always been
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 153.32 160.89 <o,f0,male> that there are some shapes which have this peculiar property that each part is like the whole but smaller
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 162.75 167.41 <o,f0,male> did humanity do with that very very little so
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 170.45 177.61 <o,f0,male> what i did actually is to study this problem and i found something
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 179.45 192.07 <o,f0,male> surprising that one can measure roughness by a number a number two point three one point two and sometimes much more one day a friend of mine to bug me
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 192.62 200.23 <o,f0,male> brought a picture and said what is the roughness of this curve i said well just short of one point five it was one point
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 202.93 212.49 <o,f0,male> time i've been looking at these things for so long so these numbers are the numbers which denote the roughness of these surfaces i hasten to say that these surfaces
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 221.36 233.58 <o,f0,male> and so on the left i took the roughness copied from many landscapes to the right i took a higher roughness so the eye after a while can distinguish these two very well
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 234.97 243.49 <o,f0,male> to learn about measuring roughness this is very rough and this is sort of smooth and this perfectly smooth very few things are very smooth so then if you
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 245.30 253.81 <o,f0,male> to ask questions what's the surface of a cauliflower well you measure and measure and measure each time you're closer it gets bigger
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 255.07 262.40 <o,f0,male> very very small distances what's the length of the coastline of these lakes the closer you measure the longer it
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 263.27 272.46 <o,f0,male> the concept of length of coastline which seems to be so natural because it's given in many cases is in fact completely fallacy there's no such thing
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 273.24 280.39 <o,f0,male> you must do it differently what good is that to know these things well surprisingly enough it's good in many ways
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 281.18 292.17 <o,f0,male> to begin with artificial landscapes which i invented sort of are used in cinema all the time we see mountains in the distance they may be mountains but they may be just
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 293.21 298.56 <o,f0,male> just cranked on now it's very easy to do it used to be very time consuming but now it's nothing
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 302.48 312.01 <o,f0,male> something very strange if you take this thing you know very well it weighs very little the volume of a lung is very small but what about the area of
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 329.32 333.65 <o,f0,male> why so because in fact the area of the lung is something very
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 335.92 342.49 <o,f0,male> the bronchi branch branch branch and they stop branching not because of
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 343.50 351.76 <o,f0,male> any matter of principle but because of physical considerations the mucus which is in the lung so what happens is that
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 352.29 360.15 <o,f0,male> the way you have a much bigger lung but if it branches and branches down to distances about the same for a whale for a man and for
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 363.28 375.26 <o,f0,male> what good is it to have that well surprisingly enough amazingly enough the anatomists had a very poor idea of the structure of the lung until very recently and i think that my mathematics
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 390.51 403.87 <o,f0,male> so i found myself in other words constructing a geometry a geometry of things which had no geometry and a surprising aspect of it is that very often the rules of this geometry are extremely short
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 406.60 418.52 <o,f0,male> it several times sometimes repeatedly again again again the same repetition and at the end you get things like that this cloud is completely one hundred percent artificial
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 427.95 436.32 <o,f0,male> something so complicated like a cloud so unstable so varying should have a simple rule behind it now this simple rule
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 438.14 446.73 <o,f0,male> not an explanation of clouds the seer of clouds had to take account of it i don't know how much
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 447.46 457.04 <o,f0,male> advanced these pictures are they're old i was very much involved in it but then turned my attention to other phenomena now here is another thing which is
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 459.55 465.83 <o,f0,male> one of the shattering events in the history of mathematics which is not appreciated by many people
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 475.79 481.97 <o,f0,male> to an extent which was absolutely amazing that man can invent things that nature
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 483.41 493.76 <o,f0,male> in particular it could invent things like a curve which fills the plane a curve 's a curve a plane 's a plane and the two won 't mix well they do mix
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 494.48 508.04 <o,f0,male> a man named peano did define such curves and it became an object of extraordinary interest it was very important but mostly interesting because a kind of break a separation between
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 508.39 520.90 <o,f0,male> the mathematics coming from reality on the one hand and new mathematics coming from pure man 's mind well i was very sorry to point out that the pure man 's mind has in fact
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 522.36 534.25 <o,f0,male> seen at long last what had been seen for a long time and so here i introduce something the set of rivers of a plane filling curve and well it's a story unto itself
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 542.73 551.45 <o,f0,male> and the objects which were used as examples when i was a child and a student of the break between mathematics
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 551.97 562.94 <o,f0,male> and visible reality those objects i turned them completely around i used them for describing some of the aspects of the complexity of nature
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 572.66 579.70 <o,f0,male> i first told it to my friends in mathematics they said don 't be silly it's just something well actually i was
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 581.21 588.33 <o,f0,male> painter hokusai knew it very well the things on the ground are algae he did not know the mathematics it didn't yet exist
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 588.72 596.09 <o,f0,male> and he was japanese who had no contact with the west but painting for a long time had a fractal side i could speak of that for a long time
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 597.66 604.30 <o,f0,male> has a fractal aspect and i read the book that mister eiffel wrote about his tower and indeed it was astonishing how much
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 604.58 610.14 <o,f0,male> he understood this is a mess mess mess brownian loop one day i decided
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 612.99 625.95 <o,f0,male> i was held by so many things in my work i decided to test myself could i just look at something which everybody had been looking at for a long time and find something dramatically new
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 637.29 647.73 <o,f0,male> then i was telling my assistant i don't see anything can you paint it so he painted it which means he put inside everything he said well this thing came out and i said stop stop stop
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 648.72 656.93 <o,f0,male> i see it's an island and amazing so brownian motion which happens to have a roughness number of two
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 658.28 668.75 <o,f0,male> i measured it one point three three again again again long measurements big brownian motions one point three three mathematical problem how to prove it
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 669.54 677.53 <o,f0,male> it took my friends twenty years three of them were having incomplete proofs they got together and together they had the proof
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 678.87 690.06 <o,f0,male> so they got the big medal in mathematics one of the three medals that people have received for proving things which i've seen without being able to prove them
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 690.88 698.30 <o,f0,male> now everybody asks me at one point or another how did it all start what got you in that strange business
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 699.63 706.31 <o,f0,male> to be at the same time a mechanical engineer a geographer and a mathematician and so on
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 707.31 718.55 <o,f0,male> well actually i started oddly enough studying stock market prices and so here i had this theory and i wrote books about it
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 727.38 734.22 <o,f0,male> it was very easy and you can write many books very fast about it there are thousands of books on that
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 734.99 744.71 <o,f0,male> now compare that with real price increments and where are real price increments well these other lines include some real price increments and some
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 745.23 752.92 <o,f0,male> forgery which i did so the idea there was that one must able to how do you say model price variation
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 753.68 764.91 <o,f0,male> and it went really well fifty years ago for fifty years people were sort of pooh poohing me because they could do it much much easier but i tell you at this point people listened to me
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 766.91 777.20 <o,f0,male> these two curves are averages standard poor the blue one and the red one is standard poor 's from which the five biggest discontinuities are taken out
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 777.84 785.71 <o,f0,male> now discontinuities are a nuisance so in many studies of prices one puts them aside well acts of
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 786.78 795.12 <o,f0,male> and you have the little nonsense which is left acts of god in this picture five acts of god are as important as everything
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 796.10 808.09 <o,f0,male> in other words it is not acts of god that we should put aside that is the meat the problem if you master these you master price and if you don't master these you can master the little noise
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 808.43 816.90 <o,f0,male> as well as you can but it's not important well here are the curves for it now i get to the final thing which is the set of which my name is attached
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 817.53 823.72 <o,f0,male> in a way it's the story of my life my adolescence was spent during the german occupation of france and
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 824.95 831.85 <o,f0,male> since i thought that i might vanish within a day or a week i had very big dreams and
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 833.07 842.75 <o,f0,male> after the war i saw an uncle again my uncle was a very prominent mathematician and he told me look there's a problem which i could not solve twenty five years ago
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 873.92 882.07 <o,f0,male> and i went from what's called real numbers which are points on a line to imaginary complex numbers which are points on a plane
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 882.48 889.63 <o,f0,male> which is what one should do there and this shape came out this shape is of an extraordinary complication
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 890.51 902.76 <o,f0,male> equation is hidden there z goes into z squared plus c it's so simple so dry it's so uninteresting now you turn the crank once twice twice
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 904.38 916.85 <o,f0,male> marvels come out i mean this comes out i don't want to explain these things this comes out this comes out shapes which are of such complication such harmony and such beauty
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 917.60 924.60 <o,f0,male> this comes out repeatedly again again again and that was one of my major discoveries was to find that these islands were
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 924.66 932.24 <o,f0,male> the same as the whole big thing more or less and then you get these extraordinary baroque decorations all over the place
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 932.99 946.46 <o,f0,male> all that from this little formula which has whatever five symbols in it and then this one the color was added for two reasons first of all because these shapes are so complicated
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 948.41 956.38 <o,f0,male> one couldn't make any sense of the numbers and if you plot them you must choose some system and so my principle has been to always
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 957.07 965.67 <o,f0,male> present the shapes with different colorings because some colorings emphasize that and others it is that or that it's so complicated
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 974.89 980.77 <o,f0,male> a pilot was flying over the landscape and found this thing so where did this come from obviously from
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 986.29 996.54 <o,f0,male> so the newspaper in cambridge published an article about that discovery and received the next day five thousand letters from people saying but that's simply a mandelbrot set very
BenoitMandelbrot_2010 1 BenoitMandelbrot_2010 997.43 1010.78 <o,f0,male> well let me finish this shape here just came out of an exercise in pure mathematics bottomless wonders spring from simple rules which are repeated without end thank you very much
