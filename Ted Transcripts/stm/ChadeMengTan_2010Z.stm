ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 16.1 24.59 <o,f0,male> what does the happiest man in the world look like he certainly doesn 't look like me he looks like this
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 25.03 31.66 <o,f0,male> his name is matthieu ricard so how do you get to be the happiest man in the world
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 31.87 36.53 <o,f0,male> well it turns out there is a way to measure happiness in the brain
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 36.53 54.95 <o,f0,male> and you do that by measuring the relative activation of the left prefrontal cortex in the fmri versus the right prefrontal cortex and matthieu 's happiness measure is off the charts he 's by far the happiest man ever measured by science
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 62.27 64.47 <o,f0,male> perhaps something very naughty
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 88.93 94.65 <o,f0,male> and to do that by creating the conditions for inner peace
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 118.82 136.24 <o,f0,male> because if compassion was a chore nobody 's going to do it except maybe the dalai lama or something but if compassion was fun everybody 's going to do it therefore to create the conditions for global compassion
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 136.42 144.05 <o,f0,male> all we have to do is to reframe compassion as something that is fun
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 144.58 156.56 <o,f0,male> but fun is not enough what if compassion is also profitable what if compassion is also good for business
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 156.82 162.86 <o,f0,male> then every boss every manager in the world will want to have compassion like this
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 163.57 174.1 <o,f0,male> that would create the conditions for world peace so i started paying attention to what compassion looks like in a business setting
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 174.6 177.08 <o,f0,male> fortunately i didn 't have to look very far
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 177.41 193.5 <o,f0,male> because what i was looking for was right in front of my eyes in google my company i know there are other compassionate companies in the world but google is the place i 'm familiar with because i 've been there for ten years so i 'll use google as the case study
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 193.59 197.25 <o,f0,male> google is a company born of idealism
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 197.4 208.04 <o,f0,male> it 's a company that thrives on idealism and maybe because of that compassion is organic and widespread company wide
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 225.82 232.49 <o,f0,male> and then other googlers join in and it just gets bigger and bigger and sometimes it gets big enough to become official
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 233.05 237.74 <o,f0,male> so in other words it almost always starts from the bottom up
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 238.73 240.56 <o,f0,male> and let me give you some examples
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 240.64 249.61 <o,f0,male> the first example is the largest annual community event where googlers from around the world donate their labor to their local communities
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 249.8 253.33 <o,f0,male> was initiated and organized by three employees
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 253.75 260.36 <o,f0,male> before it became official because it just became too big another example three googlers a chef
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 261.08 273.45 <o,f0,male> an engineer and most funny a massage therapist three of them they learned about a region in india where two hundred thousand people live without a single medical facility
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 273.52 284.08 <o,f0,male> so what do they do they just go ahead and start a fundraiser and they raise enough money to build this hospital the first hospital of its kind for two hundred thousand people
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 284.25 286.53 <o,f0,male> during the haiti earthquake
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 316.18 323.26 <o,f0,male> working on issues such as education poverty health care and the environment
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 323.64 338.23 <o,f0,male> there is so much organic social action all around google that the company decided to form a social responsibility team just to support these efforts and this idea again came from the grassroots from two googlers
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 338.56 342.88 <o,f0,male> who wrote their own job descriptions and volunteered themselves for the job
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 343.61 356.58 <o,f0,male> and i found it fascinating that the social responsibility team was not formed as part of some grand corporate strategy it was two persons saying let 's do this and the company said yes
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 357.09 369.33 <o,f0,male> so it turns out that google is a compassionate company because googlers found compassion to be fun but again fun is not enough
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 396.63 405.88 <o,f0,male> and there is a motivational component which is i want to help you so what has this got to do with business leadership
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 406.56 420.49 <o,f0,male> according to a very comprehensive study led by jim collins and documented in the book good to great it takes a very special kind of leader to bring a company from goodness to greatness
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 421.24 429.35 <o,f0,male> and he calls them level five leaders these are leaders who in addition to being highly capable
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 447.65 451.99 <o,f0,male> and they according to the research make the best business leaders
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 452.6 457.1 <o,f0,male> and if you look at these qualities in the context of compassion
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 457.65 463.23 <o,f0,male> we find that the cognitive and affective components of compassion
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 463.5 467.61 <o,f0,male> understanding people and empathizing with people
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 467.64 473 <o,f0,male> inhibits tones down what i call the excessive self obsession
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 479.03 484.6 <o,f0,male> the motivational component of compassion creates ambition for greater good
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 485.68 502.39 <o,f0,male> in other words compassion is the way to grow level five leaders and this is the first compelling business benefit the second compelling benefit of compassion is that it creates an inspiring workforce
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 502.39 506.89 <o,f0,male> employees mutually inspire each other towards greater good
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 507 519.77 <o,f0,male> it creates a vibrant energetic community where people admire and respect each other i mean you come to work in the morning and you work with three guys who just up and decide to build a hospital in india
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 537.3 549.21 <o,f0,male> so having said all that what is the secret formula for brewing compassion in the corporate setting in our experience there are three ingredients
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 549.68 557.51 <o,f0,male> the first ingredient is to create a culture of passionate concern for the greater good
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 558.55 560.1 <o,f0,male> so always think
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 560.34 569.37 <o,f0,male> how is your company and your job serving the greater good or how can you further serve the greater good
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 569.77 586.99 <o,f0,male> this awareness of serving the greater good is very self inspiring and it creates fertile ground for compassion to grow in that 's one the second ingredient is autonomy so in google there 's a lot of autonomy
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 599.07 603.43 <o,f0,male> if you already have a culture of compassion
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 603.48 605.21 <o,f0,male> and idealism
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 605.56 618.65 <o,f0,male> and you let your people roam free they will do the right thing in the most compassionate way the third ingredient is to focus on inner development and personal growth
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 619.53 622.47 <o,f0,male> leadership training in google for example
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 628.98 630.98 <o,f0,male> empathy and compassion
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 671.53 675.05 <o,f0,male> the first step is attention training
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 675.94 685.11 <o,f0,male> attention is the basis of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities therefore
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 685.15 688.85 <o,f0,male> any curriculum for training emotion intelligence
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 689.03 702.03 <o,f0,male> has to begin with attention training the idea here is to train attention to create a quality of mind that is calm and clear at the same time
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 702.03 718.58 <o,f0,male> and this creates the foundation for emotion intelligence the second step follows the first step the second step is developing self knowledge and self mastery so using the supercharged attention from step one
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 719.16 725.84 <o,f0,male> we create a high resolution perception into the cognitive and emotive processes
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 731.57 733.84 <o,f0,male> and the process of emotion
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 734.09 751.08 <o,f0,male> with high clarity objectivity and from a third person perspective and once you can do that you create the kind of self knowledge that enables self mastery the third step following the second step
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 751.26 766.31 <o,f0,male> is to create new mental habits what does that mean imagine this imagine whenever you meet any other person any time you meet a person your habitual instinctive first thought is i want you to be happy
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 786.81 797.12 <o,f0,male> and this also creates the conditions for compassion in the workplace someday we hope to open source search inside yourself
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 797.97 804.71 <o,f0,male> so that everybody in the corporate world will at least be able to use it as a reference
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 804.89 808.56 <o,f0,male> and in closing i want to end the same place i started
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 808.61 810.48 <o,f0,male> with happiness
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 810.99 815.62 <o,f0,male> i want to quote this guy the guy in robes not the other guy the dalai lama
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 815.84 819.09 <o,f0,male> who said if you want others to be happy
ChadeMengTan_2010Z 1 ChadeMengTan_2010Z 819.35 824.37 <o,f0,male> practice compassion if you want to be happy practice compassion
