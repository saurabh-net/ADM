WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 20.45 25.32 <o,f0,male> no one was a hero no one was a hero because everyone was a hero
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 38.53 41.15 <o,f0,male> the largest encyclopedia in the world
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 41.41 55.89 <o,f0,male> from just an idea that sounded crazy you have the largest encyclopedia in the world and in the egyptian revolution the revolution two point zero everyone has contributed something small or big they contributed something
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 55.89 63.93 <o,f0,male> to bring us one of the most inspiring stories in the history of mankind when it comes to revolutions
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 64.24 74.23 <o,f0,male> it was actually really inspiring to see all these egyptians completely changing if you look at the scene egypt for thirty years had been in a downhill
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 74.44 80.34 <o,f0,male> going into a downhill everything was going bad everything was going wrong
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 81.13 84.06 <o,f0,male> we only ranked high when it comes to poverty
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 85.19 90.79 <o,f0,male> corruption lack of freedom of speech lack of political activism
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 90.91 95.56 <o,f0,male> those were the achievements of our great regime
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 105.41 108.49 <o,f0,male> but the reason why everyone was silent
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 108.61 111.73 <o,f0,male> is what i call the psychological barrier of fear
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 125.91 132.13 <o,f0,male> but in fact the majority were scared everyone did not want really to get in trouble
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 132.66 139.06 <o,f0,male> a dictator cannot live without the force they want to make people live in fear
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 139.18 143.86 <o,f0,male> and that psychological barrier of fear had worked for so many years
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 144.09 147.14 <o,f0,male> and here comes the internet technology
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 147.76 149.62 <o,f0,male> blackberry sms
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 149.68 151.78 <o,f0,male> it 's helping all of us to connect
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 152.04 157.79 <o,f0,male> platforms like youtube twitter facebook were helping us a lot
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 157.8 168.44 <o,f0,male> because it basically gave us the impression that wow i 'm not alone there are a lot of people who are frustrated there are lots of people who are frustrated there are lots of people who actually share the same dream
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 168.66 179.23 <o,f0,male> there are lots of people who care about their freedom they probably have the best life in the world they are living in happiness they are living in their villas they are happy they don 't have problems but they are still
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 179.8 181.94 <o,f0,male> feeling the pain of the egyptian
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 182.19 186.62 <o,f0,male> a lot of us we 're not really happy when we see a video of an egyptian man
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 206.98 208.62 <o,f0,male> in june
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 208.67 217.22 <o,f0,male> two thousand and ten i still remember the photo i still remember every single detail of that photo the photo was horrible
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 219.06 222.03 <o,f0,male> he was tortured brutally tortured to death
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 222.11 224.5 <o,f0,male> but then what was the answer of the regime
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 228.1 239.82 <o,f0,male> that was their answer he 's a criminal he 's someone who escaped from all these bad things but people did not relate to this people did not believe this because of the internet
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 239.83 253.47 <o,f0,male> the truth prevailed and everyone knew the truth and everyone started to think that this guy could be my brother he was a middle class guy his photo was remembered by all of us a page was created
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 253.69 265.37 <o,f0,male> an anonymous administrator was basically inviting people to join the page and there was no plan what are we going to do i don 't know in a few days tens of thousands of people there
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 265.5 269.95 <o,f0,male> angry egyptians who were asking the ministry of interior affairs
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 275.55 277.55 <o,f0,male> to just bring them to justice
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 278.06 279.74 <o,f0,male> but of course they don 't listen
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 280.15 291.52 <o,f0,male> it was an amazing story how everyone started feeling the ownership everyone was an owner in this page people started contributing ideas in fact one of the most ridiculous ideas was
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 291.59 293.66 <o,f0,male> hey let 's have a silent stand
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 293.69 306.15 <o,f0,male> let 's get people to go in the street face the sea their back to the street dressed in black standing up silently for one hour doing nothing and then just leaving going back home
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 314.01 319.86 <o,f0,male> but actually when people went to the street the first time it was thousands of people in alexandria
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 320.81 329.22 <o,f0,male> it felt like it was amazing it was great because it connected people from the virtual world bringing them to the real world sharing the same
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 347.13 349.96 <o,f0,male> and things had developed until
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 350.54 352.08 <o,f0,male> the tunisian revolution
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 352.45 359.04 <o,f0,male> this whole page was again managed by the people in fact the anonymous admin
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 359.27 361.58 <o,f0,male> job was to collect ideas
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 361.66 376.43 <o,f0,male> help people to vote on them and actually tell them what they are doing people were taking shots and photos people were reporting violations of human rights in egypt people were suggesting ideas they were actually voting on ideas and then they were executing the ideas
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 376.43 382.02 <o,f0,male> people were creating videos everything was done by the people to the people and that 's the power of the internet
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 412.7 421.42 <o,f0,male> i was detained on the twenty seventh night thank god i announced the locations and everything but they detained me
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 421.42 435.17 <o,f0,male> and i 'm not going to talk about my experience because this is not about me i was detained for twelve days blindfolded handcuffed and i did not really hear anything i did not know anything i was not allowed to speak with anyone
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 438.62 446.4 <o,f0,male> seriously with the amount of change i had noticed in this square i thought it was twelve years i never had in my mind
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 446.74 448.6 <o,f0,male> to see this egyptian
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 450.8 465.26 <o,f0,male> the amazing egyptian the fear is no longer fear it 's actually strength it 's power people were so empowered it was amazing how everyone was so empowered and now asking for their rights completely opposite extremism became tolerance
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 478.61 488.68 <o,f0,male> this is amazing all the stereotypes that the regime was trying to put on us through their so called propaganda or mainstream media are proven wrong
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 489.69 505.22 <o,f0,male> this whole revolution showed us how ugly such a regime was and how great and amazing the egyptian man the egyptian woman how simple and amazing these people are whenever they have a dream when i saw that
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 505.91 508.45 <o,f0,male> i went back and i wrote on facebook
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 508.78 510.46 <o,f0,male> and that was a personal belief
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 510.62 515.99 <o,f0,male> regardless of what 's going on regardless of the details i said that we are going to win
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 516.24 532.1 <o,f0,male> we are going to win because we don 't understand politics we 're going to win because we don 't play their dirty games we 're going to win because we don 't have an agenda we 're going to win because the tears that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 532.15 539.66 <o,f0,male> we 're going to win because we have dreams we 're going to win because we are willing to stand up for our dreams
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 539.66 555.79 <o,f0,male> and that 's actually what happened we won and that 's not because of anything but because we believed in our dream the winning here is not the whole details of what 's going to happen in the political scene the winning is the winning of the dignity of every single egyptian
WaelGhonim_2011X 1 WaelGhonim_2011X 555.83 558.93 <o,f0,male> actually i had this taxi driver telling me
