JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 36.08 44.76 <o,f0,female> what is it about my brother 's brain and his schizophrenia that he cannot connect his dreams to a common and shared reality
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 45.03 51.92 <o,f0,female> so they instead become delusion so i dedicated my career to research into the severe mental
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 52.83 62.58 <o,f0,female> and i moved from my home state of indiana to boston where i was working in the lab of doctor francine benes in the harvard department of psychiatry and
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 64.11 72.45 <o,f0,female> we were asking the question what are the biological differences between the brains of individuals who would be diagnosed as normal control
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 72.82 79.67 <o,f0,female> as compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia schizoaffective or bipolar disorder
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 80.06 92.13 <o,f0,female> so we were essentially mapping the microcircuitry of the brain which cells are communicating with which cells with which chemicals and then in what quantities of those chemicals
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 92.71 105.08 <o,f0,female> so there was a lot of meaning in my life because i was performing this type of research during the day but then in the evenings and on the weekends i traveled as an advocate for nami the national alliance
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 114.85 124.46 <o,f0,female> a blood vessel exploded in the left half of my brain and in the course of four hours i watched my brain completely deteriorate
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 130.51 133.89 <o,f0,female> walk talk read write or recall
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 134.20 139.14 <o,f0,female> any of my life i essentially became an infant in a woman 's body
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 160.41 162.68 <o,f0,female> so this is a real human brain
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 163.81 172.38 <o,f0,female> this is the front of the brain the back of brain with the spinal cord hanging down and this is how it would be positioned inside of my head
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 173.30 180.31 <o,f0,female> and when you look at the brain it's obvious that the two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 181.09 190.99 <o,f0,female> for those of you who understand computers our right hemisphere functions like a parallel processor while our left hemisphere functions like a serial processor
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 200.96 205.05 <o,f0,female> that the two hemispheres are completely separate because
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 223.24 223.65 <o,f0,male> it's been
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 228.73 235.67 <o,f0,female> our right hemisphere is all about this present moment it's all about right here
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 235.95 244.35 <o,f0,female> right now our right hemisphere it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 258.52 263.72 <o,f0,female> what this present moment smells like and tastes like what it feels like
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 264.20 265.77 <o,f0,female> and what it sounds like
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 266.67 275.19 <o,f0,female> i am an energy being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 275.93 284.51 <o,f0,female> we are energy beings connected to one another through the consciousness of our right hemispheres as one human family
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 284.99 294.65 <o,f0,female> and right here right now we are brothers and sisters on this planet here to make the world a better place and in this moment we are perfect
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 296.57 297.38 <o,f0,female> and we are beautiful
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 309.34 311.53 <o,f0,female> our left hemisphere is all about the past
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 312.17 314.48 <o,f0,female> and it's all about the future
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 325.28 336.87 <o,f0,female> it then categorizes and organizes all that information associates it with everything in the past we've ever learned and projects into the future all of our possibilities
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 337.64 348.08 <o,f0,female> and our left hemisphere thinks in language it's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my internal world to my external world
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 348.47 354.60 <o,f0,female> it's that little voice that says to me hey you gotta remember to pick up bananas on your way home
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 355.01 366.41 <o,f0,female> i need them in the morning it's that calculating intelligence that reminds me when i have to do my laundry but perhaps most important it's that little voice that says to me
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 368.82 370.04 <o,f0,female> i am
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 370.88 380.99 <o,f0,female> and as soon as my left hemisphere says to me i am i become separate i become a single solid individual separate from the energy flow around me
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 381.18 387.63 <o,f0,female> and separate from you and this was the portion of my brain that i lost on the morning of my stroke
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 388.04 388.36 <o,f0,female> on the
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 390.92 399.75 <o,f0,female> i woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye and it was the kind of pain caustic pain that you get when you bite into ice cream
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 400.10 406.53 <o,f0,female> and it just gripped me and then it released me and then it just gripped me and then
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 443.51 451.43 <o,f0,female> where i'm the person on the machine having the experience to some esoteric space where i'm witnessing myself having this experience
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 452.39 463.10 <o,f0,female> was all very peculiar and my headache was just getting worse so i get off the machine and i'm walking across my living room floor and i realize that everything inside of my body has slowed way
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 484.70 493.27 <o,f0,female> you muscles you gotta contract you muscles you relax and then i lost my balance and i'm propped up against the wall and i look down at my arm
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 501.98 509.34 <o,f0,female> and where i end because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 509.61 522.61 <o,f0,female> and all i could detect was this energy energy and i'm asking myself what is wrong with me what is going on and in that moment my brain chatter my left hemisphere brain chatter went totally silent
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 527.22 528.49 <o,f0,female> total silence
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 529.02 533.42 <o,f0,female> and at first i was shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 533.73 544.94 <o,f0,female> but then i was immediately captivated by the magnificence of the energy around me and because i could no longer identify the boundaries of my body i felt
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 545.63 552.95 <o,f0,female> enormous and expansive i felt at one with all the energy that was and it was beautiful there
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 554.57 560.75 <o,f0,female> my left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me hey we got a problem we got a problem we gotta get some help and
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 563.74 576.58 <o,f0,female> so it's like ok ok i got a problem but then i immediately drifted right back out into the consciousness and i affectionately refer to this space as la la land but it was beautiful there
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 585.30 592.75 <o,f0,female> my job and any stress related to my job it was gone and i felt lighter in my body
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 593.30 601.52 <o,f0,female> and imagine all of the relationships in the external world and any stressors related to any of those they were gone and i felt this sense of
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 612.46 614.24 <o,f0,female> i felt euphoria
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 617.30 629.74 <o,f0,female> was beautiful and then again my left hemisphere comes online and it says hey you've got to pay attention we've got to get help and i'm thinking i got to get help i gotta focus so i get out of the shower and i mechanically dress and i'm walking around my
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 631.28 632.62 <o,f0,female> get to work i gotta get to work
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 633.19 640.06 <o,f0,female> can i drive can i drive and in that moment my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side then i realized
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 643.59 645.06 <o,f0,male> the next thing my brain says to me
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 647.17 647.53 <o,f0,male> this is
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 659.62 661.53 <o,f0,female> and then it crosses my mind
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 672.11 681.23 <o,f0,female> get back to my routine ok so i gotta call help i gotta call work i couldn't remember the number at work so i remembered in my office i had a business card with my number on it
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 681.60 690.23 <o,f0,female> so i go into my business room i pull out a three inch stack of business cards and i'm looking at the card on top and even though i could see clearly in my mind
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 691.11 692.69 <o,f0,female> my business card looked like i
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 693.95 707.69 <o,f0,female> if this was my card or not because all i could see were pixels and the pixels of the words blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols and i just couldn't tell and then i would wait for what i call a wave of clarity
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 707.95 722.38 <o,f0,female> and in that moment i would be able to reattach to normal reality and i could tell that's not the card that's not the card that's not the card it took me forty five minutes to get one inch down inside of that stack of cards in the
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 723.02 730.88 <o,f0,female> for forty five minutes the hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left hemisphere i do not understand numbers i do not understand the telephone but it's the only plan
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 730.96 744.88 <o,f0,female> i have so i take the phone pad and i put it right here i take the business card i put it right here and i'm matching the shape of the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles on the phone pad but then i would drift back
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 746.47 753.65 <o,f0,female> and not remember when i came back if i'd already dialed those numbers so i had to wield my paralyzed arm like a
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 755.09 764.02 <o,f0,female> the numbers as i went along and pushed them so that as i would come back to normal reality i'd be able to tell yes i've already dialed that number
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 767.78 771.84 <o,f0,female> and i'm listening to the phone and my colleague picks up the phone and he says to me
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 781.19 781.97 <o,f0,female> he sounds like a
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 784.76 790.94 <o,f0,female> and so i say to him clear in my mind i say to him this is jill i need help and what comes out of my
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 793.98 794.22 <o,f0,female> i
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 813.59 815.41 <o,f0,female> and i curl up into a little fetal ball
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 818.04 820.24 <o,f0,male> just like a balloon with the last
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 821.57 825.10 <o,f0,female> bit of air just just right out of the balloon i just
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 825.59 830.71 <o,f0,female> felt my energy lift and just i felt my spirit surrender
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 831.55 836.87 <o,f0,female> and in that moment i knew that i was no longer the choreographer of my life
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 837.70 845.36 <o,f0,female> and either the doctors rescue my body and give me a second chance at life or this was perhaps my moment of transition
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 850.15 855.82 <o,f0,female> when i woke later that afternoon i was shocked to discover that i was still alive
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 858.29 865.53 <o,f0,female> when i felt my spirit surrender i said goodbye to my life and my mind was now suspended between two
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 865.93 873.92 <o,f0,female> very opposite planes of reality stimulation coming in through my sensory systems felt like pure pain
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 880.28 887.64 <o,f0,female> and chaotic that i could not pick a voice out from the background noise and i just wanted to escape
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 888.47 892.83 <o,f0,female> because i could not identify the position of my body in space
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 893.39 896.59 <o,f0,female> i felt enormous and expansive
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 897.36 900.90 <o,f0,female> like a genie just liberated from her bottle
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 920.41 926.64 <o,f0,female> way i would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 929.20 931.90 <o,f0,female> but then i realized but i'm still alive
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 932.78 943.70 <o,f0,female> i'm still alive and i have found nirvana and if i have found nirvana and i'm still alive then everyone who is alive can find nirvana
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 945.88 956.83 <o,f0,female> i pictured a world filled with beautiful peaceful compassionate loving people who knew that they could come to this space at any time
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 957.91 959.59 <o,f0,female> and that they could purposely
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 961.43 963.98 <o,f0,female> to step to the right of their left hemispheres
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 965.59 966.64 <o,f0,female> and find this
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 979.67 981.76 <o,f0,female> and it motivated me to recover
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 985.37 987.42 <o,f0,female> two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 988.15 997.52 <o,f0,female> the surgeons went in and they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers here i am with my mama who is a true angel in my life
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 999.30 1002.85 <o,f0,female> it took me eight years to completely recover
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 1004.15 1008.84 <o,f0,female> so who are we we are the life force power
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 1011.23 1015.52 <o,f0,female> with manual dexterity and two cognitive minds
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 1016.25 1022.38 <o,f0,female> and we have the power to choose moment by moment who and how we want to be in the world
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 1033.04 1041.15 <o,f0,female> the life force power of the fifty trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that make up my form at one with all that
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 1044.03 1047.15 <o,f0,female> i can choose to step into the consciousness of my left hemisphere
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 1051.74 1059.54 <o,f0,female> from the flow separate from you i am doctor jill bolte taylor intellectual neuroanatomist
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 1061.86 1065.27 <o,f0,female> these are the we inside of me
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 1078.22 1084.69 <o,f0,female> i believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep inner peace circuitry of our right hemispheres
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 1085.57 1091.28 <o,f0,female> the more peace we will project into the world and the more peaceful our planet will be
JillBolteTaylor_2008 1 JillBolteTaylor_2008 1092.65 1095.85 <o,f0,female> and i thought that was an idea worth spreading
