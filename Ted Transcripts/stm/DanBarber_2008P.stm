DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 16.83 18.74 <o,f0,female> i went to spain a few months ago
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 24.07 25.35 <o,f0,female> the best foie gras of my life
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 30.36 33.88 <o,f0,female> because what i saw i'm convinced is
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 37.09 42.26 <o,f0,female> ridiculous right foie gras and the future of cooking there's not a food today that's more maligned than
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 57.40 59.50 <o,f0,female> really it happened here in san francisco to
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 61.13 62.33 <o,f0,female> i'm not saying that
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 64.20 65.25 <o,f0,female> a rationale
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 66.79 68.64 <o,f0,female> for being opposed to foie gras
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 68.94 75.90 <o,f0,female> the reasons usually just boil down to the gavage which is the force feeding basically you take a goose or a duck and you
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 95.65 97.83 <o,f0,female> is that it's so freakin delicious
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 121.71 124.01 <o,f0,female> you can also bike the tour de france without steroids
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 128.60 133.62 <o,f0,female> not a lot of people are doing it and for good reason so several months ago
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 134.47 137.00 <o,f0,female> a friend of mine sent me this link to this guy
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 157.27 162.24 <o,f0,female> gorge on food to prepare for the harsh realities of winter
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 163.85 168.37 <o,f0,female> and the rest of the year they're free to roam around eduardo 's
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 169.15 174.19 <o,f0,female> land and eat what they want so no gavage no force feeding no factory like conditions no cruelty
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 175.93 180.15 <o,f0,female> and it's shockingly not a new idea his great granddad started
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 193.65 195.15 <o,f0,female> when eduardo
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 197.49 201.03 <o,f0,female> the coveted french gastronomic prize
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 210.88 213.74 <o,f0,female> as he said to me that really pissed the french off
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 220.55 222.32 <o,f0,female> all over the papers i read about
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 224.03 229.12 <o,f0,female> spanish chef accused and the french accused him spanish chef accused
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 229.21 231.34 <o,f0,female> of cheating the accused him of paying off the judges
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 237.96 240.74 <o,f0,female> huge scandal for a few weeks couldn't find a shred of evidence
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 241.68 245.34 <o,f0,female> look at the guy he doesn't look like a guy who 's paying off french judges for his
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 248.29 250.86 <o,f0,female> down and very soon afterward new controversy
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 262.42 269.24 <o,f0,female> he 's lying and should be disqualified as funny as it sounds articulating it now and reading about it actually if
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 281.83 283.72 <o,f0,female> that is until i went to
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 290.70 297.18 <o,f0,female> i saw first hand a system that is incredibly complex and then at the same time like
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 303.73 307.88 <o,f0,female> and he said to me really from the first moment my life 's work
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 309.57 310.92 <o,f0,female> is to give the geese what they want
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 311.73 313.34 <o,f0,female> that about fifty times in the
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 314.97 320.05 <o,f0,female> i'm just here to give the geese what they want actually when i showed up he was lying down with the geese with
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 340.48 343.12 <o,f0,female> you know i thought like i'm speaking to you now right
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 373.95 374.58 <o,f0,female> i figured it out
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 388.02 398.18 <o,f0,female> doing this and amazingly the geese who were on the other side of the paddock when i was around get the hell away from this kid when i lowered my voice they all came right up to us
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 398.96 411.16 <o,f0,female> right up to us like right up to here right along the fence line and fence line was amazing in itself the fence like this conception of fence that we have it's totally backward with him the electricity on this fiberglass fence
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 411.52 412.89 <o,f0,female> is only on the outside
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 414.63 417.55 <o,f0,female> he rewired it he invented it i've never seen it
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 419.82 421.33 <o,f0,female> fence in animals you
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 424.42 425.70 <o,f0,female> he electrifies only the outside
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 426.77 431.87 <o,f0,female> why because he said to me that he felt like the geese and he proved this actually not just
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 433.29 437.19 <o,f0,female> a conceit he proved this the geese felt manipulated when they were
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 451.30 454.87 <o,f0,female> on the outside so it would protect them against coyotes and other predators
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 455.55 460.27 <o,f0,female> now what happened they ate and he showed me on a chart how they ate about twenty percent more
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 461.89 463.93 <o,f0,female> feed to feed their livers
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 484.36 487.96 <o,f0,female> this extra hard land into a tasting menu
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 490.27 502.46 <o,f0,female> upgrades the life for these geese and they are allowed to take whatever they want another irony the double irony is that on the figs and the olives eduardo can make more money selling those than he can on the foie gras he doesn't care
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 516.94 519.73 <o,f0,female> they get what they want they leave the rest for me and i sell
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 529.89 536.09 <o,f0,female> how i've been trained you want to look and see what good foie gras is it's got to be bright yellow it's the indication that
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 539.74 541.73 <o,f0,female> because he doesn't force feed because he doesn't
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 557.72 569.12 <o,f0,female> to seed he took the seeds he planted it on his thirty acres all around and the geese love the lupin bush not for the bush but for the seeds and when they eat the seeds their foie gras turns yellow
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 571.19 573.11 <o,f0,female> radioactive yellow bright yellow
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 574.86 577.47 <o,f0,female> of the highest quality foie gras yellow i've ever seen
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 584.90 586.34 <o,f0,female> for real is he making some
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 587.34 594.01 <o,f0,female> like you know because he seemed to have answer for everything and it was always nature it was never him and i was like
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 605.43 612.22 <o,f0,female> into working with his landscape so it's like here i am i'm on the fence about this guy but increasingly
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 613.22 615.88 <o,f0,female> eating up his every word and we're sitting there and
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 616.78 618.01 <o,f0,female> i hear
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 645.69 648.69 <o,f0,female> they're called back and back and back and then they circle around
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 649.17 658.02 <o,f0,female> and his geese are calling up now to the wild geese and the wild geese are calling down and it's getting louder and louder and they circle and circle and they land
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 663.08 664.29 <o,f0,female> no way no way
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 664.73 668.08 <o,f0,female> i look at eduardo who 's near tears looking at this
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 669.61 676.39 <o,f0,female> and i say you 're telling me that your geese are calling to the wild geese to say come for a visit and he says
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 685.04 686.49 <o,f0,female> the dna of a
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 691.32 696.34 <o,f0,female> i said that i said isn 't that what they're put on this earth for to fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 697.91 704.00 <o,f0,female> their dna is to find the conditions that are conducive to life to happiness
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 705.16 707.25 <o,f0,female> they find it here the don't need anything more
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 718.01 726.02 <o,f0,female> brilliant right imagine i don't know imagine a hog farm in like north carolina and a wild pig comes
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 733.74 735.64 <o,f0,female> got to taste it before i left
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 736.02 739.71 <o,f0,female> took me to his neighborhood restaurant and he served me some of his
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 743.05 751.97 <o,f0,female> it was incredible and the problem with saying that of course is that you know at this point it risks hyperbole really easily
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 753.29 764.66 <o,f0,female> and i'd like to make a metaphor but i don't have one really i was drinking this guy 's kool aid so much he could have served me goose feathers and i would have been like this guy 's a genius
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 766.47 775.00 <o,f0,female> really in love with him at this point but it truly was the best foie gras of my life so much so that i don't think i had ever really had foie gras until that moment
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 777.78 782.11 <o,f0,female> but this was transformative really transformative and i say to you
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 790.84 792.58 <o,f0,female> taste experience with
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 802.72 805.00 <o,f0,female> a lot of honesty and you could taste
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 806.37 811.60 <o,f0,female> herbs you could taste spices and i kept i said you know i swear to god i tasted star
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 831.14 833.55 <o,f0,female> when he harvests the foie gras he sticks them in this jar
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 836.27 838.02 <o,f0,female> pepper no oil no spices
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 851.38 857.38 <o,f0,female> need salt and pepper and he doesn't need spices because he 's got this potpourri of herbs and flavors
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 858.55 860.18 <o,f0,female> that his geese love to gorge on
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 872.72 874.18 <o,f0,female> adria the
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 879.91 881.34 <o,f0,female> how come you don't give him this
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 881.78 883.51 <o,f0,female> how come no one 's really heard of you
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 885.26 888.73 <o,f0,female> and it may be because of the wine or it may be because of my excitement he answered me directly and he said
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 900.41 901.34 <o,f0,female> they create
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 902.11 904.51 <o,f0,female> a dish where all the vectors point at us
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 912.57 914.13 <o,f0,female> and as he said i think
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 916.58 918.26 <o,f0,female> it's a gift from god
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 919.97 922.65 <o,f0,female> with god saying you've done good work simple
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 924.54 934.59 <o,f0,female> i flew home i'm on the flight with my little black book and i took you know pages and pages of notes about it i really was moved and in the corner of one of these one my notes
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 946.86 949.12 <o,f0,female> he said i think it's an insult to history
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 950.33 951.85 <o,f0,female> and i wrote insult to history
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 952.76 956.28 <o,f0,female> on the plane and i'm just tearing my hair out it's like why didn't i follow up on that what the hell does that
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 959.87 960.92 <o,f0,female> some research when i got back
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 965.66 967.13 <o,f0,female> jews invented foie gras
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 970.58 971.39 <o,f0,female> by accident
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 972.88 975.38 <o,f0,female> they were looking for an alternative to schmaltz
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 1006.38 1012.00 <o,f0,female> and he didn't want it just in the fall he wanted it all year round and he demanded that the jews supply enough for everyone
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 1013.26 1016.82 <o,f0,female> and the jews fearing for their life had to come up with an ingenious idea or at least
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 1026.02 1027.26 <o,f0,female> in a great moment
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 1027.66 1028.98 <o,f0,female> of fear for their lives
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 1033.54 1038.56 <o,f0,female> liver and the good stuff they kept for themselves supposedly anyway i believe that one
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 1041.88 1043.16 <o,f0,female> and if you think about it
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 1053.21 1055.46 <o,f0,female> mega farms feed lots
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 1074.06 1075.90 <o,f0,female> whether we're talking about beef cattle
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 1076.86 1078.44 <o,f0,female> or we're talking about chickens
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 1079.56 1080.71 <o,f0,female> or we're talking about broccoli
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 1092.61 1096.95 <o,f0,female> whatever it is it's a mindset that is reminiscent of general motors
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 1098.32 1099.80 <o,f0,female> it's rooted in extraction
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 1101.24 1103.18 <o,f0,female> take more sell more waste more
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 1129.99 1131.86 <o,f0,female> we need now to adopt
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 1133.75 1135.34 <o,f0,female> a new conception of agriculture
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 1135.91 1138.89 <o,f0,female> really new one in which we stop treating
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 1139.19 1142.90 <o,f0,female> the planet as if it were some kind of business in liquidation
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 1144.22 1148.44 <o,f0,female> and stop degrading resources under the guise of cheap food
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 1149.75 1152.08 <o,f0,female> we can start by looking to farmers
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 1153.06 1155.82 <o,f0,female> like eduardo farmers that rely on nature
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 1156.77 1158.22 <o,f0,female> for solutions for answers
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 1158.97 1161.16 <o,f0,female> rather than imposing solutions on nature
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 1162.35 1169.61 <o,f0,female> listening as janine benyus one of my favorite writers and thinkers about this topics says listening to nature 's operating instructions
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 1176.77 1180.88 <o,f0,female> the great thing for chefs the great blessing for chefs
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 1188.71 1191.64 <o,f0,female> is that the most ecological choice for food
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 1193.02 1197.17 <o,f0,female> also the most ethical choice for food whether we're talking about brussel sprouts or foie gras
DanBarber_2008P 1 DanBarber_2008P 1198.33 1203.27 <o,f0,female> and it's also almost always and i haven't found an example otherwise but almost always
