JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 33.67 39.44 <o,f0,male> one of the big things about countering terrorism is
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 39.44 49.23 <o,f0,male> how do you perceive it because perception leads to your response to it so if you have a traditional perception of terrorism
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 49.23 59.22 <o,f0,male> it would be that it 's one of criminality one of war so how are you going to respond to it naturally it would follow that you meet kind with kind you fight it
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 59.22 73.49 <o,f0,male> if you have a more modernist approach and your perception of terrorism is almost cause and effect then naturally from that the responses that come out of it are much more asymmetrical
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 73.49 81.67 <o,f0,male> we live in a modern global world terrorists have actually adapted to it
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 96.53 108.14 <o,f0,male> for my part what i wanted us to do was just to look at terrorism as though it was a global brand say coca cola both are fairly bad for your health
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 110.97 130.89 <o,f0,male> if you look at it as a brand in those ways what you 'll come to realize is it 's a pretty flawed product as we 've said it 's pretty bad for your health it 's bad for those who it affects and it 's not actually good if you 're a suicide bomber either it doesn 't actually do what it says on the tin
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 131.12 136.55 <o,f0,male> you 're not really going to get seventy two virgins in heaven it 's not
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 156.08 164.69 <o,f0,male> the consumers it needs are the terrorist constituency they 're the people who buy into the brand support them facilitate them
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 164.69 182.62 <o,f0,male> and they 're the people we 've got to reach out to we 've got to attack that brand in front of them there 's two essential ways of doing that if we carry on this brand theme one is reducing their market what i mean is it 's their brand against our brand
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 182.62 193.92 <o,f0,male> we 've got to compete we 've got to show we 're a better product if i 'm trying to show we 're a better product i probably wouldn 't do things like guantanamo bay
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 211.22 220.72 <o,f0,male> the brand myth as we 've said you know there 's nothing heroic about killing a young kid perhaps we need to focus on that and get that message back across
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 220.73 225.34 <o,f0,male> we 've got to reveal the dangers in the product our target audience
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 225.34 229.05 <o,f0,male> it 's not just the producers of terrorism as i 've said the terrorists
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 229.05 247.09 <o,f0,male> it 's not just the marketeers of terrorism which is those who finance those who facilitate it but it 's the consumers of terrorism we 've got to get in to those homelands that 's where they recruit from that 's where they get their power and strength that 's where their consumers come from
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 247.09 250.21 <o,f0,male> and we have to get our messaging in there
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 250.21 259.63 <o,f0,male> so the essentials are we 've got to have interaction in those areas with the terrorists the facilitators etc we 've got to engage
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 259.63 265.19 <o,f0,male> we 've got to educate and we 've got to have dialogue now
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 265.19 282.58 <o,f0,male> staying on this brand thing for just a few more seconds think about delivery mechanisms how are we going to do these attacks well reducing the market is really one for governments and civil society we 've got to show we 're better we 've got to show our values
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 282.59 291.95 <o,f0,male> we 've got to practice what we preach but when it comes to knocking the brand if the terrorists are coca cola and we 're pepsi
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 291.95 305.31 <o,f0,male> i don 't think being pepsi anything we say about coca cola anyone 's going to believe us so we 've got to find a different mechanism and one of the best mechanisms i 've ever come across is the victims of terrorism
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 305.31 319.63 <o,f0,male> they are somebody who can actually stand there and say this product 's crap i had it and i was sick for days it burnt my hand whatever you believe them you can see their scars you trust them
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 319.63 329.88 <o,f0,male> but whether it 's victims whether it 's governments ngos or even the queen yesterday in northern ireland
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 329.88 343.53 <o,f0,male> we have to interact and engage with those different layers of terrorism and in effect we do have to have a little dance with the devil
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 343.53 349.75 <o,f0,male> this is my favorite part of my speech i wanted to blow you all up to try and make a point
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 352.91 368.76 <o,f0,male> ted for health and safety reasons have told me i 've got to do a countdown so i feel like a bit of an irish or jewish terrorist sort of a health and safety terrorist and i laughter i 've got to count three two one and
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 389.23 400.41 <o,f0,male> lady in fifteen j was a suicide bomber amongst us all we 're all victims of terrorism there 's six hundred and twenty five of us in this room we 're going to be scarred for life
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 400.41 413.37 <o,f0,male> there was a father and a son who sat in that seat over there the son 's dead the father lives the father will probably kick himself for years to come
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 465.94 470.16 <o,f0,male> off our government
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 481.61 486.21 <o,f0,male> we 're all here and all of those who watch it are going to be traumatized by this event
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 486.21 491.36 <o,f0,male> but all of you here who are victims are going to learn some hard truths
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 491.36 508.87 <o,f0,male> that is our society we sympathize but after a while we start to ignore we don 't do enough as a society we do not look after our victims and we do not enable them and what i 'm going to try and show is that actually victims are the best weapon we have
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 509.08 510.73 <o,f0,male> against more terrorism
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 513.1 516.13 <o,f0,male> how would the government at the turn of the millennium
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 516.13 534.64 <o,f0,male> approach today well we all know what they 'd have done then is an invasion if the suicide bomber was from wales good luck to wales i 'd say knee jerk legislation emergency provision legislation which hits at the very basis of our society as we all know
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 537.69 545.75 <o,f0,male> we 're going to drive prejudice throughout edinburgh throughout the u k for welsh people
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 559.66 571.92 <o,f0,male> but mistakes of the past are inevitable it 's human nature the fear and the pressure to do something on them is going to be immense they are going to make mistakes they 're not just going to be smart
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 586.18 589.5 <o,f0,male> so what we need to do is we have to effect it
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 589.5 603.74 <o,f0,male> we 've got to start thinking about being more proactive we need to build an arsenal of noncombative weapons in this war on terrorism but of course it 's ideas is not something that governments do very well
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 607.45 626.07 <o,f0,male> i want to go back just to before the bang to this idea of brand and i was talking about coke and pepsi etc we see it as terrorism versus democracy in that brand war they 'll see it as freedom fighters and truth against injustice imperialism etc
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 629.43 638.76 <o,f0,male> we do have to see this as a deadly battlefield it 's not just our flesh and blood they want they actually want our cultural souls
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 638.77 648.59 <o,f0,male> and that 's why the brand analogy is a very interesting way of looking at this if we look at al qaeda al qaeda was essentially a
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 654.36 674.3 <o,f0,male> nine eleven launched it it was its big marketing day and it was packaged for the twenty first century they knew what they were doing they were effectively doing something in this brand image of creating a brand which can be franchised around the world where there 's poverty ignorance and injustice
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 674.3 690.88 <o,f0,male> we as i 've said have got to hit that market but we 've got to use our heads rather than our might if we perceive it in this way as a brand or other ways of thinking at it like this we will not resolve or counter terrorism
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 690.88 695.6 <o,f0,male> what i 'd like to do is just briefly go through a few examples from
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 695.69 705.91 <o,f0,male> my work on areas where we try and approach these things differently the first one has been dubbed lawfare for want of a better word
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 705.92 722.14 <o,f0,male> when we originally looked at bringing civil actions against terrorists everyone thought we were a bit mad and mavericks and crackpots now it 's got a title everyone 's doing it there 's a bomb people start suing but one of the first early cases on this was the omagh bombing
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 731.39 751.2 <o,f0,male> that meant that the culprits couldn 't really be prosecuted for lots of reasons mostly to do with the peace process and what was going on the greater good it also meant then if you can imagine this that the people who bombed your children and your husbands were walking around the supermarket
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 751.2 754.04 <o,f0,male> that you lived in some
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 754.15 772.97 <o,f0,male> of those victims said enough is enough we brought a private action and thank god ten years later we actually won it there is a slight appeal on at the moment so i have to be a bit careful but i 'm fairly confident why was it effective it was effective not just because justice was seen to be done where there was a huge void
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 772.97 792.47 <o,f0,male> it was because the real ira and other terrorist groups their whole strength is from the fact that they are an underdog when we put the victims as the underdog and flipped it they didn 't know what to do they were embarrassed their recruitment went down the bombs
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 792.48 797.02 <o,f0,male> actually stopped fact because of this action we became
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 809.12 820.29 <o,f0,male> that was allegedly from our point of view giving rewards to suicide bombers just by bringing the very action
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 820.29 833.37 <o,f0,male> that bank has stopped doing it and indeed the powers that be around the world which for real politic reasons before couldn 't actually deal with this issue because there was lots of competing interests have actually closed down those loopholes in the banking system
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 843.12 845.82 <o,f0,male> and
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 845.82 865.07 <o,f0,male> sued and that action has led to amazing things for new libya new libya has been compassionate towards those victims and started taking it so it started a whole new dialogue there but the problem is we need more and more support for these ideas and cases
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 865.07 868.13 <o,f0,male> civil affairs
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 886.68 901.19 <o,f0,male> so what we 're trying to do is create security and employment by bringing a coastguard along with the fisheries industry and i can guarantee you as that builds al shabaab and such likes will not have the poverty and injustice any longer to prey on those people
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 901.19 917.09 <o,f0,male> these initiatives cost less than a missile and certainly less than any soldier 's life but more importantly it takes the war to their homelands and not onto our shore and we 're looking at the causes the last one i wanted to talk about was dialogue
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 917.09 932.73 <o,f0,male> the advantages of dialogue are obvious it self educates both sides enables a better understanding reveals the strengths and weaknesses and yes like some of the speakers before the shared vulnerability does lead to trust
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 932.73 939.5 <o,f0,male> and it does then become that process part of normalization but it 's not an easy road
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 939.87 943 <o,f0,male> the bomb the victims
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 970.23 973.02 <o,f0,male> with saying if we follow reason
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 983.75 986.27 <o,f0,male> we need to foster more
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 986.41 1004.29 <o,f0,male> modern and asymmetrical responses to it this isn 't about being soft on terrorism it 's about fighting them on contemporary battlefields we must foster innovation as i 've said governments are receptive it won 't come from those dusty corridors the private sector has a role
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 1004.41 1012.19 <o,f0,male> the role we could do right now is going away and looking at how we can support victims around the world to bring initiatives
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 1028.87 1045.96 <o,f0,male> we have to ask ourselves these questions however unpalatable have we been ignoring an injustice or a humanitarian struggle somewhere in the world what if actually engagement on poverty and injustice is exactly what the terrorists wanted us to do what if the bombs are just simply wake up calls for us
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 1045.96 1051.52 <o,f0,male> what happens if that bomb went off because we didn 't have
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 1051.56 1057.95 <o,f0,male> any thoughts and things in place to allow dialogue to deal with these things and interaction
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 1057.95 1069.64 <o,f0,male> what is definitely uncontroversial is that as i 've said we 've got to stop being reactive and more proactive and i just want to leave you with one idea which is that
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 1069.64 1088.47 <o,f0,male> it 's a provocative question for you to think about and the answer will require sympathy with the devil it 's a question that 's been tackled by many great thinkers and writers what if society actually needs crisis to change what if society actually needs terrorism
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 1088.47 1100.3 <o,f0,male> to change and adapt for the better it 's those bulgakov themes it 's that picture of jesus and the devil hand in hand in gethsemane walking into the moonlight
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 1100.3 1110.6 <o,f0,male> what it would mean is that humans in order to survive in development quite darwinian spirit here inherently must dance with the devil
JasonMcCue_2012G 1 JasonMcCue_2012G 1113.21 1125.33 <o,f0,male> lot of people say that communism was defeated by the rolling stones it 's a good theory maybe the rolling stones has a place in this thank you
