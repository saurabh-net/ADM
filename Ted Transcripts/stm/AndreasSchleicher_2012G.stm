AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 27.34 45.1 <o,f0,male> but i want to tell you the story of pisa oecd 's test to measure the knowledge and skills of fifteen year olds around the world and it 's really a story of how international comparisons have globalized the field of education that we usually treat as an affair of domestic policy
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 45.1 51.41 <o,f0,male> look at how the world looked in the one thousand nine hundred and sixty s in terms of the proportion of people who had completed high school
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 51.41 55.66 <o,f0,male> you can see the united states ahead of everyone else
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 55.66 64.14 <o,f0,male> and much of the economic success of the united states draws on its long standing advantage as the first mover in education
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 87.62 106.92 <o,f0,male> korea shows you what 's possible in education two generations ago korea had the standard of living of afghanistan today and was one of the lowest education performers today every young korean finishes high school
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 106.92 118.91 <o,f0,male> so this tells us that in a global economy it is no longer national improvement that 's the benchmark for success but the best performing education systems internationally
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 118.91 130.24 <o,f0,male> the trouble is that measuring how much time people spend in school or what degree they have got is not always a good way of seeing what they can actually do
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 130.24 139 <o,f0,male> look at the toxic mix of unemployed graduates on our streets while employers say they cannot find the people with the skills they need
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 172.81 182.68 <o,f0,male> now some people have criticized us for this they say you know such a way of measuring outcomes is terribly unfair to people because we test students with problems they haven 't seen before
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 182.68 187.7 <o,f0,male> but if you take that logic you know you should consider life unfair because
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 187.7 195.12 <o,f0,male> the test of truth in life is not whether we can remember what we learned in school but whether we are prepared for change
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 195.12 205.02 <o,f0,male> whether we are prepared for jobs that haven 't been created to use technologies that haven 't been invented to solve problems we just can 't anticipate today
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 205.02 219.73 <o,f0,male> and once hotly contested our way of measuring outcomes has actually quickly become the standard in our latest assessment in two thousand and nine we measured seventy four school systems that together cover eighty seven percent of the economy
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 219.73 235.92 <o,f0,male> this chart shows you the performance of countries in red sort of below oecd average yellow is so so and in green are the countries doing really well you can see shanghai korea singapore in asia finland in europe
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 235.92 240.07 <o,f0,male> canada in north america doing really well
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 240.07 254.52 <o,f0,male> you can also see that there is a gap of almost three and a half school years between fifteen year olds in shanghai and fifteen year olds in chile and the gap grows to seven school years when you include the countries with really poor performance
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 254.52 260.24 <o,f0,male> there 's a world of difference in the way in which young people are prepared for today 's economy
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 262.64 271.97 <o,f0,male> but i want to introduce a second important dimension into this picture educators like to talk about equity
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 281.31 292.55 <o,f0,male> and we see that in some countries the impact of social background on learning outcomes is very very strong opportunities are unequally distributed a lot of potential of young children is wasted
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 292.55 299.72 <o,f0,male> we see in other countries that it matters much less into which social context you 're born
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 299.72 312.29 <o,f0,male> we all want to be there in the upper right quadrant where performance is strong and learning opportunities are equally distributed nobody and no country can afford to be there where performance is poor and there are large social
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 325.67 345.06 <o,f0,male> but actually if you look at how countries come out on this picture you see there are a lot of countries that actually are combining excellence with equity in fact one of the most important lessons from this comparison is that you don 't have to compromise equity to achieve excellence
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 345.06 362.97 <o,f0,male> these countries have moved on from providing excellence for just some to providing excellence for all a very important lesson and that also challenges the paradigms of many school systems that believe they are mainly there to sort people
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 362.98 368.48 <o,f0,male> and ever since those results came out policymakers educators researchers from around the world have tried to figure out
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 368.48 378.24 <o,f0,male> what 's behind the success of those systems but let 's step back for a moment and focus on the countries that actually started pisa and i 'm giving them a colored
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 404.94 418.92 <o,f0,male> and luxembourg for example the most expensive system doesn 't do particularly well what you see is that two countries with similar spending achieve very different results you also see and i think that 's one of the most encouraging findings
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 439.22 452.49 <o,f0,male> one way you can spend money is by paying teachers well and you can see korea investing a lot in attracting the best people into the teaching profession and korea also invests into long school days which drives up costs further
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 473.51 483.48 <o,f0,male> you go to the next country on the list luxembourg and you can see the red dot is exactly where it is for korea so luxembourg spends the same per student as korea does
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 497.26 508.12 <o,f0,male> but even luxembourg can spend its money only once and the price for this is that teachers are not paid particularly well students don 't have long hours of learning
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 508.12 522.72 <o,f0,male> and basically teachers have little time to do anything else than teaching so you can see two countries spent their money very differently and actually how they spent their money matters a lot more than how much they invest in education
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 522.72 535.7 <o,f0,male> let 's go back to the year two thousand remember that was the year before the ipod was invented this is how the world looked then in terms of pisa performance
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 535.7 555.27 <o,f0,male> the first thing you can see is that the bubbles were a lot smaller no we spent a lot less on education about thirty five percent less on education so you ask yourself if education has become so much more expensive has it become so much better and the bitter truth really is that you know not in many countries
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 555.27 560.07 <o,f0,male> but there are some countries which have seen impressive improvements
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 560.07 575.17 <o,f0,male> germany my own country in the year two thousand featured in the lower quadrant below average performance large social disparities and remember germany we used to be one of those countries that comes out very well when you just count people who have degrees
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 575.17 587 <o,f0,male> very disappointing results people were stunned by the results and for the very first time the public debate in germany was dominated for months by education
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 587 596.78 <o,f0,male> not tax not other kinds of issues but education was the center of the public debate and then policymakers began to respond to this the federal government
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 596.79 606.67 <o,f0,male> dramatically raised its investment in education a lot was done to increase the life chances of students with an immigrant background or from social disadvantage
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 606.67 614.53 <o,f0,male> and what 's really interesting is that this wasn 't just about optimizing existing policies
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 614.53 632.57 <o,f0,male> but data transformed some of the beliefs and paradigms underlying german education for example traditionally the education of the very young children was seen as the business of families and you would have cases where women were seen as neglecting their family responsibilities when they sent their children to kindergarten
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 632.57 650.98 <o,f0,male> pisa has transformed that debate and pushed early childhood education right at the center of public policy in germany or traditionally the german education divides children at the age of ten very young children between those deemed to pursue careers of knowledge workers
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 650.98 662.79 <o,f0,male> and those who would end up working for the knowledge workers and that mainly along socioeconomic lines and that paradigm is being challenged now too a lot of change
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 662.79 669.49 <o,f0,male> and the good news is nine years later you can see improvements in quality and equity
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 701.76 718.24 <o,f0,male> but still an impressive improvement a major overhaul of poland 's education helped to dramatically reduce between variability among schools turn around many of the lowest performing schools and raise performance by over half a school year
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 727.95 732.39 <o,f0,male> so what you can actually see there 's been a lot of change
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 732.39 745.83 <o,f0,male> and even those people who complain and say that the relative standing of countries on something like pisa is just an artifact of culture of economic factors of social issues of homogeneity of societies and so on
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 763.45 774.19 <o,f0,male> and all that raises of course the question what can we learn from those countries in the green quadrant who have achieved high levels of equity high levels of performance and raised outcomes
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 774.19 791.65 <o,f0,male> and of course the question is can what works in one context provide a model elsewhere of course you can 't copy and paste education systems wholesale but these comparisons have identified a range of factors that high performing systems share
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 791.65 796.28 <o,f0,male> everybody agrees that education is important everybody says
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 811.43 828.86 <o,f0,male> how do the media talk about schools and teachers those are the critical questions and what we have learned from pisa is that in high performing education systems the leaders have convinced their citizens to make choices that value education their future more than consumption today
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 828.86 844.01 <o,f0,male> and you know what 's interesting you won 't believe it but there are countries in which the most attractive place to be is not the shopping center but the school those things really exist but placing a high value on education is just part of the picture
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 844.01 850.51 <o,f0,male> the other part is the belief that all children are capable of success
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 850.51 860.24 <o,f0,male> you have some countries where students are segregated early in their ages you know students are divided up reflecting the belief that only some children can achieve world
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 860.24 875.84 <o,f0,male> class standards but usually that is linked to very strong social disparities if you go to japan in asia or finland in europe parents and teachers in those countries expect every student to succeed
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 875.84 885.48 <o,f0,male> and you can see that actually mirrored in student behavior when we asked students what counts for success in mathematics
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 885.48 891.98 <o,f0,male> students in north america would typically tell us you know it 's all about talent if i 'm not born as a genius in math i 'd better study
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 904.71 916.83 <o,f0,male> in the past different students were taught in similar ways high performers on pisa embrace diversity with differentiated pedagogical practices
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 916.83 921.96 <o,f0,male> they realize that ordinary students have extraordinary talents
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 921.96 937.3 <o,f0,male> and they personalize learning opportunities high performing systems also share clear and ambitious standards across the entire spectrum every student knows what matters every student knows what 's required to be successful
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 937.3 949.79 <o,f0,male> and nowhere does the quality of an education system exceed the quality of its teachers high performing systems are very careful in how they recruit and select their teachers and how they train
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 949.79 957.48 <o,f0,male> they watch how they improve the performances of teachers in difficulties who are struggling and how they structure teacher pay
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 957.48 964.63 <o,f0,male> they provide an environment also in which teachers work together to frame good practice
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 964.63 970.96 <o,f0,male> and they provide intelligent pathways for teachers to grow in their careers
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 978.03 989.58 <o,f0,male> high performing systems are very clear what good performance is they set very ambitious standards but then they enable their teachers to figure out what do i need to teach to my students today
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 989.58 999.27 <o,f0,male> the past was about delivered wisdom in education now the challenge is to enable user generated wisdom
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 999.27 1013.9 <o,f0,male> high performers have moved on from professional or from administrative forms of accountability and control sort of how do you check whether people do what they 're supposed to do in education to professional forms of work organization
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1013.9 1024.04 <o,f0,male> they enable their teachers to make innovations in pedagogy they provide them with the kind of development they need to develop stronger pedagogical practices
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1024.04 1035.57 <o,f0,male> the goal of the past was standardization and compliance high performing systems have made teachers and school principals inventive
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1035.57 1041.01 <o,f0,male> in the past the policy focus was on outcomes on provision
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1041.01 1060.61 <o,f0,male> the high performing systems have helped teachers and school principals to look outwards to the next teacher the next school around their lives and the most impressive outcomes of world class systems is that they achieve high performance across the entire system you 've seen finland doing so well on pisa but what makes finland so impressive is that only five percent
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1060.61 1064.49 <o,f0,male> of the performance variation amongst students lies between schools
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1064.49 1069.49 <o,f0,male> every school succeeds this is where success is systemic
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1069.49 1076.64 <o,f0,male> and how do they do that they invest resources where they can make the most difference they attract the strongest principals
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1076.64 1096.17 <o,f0,male> into the toughest schools and the most talented teachers into the most challenging classroom last but not least those countries align policies across all areas of public policy they make them coherent over sustained periods of time and they ensure that what they do is consistently implemented
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1096.17 1107.27 <o,f0,male> now knowing what successful systems are doing doesn 't yet tell us how to improve that 's also clear and that 's where some of the limits of international comparisons of pisa
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1128.05 1145.59 <o,f0,male> you know some people argue that changing educational administration is like moving graveyards you just can 't rely on the people out there to help you with this laughter but pisa has shown what 's possible in education
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1145.59 1153.85 <o,f0,male> it has helped countries to see that improvement is possible it has taken away excuses from those who are complacent
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1153.85 1157.58 <o,f0,male> and it has helped countries to set meaningful targets
AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1 AndreasSchleicher_2012G 1157.58 1177.15 <o,f0,male> in terms of measurable goals achieved by the world 's leaders if we can help every child every teacher every school every principal every parent see what improvement is possible that only the sky is the limit to education improvement we have laid the foundations for better policies and better lives thank you
