BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 13.12 26.51 <o,f0,male> really extraordinary honor for me i spend most of my time in jails in prisons on death row i spend most of my time in very low income communities in the projects and places where there 's a great deal of hopelessness
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 26.51 37.37 <o,f0,male> and being here at ted and seeing the stimulation hearing it has been very very energizing to me and one of the things that 's emerged in my short time here is that ted has an identity
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 37.37 40.24 <o,f0,male> and you can actually say things here
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 40.24 55.48 <o,f0,male> that have impacts around the world and sometimes when it comes through ted it has meaning and power that it doesn 't have when it doesn 't and i mention that because i think identity is really important and we 've had some fantastic presentations
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 55.48 63.11 <o,f0,male> and i think what we 've learned is that if you 're a teacher your words can be meaningful but if you 're a compassionate teacher they can be especially meaningful
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 63.33 68.19 <o,f0,male> if you 're a doctor you can do some good things but if you 're a caring doctor you can do some other things
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 71.11 90.58 <o,f0,male> and i didn 't learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that i do i actually learned about this from my grandmother i grew up in a house that was the traditional african american home that was dominated by a matriarch and that matriarch was my grandmother she was tough she was strong she was powerful
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 90.83 94.53 <o,f0,male> she was the end of every argument in our family
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 94.86 98.13 <o,f0,male> she was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 98.28 107.9 <o,f0,male> she was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved her parents were born in slavery in virginia in the one thousand eight hundred and forty 's she was born in the one thousand eight hundred and eighty 's and the experience of slavery very much
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 118.81 125.93 <o,f0,male> and then she 'd let me go and an hour or two later if i saw her she 'd come over to me and she 'd say bryan do you still feel me hugging you
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 125.93 133.5 <o,f0,male> and if i said no she 'd assault me again and if i said yes she 'd leave me alone and she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 133.5 147.65 <o,f0,male> and the only challenge was that she had ten children my mom was the youngest of her ten kids and sometimes when i would go and spend time with her it would be difficult to get her time and attention my cousins would be running around everywhere and i remember when i was about eight or nine years old waking up
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 161.5 175.74 <o,f0,male> and after about fifteen or twenty minutes of this she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said come on bryan you and i are going to have a talk and i remember this just like it happened yesterday i never will forget it
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 176.21 181.09 <o,f0,male> she took me out back and she said bryan i 'm going to tell you something but you don 't tell anybody what i tell you
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 181.41 184.51 <o,f0,male> i said okay mama she said now you make sure you don 't do that
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 184.66 188.44 <o,f0,male> i said sure then she sat me down and she looked at me
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 188.95 192.25 <o,f0,male> and she said i want you to know i 've been watching you
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 192.9 196 <o,f0,male> and she said i think you 're special
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 196.42 200.46 <o,f0,male> she said i think you can do anything you want to do
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 206.33 211.45 <o,f0,male> i said okay mama she said the first thing i want you to promise me is that you 'll always love your mom
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 212.12 218.51 <o,f0,male> she said that 's my baby girl and you have to promise me now you 'll always take care of her well i adored my mom so i said yes mama i 'll do that
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 219.08 223.54 <o,f0,male> then she said the second thing i want you to promise me is that you 'll always do the right thing
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 223.77 226.06 <o,f0,male> even when the right thing is the hard thing
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 230.48 236.04 <o,f0,male> then finally she said the third thing i want you to promise me is that you 'll never drink alcohol
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 256.73 276.13 <o,f0,male> he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some and they offered it to me i said no no no that 's okay you all go ahead i 'm not going to have any beer my brother said come on we 're doing this today you always do what we do i had some your sister had some have some beer i said no i don 't feel right about that y 'all go ahead y 'all go ahead and then my brother started staring at me he said what 's wrong with you have some beer
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 276.14 277.95 <o,f0,male> then he looked at me real hard and he said
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 278 282.03 <o,f0,male> oh i hope you 're not still hung up on that conversation mama had with you
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 303.31 308.84 <o,f0,male> two years old and i 'm going to admit to you that i 've never had a drop of alcohol
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 313.82 317.59 <o,f0,male> i say that because there is power in identity
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 318.04 328.91 <o,f0,male> when we create the right kind of identity we can say things to the world around us that they don 't actually believe makes sense we can get them to do things that they don 't think they can do
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 328.91 340.42 <o,f0,male> when i thought about my grandmother of course she would think all her grandkids were special my grandfather was in prison during prohibition my male uncles died of alcohol related diseases and these were the things she thought we needed to commit to
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 344.33 355.39 <o,f0,male> this country is very different today than it was forty years ago in one thousand nine hundred and seventy two there were three hundred thousand people in jails and prisons today there are two point three million
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 356.36 368.81 <o,f0,male> the united states now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world we have seven million people on probation and parole and mass incarceration in my judgment has fundamentally changed our world
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 369.94 377.73 <o,f0,male> in poor communities in communities of color there is this despair there is this hopelessness that is being shaped by these outcomes
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 377.86 384.58 <o,f0,male> one out of three black men between the ages of eighteen and thirty is in jail in prison on probation or parole
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 385.19 391.24 <o,f0,male> in urban communities across this country los angeles philadelphia baltimore washington fifty to sixty percent
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 391.56 395.71 <o,f0,male> of all young men of color are in jail or prison or on probation or parole
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 395.73 404.32 <o,f0,male> our system isn 't just being shaped in these ways that seem to be distorting around race they 're also distorted by poverty we have a system of justice in this country
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 404.53 410.52 <o,f0,male> that treats you much better if you 're rich and guilty than if you 're poor and innocent wealth
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 410.65 413.53 <o,f0,male> not culpability shapes outcomes
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 414.46 417.58 <o,f0,male> and yet we seem to be very comfortable
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 418.2 423.61 <o,f0,male> the politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 424.14 425.8 <o,f0,male> we 've been disconnected
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 440.64 451.3 <o,f0,male> permanently lost the right to vote we 're actually projecting in another ten years the level of disenfranchisement will be as high as it 's been since prior to the passage of the voting rights act and there is
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 451.3 453.23 <o,f0,male> this stunning silence
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 454.84 463.99 <o,f0,male> i represent children a lot of my clients are very young the united states is the only country in the world where we sentence thirteen year old children to die in prison
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 464.32 469.83 <o,f0,male> we have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country and we 're actually doing some litigation
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 484.86 488.36 <o,f0,male> but there 's another way of thinking about where we are in our identity
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 488.6 495.03 <o,f0,male> the other way of thinking about it is not do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit but do we deserve to kill
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 507.24 509.49 <o,f0,male> a kind of astonishing error rate
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 509.53 512.23 <o,f0,male> one out of nine people innocent
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 520.88 524.5 <o,f0,male> but somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 524.65 529.28 <o,f0,male> it 's not our problem it 's not our burden it 's not our struggle
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 539.02 552.37 <o,f0,male> i tell them about slavery i tell them about terrorism the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to world war ii we don 't really know very much about it but for african americans in this country that was an era defined by terror
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 552.66 560.93 <o,f0,male> in many communities people had to worry about being lynched they had to worry about being bombed it was the threat of terror that shaped their lives and these older people come up to me now
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 560.93 572.99 <o,f0,male> and they say mr stevenson you give talks you make speeches you tell people to stop saying we 're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation 's history after nine eleven they tell me to say no tell them that we grew up with that
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 573.48 581.14 <o,f0,male> and that era of terrorism of course was followed by segregation and decades of racial subordination and apartheid and
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 581.35 593.15 <o,f0,male> and yet we have in this country this dynamic where we really don 't like to talk about our problems we don 't like to talk about our history and because of that we really haven 't understood
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 593.19 596.3 <o,f0,male> what it 's meant to do the things we 've done historically
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 603.82 610.58 <o,f0,male> and i believe it 's because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of truth and reconciliation in south africa
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 611.21 615.98 <o,f0,male> people understood that we couldn 't overcome apartheid without a commitment to truth and reconciliation
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 616.13 632.37 <o,f0,male> in rwanda even after the genocide there was this commitment but in this country we haven 't done that i was giving some lectures in germany about the death penalty it was fascinating because one of the scholars stood up after the presentation and said well you know it 's deeply troubling to hear what you 're talking about
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 638.79 641.09 <o,f0,male> and the room got very quiet and this woman
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 641.1 645.32 <o,f0,male> said there 's no way with our history
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 645.47 652.56 <o,f0,male> we could ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings it would be unconscionable for us
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 653.51 657.61 <o,f0,male> to in an intentional and deliberate way set about executing people
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 664.43 670.21 <o,f0,male> where the nation state of germany was executing people especially if they were disproportionately jewish i couldn 't bear it
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 673.41 675.21 <o,f0,male> and yet in this country
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 675.52 679.21 <o,f0,male> in the states of the old south we execute people
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 695.47 698.48 <o,f0,male> well i believe that our identity is at risk
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 699.84 704.84 <o,f0,male> that when we actually don 't care about these difficult things
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 705.84 709.12 <o,f0,male> the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 710.39 717.23 <o,f0,male> we love innovation we love technology we love creativity we love entertainment
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 718.19 723.95 <o,f0,male> but ultimately those realities are shadowed by suffering
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 724.29 726.97 <o,f0,male> abuse degradation
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 732.93 737 <o,f0,male> because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 737.08 748.64 <o,f0,male> more committed more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world and for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 748.7 752.21 <o,f0,male> the disadvantaged those who will never get to ted
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 752.69 756.49 <o,f0,male> but thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 757.01 776.52 <o,f0,male> you know ultimately we all have to believe things we haven 't seen we do as rational as we are as committed to intellect as we are innovation creativity development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 776.99 781.26 <o,f0,male> and it 's that mind heart connection that i believe compels us
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 781.67 786.31 <o,f0,male> to not just be attentive to all the bright and dazzly things
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 786.46 789.23 <o,f0,male> but also the dark and difficult things
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 789.65 804.56 <o,f0,male> vaclav havel the great czech leader talked about this he said when we were in eastern europe and dealing with oppression we wanted all kinds of things but mostly what we needed was hope an orientation of the spirit a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places and be a witness
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 805.2 814.51 <o,f0,male> well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what i believe even ted communities have to be engaged in
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 814.85 816.7 <o,f0,male> there is no disconnect
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 816.79 818.78 <o,f0,male> around technology and design
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 819 823.43 <o,f0,male> that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 837.15 848.01 <o,f0,male> it will get to you i had the great privilege when i was a young lawyer of meeting rosa parks and ms parks used to come back to montgomery every now and then and she would get together with two of her dearest friends these older women
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 848.01 852.63 <o,f0,male> johnnie carr who was the organizer of the montgomery bus boycott
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 904.66 911.25 <o,f0,male> the prison population we 're trying to end mass incarceration i gave her my whole rap and when i finished she looked at me and she said
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 921.95 924.59 <o,f0,male> brave brave
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 931.02 936.25 <o,f0,male> we need to find ways to embrace these challenges these problems the suffering
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 936.89 955.54 <o,f0,male> because ultimately our humanity depends on everyone 's humanity i 've learned very simple things doing the work that i do it 's just taught me very simple things i 've come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we 've ever done i believe that for every person on the planet
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 955.82 958.91 <o,f0,male> i think if somebody tells a lie they 're not just a liar
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 959.03 965.77 <o,f0,male> i think if somebody takes something that doesn 't belong to them they 're not just a thief i think even if you kill someone you 're not just a killer
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 965.81 970.39 <o,f0,male> and because of that there 's this basic human dignity that must be respected by law
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 978.16 980.68 <o,f0,male> that the opposite of poverty is not wealth
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 983.08 988.45 <o,f0,male> i don 't believe that i actually think in too many places the opposite of poverty is justice
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 988.83 990.79 <o,f0,male> and finally i believe
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 991.75 995.72 <o,f0,male> that despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 995.72 997.85 <o,f0,male> and so inspiring and so stimulating
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 998.04 1001.92 <o,f0,male> we will ultimately not be judged by our technology
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 1002.13 1004.1 <o,f0,male> we won 't be judged by our design
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 1004.41 1010.19 <o,f0,male> we won 't be judged by our intellect and reason ultimately you judge the character of a society
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 1010.41 1015.02 <o,f0,male> not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged but by how they treat the poor
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 1016.78 1024.5 <o,f0,male> the condemned the incarcerated because it 's in that nexus that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 1026.27 1037.32 <o,f0,male> i sometimes get out of balance i 'll end with this story i sometimes push too hard i do get tired as we all do sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 1037.74 1049.25 <o,f0,male> and i 've been representing these kids who have been sentenced to do these very harsh sentences and i go to the jail and i see my client who 's thirteen and fourteen and he 's been certified to stand trial as an adult i start thinking well how did that happen
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 1049.37 1052.55 <o,f0,male> how can a judge turn you into something that you 're not
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 1053.14 1062.7 <o,f0,male> and the judge has certified him as an adult but i see this kid and i was up too late one night and i starting thinking well gosh if the judge can turn you into something that you 're not the judge must have magic power
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 1115.54 1118.22 <o,f0,male> and i finally decided oh gosh
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 1140.64 1142.94 <o,f0,male> i said i 'm a lawyer he said you 're a lawyer
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 1143.06 1146.55 <o,f0,male> i said yes sir and this man came over to me and he hugged me
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 1147.18 1150.04 <o,f0,male> and he whispered in my ear he said i 'm so
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 1177.79 1196.5 <o,f0,male> and police officers were coming in and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers and before i knew it the courtroom was filled with people angry that we were talking about race that we were talking about poverty that we were talking about inequality and out of the corner of my eye i could see this janitor pacing back and forth and he kept looking through the window and he could hear all of this holler he kept pacing back and forth
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 1196.5 1199.98 <o,f0,male> and finally this older black man with this very worried look on his face
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 1199.98 1203.74 <o,f0,male> came into the courtroom and sat down behind me almost at counsel table
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 1211.47 1219.45 <o,f0,male> and this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man he said jimmy what are you doing in this courtroom and this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 1221.24 1228.41 <o,f0,male> and he looked at me and he said i came into this courtroom to tell this young man keep your eyes on the prize hold on
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 1228.93 1232.81 <o,f0,male> i 've come to ted because i believe that many of you understand
BryanStevenson_2012 1 BryanStevenson_2012 1243.18 1261.11 <o,f0,male> our survival is tied to the survival of everyone that our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with visions of humanity compassion and justice and more than anything for those of you who share that i 've simply come to tell you
