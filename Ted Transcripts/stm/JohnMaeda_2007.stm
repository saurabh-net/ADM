JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 13.13 26.91 <o,f0,male> on simplicity what a great way to start first of all i've been watching this trend where we have these books like such and such for dummies do you know these book these such and such for dummies my daughters pointed out that i'm very similar looking
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 31.55 40.87 <o,f0,male> i was looking online at amazon com for other books like this you know there s also something called the complete idiot 's guide there's a sort of business model around being stupid in some sense
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 41.11 51.08 <o,f0,male> we like to have technology make us feel bad for some strange reason but i really like that so i wrote a book called the laws of simplicity i was in milan last week for the italian launch
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 52.03 61.56 <o,f0,male> a book about questions questions about simplicity very few answers i'm also wondering myself what is simplicity is it good is it bad is complexity better
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 115.88 116.06 <o,f0,male> i
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 127.00 130.54 <o,f0,male> so it was traumatizing actually so
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 131.08 139.93 <o,f0,male> i wanted to escape again so i went out to my car and cape cod there are idyllic roads and all of us can drive in this room and when you drive
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 151.43 160.38 <o,f0,male> so i thought complexity was attacking me suddenly so i thought ah simplicity very important but then i thought oh simplicity what would that be like on a beach what if
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 180.97 190.18 <o,f0,male> the media lab maybe some of you guys have heard of this place it's designed by i m pei one of the premier modernist architects modernism means white box and it's
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 192.13 192.57 <o,f0,male> and
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 194.41 206.45 <o,f0,male> some of you guys are entrepreneurs et cetera whatever last month i was at google and boy that cafeteria man you guys have things here in silicon valley like stock options see in academia we get titles
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 208.25 214.00 <o,f0,male> last year at ted these were all my titles i had a lot of titles i have a default title as a father of a bunch of daughters
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 214.57 225.07 <o,f0,male> this year at ted i'm happy to report that i have new titles in addition to my previous titles another associate director of research and this also happened so i have five daughters now
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 226.18 228.03 <o,f0,male> my baby reina thank you
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 228.86 239.11 <o,f0,male> and so my life is much more complex because of the baby actually but that's okay we will still stay married i think but looking way back when i was a child you see i grew up in a tofu factory in seattle
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 250.63 261.73 <o,f0,male> work till six pm six days a week my father was kind of like andy grove paranoid of the competition so often seven days a week family business equals child labor we
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 262.74 264.29 <o,f0,male> a great model
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 265.26 270.15 <o,f0,male> so i loved going to school school was great and maybe going to school helped me get to this media lab place
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 276.17 289.87 <o,f0,male> place and it's important to me because as a student i was a computer science undergrad and i discovered design later on in my life and there was this person muriel cooper who knows muriel cooper muriel cooper wasn't she amazing muriel cooper she was wacky
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 290.30 297.48 <o,f0,male> and she was a tedster exactly and she showed us she showed the world how to make the computer beautiful again and
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 297.89 305.89 <o,f0,male> she's very important in my life because she's the one that told me to leave mit and go to art school it was the best advice i ever got so i went to art school because of her
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 315.80 323.04 <o,f0,male> when i was in japan i went to an art school in japan i had a nice sort of situation because somehow i was connected to
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 323.32 333.55 <o,f0,male> paul rand some of you guys know paul rand the greatest graphic designer i'm sorry out there the great graphic designer paul rand designed the ibm logo the westinghouse logo he basically said i 've designed everything
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 359.79 370.17 <o,f0,male> i think that the mentors that we all meet sort of humanize us when you get older and you're all freaked out whatever the mentors calm us down and i'm grateful for my mentors and i'm sure all of you are
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 372.30 384.06 <o,f0,male> because the human thing is very hard when you're at mit the t doesn't stand for human it stands for technology and because of that i always wondered about this human thing so i've always been googling this word human to find out how many hits i get
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 384.29 394.61 <o,f0,male> in two thousand and one i had twenty six million hits and for a computer because computers are against humans a bit i have forty two million hits let me do an al gore here so if you sort of compare that
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 409.44 421.70 <o,f0,male> in the simplicity realm it's also interesting so if you compare complexities to simplicity it's also catching up in a way too so somehow humans and simplicity are intertwined i think
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 423.69 431.96 <o,f0,male> i have a confession i'm not a man of simplicity i spent my entire early career making complex stuff lots of complex stuff i
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 432.27 443.19 <o,f0,male> wrote computer programs to make complex graphics like this i had clients in japan to make really complex stuff like this and i've always felt bad about it in a sense so i hid in a time dimension
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 453.05 465.98 <o,f0,male> and this is a firework calendar so you launch the number into space because the japanese believe that when you see fireworks you're cooler for some reason this is why they have fireworks in the summer a very extreme culture
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 467.26 476.52 <o,f0,male> this is a fall based calendar because i have so many leaves in my yard so this is the leaves in my yard essentially and so i made a lot of these types of things
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 477.16 485.16 <o,f0,male> i've been lucky to have been there before people made these kind of things and so i made all this kind of stuff that messes with your eyes i feel kind of bad about that
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 486.00 490.43 <o,f0,male> tomorrow paola antonelli is speaking i love paola she has this show right now at moma where
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 491.77 501.79 <o,f0,male> these early works are here on display at moma on the walls if you're in new york please go and see that but i've had a problem because i make all this flying stuff and the people say oh
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 502.19 512.85 <o,f0,male> i know your work you're the guy that makes eye candy and when you're told this you feel kind of weird eye candy sort of pejorative don't you think so i say no i make eye meat instead
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 513.70 518.44 <o,f0,male> and eye meat is something different something more fibrous something more powerful perhaps but what could that
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 529.93 541.20 <o,f0,male> make art with a computer program you're always on the tree and the paradox is that for excellent art you want to be off the tree so this is sort of a complication i've found
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 541.91 552.95 <o,f0,male> so to get off the tree i began to use my old computers i took these to tokyo in two thousand and one to make computer objects this is a new way to type on my old color classic
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 553.83 564.67 <o,f0,male> you can't type very much on this i also discovered that an ir mouse responds to crt emissions and starts to move by itself so this is a self drawing machine
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 578.18 583.00 <o,f0,male> measure the impact stuff like this are things i made just to sort of understand what these things are
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 609.64 616.21 <o,f0,male> in different forms if you dry them quick you can make like elephants and steers and stuff and my wife didn't like these because they mold so i had to stop that
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 617.02 621.20 <o,f0,male> so i went back to the computer and i bought five large fries and scanned them all
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 621.97 629.99 <o,f0,male> and i was looking for some kind of food theme and i wrote some software to automatically lay out french fry images
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 630.49 642.53 <o,f0,male> and as a child i'd hear that song you know oh beautiful for spacious skies for amber waves of grain so i made this amber waves image it's sort of a midwest cornfield out of french fries and also
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 643.41 655.70 <o,f0,male> as a child i was the fattest kid in class so i used to love cheetos oh i love cheetos yummy so i wanted to play with cheetos in some way i wasn't sure where to go with this i invented cheeto paint cheeto paint is a very simple
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 657.79 658.54 <o,f0,male> i discovered that
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 658.90 660.97 <o,f0,male> cheetos are good expressive material
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 661.64 675.59 <o,f0,male> and with these cheetos i began to think what can i make with these cheetos and so i began to crinkle up potato chip flecks and also pretzels i was looking for some kind of form and in the end i made one hundred butter fries
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 677.34 677.68 <o,f0,male> and
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 677.99 690.09 <o,f0,male> each butter fry is composed of different pieces people ask me how they make the antenna sometimes they find a hair in the food that's my hair my hair 's clean it's okay i'm a tenured professor which means basically i don't have to work anymore
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 690.53 698.47 <o,f0,male> a strange business model i can come into work everyday and staple five pieces of paper and just stare at it with my latte end of story but
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 699.17 713.23 <o,f0,male> i realized that life could be very boring so i've been thinking about life and i notice that my camera my digital camera versus my car a very strange thing the car is so big the camera is so small yet the manual for the camera is so much bigger than the
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 718.72 725.45 <o,f0,male> so i was in the cape one time and i typed the word simplicity and i discovered in this weird m night shyamalan way that i discovered
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 748.92 760.22 <o,f0,male> but the laws are kind of like sushi in a way there are all kinds in japan they say that sushi is challenging you know the uni is the most challenging so number ten is challenging people hate number ten like they hate uni actually
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 760.39 768.63 <o,f0,male> the three keys are easy to eat so this is anago cooked already so easy to eat so enjoy your sushi meal later with the laws of simplicity
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 777.53 785.13 <o,f0,male> cookie versus laundry thing anyone who has kids knows that if you offer a kid a big cookie or a small cookie which cookie are they going to take
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 785.86 794.98 <o,f0,male> big cookie you can say the small cookie has godiva chocolate bits in it but it doesn't work they want the big cookie but if you offer kids two piles of
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 795.27 801.31 <o,f0,male> to fold the small pile or the big pile which will they choose strangely not the big pile
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 802.60 811.81 <o,f0,male> so i think it's as simple as this you know when you want more it's because you want to enjoy it when you want less it's because it's about work and so to boil it all down
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 830.21 836.51 <o,f0,male> your life and i just love to see the world the world is an amazing place by being at ted we see so many things at one time
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 836.84 845.89 <o,f0,male> and i can't help but enjoy looking at everything in the world like everything you see every time you wake up it's such a joy to sort of experience
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 888.70 898.92 <o,f0,male> i have a lot of cocky freshmen at mit so i tell them oh your bodies are really getting stronger and stronger but in your late twenties and mid thirties cells they die ok it gets them to work harder sometimes
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 899.58 911.52 <o,f0,male> and if you have your vision vision is interesting as you age from infant age your vision gets better and maybe in your late teens early twenties you're looking for a mate and your vision goes after that
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 915.29 924.53 <o,f0,male> your social responsibility is very interesting so as you get older you may like have kids whatever and then the kids graduate and you have no responsibility any more
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 927.33 938.58 <o,f0,male> but if any of you people ask what actually goes up does anything go up what's the positive part of this you know i think wisdom always goes up i love these eighty year old ninety year old guys and women they have so many thoughts and they have so much wisdom
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 938.85 943.80 <o,f0,male> and i think you know this ted thing i've come here and this is the fourth time and i come here for this wisdom i think
JohnMaeda_2007 1 JohnMaeda_2007 947.06 954.01 <o,f0,male> wisdom somehow and i'm so glad to be here and i'm very grateful to be here chris and this is an amazing experience for me as well
