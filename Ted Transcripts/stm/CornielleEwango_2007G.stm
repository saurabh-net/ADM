CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 154.22 159.61 <o,f0,male> that time the ituri forest was created as a forest reserve
CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 188.56 194.82 <o,f0,male> okapi faunal reserve because of this beautiful creature that is a forest giraffe
CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 200.39 219.55 <o,f0,male> through evolution we have this forest giraffe that lives only in congo it has also some beautiful primates thirteen species highest diversity we can find in one single area in africa and it has the ituri forest itself
CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 219.55 224.81 <o,f0,male> about one thousand three hundred species of plants so far known

CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 263.32 274.8 <o,f0,male> was completely difficult to do and to achieve it when kabila started his movement to liberate congo so mobutu soldiers
CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 274.8 285.19 <o,f0,male> started moving and retreated so they started fleeing from the east to the west and the okapi faunal reserve is
CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 285.19 292.35 <o,f0,male> so there was a road from goma somewhere here and coming like this so
CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 292.35 312.13 <o,f0,male> they might go through pass through the okapi faunal reserve congo has five of the world 's richest sites of protected area and the okapi faunal reserve is one of them so soldier was fleeing in the okapi faunal reserve on their way they looted everything
CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 312.13 315.56 <o,f0,male> torture wars oh my god you can 't believe
CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 315.56 321.29 <o,f0,male> every person was looking his way where to go we don 't know and it was for us the young
CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 321.94 327.8 <o,f0,male> the first time really we hear the language of war of guns
CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 328.02 336.45 <o,f0,male> and even people who faced the rebellion of one thousand nine hundred and sixty three after our independence they didn 't believe
CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 336.48 348.78 <o,f0,male> what was happening they were killing people they were doing whatever they want because they have power who have been doing that young children child soldiers
CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 401.86 404.27 <o,f0,male> purpose so that we start them for

CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 496.63 516.21 <o,f0,male> i have to save something even myself my life and life of the staff i buried some of our new vehicle engines i buried it to save it and some of equipment went with them on the top of the canopy to save it he 's not collecting plants he 's going to save our equipment on the canopy
CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 611.31 623.57 <o,f0,male> coltan extraction gold mining so we started talking with them convincing them that we are in a protected area there are regulations that it 's prohibited to do
CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 629.03 647.03 <o,f0,male> you think that soldiers who are dying are not important and your animals you are protecting are most important we don 't think so we have to do it because to let our movement advance i say no way you are not going to do it here
CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 647.03 651.01 <o,f0,male> we started talking with them and i was negotiating
CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 651.38 660.16 <o,f0,male> tried to protect our equipment tried to protect our staff and the villages of about one thousand five hundred people
CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 660.16 676.28 <o,f0,male> and we continued but i was doing that negotiating with them sometimes we are having meeting and they are talking with jean pierre bemba with mbusa nyamwisi with kabila and i 'm there sometimes they talk to my own language that is lingala
CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 701.88 706.77 <o,f0,male> forest and every time daily after we have meeting
CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 740.74 751.73 <o,f0,male> one day we went to meet the chief commander he had the same iridium cell phone like me and he asked me do you know how to use this i said i have never seen it
CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 844.01 849.3 <o,f0,male> what we are doing after that that was the situation of

CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 892.29 909.14 <o,f0,male> my design is tracking the global warming effect on biodiversity and what the impacts of the ituri forest is playing to uptake carbon this is one of the studies we are doing on a forty hectare plot where we have tagged
CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 941.25 947.72 <o,f0,male> i didn 't find this but now i think that i would have titled it the language of guns
CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 980.63 986.84 <o,f0,male> because of the language of guns i don 't think that someone may blame google
CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 986.87 1003.3 <o,f0,male> because it 's doing the right things even if people like al qaeda are using google to connect between them but it 's serving millions for the best but what is doing with gun industries thank you
CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 1019.5 1021.17 <o,f0,male> how can we
CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 1046.69 1064.34 <o,f0,male> many many of you have seen the talents of africans but there are few who are going to school many are dying because of all those kind of pandemics hiv malaria poverty not going to school
CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 1064.34 1084.28 <o,f0,male> what you can assist us it 's by building capacities how many have got opportunity like me to go to u s do a master 's and go now i 'm in the netherlands to do a ph d but many of them are just here because they don 't have money and they can 't go even to university they can 't even attain the bachelor 's degree
CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 1084.28 1086.42 <o,f0,male> building capacities
CornielleEwango_2007G 1 CornielleEwango_2007G 1086.69 1094.21 <o,f0,male> for the young generation is going to make a better generation and a better future tomorrow for africa
