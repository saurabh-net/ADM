PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 16.23 30.5 <o,f0,male> humanitarian model has barely changed since the early twentieth century its origins are firmly rooted in the analog age and there is a major shift coming on the horizon the catalyst for this change
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 30.5 37.16 <o,f0,male> was the major earthquake that struck haiti on the twelfth of january in two thousand and ten
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 37.16 52.54 <o,f0,male> haiti was a game changer the earthquake destroyed the capital of port au prince claiming the lives of some three hundred and twenty thousand people rendering homeless about one point two million people
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 52.54 58.23 <o,f0,male> government institutions were completely decapitated including the presidential palace
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 58.23 62.52 <o,f0,male> i remember standing on the roof of the ministry of justice
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 62.52 81.67 <o,f0,male> in downtown port au prince it was about two meters high completely squashed by the violence of the earthquake for those of us on the ground in those early days it was clear for even the most disaster hardened veterans that haiti was something different haiti was something we hadn 't seen before
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 81.67 98.12 <o,f0,male> but haiti provided us with something else unprecedented haiti allowed us to glimpse into a future of what disaster response might look like in a hyper connected world where people have access to mobile smart devices
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 118.84 127.13 <o,f0,male> we were in one of the poorest countries on the planet but eighty percent of the people had mobile devices in their hands
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 127.13 131.22 <o,f0,male> and we were unprepared for this and they were shaping the aid effort
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 131.22 143.29 <o,f0,male> outside haiti also things were looking different tens of thousands of so called digital volunteers were scouring the internet converting tweets that had already been converted from texts
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 143.29 159.99 <o,f0,male> and putting these into open source maps layering them with all sorts of important information people like crisis mappers and open street map and putting these on the web for everybody the media the aid organizations and the communities themselves to participate in and to use
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 159.99 171.02 <o,f0,male> back in haiti people were increasingly turning to the medium of sms people that were hungry and hurting were signaling their distress were signaling their need for help
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 171.02 190.3 <o,f0,male> on street sides all over port au prince entrepreneurs sprung up offering mobile phone charging stations they understood more than we did people 's innate need to be connected never having been confronted with this type of situation before
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 190.32 209.5 <o,f0,male> we wanted to try and understand how we could tap into this incredible resource how we could really leverage this incredible use of mobile technology and sms technology we started talking with a local telecom provider called voila which is a subsidiary of trilogy international
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 209.5 228.14 <o,f0,male> we had basically three requirements we wanted to communicate in a two way form of communication we didn 't want to shout we needed to listen as well we wanted to be able to target specific geographic communities we didn 't need to talk to the whole country at the same time and we wanted it to be easy to use
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 228.14 236.45 <o,f0,male> out of this rubble of haiti and from this devastation came something that we call tera the trilogy emergency response application
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 236.45 240.3 <o,f0,male> which has been used to support the aid effort ever since
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 240.3 260.04 <o,f0,male> it has been used to help communities prepare for disasters it has been used to signal early warning in advance of weather related disasters it 's used for public health awareness campaigns such as the prevention of cholera and it is even used for sensitive issues such as building awareness around gender based violence
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 260.04 261.86 <o,f0,male> but does it work
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 262.08 273.33 <o,f0,male> we have just published an evaluation of this program and the evidence that is there for all to see is quite remarkable
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 273.65 287.29 <o,f0,male> some seventy four percent of people received the data those who were intended to receive the data seventy four percent of them received it ninety six percent of them found it useful
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 287.29 292.1 <o,f0,male> eighty three percent of them took action evidence that it is indeed empowering
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 292.24 295.74 <o,f0,male> and seventy three percent of them shared
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 307.74 320.79 <o,f0,male> technology is transformational right across the developing world citizens and communities are using technology to enable them to bring about change positive change in their own communities
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 320.79 331.9 <o,f0,male> the grassroots has been strengthened through the social power of sharing and they are challenging the old models the old analog models of control and command
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 331.92 348.91 <o,f0,male> one illustration of the transformational power of technology is in kibera kibera is one of africa 's largest slums it 's on the outskirts of nairobi the capital city of kenya it 's home to an unknown number of people some say between two hundred and fifty thousand and one point two million
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 348.91 358.75 <o,f0,male> if you were to arrive in nairobi today and pick up a tourist map kibera is represented as a lush green national park devoid of human settlement
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 358.75 362.66 <o,f0,male> young people living in kibera in their community
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 362.66 375.81 <o,f0,male> with simple handheld devices gps handheld devices and sms enabled mobile phones have literally put themselves on the map they have collated crowd sourced data and rendered the invisible visible
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 375.81 386.54 <o,f0,male> people like josh and steve are continuing to layer information upon information real time information tweet it and text it onto these maps for all to use
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 386.54 400 <o,f0,male> you can find out about the latest impromptu music session you can find out about the latest security incident you can find out about places of worship you can find out about the health centers you can feel the dynamism of this living breathing community
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 400 405.3 <o,f0,male> they also have their own news network on youtube with thirty six thousand viewers at the moment
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 405.3 421.13 <o,f0,male> they 're showing us what can be done with mobile digital technologies they 're showing that the magic of technology can bring the invisible visible and they are giving a voice to themselves they are telling their own story bypassing the official narrative
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 421.13 433.8 <o,f0,male> and we 're seeing from all points on the globe similar stories in mongolia for instance where thirty percent of the people are nomadic sms information systems are being used to track migration and weather patterns
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 433.8 450.43 <o,f0,male> sms is even used to hold herder summits from remote participation and if people are migrating into urban unfamiliar concrete environments they can also be helped in anticipation with social supporters ready and waiting for them based on sms knowledge
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 450.43 464.32 <o,f0,male> in nigeria open source sms tools are being used by the red cross community workers to gather information from the local community in an attempt to better understand and mitigate
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 485.25 501.24 <o,f0,male> we are on a planet of seven billion people five billion mobile subscriptions by two thousand and fifteen there will be three billion smartphones in the world the u n broadband
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 501.24 508.05 <o,f0,male> commission has recently set targets to help broadband access in fifty percent of the developing world
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 508.05 524.8 <o,f0,male> compared to twenty percent today we are hurtling towards a hyper connected world where citizens from all cultures and all social strata will have access to smart fast mobile devices people are understanding from cairo to oakland
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 531.47 539.07 <o,f0,male> a transformation is coming which needs to be understood by the humanitarian structures and humanitarian models
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 539.07 551.68 <o,f0,male> the collective voices of people needs to be more integrated through new technologies into the organizational strategies and plans of actions and not just recycled for fundraising or marketing we need to for example embrace
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 551.68 560.58 <o,f0,male> the big data the knowledge that is there from market leaders who understand what it means to use and leverage big data
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 560.58 566 <o,f0,male> one idea that i 'd like you to consider for instance is to take a look at our it departments
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 566 572.97 <o,f0,male> they 're normally backroom or basement hardware service providers but they need to be elevated to software strategists
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 572.97 591.3 <o,f0,male> we need people in our organizations who know what it 's like to work with big data we need technology as a core organizational principle we need technological strategists in the boardroom who can ask and answer the question what would amazon or google do with all of this data and convert it to humanitarian good
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 606.74 615.96 <o,f0,male> but i think in the future humanitarian organizations will also have to anticipate the right for people to access critical communication technologies
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 615.96 624.54 <o,f0,male> in order to ensure that their voices are heard that they 're truly participating that they 're truly empowered in the humanitarian world
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 624.54 633.84 <o,f0,male> it has always been the elusive ideal to ensure full participation of people affected by disasters in the humanitarian effort
PaulConneally_2011X 1 PaulConneally_2011X 633.84 647.42 <o,f0,male> we now have the tools we now have the possibilities there are no more reasons not to do it i believe we need to bring the humanitarian world from analog to digital thank you very much
