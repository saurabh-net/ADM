EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 16.43 19.56 <o,f0,female> i want to take you on a trip to an alien world
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 20 22.61 <o,f0,female> and it 's not a trip that requires
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 23.28 29.84 <o,f0,female> light years of travel but it 's to a place where it 's defined by light
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 30.49 32.68 <o,f0,female> so it 's a little appreciated
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 33.45 39.42 <o,f0,female> that most of the animals in our ocean make light
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 39.74 44.67 <o,f0,female> i 've spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 44.78 57.05 <o,f0,female> i study it because i think understanding it is critical to understanding life in the ocean where most bioluminescence occurs i also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 57.05 76.56 <o,f0,female> but mostly i 'm entranced by it since my my first dive in a deep diving submersible when i went down and turned out the lights and saw the fireworks displays i 've been a bioluminescence junky but i would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 76.94 79.49 <o,f0,female> and they were totally inadequate to the task
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 79.7 89.12 <o,f0,female> i needed some way to share the experience directly and the first time i figured out that way was in this little single person submersible called deep rover
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 89.32 94.02 <o,f0,female> this next video clip you 're going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 94.08 99.15 <o,f0,female> and the first thing you 're going to see is a transect screen that is about a meter across
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 158.87 162.06 <o,f0,female> if we could have the lights down and have it as dark in here as possible
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 201.03 202.61 <o,f0,female> so
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 202.61 212.32 <o,f0,female> that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate a single celled alga so why would a single celled alga need to be able to produce light
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 217.96 231.36 <o,f0,female> it 's what 's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and just like the alarm on your car or your house it 's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder thereby either leading to his capture or scaring him away
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 273.05 275.08 <o,f0,female> attention it 's phenomenal
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 281.92 284.49 <o,f0,female> there 's other ways you can defend yourself with light
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 284.88 286.66 <o,f0,female> for example this shrimp
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 286.87 295.29 <o,f0,female> releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud this blinds or distracts the predator
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 295.72 300.23 <o,f0,female> this little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 300.66 303.21 <o,f0,female> now it may look like a tasty morsel
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 303.48 305.49 <o,f0,female> or a pig 's head with wings
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 330.66 347.84 <o,f0,female> so there 's a lot of animals in the open ocean most of them that make light and we have a pretty good idea for most of them why they use it for finding food for attracting mates for defending against predators but when you get down to the bottom of the ocean that 's where things get really strange and some of these animals
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 372.09 389.7 <o,f0,female> so if you brush up against it any place you brushed against it you get this twinkling blue green light that 's just breathtaking and you see things like this this looks like something out of a dr seuss book just all manner of creatures all over this thing
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 389.7 404.56 <o,f0,female> and these are flytrap anemones now if you poke it it pulls in its tentacles but if you keep poking it it starts to produce light and it actually ends up looking like a galaxy
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 405.38 410.18 <o,f0,female> it produces these strings of light presumably as some form of defense
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 411.1 418.62 <o,f0,female> there are starfish that can make light and there are brittle stars that produce bands of light that dance along their arms
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 428.24 446.86 <o,f0,female> so it can actually hold itself in very strong currents as you see here but if we collect it very gently and we bring it up into the lab and just squeeze it at the base of the stock it produces this light that propagates from stem to the plume changing color as it goes from
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 517.05 527.64 <o,f0,female> so i just want to show you some of the responses we 've elicited from animals in the deep sea so the camera 's black and white it 's not high resolution and what you 're seeing
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 527.64 542.29 <o,f0,female> here is a bait box with a bunch of like the cockroaches of the ocean there are isopods all over it and right in the front is the electronic jellyfish and when it starts flashing it 's just going to be one of the leds that 's flashing very fast
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 542.29 551.76 <o,f0,female> but as soon as it starts to flash and it 's going to look big because it blooms on the camera i want you to look right here there 's something small there that responds
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 551.76 559.81 <o,f0,female> we 're talking to something it looks like a little of string pearls basically in fact three strings of pearls
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 584.83 599.23 <o,f0,female> and then finally i want to show you some responses that we recorded with the world 's first deep sea webcam which we had installed in monterey canyon last year we 've only just begun to analyze all of this data this is going to be a glowing source first
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 599.23 609.36 <o,f0,female> which is like bioluminescent bacteria and it is an optical cue that there 's carrion on the bottom of the ocean so this scavenger comes in
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 609.36 623.73 <o,f0,female> which is a giant sixgill shark and i can 't claim for sure that the optical source brought it in because there 's bait right there but if it had been following the odor plume it would have come in from the other direction and it does actually seem to be trying to eat
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 635.33 638.59 <o,f0,female> and this is a burglar alarm
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 657.76 662.75 <o,f0,female> hey wait a minute there 's supposed to be something else there
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 669.67 678.81 <o,f0,female> and then he goes away for a few seconds to think about it some more and thinks maybe if i come in from a different angle
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 704.18 710.6 <o,f0,female> more than ninety percent ninety nine percent of the living space on our planet is ocean
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 712.52 714.26 <o,f0,female> it 's a magical place
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 714.87 719.02 <o,f0,female> filled with breathtaking light shows
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 724.04 727.48 <o,f0,female> and wondrous creatures
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 727.66 732.25 <o,f0,female> alien life forms that you don 't have to travel to another planet to see
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 732.93 734.87 <o,f0,female> but if you do take the plunge
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 735.52 737.75 <o,f0,female> please remember to turn out the lights
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 737.83 739.61 <o,f0,female> but i warn you
