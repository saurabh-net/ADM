PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 31.23 40.37 <o,f0,female> i had an amazing mom who was just fiercely independent she worked at the local high school as a secretary in the dean 's office so she got to
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 49.03 54.53 <o,f0,female> so see kids like us we have a lot of things to deal with outside of school and
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 69.44 74 <o,f0,female> really do you think that doing my homework that night was at the top of my priority list
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 90.51 96.75 <o,f0,female> i needed teachers in the classroom every day who were going to say you can move beyond that
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 165.89 181.54 <o,f0,female> and then i told them i want to be a teacher and boy they were like what why why would you want to do that so i began my teaching career at the exact same middle school that i attended and
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 181.78 194.91 <o,f0,female> i really wanted to try to save more kids who were just like me and so every year i share my background with my kids because they need to know that everyone has a story everyone has a struggle
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 195.03 199.67 <o,f0,female> and everyone needs help along the way and i
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 204.91 206.91 <o,f0,female> i created
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 207.25 209.48 <o,f0,female> opportunity
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 209.48 214.26 <o,f0,female> i had a kid one day come into my class having been stabbed the night before
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 222.61 234.4 <o,f0,female> i need to be in class because i need to graduate so he knew that i was not going to let him be a victim of his circumstance but we were going to push forward and keep moving on
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 251.82 257.81 <o,f0,female> and teachers turning over year after year after year how do you get to build those relationships
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 258.86 261.89 <o,f0,female> so we created a new school
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 262.75 268.21 <o,f0,female> and we created the san fernando institute for applied media
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 268.27 270.57 <o,f0,female> we made sure that we were still
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 270.88 274.46 <o,f0,female> attached to our school district for funding for support
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 274.57 278.13 <o,f0,female> but with that we were going to gain freedom
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 278.53 284.72 <o,f0,female> freedom to hire the teachers that we knew were going to be effective freedom
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 284.9 294.68 <o,f0,female> to control the curriculum so that we 're not doing lesson one point two on page five no and freedom to control a budget
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 294.79 301.34 <o,f0,female> to spend money where it matters not how a district or a state says you have to do it
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 301.43 306.36 <o,f0,female> we wanted those freedoms but now shifting an entire paradigm
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 310.68 323.74 <o,f0,female> but we had to do it our community deserved a new way of doing things and as the very first pilot middle school in all of los angeles unified school district
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 324.23 326.92 <o,f0,female> you better believe there was some opposition
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 327.31 331.85 <o,f0,female> and it was out of fear fear of well what if they get it wrong
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 358.28 361.28 <o,f0,female> so in our third year how did we do it
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 367.72 371.78 <o,f0,female> we make our curriculum rigorous and relevant to them
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 371.78 389.85 <o,f0,female> and they use all the technology that they 're used to laptops computers tablets you name it they have it animation software moviemaking software they have it all and because we connect it to what they 're doing for example they made public service announcements for the cancer society
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 389.85 394.54 <o,f0,female> these were played in the local trolley system teaching elements of persuasion
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 425.09 428.58 <o,f0,female> and it takes an active parent center who
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 428.58 434.47 <o,f0,female> not only there showing a presence every day but who is part of our governance
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 434.47 439.02 <o,f0,female> making decisions for their kids our kids
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 440.3 445.15 <o,f0,female> because why should our students have to go so far away from where they live
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 445.56 456 <o,f0,female> they deserve a quality school in their neighborhood a school that they can be proud to say they attend and a school that the community can be proud of as well
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 456.51 459.13 <o,f0,female> and they need teachers to fight for them
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 459.13 468.35 <o,f0,female> every day and empower them to move beyond their circumstances because it 's time that kids like me
PearlArredondo_2013S 1 PearlArredondo_2013S 468.51 470.42 <o,f0,female> stop being the exception
