SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 17.12 24.13 <o,f0,male> i moved to america twelve years ago with my wife terry and our two kids actually truthfully we moved to los angeles
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 32.59 34.59 <o,f0,male> it 's a short plane ride from
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 45.7 47.97 <o,f0,male> americans don 't get irony
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 48.79 52.23 <o,f0,male> have you come across this idea
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 52.92 58.93 <o,f0,male> it 's not true i 've traveled the whole length and breadth of this country i have found no evidence that americans don 't get irony
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 59.37 61.65 <o,f0,male> it 's one of those cultural myths
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 62.12 64.35 <o,f0,male> like the british are reserved
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 66.15 68.09 <o,f0,male> i don 't know why people think this
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 88.89 95.52 <o,f0,male> but i knew that americans get irony when i came across that legislation no child left behind
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 95.94 100.85 <o,f0,male> because whoever thought of that title gets irony
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 110.06 116.11 <o,f0,male> it 's leaving millions of children behind now i can see that 's not a very attractive name for legislation
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 116.51 118.96 <o,f0,male> millions of children left behind i can see
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 128.29 132.85 <o,f0,male> in some parts of the country sixty percent of kids drop out of high school
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 133.5 136.23 <o,f0,male> in the native american communities it 's eighty percent
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 140.3 142.66 <o,f0,male> one estimate is it would
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 142.76 147.37 <o,f0,male> create a net gain to the u s economy over ten years
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 147.4 150.2 <o,f0,male> of nearly a trillion dollars
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 151.12 154.37 <o,f0,male> from an economic point of view this is good math isn 't
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 154.5 160.31 <o,f0,male> that we should do this it actually costs an enormous amount to mop up the damage from
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 160.41 168.56 <o,f0,male> the dropout crisis but the dropout crisis is just the tip of an iceberg what it doesn 't count are all the kids who are in school
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 168.58 170.36 <o,f0,male> but being disengaged from it
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 170.75 182.02 <o,f0,male> who don 't enjoy it who don 't get any real benefit from it and the reason is not that we 're not spending enough money america spends more money on education than most other countries
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 182.05 185.34 <o,f0,male> class sizes are smaller than in many countries
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 185.54 189.46 <o,f0,male> and there are hundreds of initiatives every year to try and improve education
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 190.16 191.67 <o,f0,male> the trouble is
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 191.73 193.66 <o,f0,male> it 's all going in the wrong direction
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 194.51 199.02 <o,f0,male> there are three principles on which human life flourishes
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 199.19 201.02 <o,f0,male> and they are contradicted
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 201.16 204.92 <o,f0,male> by the culture of education under which most teachers
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 204.97 208.24 <o,f0,male> have to labor and most students have to endure
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 209.14 213.73 <o,f0,male> the first is this that human beings are naturally
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 213.78 215.65 <o,f0,male> different and diverse
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 241.31 246.04 <o,f0,male> i bet you they are completely different from each other
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 249.72 251.6 <o,f0,male> you would never confuse them would you
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 264.82 267.22 <o,f0,male> is based on not diversity
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 276.67 279.24 <o,f0,male> one of the effects of no child left behind
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 279.25 284.48 <o,f0,male> has been to narrow the focus onto the so called stem disciplines they 're very important
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 284.58 287.92 <o,f0,male> i 'm not here to argue against science and math on the contrary
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 290.97 298.35 <o,f0,male> a real education has to give equal weight to the arts the humanities to physical education an awful lot of kids
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 304.69 318.13 <o,f0,male> estimate in america currently is that something like ten percent of kids getting on that way are being diagnosed with various conditions under the broad title of attention deficit disorder
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 322.47 324.31 <o,f0,male> i just don 't believe it 's an epidemic
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 324.6 330.11 <o,f0,male> like this if you sit kids down hour after hour doing low grade clerical work
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 331.14 334.4 <o,f0,male> don 't be surprised if they start to fidget
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 342.09 348.21 <o,f0,male> children are not for the most part suffering from a psychological condition they 're suffering from childhood
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 389.86 401.18 <o,f0,male> they will learn without any further assistance very often children are natural learners it 's a real achievement to put that particular ability out or to stifle it
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 401.51 415.96 <o,f0,male> curiosity is the engine of achievement now the reason i say this is because one of the effects of the current culture here if i can say so has been to de professionalize teachers
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 416.28 418.75 <o,f0,male> there is no system in the world
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 424.86 432.21 <o,f0,male> teachers are the lifeblood of the success of schools but teaching is a creative profession
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 432.6 435.51 <o,f0,male> teaching properly conceived is not a delivery system
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 435.98 440.46 <o,f0,male> you know you 're not there just to pass on received information great teachers do that
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 441.28 450.11 <o,f0,male> but what great teachers also do is mentor stimulate provoke engage you see in the end education is about learning
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 473.72 478.65 <o,f0,male> but a wonderful guy he was wonderful
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 485.63 490.13 <o,f0,male> you know you can be engaged in the activity of something but not really be achieving it like
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 503.76 505.5 <o,f0,male> but if nobody 's learning anything
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 505.55 508.67 <o,f0,male> she may be engaged in the task of teaching but not actually
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 512.61 523.08 <o,f0,male> learning that 's it and part of the problem is i think that the dominant culture of education has come to focus on not teaching and learning but testing
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 523.67 527.38 <o,f0,male> now testing is important standardized tests have a place
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 527.61 531.9 <o,f0,male> but they should not be the dominant culture of education they should be diagnostic
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 540.33 542.23 <o,f0,male> if i go for a medical examination
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 542.53 545.9 <o,f0,male> i want some standardized tests i do
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 546 549.37 <o,f0,male> you know i want to know what my cholesterol level is compared to everybody else 's
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 549.45 553.81 <o,f0,male> on a standard scale i don 't want to be told on some scale my doctor invented in the
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 556.06 558.95 <o,f0,male> your cholesterol is what i call level orange
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 564.57 566.54 <o,f0,male> but all that should support
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 569.33 575.39 <o,f0,male> which of course it often does so in place of curiosity what we have is a culture of compliance
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 589.89 592.26 <o,f0,male> it 's why we all have different resumes
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 592.27 611.3 <o,f0,male> we create our lives and we can recreate them as we go through them it 's the common currency of being a human being it 's why human culture is so interesting and diverse and dynamic i mean other animals may well have imaginations and creativity but it 's not so much in evidence is it as ours i mean you may have a dog
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 622.03 624.72 <o,f0,male> sit staring out the window with a bottle of jack daniels
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 653.93 658.1 <o,f0,male> now it doesn 't have to be that way it really doesn 't
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 672.54 675.02 <o,f0,male> the thing about work in finland is this
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 675.89 684.03 <o,f0,male> they don 't obsess about those disciplines they have a very broad approach to education which includes humanities physical education the arts
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 729.03 732.23 <o,f0,male> but you can compare it to a state in america
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 732.61 736.23 <o,f0,male> many states in america have fewer people in them than that
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 750.76 754.33 <o,f0,male> but what all the high performing systems in the world do
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 754.67 757.75 <o,f0,male> is currently what is not evident
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 757.91 760.7 <o,f0,male> sadly across the systems in america
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 763.94 771.14 <o,f0,male> they individualize teaching and learning they recognize that it 's students who are learning
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 771.32 778.75 <o,f0,male> and the system has to engage them their curiosity their individuality and their creativity that 's how you get them to learn
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 779.34 784.88 <o,f0,male> the second is that they attribute a very high status to the teaching
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 813.62 816.62 <o,f0,male> to the school level for getting the job done
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 816.89 818.94 <o,f0,male> you see there 's a big difference here
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 819.08 832.58 <o,f0,male> between going into a mode of command and control in education that 's what happens in some systems you know central governments decide or state governments decide they know best and they 're going to tell you what to do the trouble is that
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 832.76 846.41 <o,f0,male> education doesn 't go on in the committee rooms of our legislative buildings it happens in classrooms and schools and the people who do it are the teachers and the students and if you remove their discretion it stops working
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 857.27 866.8 <o,f0,male> but i have to say it 's happening in spite of the dominant culture of education not because of it it 's like people are sailing into a headwind all the time
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 874.92 876.45 <o,f0,male> of education it 's like
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 876.59 879.41 <o,f0,male> education is an industrial process
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 879.43 891.79 <o,f0,male> that can be improved just by having better data and somewhere in i think the back of the mind of some policy makers is this idea that if we fine tune it well enough if we just get it right it will all hum along perfectly into the future
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 892.1 894.46 <o,f0,male> it won 't and it never did
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 895.68 897.88 <o,f0,male> the point is that education
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 898.12 901.63 <o,f0,male> is not a mechanical system it 's a human system
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 925.92 934.04 <o,f0,male> i was at a meeting recently in los angeles of they 're called alternative education programs these are programs designed to get kids back into education
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 934.18 936.17 <o,f0,male> they have certain common features
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 936.27 937.98 <o,f0,male> they 're very personalized
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 938.36 941.68 <o,f0,male> they have strong support for the teachers
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 941.88 950.37 <o,f0,male> close links with the community and a broad and diverse curriculum and often programs which involve students outside school as well as inside school
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 974.18 982.68 <o,f0,male> so i think we have to embrace a different metaphor we have to recognize that it 's a human system and there are conditions under which people thrive
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 982.88 988.5 <o,f0,male> and conditions under which they don 't we are after all organic creatures
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 995.29 998.6 <o,f0,male> not far from where i live is a place called death valley
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 1003.14 1007.19 <o,f0,male> driest place in america and nothing grows there
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 1007.97 1009.89 <o,f0,male> nothing grows there because it doesn 't rain
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 1031.4 1033.28 <o,f0,male> was carpeted in flowers
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 1046.91 1050.18 <o,f0,male> waiting for the right conditions to come about
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 1050.34 1053.8 <o,f0,male> and with organic systems if the conditions are right
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 1074.12 1077.45 <o,f0,male> and schools that were once bereft spring to life
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 1077.51 1079.05 <o,f0,male> great leaders know that
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 1079.52 1085.55 <o,f0,male> the real role of leadership in education and i think it 's true at the national level the state level at the school level
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 1090.16 1093.81 <o,f0,male> the real role of leadership is climate control
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 1094.32 1096.58 <o,f0,male> creating a climate of possibility
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 1096.61 1104.02 <o,f0,male> and if you do that people will rise to it and achieve things that you completely did not anticipate and couldn 't have expected
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 1104.27 1108.79 <o,f0,male> there 's a wonderful quote from benjamin franklin there are three sorts of people in the world
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 1109.31 1111.55 <o,f0,male> those who are immovable
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 1111.9 1116.74 <o,f0,male> people who don 't get they don 't want to get it they 're going to do anything about it there are people who are movable
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 1129.2 1130.9 <o,f0,male> and if the movement is strong enough
SirKenRobinson_2013S 1 SirKenRobinson_2013S 1131.44 1134.05 <o,f0,male> that 's in the best sense of the word a revolution
