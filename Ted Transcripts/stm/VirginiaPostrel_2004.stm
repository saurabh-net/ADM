VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 19.07 27.38 <o,f0,female> and one answer to that is because i'm here to talk about glamour so we all think we know what glamour is here it is it's glamorous movie stars

VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 105.39 118.31 <o,f0,female> space and not the alien style glamour but the nice clean early sixties version so what do we mean by glamour well one thing you can do if you want to know what glamour means is you can look in the dictionary
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 134.51 137.82 <o,f0,female> had a glamour it wasn't glamour as a quality you cast

VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 169.07 177.52 <o,f0,female> but still glamour is an illusion glamour is a magic spell and there's something dangerous about glamour throughout
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 178.10 189.55 <o,f0,female> most of history when the witches cast a magic spell on you that was not in your self interest it was to get you to act against your interest well of course in the twentieth century glamour came to have this different meaning associated with
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 200.84 206.43 <o,f0,female> with all due respect to hedy about whom we'll hear more later there's a lot more to it there was a

VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 248.01 257.61 <o,f0,female> and it involves a great deal of technique it's not glamour is not something you don't wake up in the morning glamorous i don't care who you are even nicole kidman doesn't wake up in the morning glamorous
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 257.93 271.60 <o,f0,female> there is a process of idealization glorification and dramatization and it's not just the case for people glamour doesn't have to be people architectural photography julius schulman who 's talked about transfiguration took this
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 281.55 290.69 <o,f0,female> this is alex ross 's comic book art which appears to be extremely realistic as part of his style is he gives you a kind of realism in his comic art
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 291.04 301.97 <o,f0,female> except that light doesn't work this way in the real world and when you stack people in rows the ones in the background look smaller than the ones in the foreground but not in the world of glamour
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 302.37 310.05 <o,f0,female> what glamour is all about i took this from a blurb in the table of contents of new york magazine which was telling us that glamour is back
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 310.42 319.16 <o,f0,female> glamour is all about transcending the everyday and i think that that's starting to get at what the core that combines all sorts of glamour is
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 336.04 338.11 <o,f0,female> not make you glamorous that only makes you beautiful
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 339.23 346.99 <o,f0,female> she is graceful she is mysterious and she is transcendent and those are the central qualities of glamour
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 347.40 355.76 <o,f0,female> you don't see her eyes they're looking downward she's not looking away from you exactly but you have to mentally imagine her world
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 356.01 364.23 <o,f0,female> she's encouraging you to contemplate this higher world to which she belongs where she can be completely tranquil holding the
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 368.87 377.70 <o,f0,female> not glamorous that's glamour that's michelangelo 's pieta where mary is the same age as jesus and they're both awfully happy
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 379.32 392.31 <o,f0,female> invites us to live in a different world it has to simultaneously be mysterious a little bit distant that's why often in these glamour shots the person is not looking at the audience it's why sunglasses are glamorous
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 392.82 393.43 <o,f0,female> also not
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 394.74 401.45 <o,f0,female> us that we can't identify with the person in some sense there has to be something like us so as i say in religious art
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 401.70 407.95 <o,f0,female> you know god is not glamorous god cannot be glamorous because god is omnipotent omniscient all these too far above us
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 415.62 418.12 <o,f0,female> earlier glamour does not have to be about people
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 419.64 428.99 <o,f0,female> this transcendent quality now what is it about superman aside from alex ross 's style which is very glamorous one thing about superman is he makes you believe that a man can fly
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 429.33 436.63 <o,f0,female> and glamour is all about transcending this world and getting to an idealized perfect place and
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 443.89 444.60 <o,f0,female> we have with them the
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 446.60 451.58 <o,f0,female> so you can do a glamorized picture of a car but you can't do a glamorized picture of traffic
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 459.09 466.33 <o,f0,female> you know the guy in front of you in the airplane who has this nasty little kid or the big cough the story is about
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 467.27 470.39 <o,f0,female> arriving or thinking about where you're arriving and this sense of
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 471.73 485.65 <o,f0,female> is one reason that we have glamour styling this sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorous because we associate it with movies of that period but because in it's streamlining it transports us
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 485.89 494.47 <o,f0,female> from the everyday the same thing arches are very glamorous arches with stained glass even more glamorous staircases that curve away from
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 503.71 511.14 <o,f0,female> but maybe that's because i went to princeton anyway skylines are super glamorous city streets not so glamorous you know when you get actually to
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 531.65 538.21 <o,f0,female> pull glamour off you need this renaissance quality of sprezzatura which is a term
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 539.27 547.29 <o,f0,female> by castiglione in his book the book of the courtier there's the not glamorous version of what it looks like today after a few centuries
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 547.73 561.05 <o,f0,female> and sprezzatura is the art that conceals art it makes things look effortless you don't think about how nicole kidman is maneuvering that dress she just looks completely natural and i remember reading after the
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 562.90 568.90 <o,f0,female> how angelina jolie would go home completely black and blue but of course they covered that with make up because
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 569.53 578.98 <o,f0,female> did all those same stunts but she doesn't get black and blue because she has sprezzatura to conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort and
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 591.13 601.72 <o,f0,female> life could be better i could join this i could be a perfect person i could join this perfect world we don't tell you all the grubby details now this was kindly lent to me by jeff bezos from last year
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 613.55 618.34 <o,f0,female> a catalog of modern beautiful objects for your home it looks like this
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 619.31 631.55 <o,f0,female> no cords look next time you get these catalogs in your mail you can usually figure out where they hid the cord but there's always this illusion that if you buy this lamp you will live in a world without cords
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 631.99 640.55 <o,f0,female> and the same thing is true of if you buy this laptop or you buy this computer and even in these wireless eras you don't get to live in the world without cords
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 641.27 650.97 <o,f0,female> have to have mystery and you have to have grace and there she is grace this is the most glamorous picture i think ever and part of the thing is that in rear window
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 660.83 674.31 <o,f0,female> is extremely glamorous because like sunglasses it conceals and reveals at the same time translucence is glamorous that's why all these people wear pearls it's why barware is glamorous glamour is translucent not
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 675.45 688.13 <o,f0,female> not opaque it invites us into the world but it doesn't give us a completely clear picture and i think if grace kelly is the most glamorous person maybe a spiral staircase with glass block
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 689.35 702.73 <o,f0,female> the most glamorous interior shot because a spiral staircase is incredibly glamorous it has that sense of going up and away and yet you never think about how you would really trip if you were particularly going down
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 716.35 719.09 <o,f0,female> ideals that cannot possibly be realized
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 719.80 732.18 <o,f0,female> in reality they have contradictions they uphold principles that are incommensurable with each other whatever it is and yet these ideals give meaning and purpose to our lives as cultures and as individuals and the way
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 732.78 740.48 <o,f0,female> that is we displace them we put them into a golden world an imagined world an age of heroes the world to
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 741.62 746.91 <o,f0,female> and in the life of an individual we often associate that with some object the white picket fence
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 766.90 774.49 <o,f0,female> perfect office again no cords and certainly no it doesn't look a thing like my office i mean there's no paper on the desk
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 799.26 808.71 <o,f0,female> your ideal and also what has been edited out is it something important so the matrix is a movie that is all about glamour i could do a whole talk on the matrix and glamour
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 815.42 822.63 <o,f0,female> and those long coats and of course they could walk up walls and do all these kinds of things that are impossible in the real world this is another margaret bourke white
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 823.34 832.45 <o,f0,female> this is from soviet union attractive i mean look how happy the people are and good looking too you know we're marching toward utopia
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 853.79 861.04 <o,f0,female> cleaning your floor this is from triumph of the will brilliant editing to cut together things there's a glamour shot national socialism is all about
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 861.85 871.89 <o,f0,female> it was a very aesthetic ideology it was all about cleaning up germany and the west and the world and ridding it of anything unglamorous so glamour can be dangerous i
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 872.55 881.62 <o,f0,female> a genuine appeal has a genuine value i'm not against glamour but there's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 891.66 894.77 <o,f0,female> the manipulation of it all and sort of admit that
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 902.21 911.38 <o,f0,female> she invented spread spectrum technology so she's even more glamorous if you know that she really wasn't stupid even though she thought she could look stupid david hockney talks about
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 911.67 922.47 <o,f0,female> how the appreciation of this i think very glamorous painting is heightened if you think about the fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash which only took a fraction of a second to happen
VirginiaPostrel_2004 1 VirginiaPostrel_2004 952.59 965.85 <o,f0,female> but i also knew how hard they worked all week sometimes under those hats there's a lot of joy and a lot of sorrow and actually you get more appreciation for glamour when you realize what went into creating it thank you
