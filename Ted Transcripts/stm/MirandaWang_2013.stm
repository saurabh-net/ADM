MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 64.81 70.43 <o,f0,female> matter and construction debris it 's truly impossible to pick them out and environmentally eliminate them
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 91.73 94.42 <o,f0,female> this picture you see here is the great pacific gyre
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 108.39 113.74 <o,f0,female> right now the ocean is actually a soup of plastic debris and there 's nowhere you
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 137.61 139.13 <o,f0,female> with bacteria
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 139.41 145.24 <o,f0,female> sounds cool right audience yeah jy thank you but we had a problem
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 197.28 202.6 <o,f0,female> containers cosmetics and even food wraps phthalates are horrible because
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 226.13 242.03 <o,f0,female> we read that each year the vancouver municipal government monitors phthalate concentration levels in rivers to assess their safety so we figured if there are places along our fraser river that are contaminated with phthalates and if there are bacteria that are able to live in these areas
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 292.02 297.32 <o,f0,female> everything went well from there and we became amazing scientists
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 317.14 329 <o,f0,female> but this mistake turned out to be rather serendipitous we noticed that the unharmed cultures came from places of opposite contamination levels so this mistake actually led us to think that
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 355.98 372.83 <o,f0,female> then we monitored phthalate utilization and bacterial growth and found that they shared an inverse correlation so as bacterial populations increased phthalate concentrations decreased this means that our bacteria were actually living off of phthalates mw so now
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 430.24 445.82 <o,f0,female> i know some of you in the crowd are thinking well carbon dioxide is horrible it 's a greenhouse gas but if our bacteria did not evolve to break down phthalates they would have used some other kind of carbon source and aerobic respiration would have led it to have end products such as carbon dioxide anyway
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 446.22 462.02 <o,f0,female> we were also interested to see that although we 've obtained greater diversity of bacteria biodegraders from the bird habitat site we obtained the most efficient degraders from the landfill site so this fully shows that nature evolves through natural selection
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 480.43 492.86 <o,f0,female> we have not only shown that bacteria can be the solution to plastic pollution but also that being open to uncertain outcomes and taking risks create opportunities for unexpected discoveries
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 511.24 523.33 <o,f0,female> we can apply this to wastewater treatment plants to clean up our rivers and other natural resources and perhaps one day we 'll be able to tackle the problem of solid plastic waste
