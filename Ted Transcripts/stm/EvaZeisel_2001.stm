EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 161.22 162.60 <o,f0,female> of things
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 178.79 179.42 <o,f0,female> of
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 186.53 196.45 <o,f0,female> i believe is called innovation innovation is not part of the aim of my
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 204.43 206.74 <o,f0,female> of things they make things
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 212.47 219.36 <o,f0,female> the craftsmen do i have so much to say i have to think what i am going to say
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 231.65 239.90 <o,f0,female> that means the playful search for beauty was called the first activity of man
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 242.21 253.16 <o,f0,female> was a mathematics professor at mit wrote the playful search for beauty was man 's first activity
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 253.91 260.99 <o,f0,female> that all useful qualities and all material qualities were developed from
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 261.89 265.59 <o,f0,female> playful search for beauty these
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 277.95 281.17 <o,f0,female> that we have to
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 289.95 299.41 <o,f0,female> and this for me is now seventy five years so how can you without drying up make things with
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 300.91 310.26 <o,f0,female> as a gift to others for so long the playful is therefore an important part
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 310.90 314.09 <o,f0,female> of our quality as
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 320.54 320.98 <o,f0,female> some
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 326.57 329.30 <o,f0,female> i started to do these things
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 350.15 351.71 <o,f0,female> pieces as part of the
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 361.92 367.17 <o,f0,female> actually took me through many
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 368.45 375.62 <o,f0,female> and showed me a great part of the world this is not that they took me the work didn't take me
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 376.17 388.68 <o,f0,female> i made the things particularly because i wanted to use them to see the world i was incredibly curious to see the world and i made all these things
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 393.60 400.05 <o,f0,female> me to see many countries and many cultures i started
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 402.05 411.19 <o,f0,female> as an apprentice to a hungarian craftsman and this taught me
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 415.14 427.11 <o,f0,female> was in middle ages the guild system that means when i was an apprentice i had to apprentice myself in order to become
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 431.35 434.19 <o,f0,female> in my shop where i studied
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 443.52 448.87 <o,f0,female> and learned worker and apprentice and
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 455.65 459.76 <o,f0,female> the work as an apprentice
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 476.05 480.28 <o,f0,female> feet when it came from the
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 485.49 495.90 <o,f0,female> that it had to be kneaded it had to then go in kind of a mangle and then finally it was prepared for the throwing and
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 500.76 505.93 <o,f0,female> as an apprentice my master took me
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 506.04 514.96 <o,f0,female> to set ovens because this was part of oven making oven setting in the
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 515.91 523.30 <o,f0,female> and finally i had received a document that i had accomplished
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 536.73 543.83 <o,f0,female> roof coverers rail diggers oven setters chimney sweeps and
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 548.06 558.65 <o,f0,female> also got at the time a workbook which explained my rights and my working conditions and i still have that
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 559.96 564.66 <o,f0,female> first i set up a shop in my own garden and
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 571.08 580.78 <o,f0,female> and there i was sitting and my then boyfriend i didn't mean it was a boyfriend like it is meant
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 583.52 591.93 <o,f0,female> and i sat at the market and sold the pots my mother thought that this was not very proper so she sat with us to
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 601.63 607.64 <o,f0,female> however after a while there was a new factory being built in budapest a
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 611.03 621.64 <o,f0,female> and i visited it with several ladies and asked all sorts of questions of the director then the director asked me why do you ask all these questions
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 622.47 632.18 <o,f0,female> a pottery so he asked me could he please visit me and then finally he did and explained to me that
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 632.99 641.51 <o,f0,female> did now in my shop was an anachronism that the industrial revolution had broken out and that i rather should join
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 641.76 649.53 <o,f0,female> the factory there he made an art department for me where i worked for several months however
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 666.04 671.44 <o,f0,female> producing my designs now in molds and this was sold also to
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 675.41 678.38 <o,f0,female> that it was quite successful however
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 682.73 692.36 <o,f0,female> model maker everybody concerned himself much more with the art department that means with my work than making toilets so
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 696.05 705.03 <o,f0,female> the center from the bank who owned the factory saying make toilet setting behind the art department and that
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 706.55 714.47 <o,f0,female> so this gave me the possibility because now i was a journeyman and journeymen also take their satchel and
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 715.35 723.95 <o,f0,female> to see the world so as a journeyman i put an ad into the paper that i had studied that i was a down to
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 726.04 732.42 <o,f0,female> journeyman and i was looking for a job as a journeyman and i got several answers and
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 732.84 740.36 <o,f0,female> i accepted the one which was farthest from home and practically i thought halfway to america
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 740.65 744.85 <o,f0,female> and that was in hamburg then i first
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 751.19 760.54 <o,f0,female> everything was done on the wheel and so i worked in a shop where there were several
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 761.94 765.28 <o,f0,female> and the first day i was coming to
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 772.82 777.10 <o,f0,female> four turntables and one of them
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 778.97 789.42 <o,f0,female> behind where i was sitting was a hunchback a deaf mute hunchback who smelled very bad so i doused him
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 790.84 794.41 <o,f0,female> cologne every day which he thought was very nice and
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 802.75 804.12 <o,f0,female> the first day i came to
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 811.20 811.83 <o,f0,female> me
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 813.33 817.29 <o,f0,female> my colleagues had thoughtfully put
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 828.77 830.78 <o,f0,female> natural man 's
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 837.61 846.38 <o,f0,female> after i brushed them off with a hand motion they were very i finally was now accepted and
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 856.71 857.05 <o,f0,female> here
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 870.30 871.47 <o,f0,female> we have about five
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 891.89 897.95 <o,f0,female> actually my work took me to many countries because
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 900.07 909.03 <o,f0,female> to fill my curiosity and among other things other countries i worked was in the soviet union

EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 934.98 935.78 <o,f0,female> at the beginning of
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 956.64 960.61 <o,f0,female> the accusation was that i had successfully
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 963.42 964.46 <o,f0,female> 's life
EvaZeisel_2001 1 EvaZeisel_2001 970.97 981.58 <o,f0,female> and if this is the end of my five minutes i want to tell you that i actually did survive which was a surprise
