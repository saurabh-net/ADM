DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 17.01 20.62 <o,f0,male> so i work in marketing which i love but my first passion was physics
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 27.67 31.13 <o,f0,male> so he taught me that physics is cool
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 46.72 47.38 <o,f0,male> at school
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 48.26 55.99 <o,f0,male> okay lots of you so hopefully this will bring back some happy or possibly some slightly disturbing memories so physics and marketing
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 60.81 61.83 <o,f0,male> the force equals mass
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 63.34 66.28 <o,f0,male> this is something that perhaps turkish airlines should have studied a bit more
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 73.94 79.64 <o,f0,male> but if we rearrange this formula quickly we can get to acceleration equals force over mass
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 80.24 87.39 <o,f0,male> which means that for a larger particle a larger mass it requires more force to change it's direction
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 88.31 89.57 <o,f0,male> it's the same with brands
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 90.25 93.54 <o,f0,male> the more massive a brand the more baggage it has
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 94.04 95.87 <o,f0,male> the more force is needed to change its
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 165.69 168.98 <o,f0,male> knocks the particle so you don't know where it was before you looked at it
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 172.07 173.77 <o,f0,male> the act of measurement changes it
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 190.14 192.85 <o,f0,male> and yet mcdonald 's sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 193.88 202.69 <o,f0,male> think about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets who stuff their trolleys full of fresh green vegetables and fruit but don't shop like that any other day
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 217.54 229.80 <o,f0,male> the science no sorry the marketing is getting easier luckily with now better point of sale tracking more digital media consumption you can measure more what consumers actually do rather than what they say they do
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 230.34 238.45 <o,f0,male> so the physics is you can never accurately and exactly measure a particle because the observation changes it
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 238.73 246.29 <o,f0,male> the marketing is the message for marketing is that try to measure what consumers actually do rather than what they say
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 249.99 251.69 <o,f0,male> next the scientific method
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 274.11 284.76 <o,f0,male> had dozens of data points to support his theory that the planets would rotate around the earth it only took one robust observation from copernicus to blow that idea out of the water
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 297.23 302.26 <o,f0,male> they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 305.89 306.52 <o,f0,male> think about
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 307.58 311.41 <o,f0,male> it was for a long time revered as the most reliable of cars
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 311.87 313.76 <o,f0,male> and then they had the big recall incident
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 326.58 336.68 <o,f0,male> so the physics is that you cannot prove a hypothesis but it's easy to disprove it any hypothesis is shaky and the marketing is that not matter
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 337.32 345.68 <o,f0,male> how much you've invested in your brand one bad week can undermine decades of good work so be really careful to try and avoid the screw ups that can undermine your brand
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 358.89 360.14 <o,f0,male> the same is true of marketing
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 360.87 367.74 <o,f0,male> if we go back twenty years the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager could pretty much define a brand
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 368.85 373.55 <o,f0,male> where we are today things have changed you can get a strong brand image
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 380.42 382.11 <o,f0,male> but then you lose control of it
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 383.11 384.55 <o,f0,male> with the kind of digital
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 392.46 394.68 <o,f0,male> your brand starts being dispersed
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 400.52 401.57 <o,f0,male> it's out of your control
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 419.30 424.77 <o,f0,male> it makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force which is ultimately good for your brand
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 425.33 437.48 <o,f0,male> so the lesson from physics is that entropy will always increase it's a fundamental law the message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed you can't fight it so embrace it and find a way to work with it
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 438.29 443.81 <o,f0,male> so to close my teacher mister vutter told me that physics is cool
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 444.29 449.88 <o,f0,male> and hopefully i've convinced you that physics can teach all of us even in the world of marketing something special thank you
