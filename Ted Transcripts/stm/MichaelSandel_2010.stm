MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 17.50 30.22 <o,f0,male> one thing the world needs one thing this country desperately needs is a better way of conducting our political debates we need to rediscover the lost art of democratic argument
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 36.96 46.71 <o,f0,male> if you think about the arguments we have most of the time it's shouting matches on cable television ideological food fights on the floor of congress
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 48.15 57.79 <o,f0,male> i have a suggestion look at all the arguments we have these days over health care over bonuses and bailouts on wall street
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 58.88 69.14 <o,f0,male> over the gap between rich and poor over affirmative action and same sex marriage lying just beneath the surface of those arguments
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 70.16 74.32 <o,f0,male> passions raging on all sides are big questions
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 75.13 84.20 <o,f0,male> of moral philosophy big questions of justice but we too rarely articulate and defend
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 84.84 93.70 <o,f0,male> and argue about those big moral questions in our politics so what i would like to do today is have something of a discussion
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 95.07 102.28 <o,f0,male> first let me take a famous philosopher who wrote about those questions of justice and morality
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 102.63 109.62 <o,f0,male> give you a very short lecture on aristotle of ancient athens aristotle 's theory of justice
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 110.01 120.44 <o,f0,male> and then have a discussion here to see whether aristotle 's ideas actually inform the way we think and argue about questions today
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 121.40 122.78 <o,f0,male> so are you ready for the lecture
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 125.75 127.12 <o,f0,male> according to aristotle
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 127.90 131.00 <o,f0,male> justice means giving people what they deserve
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 133.45 135.96 <o,f0,male> that's it that's the lecture
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 148.49 154.61 <o,f0,male> take the example of flutes suppose we're distributing flutes who should get the best ones
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 162.42 163.46 <o,f0,male> you can just call it out
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 164.96 167.10 <o,f0,male> at random you would do it by lottery
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 167.95 170.95 <o,f0,male> or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 180.04 182.55 <o,f0,male> how many say the best flute players
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 186.49 189.60 <o,f0,male> why actually that was aristotle 's answer
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 192.53 194.89 <o,f0,male> a harder question why
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 195.53 201.67 <o,f0,male> do you think those of you who voted this way that the best flutes should go to the best flute players
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 212.78 213.49 <o,f0,male> all right
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 216.13 221.15 <o,f0,male> it's a good reason we'll all be better off if good music is played rather than terrible music
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 223.22 223.47 <o,f0,male> but
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 224.49 236.16 <o,f0,male> peter aristotle doesn't agree with you that that's the reason that's all right aristotle had a different reason for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players he said
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 237.43 239.10 <o,f0,male> that's what flutes are for
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 239.84 246.98 <o,f0,male> to be played well he says that to reason about just distribution of a thing
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 248.08 253.33 <o,f0,male> we have to reason about and sometimes argue about the purpose
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 253.45 256.52 <o,f0,male> of the thing or the social activity in this case musical
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 272.32 280.35 <o,f0,male> when we think about justice aristotle says what we really need to think about is the essential nature of the activity in question
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 282.15 295.53 <o,f0,male> the qualities that are worth honoring and admiring and recognizing one of the reasons that the best flute players should get the best flutes is that musical performance is not only to make the rest of us happy
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 296.23 306.80 <o,f0,male> but to honor and recognize the excellence of the best musicians now flutes may seem the distribution of flutes may seem
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 317.05 319.63 <o,f0,male> casey martin a few years ago casey martin
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 320.65 329.28 <o,f0,male> did any of you hear about him he was a very good golfer but he had a disability he had a bad leg a circulatory problem
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 329.73 337.27 <o,f0,male> that made it very painful for him to walk the course in fact it carried risk of injury
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 338.40 344.26 <o,f0,male> he asked the pga the professional golfers association for permission to use a golf cart
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 345.08 350.51 <o,f0,male> in the pga tournaments they said no now that would give you an unfair advantage
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 353.73 359.37 <o,f0,male> and his case went all the way to the supreme court believe it or not the case over the golf cart
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 360.73 365.97 <o,f0,male> because the law says that the disabled must be accommodated
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 368.75 370.51 <o,f0,male> the accommodation does not
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 371.27 375.32 <o,f0,male> change the essential nature of the activity
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 376.42 384.38 <o,f0,male> he says i 'm a great golfer i want to compete but i need a golf cart to get from one hole to the next suppose
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 385.15 391.45 <o,f0,male> you were on the supreme court suppose you were deciding the justice of this case
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 392.39 405.76 <o,f0,male> how many here would say that casey martin does have a right to use a golf cart and how many say no he doesn 't all right let 's take a poll show of hands how many would rule in favor of casey martin
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 408.20 416.20 <o,f0,male> and how many would not how many would say he doesn 't all right we have a good division of opinion here someone who would not
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 427.98 429.14 <o,f0,male> be an unfair advantage
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 430.35 432.37 <o,f0,male> if he gets to ride in a golf cart
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 433.13 440.68 <o,f0,male> those of you i imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart worry about an unfair advantage what about
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 441.10 447.11 <o,f0,male> those of you who say he should be given a golf cart how would you answer the objection yes
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 456.49 463.85 <o,f0,male> get charlie a microphone in case someone wants to reply tell us charlie why would you say he should be able to use a golf cart
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 485.07 492.95 <o,f0,male> who has an answer for charlie all right who has an answer for charlie what would you say the endurance element is a very important part of the game
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 519.90 520.16 <o,f0,male> not a
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 531.77 532.95 <o,f0,male> it's interesting
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 535.53 543.15 <o,f0,male> in the case in the lower court they brought in golfing greats to testify on this very issue
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 544.55 554.97 <o,f0,male> is walking the course essential to the game and they brought in jack nicklaus and arnold palmer and what do you suppose they all said yes they agreed with warren
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 555.57 568.71 <o,f0,male> they said yes walking the course is strenuous physical exercise the fatigue factor is an important part of golf and so it would change the fundamental nature of the game to give him the golf cart
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 569.72 572.38 <o,f0,male> now notice something interesting
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 573.04 576.79 <o,f0,male> well i should tell you about the supreme court first the supreme court
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 577.93 579.74 <o,f0,male> decided what do you suppose they said
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 583.77 586.61 <o,f0,male> that casey martin must be provided a golf cart
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 588.11 596.87 <o,f0,male> two they ruled what was interesting about their ruling and about the discussion we've just had
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 598.36 604.20 <o,f0,male> is that the discussion about the right the justice of the matter depended on
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 604.86 606.88 <o,f0,male> figuring out what is
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 607.44 609.46 <o,f0,male> the essential nature of golf
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 610.70 619.32 <o,f0,male> the supreme court justices wrestled with that question and justice stevens writing for the majority said he had read all about the history of golf
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 622.60 628.23 <o,f0,male> the essential point of the game is to get very small ball from one place into a hole
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 629.00 637.61 <o,f0,male> in as few strokes as possible and that walking was not essential but incidental now there were two dissenters one of whom was justice scalia
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 640.16 642.23 <o,f0,male> he wouldn't have granted the cart
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 643.21 650.42 <o,f0,male> and he had a very interesting dissent it's interesting because he rejected the aristotelian premise
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 662.53 668.89 <o,f0,male> to say that something is essential is ordinarily to say that it is necessary to the achievement of a certain object
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 669.72 674.82 <o,f0,male> but since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 679.35 682.86 <o,f0,male> that is what distinguishes games from productive activity
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 686.02 699.98 <o,f0,male> it is quite impossible to say that any of a game 's arbitrary rules is essential so there you have justice scalia taking on the aristotelian premise of the majority 's opinion
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 701.72 705.22 <o,f0,male> justice scalia 's opinion is questionable
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 706.40 708.05 <o,f0,male> for two reasons first
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 708.67 710.82 <o,f0,male> no real sports fan would talk that way
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 714.10 720.85 <o,f0,male> if we had thought that the rules of the sports we care about are merely arbitrary rather than designed
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 720.99 728.94 <o,f0,male> to call forth the virtues and the excellences that we think are worthy of admiring we wouldn't care about the outcome of the game
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 730.76 734.60 <o,f0,male> it's also objectionable on a second ground
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 736.19 742.81 <o,f0,male> on the face of it it seemed to be this debate about the golf cart an argument about fairness
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 743.90 745.57 <o,f0,male> what's an unfair advantage
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 747.31 754.64 <o,f0,male> but if fairness were the only thing at stake there would have been an easy and obvious solution what would it be
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 763.98 769.23 <o,f0,male> but letting everyone ride in a cart would have been i suspect more anathema
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 769.91 771.63 <o,f0,male> to the golfing greats
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 772.52 772.99 <o,f0,male> and to the
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 774.80 778.09 <o,f0,male> even than making an exception for casey martin why
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 778.88 782.60 <o,f0,male> because what was at stake in the dispute over the golf cart
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 800.09 808.96 <o,f0,male> let me put the point as delicately as possible golfers are a little sensitive about the athletic status of their game
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 816.25 821.31 <o,f0,male> after all there's no running or jumping and the ball stands still
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 824.31 833.10 <o,f0,male> so if golfing is the kind of game that can be played while riding around in a golf cart it would be hard to confer
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 833.29 841.77 <o,f0,male> on the golfing greats the status that we confer the honor and recognition that goes to truly great athletes
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 850.40 862.99 <o,f0,male> flutes it's hard to decide the question of what justice requires without grappling with the question what is the essential nature of the activity in question
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 865.17 872.97 <o,f0,male> what qualities what excellences connected with that activity are worthy of honor and recognition
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 874.39 881.06 <o,f0,male> let 's take a final example that's prominent in contemporary political debate same sex marriage
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 883.27 885.44 <o,f0,male> there are those who favor state recognition
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 887.16 890.20 <o,f0,male> only of traditional marriage between one man and one woman
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 891.17 899.79 <o,f0,male> and there are those who favor state recognition of same sex marriage how many here favor
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 904.19 906.84 <o,f0,male> and how many favor the second same sex marriage
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 911.90 925.96 <o,f0,male> what ways of thinking about justice and morality underlie the arguments we have over marriage the opponents of same sex marriage say that the purpose of marriage fundamentally is procreation
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 926.90 930.46 <o,f0,male> what's worthy of honoring and recognizing and encouraging
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 932.02 943.83 <o,f0,male> and the defenders of same sex marriage say no procreation is not the only purpose of marriage what about a lifelong mutual loving commitment that's really what marriage is about
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 944.93 953.27 <o,f0,male> so with flutes with golf carts and even with a fiercely contested question like same sex marriage
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 954.68 956.45 <o,f0,male> aristotle has a point
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 957.52 964.70 <o,f0,male> very hard to argue about justice without first arguing about the purpose of social institutions
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 966.04 978.34 <o,f0,male> about what qualities are worthy of honor and recognition so let 's step back from these cases and see how they shed light on the way we might
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 980.13 989.07 <o,f0,male> elevate the terms of political discourse in the united states and for that matter around the world there is a tendency to think
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 989.58 996.27 <o,f0,male> that if we engage too directly with moral questions in politics that's a recipe for disagreement
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 996.85 1007.77 <o,f0,male> and for that matter a recipe for intolerance and coercion so better to shy away from to ignore the moral and the religious convictions that people bring to civic life
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 1009.13 1015.29 <o,f0,male> it seems to me that our discussion reflects the opposite that a better way
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 1016.57 1020.48 <o,f0,male> to mutual respect is to engage directly
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 1020.86 1024.69 <o,f0,male> with the moral convictions citizens bring to public life
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 1025.45 1029.13 <o,f0,male> rather than to require that people leave their deepest
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 1029.29 1042.33 <o,f0,male> moral convictions outside politics before they enter that it seems to me is a way to begin to restore the art of democratic argument thank you very much
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 1065.94 1078.17 <o,f0,male> golf courses to same sex marriage that was a genius link now look you're a pioneer of open education your lecture series was one of the first to do it big what's your vision for the next phase of this
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 1078.81 1085.05 <o,f0,male> well i think that it is possible in the classroom we have arguments on some
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 1085.31 1096.80 <o,f0,male> of the most fiercely held moral convictions that students have about big public questions and i think we can do that in public life more generally and so my real dream would be to take
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 1097.21 1104.30 <o,f0,male> the public television series that we've created of the course it's available now online free for everyone anywhere in the world
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 1104.72 1113.34 <o,f0,male> and to see whether we can partner with institutions at universities in china in india in africa around the world to try to promote
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 1114.40 1118.21 <o,f0,male> civic education and also a richer kind of
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 1123.69 1130.80 <o,f0,male> at some point live in real time you could have this kind of conversation inviting questions but with people from china and india joining in
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 1144.87 1148.60 <o,f0,male> way of thinking and arguing engaging seriously with
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 1148.72 1155.90 <o,f0,male> big moral questions exploring cultural differences and connect through a live video hookup
MichaelSandel_2010 1 MichaelSandel_2010 1156.39 1163.73 <o,f0,male> students in beijing and mumbai and in cambridge massachusetts and create a global classroom that's what i would love to
