PaoloCardini_2012G 1 PaoloCardini_2012G 32.26 38.24 <o,f0,male> let 's consider for a while the option of monotasking
PaoloCardini_2012G 1 PaoloCardini_2012G 38.24 55.75 <o,f0,male> a couple of examples look at that this is my multitasking activity result laughter so trying to cook answering the phone writing sms and maybe uploading some pictures about this awesome barbecue
PaoloCardini_2012G 1 PaoloCardini_2012G 55.75 66.88 <o,f0,male> so someone tells us the story about supertaskers so this two percent of people who are able to control multitasking environment
PaoloCardini_2012G 1 PaoloCardini_2012G 66.88 80.86 <o,f0,male> but what about ourselves and what about our reality when 's the last time you really enjoyed just the voice of your friend so this is a project i 'm working on
PaoloCardini_2012G 1 PaoloCardini_2012G 100.67 116.65 <o,f0,male> another example have you ever been to venice how beautiful it is to lose ourselves in these little streets on the island but our multitasking reality is pretty different and full of tons of information
PaoloCardini_2012G 1 PaoloCardini_2012G 118.17 132.79 <o,f0,male> so what about something like that to rediscover our sense of adventure i know that it could sound pretty weird to speak about mono when the number of possibilities is so huge
PaoloCardini_2012G 1 PaoloCardini_2012G 132.79 144.25 <o,f0,male> but i push you to consider the option of focusing on just one task or maybe turning your digital senses totally off
PaoloCardini_2012G 1 PaoloCardini_2012G 152.34 160.09 <o,f0,male> why not so find your monotask spot within the multitasking world thank you
