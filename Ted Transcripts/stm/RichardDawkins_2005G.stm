RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 12.60 13.55 <o,f0,male> my title
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 14.10 23.47 <o,f0,male> queerer than we can suppose the strangeness of science queerer than we can suppose comes from j b s haldane the famous biologist who said
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 23.87 31.65 <o,f0,male> now my own suspicion is that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose but queerer than we can suppose
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 32.17 39.13 <o,f0,male> i suspect that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of or can be dreamed of in any philosophy
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 41.63 50.75 <o,f0,male> richard feynman compared the accuracy of quantum theories experimental predictions to specifying the width of north america
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 50.96 58.29 <o,f0,male> to within one hair 's breadth of accuracy this means that quantum theory has got to be in some sense true
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 59.08 67.28 <o,f0,male> yet the assumptions that quantum theory needs to make in order to deliver those predictions are so mysterious that even feynman himself
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 67.59 75.16 <o,f0,male> was moved to remark if you think you understand quantum theory you don't understand quantum theory
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 77.07 88.31 <o,f0,male> that physicists resort to one or another paradoxical interpretation of it david deutsch who 's talking here in the fabric of reality embraces the
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 88.53 96.34 <o,f0,male> many worlds interpretation of quantum theory because the worst that you can say about it is that it's preposterously wasteful
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 96.65 109.76 <o,f0,male> it postulates a vast and rapidly growing number of universes existing in parallel mutually undetectable except through the narrow porthole of quantum mechanical
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 110.21 113.51 <o,f0,female> experiments and that's richard
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 115.69 126.60 <o,f0,male> the biologist lewis wolpert believes that the queerness of modern physics is just an extreme example science as opposed to technology does violence to common sense
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 127.12 136.48 <o,f0,male> every time you drink a glass of water he points out the odds are that you will imbibe at least one molecule that passed through the bladder of oliver cromwell
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 138.68 140.51 <o,f0,female> just elementary probability theory
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 141.96 142.43 <o,f0,female> the number of
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 144.41 151.87 <o,f0,male> hugely greater than the number of glassfuls or bladdersful in the world and of course there's nothing special about cromwell or bladders
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 152.18 160.78 <o,f0,male> you have just breathed in a nitrogen atom that passed through the right lung of the third iguanodon to the left of the tall cycad tree
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 164.02 174.44 <o,f0,female> queerer than we can suppose what is it that makes us capable of supposing anything and does this tell us anything about what we can suppose
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 175.09 187.98 <o,f0,female> are there things about the universe that will be forever beyond our grasp but not beyond the grasp of some superior intelligence are there things about the universe that are in principle ungraspable
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 188.46 191.20 <o,f0,female> by any mind however superior
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 193.34 203.59 <o,f0,male> science has been one long series of violent brainstorms as successive generations have come to terms with increasing levels of queerness in the universe
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 205.23 213.66 <o,f0,male> used to the idea that the earth spins rather than the sun moves across the sky it's hard for us to realize what a shattering mental revolution that must
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 224.65 235.53 <o,f0,male> tell me he asked a friend why do people always say it was natural for man to assume that the sun went round the earth rather than that the earth was rotating
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 236.24 249.35 <o,f0,male> his friend replied well obviously because it just looks as though the sun is going round the earth wittgenstein replied well what would it have looked like if it had looked as though the earth was rotating
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 265.09 275.61 <o,f0,male> the familiar illustration is the nucleus of an atom is a fly in the middle of a sports stadium and the next atom is in the next sports stadium
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 276.20 282.73 <o,f0,male> so it would seem the hardest solidest densest rock is really almost entirely empty space
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 283.11 292.04 <o,f0,male> broken only by tiny particles so widely spaced they shouldn 't count why then do rocks look and feel solid and hard and impenetrable
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 293.52 305.92 <o,f0,male> as an evolutionary biologist i'd say this our brains have evolved to help us survive within the orders of magnitude of size and speed which our bodies operate at
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 306.49 314.03 <o,f0,male> we never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms if we had our brains probably would perceive rocks as full of empty space
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 314.35 321.01 <o,f0,male> rocks feel hard and impenetrable to our hands precisely because objects like rocks and hands
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 321.41 329.78 <o,f0,female> cannot penetrate each other it's therefore useful for our brains to construct notions like solidity
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 330.06 339.40 <o,f0,female> and impenetrability because such notions help us to navigate our bodies through the middle sized world in which we have to navigate
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 348.45 356.18 <o,f0,female> our brains would be much better at understanding einstein i want to give the name middle world to the medium
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 364.36 369.50 <o,f0,male> we are evolved denizens of middle world and that limits what we are capable of
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 379.48 387.59 <o,f0,male> hits another middle world object like a rock it knocks itself out may i introduce major general
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 395.98 406.11 <o,f0,male> he stared at his wall in arlington virginia and decided to do it as frightening as the prospect was he was going into the next office
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 408.82 416.34 <o,f0,female> and moved out from behind his desk what is the atom mostly made of he thought space
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 416.74 417.95 <o,f0,female> he started walking
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 418.48 419.82 <o,f0,female> what am i mostly made
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 421.42 424.93 <o,f0,female> atoms he quickened his pace almost to a jog now
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 425.55 427.46 <o,f0,male> what is the wall mostly made
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 429.29 440.90 <o,f0,male> atoms all i have to do is merge the spaces then general stubblebine banged his nose hard on the wall of his office
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 442.31 449.24 <o,f0,male> who commanded sixteen thousand soldiers was confounded by his continual failure to walk through the wall
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 449.57 461.41 <o,f0,male> he has no doubt that this ability will one day be a common tool in the military arsenal who would screw around with an army that could do that that's from an article in playboy which i was reading the other day
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 475.14 476.58 <o,f0,male> unaided human intuition
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 477.54 483.98 <o,f0,male> schooled in middle world finds it hard to believe galileo when he tells us a heavy object and
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 485.34 491.28 <o,f0,male> air friction aside would hit the ground at the same instant and that's because in middle world air friction is always there
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 491.88 502.81 <o,f0,male> if we'd evolved in a vacuum we would expect them to hit the ground simultaneously if we were bacteria constantly buffeted by thermal movements of molecules it would be different but we middle
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 504.02 512.73 <o,f0,male> to notice brownian motion in the same way our lives are dominated by gravity but are almost oblivious to the force of surface tension
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 513.16 515.96 <o,f0,female> a small insect would reverse these priorities
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 517.52 524.84 <o,f0,female> steve grand he 's the one on the left douglas adams is on the right steve grand in his book creation life and how to make it
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 525.22 536.25 <o,f0,female> is positively scathing about our preoccupation with matter itself we have this tendency to think that only solid material things are really things at all
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 537.56 540.84 <o,f0,female> waves of electromagnetic fluctuation in a vacuum seem
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 548.74 557.92 <o,f0,female> but we find real matter comforting only because we've evolved to survive in middle world where matter is a useful fiction
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 558.33 567.36 <o,f0,female> a whirlpool for steve grand is a thing with just as much reality as a rock in a desert plain in tanzania
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 567.91 576.89 <o,f0,female> in the shadow of the volcano ol donyo lengai there's a dune made of volcanic ash the beautiful thing is that it moves bodily
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 577.41 586.51 <o,f0,female> it's what's technically known as a barchan and the entire dune walks across the desert in a westerly direction at a speed of about seventeen meters per year
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 587.11 595.35 <o,f0,female> it retains its crescent shape and moves in the direction of the horns what happens is that the wind blows the sand up the shallow slope
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 595.65 605.00 <o,f0,female> on the other side and then as each sand grain hits the top of the ridge it cascades down on the inside of the crescent and so the whole horn shaped dune moves
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 607.21 615.75 <o,f0,female> steve grand points out that you and i are ourselves more like a wave than a permanent thing he invites us the reader
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 616.10 624.47 <o,f0,female> to think of an experience from your childhood something you remember clearly something you can see feel maybe even smell as if you were really there
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 625.03 632.78 <o,f0,female> after all you really were there at the time weren't you how else would you remember it but here is the bombshell you weren't
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 633.55 643.21 <o,f0,female> not a single atom that is in your body today was there when that event took place matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 656.70 670.62 <o,f0,female> so really isn't a word that we should use with simple confidence if a neutrino had a brain which it evolved in neutrino sized ancestors it would say that rocks really do consist of empty space
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 671.18 682.66 <o,f0,female> we have brains that evolved in medium sized ancestors which couldn't walk through rocks really for an animal is whatever its brain needs it to be in order to assist its survival
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 683.34 690.42 <o,f0,female> and because different species live in different worlds there will be a discomforting variety of reallys
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 692.74 702.30 <o,f0,female> what we see of the real world is not the unvarnished world but a model of the world regulated and adjusted by sense data but constructed
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 713.05 714.91 <o,f0,female> from a walking climbing or swimming
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 715.68 729.40 <o,f0,female> a monkey 's brain must have software capable of simulating a three dimensional world of branches and trunks a mole 's software for constructing models of its world will be customized for underground use
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 729.86 738.90 <o,f0,female> a water strider 's brain doesn't need three d software at all since it lives on the surface of the pond in an edwin abbott flatland
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 740.03 746.67 <o,f0,female> i've speculated that bats may see color with their ears the world model that a bat needs
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 746.84 756.98 <o,f0,female> in order to navigate through three dimensions catching insects must be pretty similar to the world model that any flying bird a day flying bird like a swallow needs to perform the same kind of tasks
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 757.28 766.37 <o,f0,female> the fact that the bat uses echoes in pitch darkness to input the current variables to its model while the swallow uses light is incidental
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 767.09 775.18 <o,f0,female> bats i even suggested use perceived hues such as red and blue as labels internal labels for
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 775.77 785.80 <o,f0,female> some useful aspect of echoes perhaps the acoustic texture of surfaces furry or smooth and so on in the same way as swallows or indeed we use
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 786.24 795.23 <o,f0,female> those perceived hues redness and blueness etcetera to label long and short wavelengths of light there's nothing inherent about red that makes it long wavelength
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 796.12 803.91 <o,f0,female> the point is that the nature of the model is governed by how it is to be used rather than by the sensory modality involved
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 805.22 809.78 <o,f0,female> j b s haldane himself had something to say about animals whose world is dominated by smell
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 811.18 823.77 <o,f0,female> dogs can distinguish two very similar fatty acids extremely diluted caprylic acid and caproic acid the only difference you see is that one has an extra pair of carbon atoms in the chain
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 824.76 837.82 <o,f0,female> guesses that a dog would probably be able to place the acids in the order of their molecular weights by their smells just as a man could place a number of piano wires in the order of their lengths by means of
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 839.39 847.16 <o,f0,female> another fatty acid capric acid which is just like the other two except that it has two more carbon atoms
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 847.80 856.36 <o,f0,female> a dog that had never met capric acid would perhaps have no more trouble imagining its smell than we would have trouble imagining a trumpet say
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 856.90 861.03 <o,f0,female> playing one note higher than we've heard a trumpet play before
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 875.69 886.48 <o,f0,female> middle world the range of sizes and speeds which we have evolved to feel intuitively comfortable with is a bit like the narrow range of the electromagnetic spectrum
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 886.71 895.24 <o,f0,female> that we see as light of various colors we're blind to all frequencies outside that unless we use instruments to help us
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 896.46 906.59 <o,f0,female> middle world is the narrow range of reality which we judge to be normal as opposed to the queerness of the very small the very large and the very fast
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 907.28 916.19 <o,f0,female> we could make a similar scale of improbabilities nothing is totally impossible miracles are just events that are extremely improbable
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 916.52 924.39 <o,f0,female> a marble statue could wave its hand at us the atoms that make up its crystalline structure are all vibrating back and forth anyway
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 924.68 933.43 <o,f0,female> because there are so many of them and because there's no agreement among them in their preferred direction of movement the marble as we see it in middle world stays
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 934.67 944.68 <o,f0,female> the atoms in the hand could all just happen to move the same way at the same time and again and again in this case the hand would move and we'd see it waving at us in middle world
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 945.32 955.63 <o,f0,female> the odds against it of course are so great that if you set out writing zeros at the time of the origin of the universe you still would not have written enough zeros to this day
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 956.80 963.34 <o,f0,female> evolution in middle world has not equipped us to handle very improbable events we don't live long enough
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 963.82 973.41 <o,f0,female> in the vastness of astronomical space and geological time that which seems impossible in middle world might turn out to be inevitable
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 975.49 981.77 <o,f0,female> one way to think about that is by counting planets we don't know how many planets there are in the universe but a good estimate
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 982.02 991.15 <o,f0,female> is about ten to the twenty or one hundred billion billion and that gives us a nice way to express our estimate of life 's improbability
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 992.03 1004.32 <o,f0,female> could make some sort of landmark points along a spectrum of improbability which might look like the electromagnetic spectrum we just looked at if life has arisen only once on any
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 1005.05 1012.14 <o,f0,female> if if life could i mean life could originate once per planet could be extremely common or it could originate once per
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 1013.02 1014.43 <o,f0,female> or once per galaxy
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 1014.97 1019.51 <o,f0,female> or maybe only once in the entire universe in which case it would have to be here
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 1020.34 1026.78 <o,f0,female> and somewhere up there would be the chance that a frog would turn into a prince and similar magical things like that
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 1027.61 1034.97 <o,f0,female> if life has arisen on only one planet in the entire universe that planet has to be our planet because here we are talking about
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 1035.39 1045.93 <o,f0,female> and that means that if we want to avail ourselves of it we're allowed to postulate chemical events in the origin of life which have a probability as low as one in one hundred billion billion
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 1046.37 1059.31 <o,f0,female> i don't think we shall have to avail ourselves of that because i suspect that life is quite common in the universe and when i say quite common it could still be so rare that no one island of life ever encounters another
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 1061.97 1075.91 <o,f0,female> how shall we interpret queerer than we can suppose queerer than in principle can be supposed or just queerer than we can suppose given the limitations of our brain 's evolutionary apprenticeship in middle world
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 1089.34 1097.60 <o,f0,female> i wonder whether we might help ourselves to understand say quantum theory if we brought up children to play computer games beginning in early childhood
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 1098.01 1109.21 <o,f0,female> which had a sort of make believe world of balls going through two slits on a screen a world in which the strange goings on of quantum mechanics were enlarged by the computer 's make believe so that they became familiar
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 1109.40 1118.25 <o,f0,female> on the middle world scale of the stream and similarly a relativistic computer game in which objects on the screen manifest the lorenz contraction and so on
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 1119.64 1129.90 <o,f0,female> to try to get ourselves into the way of thinking get children into the way of thinking about it i want to end by applying the idea of middle world to our perceptions of each other
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 1131.32 1138.67 <o,f0,female> most scientists today subscribe to a mechanistic view of the mind we're the way we are because our brains are wired up as they are
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 1138.83 1146.71 <o,f0,female> our hormones are the way they are we'd be different our characters would be different if our neuro anatomy and our physiological chemistry were different
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 1147.19 1158.64 <o,f0,female> but we scientists are inconsistent if we were consistent our response to a misbehaving person like a child murderer should be something like this unit has a faulty component it needs repairing
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 1159.17 1169.30 <o,f0,female> that's not what we say what we say and i include the most austerely mechanistic among us which is probably me what we say is vile monster prison is too good for you
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 1169.58 1178.78 <o,f0,female> or worse we seek revenge in all probability thereby triggering the next phase in an escalating cycle of counter revenge which we see of course all over the world today
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 1179.81 1186.46 <o,f0,female> in short when we're thinking like academics we regard people as elaborate and complicated machines like computers
RichardDawkins_2005G 1 RichardDawkins_2005G 1188.05 1197.93 <o,f0,male> but when we revert to being human we behave more like basil fawlty who we remember thrashed his car to teach it a lesson when it wouldn't start on gourmet night
