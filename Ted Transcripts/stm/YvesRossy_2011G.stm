YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 83.41 90.23 <o,f0,female> many of the tests are conducted while yves is strapped onto the wing because yves body is an integral part of the aircraft
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 182.52 185.19 <o,f0,male> and
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 210.35 212.24 <o,f0,male> i
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 234.71 249.56 <o,f0,male> the wing is open so our first critical moment it 's open he is down is he flying commentator two it looks like he 's stabilized he 's starting to make his climb commentator there 's that ninety degree turn you 're talking about taking him out he 's out over the channel
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 279.67 284.26 <o,f0,male> and what he 's going to do as he approaches the ground is pull down on those toggles
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 378.57 380.41 <o,f0,male> and that 's the
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 485.73 497.5 <o,f0,male> manager of systems as a pilot but this is really you need fluidity you need to be agile and also to adapt really fast
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 556.38 575.21 <o,f0,male> that means if i have a problem with the first one i pull i still have the possibility to open the second one and this is my life that 's the real important thing about safety i did use that during these last fifteen years about twenty times
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 575.21 582.45 <o,f0,male> never with that type of wing but at the beginning i can release my wing when
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 624.05 637.57 <o,f0,male> so the next thing i saw was just blue it was the sea i have also an audible altimeter so i was at my minimum altitude in that vector fast so
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 680.74 686.87 <o,f0,male> civil aviation is something that we know very well we have a hundred years of experience
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 686.87 705.68 <o,f0,male> and you can adapt really precisely with that i have to adapt to something new that means improvise so it 's really a play between these two approaches something that i know very well these principles for example we have two engines on an airbus
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 712.82 721.65 <o,f0,male> that 's my ejection seat so i have the approach of a professional pilot with the respect
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 735.61 748.78 <o,f0,male> and then i stabilize and according to my altitude i continue on two or three engines it 's sometimes possible it 's quite complicated to explain but according to which
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 864.42 873.75 <o,f0,male> thanks to the increasing technology better technology it will be safe and i hope it will be for everybody
