JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 89.96 93 <o,f0,female> is finally able to rest in peace
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 93.38 96.75 <o,f0,female> you know because they can 't hear the snoring anymore
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 96.75 111.36 <o,f0,female> and then they 'll get stupid drunk and smash cake in each others faces and do the macarena and we 'll be there showering them with towels and toasters and drinking their free booze and throwing birdseed at them every single time
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 111.75 117.5 <o,f0,female> even though we know statistically half of them will be divorced

JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 129.21 135.37 <o,f0,female> and debating which way the toilet paper should come off of the roll
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 147.75 153.37 <o,f0,female> i mean look it doesn 't take a double blind placebo controlled study to figure out what makes a marriage not work
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 153.37 155.64 <o,f0,female> disrespect
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 155.79 158.18 <o,f0,female> boredom too much
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 158.18 167.74 <o,f0,female> time on facebook having sex with other people but you can have the exact opposite of all of those things respect excitement
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 179.5 182.34 <o,f0,female> what do the folks who make it all the
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 193.12 198.37 <o,f0,female> solo why should you stop what you 're doing and make it your life 's
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 204.66 211.49 <o,f0,female> well researchers spend billions of your tax dollars trying to figure that out they stalk blissful
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 211.49 226.63 <o,f0,female> couples and they study their every move and mannerism and they try to pinpoint what it is that sets them apart from their miserable neighbors and friends and it turns out the success stories share a few similarities
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 226.85 235.6 <o,f0,female> actually beyond they don 't have sex with other people for instance in the happiest marriages the wife is thinner and better looking than the husband
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 241.21 247.95 <o,f0,female> to marital bliss because women we care a great deal about being thin and good looking whereas men mostly care about sex
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 248.47 252.91 <o,f0,female> ideally with women who are thinner and better looking than they are
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 290.29 296.96 <o,f0,female> she might say wow honey thank you for going out of your way to make me relatively thinner
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 297.37 298.96 <o,f0,female> these are couples who can
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 298.96 301.56 <o,f0,female> find good in any situation yeah
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 301.66 308.58 <o,f0,female> it was devastating when we lost everything in that fire but it 's kind of nice sleeping out here under the stars
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 308.92 320.79 <o,f0,female> and it 's a good thing you 've got all that body fat to keep us warm one of my favorite studies found that the more willing a husband is to do house work the more attractive his wife will find him
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 321.69 324.74 <o,f0,female> because we needed a study to tell us this
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 325.45 328.44 <o,f0,female> but here 's what 's going on here the more attractive
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 338.86 348.63 <o,f0,female> they live happily ever after in other words men you might want to pick it up a notch in the domestic department here 's an interesting one
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 348.63 353.27 <o,f0,female> one study found that people who smile in childhood photographs
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 353.59 361.32 <o,f0,female> are less likely to get a divorce this is an actual study and let me clarify the researchers were not looking at
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 361.32 369.63 <o,f0,female> documented self reports of childhood happiness or even studying old journals the data were based entirely on whether people
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 369.63 375.61 <o,f0,female> looked happy in these early pictures now i don 't know how old all of you are
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 375.66 381.66 <o,f0,female> but when i was a kid your parents took pictures with a special kind of camera that held something called film
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 413.6 417.33 <o,f0,female> so what else can you do to safeguard your marriage
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 439.74 450.98 <o,f0,female> and it 's not just successfully starring in films that 's dangerous it turns out merely watching a romantic comedy causes relationship satisfaction to plummet
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 456.09 467.17 <o,f0,female> maybe it could happen to us but it obviously hasn 't and it probably never will makes our lives seem unbearably grim in comparison and theoretically i suppose
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 470.21 472.04 <o,f0,female> dies in a fiery car crash
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 477.21 480.86 <o,f0,female> drinking alcohol it seems
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 485.41 491.44 <o,f0,female> i can 't tell you anymore about that one because i stopped reading it at the headline but here 's a scary one divorce
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 491.5 500.77 <o,f0,female> is contagious that 's right when you have a close couple friend split up it increases your chances of getting a divorce by seventy five
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 516.1 524.15 <o,f0,female> and viagra and eharmony and i 'm thinking they 've done more for my marriage than a lifetime of therapy ever
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 550.52 559.02 <o,f0,female> physically and emotionally we produce happier more stable and more successful kids
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 559.02 572.57 <o,f0,female> we have more sex than our supposedly swinging single friends believe it or not we even live longer which is a pretty compelling argument for marrying someone you like a lot in the first place
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 573.5 582.04 <o,f0,female> now if you 're not currently experiencing the joy of the joint tax return i can 't tell you how to find
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 582.04 594.73 <o,f0,female> a chore loving person of the approximately ideal size and attractiveness who prefers horror movies and doesn 't have a lot of friends hovering on the brink of divorce but i can only encourage you to try because the benefits as i 've pointed out
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 597.5 613.88 <o,f0,female> line is whether you 're in it or you 're searching for it i believe marriage is an institution worth pursuing and protecting so i hope you 'll use the information i 've given you today to weigh your personal strengths against your own risk factors for instance in my marriage
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 634.62 637.42 <o,f0,female> and we do like a cocktail
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 642.18 659.69 <o,f0,female> also my husband does a lot around the house and would happily never see another romantic comedy as long as he lives so i 've got all those things going for me but just in case i plan to work extra hard to not win an oscar anytime soon
JennaMcCarthy_2011X 1 JennaMcCarthy_2011X 659.72 662.29 <o,f0,female> and for the good of your relationships i would
