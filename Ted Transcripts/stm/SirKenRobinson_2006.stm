SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 19.44 22.33 <o,f0,male> you it's been great hasn't it
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 23.95 27.27 <o,f0,male> been blown away by the whole thing in fact i'm leaving
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 33.58 41.34 <o,f0,male> there have been three themes haven't there running through the conference which are relevant to what i want to talk about one is the extraordinary
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 51.76 59.22 <o,f0,male> the second is that it's put us in a place where we have no idea what's going to happen in terms of the future no idea how this
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 60.65 67.56 <o,f0,male> i have an interest in education actually what i find is everybody has an interest in education don't you
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 80.25 82.30 <o,f0,male> if you work in education you're not asked and
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 86.01 87.25 <o,f0,male> never asked back curiously
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 89.88 98.31 <o,f0,male> if you are and you say to somebody you know they say what do you do and you say you work in education you can see the blood run from their face they're like oh my god you know why me
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 101.51 102.79 <o,f0,male> my one night out all week
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 105.86 113.96 <o,f0,male> but if you ask about their education they pin you to the wall because it's one of those things that goes deep with people am i right like religion and money
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 115.17 126.72 <o,f0,male> things i have a big interest in education and i think we all do we have a huge vested interest in it partly because it's education that's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 135.88 144.98 <o,f0,male> nobody has a clue despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days what the world will look like in five years time and yet we're meant to be educating them for
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 164.86 175.57 <o,f0,male> she's exceptional but i think she's not so to speak exceptional in the whole of childhood what you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 176.04 185.09 <o,f0,male> and my contention is all kids have tremendous talents and we squander them pretty ruthlessly so i want to talk about education and i want to talk about creativity
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 185.32 194.51 <o,f0,male> my contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy and we should treat it with the same status
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 195.15 197.79 <o,f0,female> thank you
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 205.34 206.53 <o,f0,male> so fifteen minutes
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 210.18 211.32 <o,f0,male> well i was born no
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 215.35 224.46 <o,f0,male> i heard a great story recently i love telling it of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson she was six and she was at the back drawing and the teacher said this little girl hardly ever paid attention
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 231.37 239.94 <o,f0,male> and the girl said i 'm drawing a picture of god and the teacher said but nobody knows what god looks like and the girl said they will in a minute
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 252.12 256.20 <o,f0,male> when my son was four in england actually he was four everywhere to be honest
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 271.74 283.86 <o,f0,male> nativity ii but james got the part of joseph which we were thrilled about we considered this to be one of the lead parts we had the place crammed full of agents in t shirts james robinson is joseph
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 285.07 292.61 <o,f0,male> didn't have to speak but you know the bit where the three kings come in they come in bearing gifts and they bring gold frankincense and myrhh this really happened we were sitting there and
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 302.92 310.14 <o,f0,male> tea towels on their heads and they put these boxes down and the first boy said i bring you gold and the second boy said i bring you
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 364.31 376.87 <o,f0,male> and the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities picasso once said this he said that all children are born artists the problem is to remain an artist as we grow up
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 377.42 383.79 <o,f0,male> i believe this passionately that we don't grow into creativity we grow out of it or rather we get educated
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 385.01 392.34 <o,f0,male> so why is this i lived in stratford on avon until about five years ago in fact we moved from stratford to los angeles
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 395.52 395.81 <o,f0,male> was
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 414.06 417.65 <o,f0,male> i never thought of it i mean he was seven at some point he was in somebody 's english class
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 424.00 424.20 <o,f0,male> that
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 442.66 445.77 <o,f0,male> go to bed now to william shakespeare and put the pencil
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 448.67 455.21 <o,f0,male> it's confusing everybody
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 462.33 472.22 <o,f0,male> we moved from stratford to los angeles and i just want to say a word about the transition actually my son didn't want to come i've got two kids he 's twenty one now my daughter 's sixteen he didn't want to come
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 486.67 491.07 <o,f0,male> long time when you're sixteen anyway he was really upset on the plane and he said i 'll never find another girl like
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 527.99 529.71 <o,f0,male> and in pretty much every system
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 531.26 543.28 <o,f0,male> hierarchy within the arts art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance there isn't an education system on the planet that teaches dance every day to children the way we teach them mathematics why
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 543.98 552.47 <o,f0,male> why not i think this is rather important i think math is very important but so is dance children dance all the time if they're allowed to we all do we all have bodies
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 558.28 561.77 <o,f0,male> what happens is as children grow up we start to educate them progressively from the waist up
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 580.93 591.42 <o,f0,male> i think you'd have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors isn't it they're the people who come out the top and i used to be one
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 591.97 592.28 <o,f0,male> so
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 596.89 604.48 <o,f0,male> and i like university professors but you know we shouldn 't hold them up as the high water mark of all human achievement they're just a form of life
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 605.62 614.59 <o,f0,male> another form of life but they're rather curious and i say this out of affection for them there's something curious about professors in my experience not all of them but typically they live in their heads
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 615.33 625.43 <o,f0,male> they live up there and slightly to one side they're disembodied you know in a kind of literal way they look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 633.78 634.40 <o,f0,male> to meetings
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 640.45 649.56 <o,f0,male> if you want real evidence of out of body experiences by the way get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics and pop into the discotheque on the final night
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 652.91 656.11 <o,f0,male> there you will see it grown men and women writhing uncontrollably
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 657.83 663.32 <o,f0,male> off the beat waiting until it ends so they can go home and write a paper about it
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 666.65 677.07 <o,f0,male> our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability and there's a reason the whole system was invented around the world there were no public systems of education really before the nineteenth century
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 677.49 687.03 <o,f0,male> they all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism so the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas number one that the most useful subjects for work are at the top
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 728.84 738.52 <o,f0,male> and i think we can't afford to go on that way in the next thirty years according to unesco more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 739.06 751.11 <o,f0,male> more people and it's the combination of all the things we've talked about technology and its transformation effect on work and demography and the huge explosion in population suddenly degrees aren't worth anything isn't that true
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 752.28 757.52 <o,f0,male> when i was a student if you had a degree you had a job if you didn't have a job it's because you didn't want one
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 757.92 759.24 <o,f0,male> and i didn't want one
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 759.54 762.67 <o,f0,male> frankly but now
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 763.22 777.18 <o,f0,male> kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games because you need an ma where the previous job required a ba and now you need a phd for the other it's a process of academic inflation and it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 777.50 782.19 <o,f0,male> we need to radically rethink our view of intelligence we know three things about intelligence one it's
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 783.14 794.00 <o,f0,male> we think about the world in all the ways that we experience it we think visually we think in sound we think kinesthetically we think in abstract terms we think in movement secondly intelligence is dynamic
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 795.06 801.07 <o,f0,male> if you look at the interactions of a human brain as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations intelligence
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 801.23 810.54 <o,f0,male> is wonderfully interactive the brain isn't divided into compartments in fact creativity which i define as the process of having original ideas that have value
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 810.99 819.30 <o,f0,male> more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things the brain is intentionally by the way
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 831.61 838.70 <o,f0,male> a raft of research but i know it from my personal life if my wife is cooking a meal at home which is not often
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 839.80 840.76 <o,f0,male> thankfully but you know
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 843.79 848.89 <o,f0,male> good at some things but if she's cooking you know she's dealing with people on the phone she's talking to the kids she's painting the
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 895.54 898.38 <o,f0,male> and the third thing about intelligence is it's distinct
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 914.96 922.73 <o,f0,male> some have she's a choreographer and everybody knows her work she did cats and phantom of the opera she's wonderful i used to be on the board of the royal ballet in england
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 923.38 923.82 <o,f0,male> as you can
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 938.24 947.36 <o,f0,male> couldn't concentrate she was fidgeting i think now they'd say she had adhd wouldn't you but this was the nineteen thirties and adhd hadn't been invented at this point
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 953.97 954.67 <o,f0,male> they could have that
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 973.04 979.50 <o,f0,male> at the end of it because she was disturbing people her homework was always late and so on little kid of eight in the end the
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 986.89 997.41 <o,f0,male> said wait here we'll be back we won 't be very long and they went and left her but as they went out the room he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk and when they got out the room he said to her mother
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 999.49 1012.18 <o,f0,male> and the minute they left the room she said she was on her feet moving to the music and they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said misters lynne gillian isn't sick she's a dancer
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 1013.77 1017.64 <o,f0,male> take her to a dance school i said what happened she said she did i
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 1035.32 1042.85 <o,f0,male> she became a soloist she had a wonderful career at the royal ballet she eventually graduated from the royal ballet school and founded her own company the gillian lynne dance company
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 1064.38 1074.40 <o,f0,male> it comes to is this al gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by rachel carson i believe our only hope for the future
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 1074.82 1083.08 <o,f0,male> is to adopt a new conception of human ecology one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 1093.23 1104.51 <o,f0,male> we have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we're educating our children there was a wonderful quote by jonas salk who said if all the insects were to disappear from the earth
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 1105.53 1115.16 <o,f0,male> within fifty years all life on earth would end if all human beings disappeared from the earth within fifty years all forms of life would flourish
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 1115.86 1125.87 <o,f0,male> and he 's right what ted celebrates is the gift of the human imagination we have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely
SirKenRobinson_2006 1 SirKenRobinson_2006 1138.62 1149.54 <o,f0,male> task is to educate their whole being so they can face this future by the way we may not see this future but they will and our job is to help them make something of it thank you very much
