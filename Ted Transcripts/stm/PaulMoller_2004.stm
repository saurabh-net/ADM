PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 13.94 23.10 <o,f0,male> ask the question you know why is a flying car or maybe more accurately a rotable aircraft possible at this time a number of years ago
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 25.42 33.09 <o,f0,male> predicted that flying cars of some form would be available now sixty years later i'm here to tell you why it's possible when i was
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 33.50 42.52 <o,f0,male> about five years old not very much about a year after mister ford made his predictions i was living in a rural part of canada on the side of a mountain
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 42.94 45.32 <o,f0,male> in a very isolated area
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 45.95 54.81 <o,f0,male> getting to school for a kid that was actually pretty short for his age through the canadian winter was not a pleasant experience it was a trying
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 56.51 57.85 <o,f0,male> scary thing for a young
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 60.74 64.09 <o,f0,male> at the end of my first year in school in the summer of that year
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 65.29 70.23 <o,f0,male> i discovered a couple hummingbirds that were caught in a shed near my home
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 70.93 72.07 <o,f0,male> they'd worn themselves out
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 74.90 84.27 <o,f0,male> and well they were easy to capture i took them outside and as i let them go that split second even though they were very tired that second i let them go they hovered for a second then zipped off into the distance
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 84.74 86.75 <o,f0,male> i thought what a great way to get to school
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 89.46 99.50 <o,f0,male> for a kid at that age this was like infinite speed disappearing and i was very inspired by that and so the next over the next six decades believe it or not
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 100.07 109.55 <o,f0,male> i've built a number of aircraft with the goal of creating something that could do for you or me what the hummingbird does and give you that flexibility
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 120.58 122.03 <o,f0,male> like helicopter perhaps
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 122.84 128.02 <o,f0,male> the faa the controlling body above all calls it a powerlift aircraft
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 137.59 144.04 <o,f0,male> when you consider that there are no operational powerlift aircraft so for once perhaps the government is ahead of itself
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 145.35 148.87 <o,f0,male> the press calls my particular volantor a
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 150.77 155.19 <o,f0,male> this is a little bit earlier version of it that's why it's given the x designation
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 155.66 161.24 <o,f0,male> but it's a four passenger aircraft that could take off vertically like a helicopter therefore it doesn't need an airfield
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 161.64 163.63 <o,f0,male> on the ground it's powered electrically
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 165.12 173.76 <o,f0,male> it's actually classified as a motorcycle because of the three wheels which is a great asset because it allows you theoretically to use this on the highways in most states
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 186.82 187.85 <o,f0,male> one could say that
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 192.32 203.01 <o,f0,male> and gets around in much the same way and it's true but a helicopter is a very complex device it's expensive so expensive that very few people could own or use it
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 204.15 212.13 <o,f0,male> it's often been described because of its fragile nature and its complexity as a series of parts a large number of parts flying in formation
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 217.76 220.95 <o,f0,male> another difference and i have to describe this because it's very personal
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 224.49 225.91 <o,f0,male> the volantor in my case the
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 227.65 238.46 <o,f0,male> is the experience that i've had in flying both of those in a helicopter you feel and it's still a remarkable sensation you feel like you're being hauled up from above by a vibrating crane
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 239.21 248.45 <o,f0,male> when you get in the skycar and i can tell you there's only one other person that's flown it but he had the same sensation you really feel like you're being lifted up by a magic carpet
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 252.84 260.33 <o,f0,male> and it's been a great motivator i only get to fly this vehicle occasionally and only when i can persuade my stockholders to let me do
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 261.18 265.75 <o,f0,male> but it's still one of those wonderful experiences that reward you for all that time
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 269.97 271.26 <o,f0,male> what we really need
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 271.76 275.78 <o,f0,male> is something to replace the automobile for those fifty plus mile trips
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 281.45 290.64 <o,f0,male> if we can get rid of that then the highways will now be useful to you as contrasted by what's happening in many parts of the world today
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 292.68 297.41 <o,f0,male> on this next slide is an interesting history of what we really
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 297.89 308.17 <o,f0,male> have seen in infrastructure because whether i give you a perfect skycar the perfect vehicle for use it's going to have very little value to you unless you've got a system to use it in
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 335.86 349.45 <o,f0,male> this historically you see that we got around two hundred years ago by canals and as that system disappeared were replaced by railroads as that disappeared we came in with highways but if you look at that top corner the highway system you see where we are today
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 350.03 351.52 <o,f0,male> highways are no longer being built
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 352.95 356.73 <o,f0,male> and that's a fact you won 't see any additional highways in the next ten years
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 357.55 361.20 <o,f0,male> however the next ten years if like the last ten years we're going to see thirty percent more
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 362.92 363.90 <o,f0,male> and where is that going to
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 364.91 368.73 <o,f0,male> so the issue then i've often asked is when is it going to happen
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 378.36 388.36 <o,f0,male> so i'm not going to quote myself on this i'd prefer to quote someone else who testified with me before congress and in his position as head of nasa
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 395.13 402.53 <o,f0,male> i would argue actually if you look at the fact that on the highways today you're only averaging about thirty miles per hour on average according to the
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 404.21 416.18 <o,f0,male> the skycar travels at over three hundred miles an hour up to twenty five thousand feet and so in effect you could see perhaps a tenfold increase in the ability to get around as far as speed is concerned
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 422.18 422.95 <o,f0,male> many of you
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 423.95 428.23 <o,f0,male> the highway in the sky that i'm talking about here has been under construction for ten years
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 429.01 438.30 <o,f0,male> it makes use of the gps you're familiar with gps in your automobile but you may not be familiar with the fact that there's a gps u s there's a russian gps and there's a new
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 449.45 456.93 <o,f0,male> to make sure that you're being controlled because if you're in this world where computers are controlling what you're doing it's going to be very critical that something can't fail on you
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 459.66 462.10 <o,f0,male> how would a trip in a skycar work well
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 463.27 470.89 <o,f0,male> you can't right now take off from your home because it's too noisy i mean to be able to take off from your home you'd have to be extremely quiet but it's still fairly quiet
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 481.83 487.45 <o,f0,male> time on the road after all if you can fly like that why are you going to drive around on a highway go to a local
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 495.08 503.86 <o,f0,male> you can play computer games you can sleep you can read on the way this is the world there won 't be you as a pilot and i know the pilots in the audience aren't going to like that and i've had a lot of bad feedback
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 527.78 533.70 <o,f0,male> i got a lot of excitement around this and i was able to fund the initiation of the program back in that time
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 558.47 568.48 <o,f0,male> actually the middle of two thousand and two we flew the four hundred m four hundred which was the four passenger vehicle in this case here we're flying it remotely as we always did at the beginning
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 569.43 578.20 <o,f0,male> and we had very small powerplants in it at this time we are now installing larger powerplants which will make it possible for me to get back on board a vertical takeoff aircraft
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 578.97 592.12 <o,f0,male> is not the safest vehicle during the test flight program there's an old adage that applied for the years between nineteen fifties and nineteen seventies when every aeronautical company was working on vertical takeoff aircraft
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 594.57 599.85 <o,f0,male> a vertical takeoff aircraft needs an artificial stabilization system that's essential
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 600.54 603.56 <o,f0,male> at least for the hover and the low speed flight
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 606.51 615.13 <o,f0,male> if that single stability system that brain that flies that aircraft fails or if the engine fails that vehicle crashes there is no option to that
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 615.84 623.23 <o,f0,male> and the adage that i'm referring to that applied at that time was that nothing comes down faster than a vtol aircraft upside down
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 625.92 632.05 <o,f0,male> a macabre comment because we lost a lot of pilots in fact the aircraft companies gave up on vertical takeoff aircraft
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 632.43 640.66 <o,f0,male> more or less for a number of years and there's really only one operational aircraft in the world today that's a vertical takeoff aircraft as distinct from a helicopter and that's the hawker harrier jump
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 647.72 650.65 <o,f0,male> a vertical takeoff aircraft like the hummingbird
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 656.28 657.42 <o,f0,male> getting that energy
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 658.21 663.21 <o,f0,male> is very very difficult it all comes down to that power plant how to get a large amount of power in a small package
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 668.83 673.38 <o,f0,male> invented the rotary engine a very unique engine it's round it's small
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 673.74 675.10 <o,f0,male> it's vibration free
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 675.56 680.48 <o,f0,male> it fits exactly where we need to fit it right in the center of the hubs of the ducts in the system
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 681.07 687.16 <o,f0,male> very critical in fact that engine for those who are into the automobile know that it recently is applied to the rx eight
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 694.48 701.34 <o,f0,male> in that application it generates one horsepower per pound which is twice as good as your car engine today but only half of what we need
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 702.02 708.33 <o,f0,male> my company has spent thirty five years and many millions of dollars taking that rotary engine which was invented in the late
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 708.91 717.46 <o,f0,male> and getting it to the point that we get over two horsepower per pound reliably and critical we actually get one hundred and seventy five horsepower into one cubic foot
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 719.39 721.44 <o,f0,male> we have eight engines in this vehicle
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 721.84 724.38 <o,f0,male> we have four computers we have two parachutes
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 725.72 727.05 <o,f0,male> is the critical issue here
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 727.43 732.96 <o,f0,male> if you want to stay alive you've got to have backups and we have actually flown this vehicle and lost an engine and continued to hover
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 733.42 741.05 <o,f0,male> the computers back up each other there's a voting system if one computer is not agreeing with the other three it's kicked out of the system
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 749.84 752.00 <o,f0,male> there won 't be a third chance
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 753.84 755.47 <o,f0,male> the parachutes are there hopefully
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 756.02 760.68 <o,f0,male> more for psychological than real reasons but they will be an ultimate backup if it
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 764.60 768.01 <o,f0,male> like to show you an animation in this next one which is one
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 768.59 775.80 <o,f0,male> element of the skycar 's use but it's one that demonstrates how it could be used you could think of it personally in your own terms of how you might use it
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 821.35 823.85 <o,f0,male> going to change the demographics in a very significant way
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 826.36 835.46 <o,f0,male> live seventy five miles from san francisco and get there in fifteen minutes you're going to sell your seven hundred thousand dollar apartment buy an upscale home on the side of a mountain
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 836.43 841.90 <o,f0,male> a skycar which i think would be priced at that time perhaps in the area of one hundred thousand dollars put money in the bank
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 863.60 865.13 <o,f0,male> and that has
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 865.78 872.13 <o,f0,male> you run into situations where you have this great acceptance of what you're doing and a lot of rejection of the same kind of thing
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 872.76 874.08 <o,f0,male> i characterized
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 874.68 878.12 <o,f0,male> this emerging technology in an aphorism
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 878.88 879.07 <o,f0,male> as
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 881.02 887.82 <o,f0,male> which really talks about what i've experienced and i'm sure what other people may have experienced in emerging technologies
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 893.25 903.64 <o,f0,male> there's an interesting poll that came out recently under nas i think it's msnbc in which they asked the question are you in the market for a volantor
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 918.64 921.35 <o,f0,male> i'm encouraged by that at least it makes me feel like
PaulMoller_2004 1 PaulMoller_2004 922.03 932.54 <o,f0,male> to some extent it is becoming self evident that we need an alternative to the automobile at least for those fifty mile trips and more so that the highways become usable in today 's world thank you
