DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 17.48 29.37 <o,f0,male> few things that bring us humans together in the way that an election does we stand in elections we vote in elections we observe elections our democracies rely on elections
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 29.69 39.06 <o,f0,male> we all understand why we have elections and we all leave the house on the same day to go and vote we cherish the opportunity to have our say
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 40.29 42.84 <o,f0,male> to help decide the future of the country
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 44.64 49.12 <o,f0,male> the fundamental idea is that politicians are given mandate to speak for us
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 49.47 52.31 <o,f0,male> to make decisions on our behalf that affect us all
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 53.57 63.69 <o,f0,male> without that mandate they would be corrupt well unfortunately power corrupts and so people will do lots of things to get power and to stay in power
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 68.68 77.78 <o,f0,male> you see even if the idea of the election is perfect running a countrywide election is a big project and big projects are messy
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 78.86 82.51 <o,f0,male> whenever there is an election it seems like something always goes wrong
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 83.21 84.59 <o,f0,male> someone tries to cheat
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 85.04 87.49 <o,f0,male> or something goes accidentally awry
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 88.16 92.61 <o,f0,male> a ballot box goes missing here chads are left hanging over here
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 94.09 106.15 <o,f0,male> to make sure as few things as possible go wrong we have all these procedures around the election so for example you come to the polling station and a poll station worker asks for your id
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 110.46 120.20 <o,f0,male> voting booth to fill out your vote when you come back out you get to drop your vote into the ballot box where it mixes with all the other votes so that no one knows how you voted
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 121.61 134.85 <o,f0,male> what i want us to think about for a moment is what happens after that after you drop your vote into the ballot box and most people would go home and feel sure that their vote has been counted because they trust that the election system works
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 135.59 142.13 <o,f0,male> they trust that election workers and election observers do their jobs and do their jobs correctly
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 143.00 150.47 <o,f0,male> the ballot boxes go to counting places they're unsealed and the votes are poured out and laboriously counted
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 162.52 164.48 <o,f0,male> we have to trust a lot of people
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 165.58 168.06 <o,f0,male> we have to trust a lot of procedures
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 169.52 172.77 <o,f0,male> and sometimes we even have to trust computers
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 174.68 180.96 <o,f0,male> so imagine hundreds of millions of voters casting hundreds of millions of votes all to be counted correctly
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 181.59 184.28 <o,f0,male> and all the things that can possibly go wrong
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 186.10 188.23 <o,f0,female> causing all these bad headlines
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 189.71 194.57 <o,f0,female> and you cannot help but feel exhausted at the idea of trying to make
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 198.41 206.04 <o,f0,female> well in the face of all these bad headlines researchers have taken a step back and thought about how we can do elections differently
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 207.68 210.20 <o,f0,female> they've zoomed out and looked at the big picture
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 211.02 214.74 <o,f0,female> and the big picture is this elections should be
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 217.80 222.05 <o,f0,female> should be able to check that their votes are counted correctly
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 222.74 226.83 <o,f0,female> without breaking election secrecy which is so very important
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 228.04 235.82 <o,f0,female> and that's the tough part how do we make an election system completely verifiable while keeping the votes absolutely secret
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 236.71 238.35 <o,f0,female> well the way we've come up with
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 239.37 243.94 <o,f0,female> uses computers but doesn't depend on them and the secret is the ballot form
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 244.40 253.32 <o,f0,female> and if you look closely at these ballot forms you'll notice that the candidate list is in a different order on each one and that means if you mark your choices on one of them
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 253.70 260.15 <o,f0,female> and then remove the candidate list i won 't be able to tell from the bit remaining what your vote is for
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 261.15 263.05 <o,f0,female> and on each ballot form there is this
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 272.59 281.89 <o,f0,female> but what's not complicated is voting with one of these forms so we can let computers do all the complicated cryptography for us and then we'll use the paper
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 285.77 288.82 <o,f0,female> so this is how you vote you get one of these ballot forms
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 289.36 293.96 <o,f0,female> at random and then you go into the voting booth and you mark your choices
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 294.53 296.36 <o,f0,female> and you tear along a perforation
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 300.02 311.43 <o,f0,female> and you shred the candidate list and the bit that remains the one with your marks this is your encrypted vote so you let a poll station worker scan your encrypted vote
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 319.24 323.67 <o,f0,female> and displayed on a website for anyone to see including you so
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 324.38 338.17 <o,f0,female> you take this encrypted vote home as your receipt and after the close of the election you can check that your vote was counted by comparing your receipt to the vote on the website
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 349.85 353.40 <o,f0,female> if the government wants to find out how you voted they won 't be able to
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 355.27 363.64 <o,f0,female> no hacker can break in and find out how you voted no hacker can break in and change your vote because then it won 't match your receipt
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 367.23 369.77 <o,f0,female> because then you won 't find yours when you look for
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 372.10 374.27 <o,f0,female> but the election magic doesn't stop there
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 374.81 386.72 <o,f0,female> instead we want to make the whole process so transparent that news media and international observers and anyone who wants to can download all the election data and do the count themselves
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 387.33 390.17 <o,f0,female> they can check that all the votes were counted correctly
DavidBismark_2010G 1 DavidBismark_2010G 390.62 395.69 <o,f0,female> they can check that the announced result of the election is the correct one
