GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 34.33 38.01 <o,f0,male> global citizenship is that an idea that you believe in and how would you define that
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 51.31 60.43 <o,f0,male> and there is so much shared sense of what we need to do that it is vital that we all come together but we don 't necessarily have the means to do so
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 60.44 73.52 <o,f0,male> so there are challenges to be met i believe the concept of global citizenship will simply grow out of people talking to each other across continents but then of course the task is to create the institutions that make that global society work
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 73.54 81.52 <o,f0,male> but i don 't think we should underestimate the extent to which massive changes in technology make possible the linking up of people across the world
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 187.96 192.13 <o,f0,male> richard nixon goes to represent the united states government
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 192.52 207.08 <o,f0,male> at the celebrations for independence in ghana and it 's one of his first outings as vice president to an african country he doesn 't quite know what to do so he starts going around the crowd and starts talking to people in the crowd and he says to people in this rather unique
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 227.9 237.83 <o,f0,male> civil rights in america were achieved in the one thousand nine hundred and sixty s but what is equally remarkable is socioeconomic rights in africa have not moved forward
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 237.85 243.17 <o,f0,male> very fast even since the age of colonialism and yet
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 243.23 246.35 <o,f0,male> america and africa have got a common interest
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 246.35 255.13 <o,f0,male> and we have got to realize that if we don 't link up with those people who are sensible voices and democratic voices in africa to work together for common causes
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 255.13 267.02 <o,f0,male> then the danger of al qaeda and related groups making progress in africa is very big so i would say that what seems sometimes to be altruism in relation to africa or in relation to developing countries
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 277.65 295.69 <o,f0,male> do in the long run come together and whatever the short run price for taking action on climate change or taking action on security or taking action to provide opportunities for people for education these are prices that are worth paying so that you build a stronger global society where people feel able to feel comfortable with each other
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 295.69 301.18 <o,f0,male> and are able to communicate with each other in such a way that you can actually build stronger links between different countries
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 313.11 322.86 <o,f0,male> one end of the beach there is a house containing a family of five nigerians and at the other end of the beach there is a single brit you have time to
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 326.01 327.93 <o,f0,male> alert one house what do you do
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 340.21 355.65 <o,f0,male> i do agree that my responsibility is first of all to make sure that people in our country are safe and i wouldn 't like anything that is said today to suggest that i am diminishing the importance of the responsibility that each individual leader has for their own country
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 355.65 360.91 <o,f0,male> but i 'm trying to suggest that there is a huge opportunity open to us that was never open to us before
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 367.02 373.08 <o,f0,male> and i think look at the tsunami it 's a classic example where was the early warning systems
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 382.89 395.39 <o,f0,male> and when the world starts to work together with better early warning systems then you can deal with some of these problems in a far better way i just think we 're not seeing at the moment the huge opportunities open to us by the ability of people to cooperate
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 395.39 405.32 <o,f0,male> in a world where either there was isolationism before or there was limited alliances based on convenience which never actually took you to deal with some of the central problems
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 408.72 417.61 <o,f0,male> people have like people in the audience here where we love the kind of language that you 're talking about it is inspiring a lot of us believe that that has to be the world 's future
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 417.61 424.02 <o,f0,male> and yet when the situation changes you suddenly hear politicians talking as if
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 424.02 438.75 <o,f0,male> you know for example the life of one american soldier is worth countless numbers of iraqi civilians when the pedal hits the metal the idealism can get moved away i 'm just wondering how
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 467.84 482.34 <o,f0,male> the same global ethic is at the heart of each of these religions so i think you 're dealing with something that people instinctively see as part of that moral sense so you 're building on something that is not
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 493.87 509.73 <o,f0,male> but it is a set of values that cannot in my view be extinguished then the question is how do you make that change happen how do you persuade people that it is in their interest to build strong after the second world war
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 509.73 516.73 <o,f0,male> we built institutions the united nations the imf the world bank the world trade organization the marshall plan
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 516.73 528.07 <o,f0,male> there was a period in which people talked about an act of creation because these institutions were so new but they are now out of date they don 't deal with the problems as i said you can 't deal with the environmental problem through
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 528.07 541.09 <o,f0,male> existing institutions you can 't deal with the security problem in the way that you need to you can 't deal with the economic and financial problem so we have got to rebuild our global institutions build them in a way that is suitable to the challenges of this time
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 541.09 554.91 <o,f0,male> and i believe that if you look at the biggest challenge we face it is to persuade people to have the confidence that we can build a truly global society with the institutions that are founded on these rules so i come back to my initial point
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 572.64 575.77 <o,f0,male> by tackling the impossible you make the impossible possible
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 586.27 590.14 <o,f0,male> but surely a true global ethic
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 626.19 631.73 <o,f0,male> since then the world has moved forward partly as a result of what happened with the holocaust
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 631.73 638.38 <o,f0,male> and people 's concern about the rights of individuals within territories where they need protection
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 638.38 652.26 <o,f0,male> partly because of what we saw in rwanda partly because of what we saw in bosnia the idea of the responsibility to protect all individuals who are in situations where they are at humanitarian risk is now being established as a principle which governs the world
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 652.26 663.46 <o,f0,male> so while i can 't automatically say that britain will rush to the aid of any citizen of any country in danger i can say
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 682.82 697.1 <o,f0,male> and that comes back to what the future role of the united nations and what it can do actually is but the responsibility to protect is a new idea that is in a sense taken over from the idea of self determination as the principle governing the international community
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 703.54 723.16 <o,f0,male> the kind of full form global ethic global citizenship and basically saying that i believe that all people across the planet have equal consideration and if in power we will act in that way and we believe that the people of this country are also now global citizens and will support that
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 736.3 742.24 <o,f0,male> and you have a duty to help those countries that cannot afford to deal with the problems of climate change themselves
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 742.24 747.36 <o,f0,male> you 're saying you want a deal with all the different countries of the world where we 're all bound together
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 771.59 774.17 <o,f0,male> and if you could then find a financing mechanism
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 829.17 839.84 <o,f0,male> i mean the great difficulty in europe is if you 're at a meeting and twenty seven people speak it takes a very very long time but we did get an agreement on climate change america
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 847.44 858.69 <o,f0,male> japan has made an announcement china and india have signed up to the scientific evidence and now we 've got to move them to accept a long term target and then short term targets
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 866.81 885.33 <o,f0,male> if we work together we can get that agreement to copenhagen i certainly have been putting forward proposals that would have allowed the poorest parts of the world to feel that we have taken into account their specific needs and we would help them adapt and we would help them make the transition to a low carbon economy
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 949.72 956.74 <o,f0,male> and god said not this year not in this decade perhaps not in your lifetime so barroso walked away crying and in tears
GordonBrown_QA_2009G 1 GordonBrown_QA_2009G 964.67 967.17 <o,f0,male> when will our international institutions work
