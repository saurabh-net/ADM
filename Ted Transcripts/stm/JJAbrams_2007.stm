JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 25.88 29.81 <o,f0,male> in terms of lost you know what the hell 's that island you know
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 36.72 50.64 <o,f0,male> about mystery that i seem to be drawn to and i was thinking about this what to talk about at ted when i talked to the kind rep from ted and i said listen you know what should i talk about he said don 't worry about it just be profound
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 52.49 55.50 <o,f0,female> and i took enormous comfort in that so thank you if you're here
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 55.81 65.96 <o,f0,female> i was trying to think what do i talk about it's a good question why do i do so much stuff that involves mystery and i started trying to figure it out and i started thinking about why do i do any of what i do and i started thinking about my grandfather
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 66.86 68.00 <o,f0,female> i loved
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 68.82 70.44 <o,f0,female> my grandfather harry kelvin
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 84.44 96.31 <o,f0,male> so he had this incredible curiosity as a kid i saw him come over to me with radios and telephones and all sorts of things and he'd open them up he'd unscrew them and reveal the inner workings which many of us i'm sure take for granted but
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 106.97 110.89 <o,f0,male> my grandfather was a kind of guy who would not only
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 111.52 125.67 <o,f0,male> take things apart but he got me interested in all sorts of different odd crafts like you know printing like the letter press i'm obsessed with printing i'm obsessed with silk screening and bookbinding and box making when i was a kid i was always like taking
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 153.47 160.45 <o,f0,male> you know kind of got me into all sorts of these things he would also supply me with tools he was this amazing encourager this patron sort of
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 173.15 181.26 <o,f0,male> he was so generous i couldn't believe it he wasn't doing it entirely without some manipulation i mean i would call him and i'd be like listen grandpa
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 181.74 188.89 <o,f0,male> i really need this camera you don't understand this is like you know i want to make movies i'll get invited to ted one day this
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 197.63 201.64 <o,f0,female> should be doing she was fantastic so i found myself
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 202.04 211.20 <o,f0,male> getting this stuff thanks to her assist and suddenly you know i had a synthesizer when i was fourteen years old this kind of stuff and it let me make
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 211.63 217.18 <o,f0,male> things which to me was sort of the dream he sort of humored my obsession to other things too like magic
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 237.30 244.30 <o,f0,female> right which is good but now i can't move now i have to do this the rest of the thing like this i'm like oh wow look at my computer over there anyway
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 256.73 258.45 <o,f0,female> buys you fifty dollars worth of magic
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 262.58 266.39 <o,f0,female> now i bought this decades ago and i'm not kidding if you look at this you'll see it's never been
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 305.40 306.69 <o,f0,female> it represents my grandfather
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 307.70 309.13 <o,f0,female> am i allowed to cry at ted
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 317.40 320.42 <o,f0,female> is that it represents infinite possibility
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 332.58 334.41 <o,f0,female> find myself drawn to
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 372.47 381.54 <o,f0,male> that sense of possibility what could this thing be there was no time to develop it i'm sure you're all familiar with those people who tell you what you can't do and what you should change and there was no time for that which is kind of amazing
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 382.20 390.93 <o,f0,male> and so we did this show and for those of you who you know who haven't seen it or don't know it i can show you this one little clip from the pilot just to show you some
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 444.07 446.17 <o,f0,female> ten years ago if we wanted to do that we'd have to kill
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 452.67 455.58 <o,f0,female> it would be harder it would take take two would be a
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 468.77 478.64 <o,f0,female> we did and so part of the amazing thing for me is in the creative process technology is like mind blowingly inspiring to me i realize that that blank page is a magic box
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 478.99 489.49 <o,f0,female> you know it needs to be filled with something fantastic i used to have the ordinary people script that i'd flip through the romance of the script was amazing to me it would inspire me i wanted to try and fill pages with the same kind of
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 504.12 504.70 <o,f0,female> i feel this
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 507.31 511.68 <o,f0,female> and i often am like you know dude today i'm out i got nothing you know so there's that
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 511.74 525.27 <o,f0,female> in terms of the content of it you look at stories you think well what are stories but mystery boxes there's a fundamental question in tv the first act is called the teaser it's literally the teaser it's the big question so you're drawn into it then of course there's another question and it goes on
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 552.04 557.41 <o,f0,female> with mystery boxes that i started feeling like compelled then there's the thing of like mystery in terms of imagination
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 559.13 562.94 <o,f0,female> the withholding of information you know doing that intentionally
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 563.26 574.20 <o,f0,female> is much more engaging whether it's like the shark in jaws if spielberg 's mechanical shark bruce had worked it would not be remotely as scary you would have seen it too much in alien they never really showed the alien terrifying
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 574.91 582.17 <o,f0,female> even in a movie like a romantic comedy the graduate they're having that date remember and they're in the car and it's loud and so they put the top up
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 592.74 596.68 <o,f0,male> this idea stretching the sort of paradigm a little bit but the idea of
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 608.50 619.11 <o,f0,male> right well it's not e t is about divorce e t is about a heartbroken divorce crippled family and ultimately this kid who can't find his way die hard right crazy great fun action adventure movie in a building
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 619.57 628.15 <o,f0,male> it's about a guy who 's on the verge of divorce he 's showing up to la tail between his legs there are great scenes maybe not the most amazing dramatic scenes in the history of time but
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 644.49 644.67 <o,f0,female> and
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 650.09 651.61 <o,f0,female> dealing with his place in the world
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 653.44 662.79 <o,f0,female> how he 's going to you know make it work in this new town this is one of my favorite scenes ever and this is a scene that you wouldn't necessarily think of when you think of jaws but it's an amazing
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 743.90 752.66 <o,f0,female> it's why when people like do sequels or rip off movies you know of a genre they're ripping off the wrong thing you're not supposed to rip off the shark or the monster you gotta rip off you know if you
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 766.32 773.55 <o,f0,female> you know you go to the theater you're just so excited to see anything the moment the lights go down is often the best part you know and you're full of that amazing
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 786.72 794.67 <o,f0,female> whether it's a tv an ipod computer cell phone it's funny i'm an as i said apple fanatic and one day about a year or so ago i was
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 795.80 806.35 <o,f0,female> signing on online in the morning to watch steve jobs keynote cause i always do and he came on he was presenting the video ipod and what was on the enormous ipod behind him lost
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 826.70 836.89 <o,f0,male> guys who had some visual effects experience but the point was that they were doing things that were using these mystery boxes that they had everyone has now what i realize is what my grandfather did for me when i was a kid
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 847.66 856.12 <o,f0,male> using infinity software they stopped making fifteen years ago he 's doing stuff that looks as amazing as stuff i've seen released from hollywood
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 856.58 865.59 <o,f0,male> the most incredible sort of mystery i think is now the question of what comes next because it is now democratized so now the creation of media
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 865.96 872.64 <o,f0,male> is it's everywhere the stuff that i was lucky and begging for to get when i was a kid is now ubiquitous and so there's an amazing sense
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 884.84 897.16 <o,f0,male> you know lectures and stuff that to someone who wants to write go write do your thing it's free you know you don't need permission to go write but now i can say go make your movie there's nothing stopping you from going out there and getting the technology you can lease rent buy
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 897.99 905.27 <o,f0,male> off the shelf that is either as good or just as good as the stuff that's being used by the you know quote unquote
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 913.72 924.47 <o,f0,male> i did mission impossible iii we had amazing visual effects stuff ilm did the effects it was incredible and sort of like my dream to be involved and there are a couple of sequences in the movie like these couple of
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 955.83 968.42 <o,f0,male> so my favorite visual effect in the movie is the one i'm about to show you and it's a scene in which tom 's character wakes up he 's drowsy he 's crazy out of it and the guy wakes up and he shoves this gun in his nose and shoots this little capsule into his brain that he 's going to use later to kill him as bad guys
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 996.28 1005.76 <o,f0,female> there are three things you don't want to do number two is don't hurt tom 's nose so eddie has this gun and he 's the greatest guy he 's like this really sweet english guy he 's like sorry i don't want to hurt you i'm like you gotta we have to make this look
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 1006.21 1019.97 <o,f0,female> and i realized that we had to do something cause it wasn't working just as it was and i literally like thought back to what i would have done using the super eight camera that my grandfather got me sitting in that room and i realized that hand didn't have to be eddie marsan 's it could be tom 's
JJAbrams_2007 1 JJAbrams_2007 1036.42 1038.21 <o,f0,female> ask for any more money so here
