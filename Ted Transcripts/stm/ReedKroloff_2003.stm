ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 12.81 23.80 <o,f0,male> to be new at ted it's like being the last high school virgin you know that all of the cool people are there doing it
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 24.50 32.20 <o,f0,male> and you're on the outside you're at home you're like the raspyni brothers where you've got your balls in cold water
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 32.40 42.85 <o,f0,male> and you just play with your fingers all day and then you get invited and you're on the inside and
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 43.47 49.84 <o,f0,male> it's everything you hoped it would be it's exciting and there's music playing all of the time and then suddenly it's over
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 50.37 64.52 <o,f0,male> and it's only taken five minutes and you want to go back and do it again but i really appreciate being here and thank you chris and also thank you deborah patton for making this possible so anyway
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 65.04 79.02 <o,f0,male> talk about architecture a little bit within the subject of creation and optimism and if you put creation and optimism together you've got two choices that you can talk about you can talk about creationism
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 93.73 105.21 <o,f0,male> any kind of conversation about architecture which is in fact what you were just talking about what was going on here setting up ted small scale architecture at the present time can't really
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 111.37 117.08 <o,f0,male> the world trade center and what's been going on there what it means to us
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 117.69 118.51 <o,f0,male> because
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 119.21 124.72 <o,f0,male> if architecture is what i believe it to be which is the built form of our cultural ambitions
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 125.71 132.02 <o,f0,male> what do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 132.12 143.43 <o,f0,male> a situation that represents somebody else's cultural ambitions relative to us and our own opportunity to make something new there
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 155.71 163.58 <o,f0,male> and made it a subject for common conversation i don't remember in my twenty year career of practicing and writing about architecture a time when five
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 163.95 173.56 <o,f0,male> sat me down at a table and asked me very serious questions about zoning fire exiting safety concerns and whether carpet burns
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 184.63 196.04 <o,f0,male> you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way and so now we're going to think about architecture in a very different way we're going to think about it like this how many of you saw usa today today
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 196.63 205.62 <o,f0,male> there it is looks like that there's the world trade center site on the front cover they've made a selection they've chosen a project by daniel
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 206.18 219.49 <o,f0,male> the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture child prodigy piano player he started on the squeeze box and moved to a little more serious issue a bigger instrument and now to an even larger instrument upon which to
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 220.01 231.45 <o,f0,male> his particular brand of de constructivist magic as you see here he was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition after six previous
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 232.25 240.33 <o,f0,male> firms struck out with things that were so stupid and banal that even the city of new york was forced to go oh i'm really sorry we screwed up
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 242.01 250.57 <o,f0,male> can we do this again from the top except use some people with a vague hint of talent instead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 251.85 264.36 <o,f0,male> hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities let 's bring in some real architects for a change and so we got this or we had a choice of that oh stop clapping
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 265.90 275.32 <o,f0,male> it's too late that is gone this was a scheme by a team called think a new york based team and then there was that one which was the libeskind scheme this one
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 275.88 286.14 <o,f0,male> this is going to be the new world trade center a giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it now i don't know what you think but i think this is a pretty stupid decision
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 287.11 294.89 <o,f0,male> because what you've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 295.76 306.50 <o,f0,male> but that's what we're going to do but i want you to think about these things in terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that american architecture represents and that these two things talk about very specifically
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 306.71 315.83 <o,f0,male> and that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects in trying to decide whether we want architecture from the kind of technocratic
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 325.48 333.27 <o,f0,male> chemical or something that's more of a romantic solution now i don't mean romantic as in this is a nice place to take someone on a date
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 333.71 345.34 <o,f0,male> i mean romantic in the sense of there are things larger and grander than us so in the american tradition the difference between the technocratic and the romantic would be the difference between
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 354.86 364.43 <o,f0,male> as a really truly technocratic solution a bowing to the in jefferson 's time current popular philosophy of
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 373.31 380.26 <o,f0,male> now which would you rather be a grid or manifest destiny manifest destiny
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 381.48 390.40 <o,f0,male> a big deal it sounds big it sounds important it sounds solid it sounds american ballsy serious male
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 391.43 402.05 <o,f0,male> and that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time i mean it goes on in our private lives too every single day we all want to go out and buy an audi tt don't we
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 402.46 411.04 <o,f0,male> everyone here must own one or at least they craved one the moment they saw one and then they hopped in it turned the little electronic key rather than the real key
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 411.54 418.33 <o,f0,male> zipped home on their new superhighway and drove straight into a garage that looks like a tudor castle
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 420.36 428.18 <o,f0,male> why why why do you want to do that why do we all want to do that i even owned a tudor thing once myself
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 431.32 438.18 <o,f0,male> in our nature to go ricocheting back and forth between this technocratic solution
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 438.59 444.90 <o,f0,male> and a larger sort of more romantic image of where we are so we're going to go straight into this can i have the lights off for a moment
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 445.15 454.19 <o,f0,male> i'm going to talk about two architects very very briefly that represent the current split architecturally between these two traditions of a technocratic or technological solution
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 454.77 464.74 <o,f0,male> and a romantic solution and these are two of the top architectural practices in the united states today one very young one a little more mature this is the work of a firm called shop and what you're seeing here
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 464.92 473.42 <o,f0,male> is their isometric drawings of what will be a large scale camera obscura in a public park does everybody know what a camera obscura is
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 474.07 485.61 <o,f0,male> yeah it's one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world it's sort of a little movie without any moving parts and projects it on a page and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 485.86 496.12 <o,f0,male> this is just the outlines of it and you can see does it look like a regular building no it's actually non orthogonal it's not up and down square rectangular anything like that that you'd see in a normal shape of a building
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 496.27 510.84 <o,f0,male> the computer revolution the technocratic technological revolution has allowed us to jettison normal shaped buildings traditionally shaped buildings in favor of non orthogonal buildings such as this what's interesting about it is not the shape what's interesting about it is how it's made
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 511.27 517.68 <o,f0,male> how it's made a brand new way to put buildings together something called mass customization no it is not an oxymoron
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 517.96 528.20 <o,f0,male> what makes the building expensive in the traditional sense is making individual parts custom that you can't do over and over again that's why we all live in developer houses they all want to save money by building the same thing five hundred times
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 529.09 530.72 <o,f0,male> that's because it's cheaper
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 532.08 544.45 <o,f0,male> works by an architect feeding into a computer a program that says manufacture these parts the computer then talks to a machine a computer operated machine a cad cam machine
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 544.74 555.86 <o,f0,male> that can make a zillion different changes at a moment 's notice because the computer is just a machine it doesn't care it's manufacturing the parts it doesn't see any excess cost it doesn't spend any extra time
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 556.05 562.21 <o,f0,male> it's not a laborer it's simply an electronic lathe so the parts can all be cut at the same time meanwhile
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 569.84 578.29 <o,f0,male> send a set of assembly instructions like you used to get when you were a child when you bought little models that said bolt a to b and c to d
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 578.59 586.66 <o,f0,male> and so what the builder will get is every single individual part that has been custom manufactured off site and delivered on a truck to the site
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 587.04 596.29 <o,f0,male> to that builder and a set of these instruction manuals just simple bolt a to b and they will be able to put them together here 's the little drawing that tells them how that works
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 596.87 606.06 <o,f0,male> and that's what will happen in the end you're underneath it looking up into the lens of the camera obscura lest you think this is all fiction lest you think this is all fantasy or romance
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 614.14 624.33 <o,f0,male> young architects summer series and they said well it's summer what do you do in the summer you go to the beach and when you go to the beach what do you get you get sand dunes so let 's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 624.72 634.93 <o,f0,male> so they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune they took photographs they fed the photographs into their computer program and that computer program shaped a sand dune
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 635.24 644.97 <o,f0,male> and then took that sand dune shape and turned it into at their instructions using standard software with slight modifications a set of instructions for pieces of wood
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 645.21 656.23 <o,f0,male> and those are the pieces of wood those are the instructions these are the pieces and here 's a little of that blown up what you can see is there's about six different colors and each color represents a type of wood to be cut a piece of wood to be cut
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 656.55 665.07 <o,f0,male> all of which were delivered by flat bed on a truck and hand assembled in forty eight hours by a team of eight people
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 665.23 674.50 <o,f0,male> only one of whom had ever seen the plans before only one of whom had ever seen the plans before and here comes dunescape coming up out of the courtyard
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 675.03 680.44 <o,f0,male> and there it is fully built there are only sixteen different pieces of wood
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 691.98 703.12 <o,f0,male> it's a great place for parties it was it was only up for six weeks it's got little dressing rooms and cabanas where lots of interesting things went on all summer long
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 704.19 712.52 <o,f0,male> now lest you think that this is only for the light at heart or just temporary installations this is the same firm working at the world trade center
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 721.80 730.91 <o,f0,male> and the redevelopment of the west side they were asked to design replace that bridge in six weeks building it including all of the parts manufactured
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 731.43 741.80 <o,f0,male> and they were able to do it that was their design using that same computer modeling system and only five or six really different kinds of parts a couple of struts like this some exterior cladding material
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 742.13 748.59 <o,f0,male> and a very simple framing system that was all manufactured off site and delivered by truck they were able to create that
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 758.62 763.63 <o,f0,male> you don't need any overhead lighting so the neighbors don't complain about metal highlight lighting in their face
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 763.84 773.57 <o,f0,male> here it is going across and there down the other side and you get the same kind of grandeur now let me show you quickly the opposite if i may woo pretty
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 787.59 800.30 <o,f0,male> to seduce you into something that you can do into something that will please you something that will lift your spirits something that will make you feel as if are in another world such as his nobu restaurant in new york
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 800.48 808.67 <o,f0,male> which is supposed to take you from the clutter of new york city to the simplicity of japan and the elegance of japanese
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 809.84 814.56 <o,f0,male> when it's all said and done it's got to look like seaweed said the owner
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 814.68 824.29 <o,f0,male> or his restaurant pod in philadelphia pennsylvania i want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white every single surface of this restaurant is white
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 824.72 837.74 <o,f0,male> the reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting it's all about sensuality it's all about transforming watch this i'm not touching any buttons ladies and gentlemen this is happening by itself
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 838.19 851.79 <o,f0,male> it transforms through the magic of lighting it's all about sensuality it's all about touch rosa mexicano restaurant where he transports us to the shores of acapulco up on the upper west side with this wall
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 852.15 859.30 <o,f0,male> cliff divers who there you go like that let 's see it one more time okay just to make sure that you've enjoyed it
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 860.93 872.95 <o,f0,male> and finally it's about comfort it's about making you feel good in places that you wouldn't have felt good before it's about bringing nature to the inside in the guardian tower of new york converted to a w union square i'm sorry i'm rushing
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 873.23 884.67 <o,f0,male> where we had to bring in the best horticulturists in the world to make sure that the interior of this dragged the garden space of the court garden of the union square into the building itself
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 888.60 897.39 <o,f0,male> this is a wine buying experience simplified by color and taste fizzy fresh soft luscious juicy smooth big and sweet wines
ReedKroloff_2003 1 ReedKroloff_2003 897.76 905.02 <o,f0,male> all explained to you by color and texture on the wall and finally it's about entertainment as in his headquarters for the
