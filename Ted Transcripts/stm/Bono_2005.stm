Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 13.19 13.52 <o,f0,male> well
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 28.28 36.71 <o,f0,male> thank you very much as another famous man jerry garcia said what a strange long trip
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 37.37 48.28 <o,f0,male> and he should have said what a strange long trip it's about to become at this very moment you are viewing my upper half my lower half is appearing at a different
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 56.08 63.30 <o,f0,male> two places at once but still i'm sorry i can't be with you in person i'll explain at another
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 64.13 74.59 <o,f0,male> time and though i'm a rock star i just want to assure you that none of my wishes will include a hot tub but what really turns me on about technology
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 75.11 84.15 <o,f0,male> is not just the ability to get more songs on mp three players the revolution this revolution is much bigger than that
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 109.57 118.18 <o,f0,male> if you wanted to make a film you needed a mass of equipment and a hollywood budget now you need a camera that fits in your
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 119.18 124.57 <o,f0,male> and a couple of bucks for a blank dvd imagination has been
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 125.65 133.93 <o,f0,male> from the old constraints and that really really excites me i'm excited when i glimpse that kind of thinking
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 134.28 147.13 <o,f0,male> writ large what i would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints political economic psychological whatever
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 147.79 152.66 <o,f0,male> the geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world from the
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 153.68 162.08 <o,f0,male> with which you swept away obstacles that no one knew could even be budged and that's actually what i'd like to talk about today
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 163.65 167.56 <o,f0,male> first though i should probably explain why
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 167.93 177.49 <o,f0,male> and how i got to this place it's a journey that started twenty years ago
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 178.88 186.92 <o,f0,male> you may remember that song we are the world or do they know it's christmas band aid live aid another very tall
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 195.10 204.16 <o,f0,male> was a great moment and it utterly changed my life that summer my wife ali and myself went to ethiopia
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 206.46 218.37 <o,f0,male> we went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on we lived in ethiopia for a month working at an orphanage the children had a name for me they called me the girl with the
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 221.84 227.55 <o,f0,male> don't ask anyway we found africa to be a magical place
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 229.75 235.86 <o,f0,male> big shining continent beautiful royal people anybody who ever gave anything
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 236.74 244.39 <o,f0,male> to africa got a lot more back ethiopia didn't just blow my mind it opened my mind
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 245.81 252.31 <o,f0,male> anyway on our last day at this orphanage a man handed me his baby and said
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 254.41 267.27 <o,f0,male> would you take my son with you he knew in ireland that his son would live and that in ethiopia his son would die it was the middle of that awful famine
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 269.77 270.08 <o,f0,male> well
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 270.68 274.79 <o,f0,male> i turned him down and
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 278.21 285.31 <o,f0,male> was a funny kind of sick feeling but i turned him down and it's a feeling i can't ever quite forget
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 285.78 294.50 <o,f0,male> and in that moment i started this journey in that moment i became the worst thing of all i became a rock star with
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 297.80 305.86 <o,f0,male> except this isn't the cause is it six and a half thousand africans dying every single day from aids
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 306.13 311.97 <o,f0,male> a preventable treatable disease for lack of drugs we can get in any pharmacy
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 312.61 321.88 <o,f0,male> that's not a cause that's an emergency eleven million aids orphans in africa twenty million by the end of the decade that's not a cause
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 336.24 337.13 <o,f0,male> an emergency
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 338.71 346.04 <o,f0,male> so what we're talking about here is human rights the right to live like a human
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 346.64 356.41 <o,f0,male> the right to live period and what we're facing in africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 367.37 374.90 <o,f0,male> this is about justice really this is not about charity this is about justice
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 375.70 383.68 <o,f0,male> that's right and that's too bad because we're very good at charity americans like irish people are good
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 384.67 392.86 <o,f0,male> even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford we like to give and we give a lot look at the response to the tsunami it's inspiring
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 394.48 403.93 <o,f0,male> but justice is a tougher standard than charity you see africa makes a fool of our idea of justice
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 404.54 411.32 <o,f0,male> it makes a farce of our idea of equality it mocks our pieties it doubts our concern it questions our
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 413.17 421.87 <o,f0,male> because there is no way we can look at what's happening in africa and if we're honest conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 422.30 428.67 <o,f0,male> as you heard in the film anywhere else not here not here not in america not in europe
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 430.45 437.01 <o,f0,male> a head of state that you're all familiar with admitted this to me
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 438.40 446.74 <o,f0,male> really true there is no chance this kind of hemorrhaging of human life would be accepted anywhere else other than africa
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 448.07 461.04 <o,f0,male> africa is a continent in flames and deep down if we really accepted that africans were equal to us we would all do more to put the fire out we're standing around with watering cans
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 461.76 468.60 <o,f0,male> what we really need is the fire brigade you see it's not as dramatic as the tsunami
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 470.34 476.14 <o,f0,male> crazy really when you think about it does stuff have to look like an action movie these days
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 476.48 485.10 <o,f0,male> to exist in the front of our brain the slow extinguishing of countless lives is just not dramatic enough it would appear
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 495.40 503.30 <o,f0,male> anyway i believe that that kind of thinking offends the intellectual rigor in this room
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 516.48 527.42 <o,f0,male> i want to argue with you tonight that that's our crisis i want to argue that though africa is not the front line in the war against terror it could be soon
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 528.30 535.89 <o,f0,male> every week religious extremists take another african village they're attempting to bring order to chaos well
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 536.89 545.84 <o,f0,male> why aren't we poverty breeds despair we know this despair breeds violence we know this in turbulent times isn't it cheaper
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 546.43 559.30 <o,f0,male> and smarter to make friends out of potential enemies than to defend yourself against them later the war against terror is bound up in the war against poverty
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 560.86 568.13 <o,f0,male> and i didn't say that colin powell said that now when the military are telling us that this is a war that cannot be won
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 568.52 574.96 <o,f0,male> by military might alone maybe we should listen there's an opportunity here
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 575.60 587.45 <o,f0,male> and it's real it's not spin it's not wishful thinking the problems facing the developing world afford us in the developed world a chance to re describe ourselves to the world
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 588.96 600.08 <o,f0,male> we will not only transform other people 's lives but we will also transform the way those other lives see us and that might be smart in these nervous dangerous times
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 600.84 607.18 <o,f0,male> don't you think that on a purely commercial level that anti retroviral drugs
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 607.62 615.57 <o,f0,male> great advertisements for western ingenuity and technology doesn't compassion look well on us and let 's cut the
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 616.73 629.66 <o,f0,male> crap for a second in certain quarters of the world brand eu brand usa is not at its shiniest the neon sign is fizzing and
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 631.73 633.65 <o,f0,male> someone 's put a brick through the window
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 634.14 637.05 <o,f0,male> the regional branch managers are getting nervous
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 638.04 645.87 <o,f0,male> never before have we in the west been so scrutinized our values do we have any our credibility
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 646.38 655.19 <o,f0,male> these things are under attack around the world brand usa could use some polishing and i say that as a fan you know
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 655.49 664.87 <o,f0,male> as a person who buys the products but think about it more anti retrovirals make sense but that's just the easy part
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 668.54 674.12 <o,f0,male> equality for africa that's a big expensive idea
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 675.27 682.45 <o,f0,male> you see the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference what on earth can we all do
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 684.73 694.82 <o,f0,male> well much more than we think we can't fix every problem but the ones we can i want to argue we must and because we can we must
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 695.98 708.87 <o,f0,male> this is the straight truth the righteous truth it is not a theory the fact is that ours is the first generation that can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 709.45 720.98 <o,f0,male> look across the ocean to africa and say this and mean it we do not have to stand for this a whole continent written off we do not have to stand for this
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 732.08 740.17 <o,f0,male> let me say this without a trace of irony before i back it up to a bunch of ex hippies
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 740.69 749.84 <o,f0,male> forget the sixties we can change the world i can 't you can 't as individuals but we
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 750.18 758.28 <o,f0,male> can change the world i really believe that the people in this room look at the gates foundation they've done incredible stuff unbelievable stuff
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 758.64 766.13 <o,f0,male> but working together we can actually change the world we can turn the inevitable outcomes
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 767.99 776.01 <o,f0,male> and transform the quality of life for millions of lives who look and feel rather like us when
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 778.35 786.89 <o,f0,male> i'm sorry to laugh here but you do look so different than you did in haight ashbury in the sixties
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 788.85 800.71 <o,f0,male> but i want to argue that this is the moment that you are designed for it is the flowering of the seeds you planted in earlier headier days
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 802.70 816.81 <o,f0,male> ideas that you gestated in your youth this is what excites me this room was born for this moment is really what i want to say to you tonight most of you started out wanting to change the world
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 818.07 821.42 <o,f0,male> most of you did the digital world well now
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 822.23 825.81 <o,f0,male> actually because of you it is possible to change the physical
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 830.75 833.92 <o,f0,male> and they know much more than i do so
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 834.79 848.93 <o,f0,male> why then are we not pumping our fists into the air probably because when we admit we can do something about it we've got to do something about it it is
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 850.38 864.51 <o,f0,male> pain in the arse this equality business is actually a pain in the arse but for the first time in history we have the technology we have the know how we have the cash we have the life saving drugs
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 866.11 870.38 <o,f0,male> do we have the will i hope this is obvious but
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 872.98 886.57 <o,f0,male> i'm not a hippie and i'm not really one for the warm fuzzy feeling i do not have flowers in my hair actually i come from punk rock the clash wore big army boots not
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 888.72 896.41 <o,f0,male> but i know toughness when i see it and for all the talk of peace and love on the west coast there was muscle
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 898.29 907.10 <o,f0,male> to the movement that started out here you see idealism detached from action is just a dream
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 907.81 914.46 <o,f0,male> but idealism allied with pragmatism with rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit is
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 916.13 924.80 <o,f0,male> very exciting it's very real it's very strong and it's very present in a crowd like you
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 926.25 939.57 <o,f0,male> last year at data this organization i helped set up we launched a campaign to summon this spirit in the fight against aids and extreme poverty we're calling it the one campaign
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 940.25 951.51 <o,f0,male> it's based on our belief that the action of one person can change a lot but the actions of many coming together as one can change the world
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 952.35 962.86 <o,f0,male> well we feel that now is the time to prove we're right there are moments in history when civilization redefines itself
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 963.43 972.80 <o,f0,male> we believe this is one we believe that this could be the time when the world finally decides that the wanton loss of life in africa is just no longer
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 982.19 992.13 <o,f0,male> who live on planet earth momentum has been building lurching a little but it's building this year is a test for us all
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 992.78 998.50 <o,f0,male> especially the leaders of the g eight nations who really are on the line here
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 998.93 1000.64 <o,f0,male> with all the world in history watching
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1001.80 1005.88 <o,f0,male> i have been of late disappointed with the bush administration
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1006.52 1015.07 <o,f0,male> they started out with such promise on africa they made some really great promises and actually have fulfilled a lot of them
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1015.42 1022.01 <o,f0,male> but some of them they haven 't they don't feel the push from the ground is the truth
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1024.99 1033.20 <o,f0,male> but my disappointment has much more perspective when i talk to american people and i hear their worries about the deficit
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1033.66 1043.44 <o,f0,male> the fiscal well being of their country i understand that but there's much more push from the ground than you'd think if we got organized
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1044.83 1058.89 <o,f0,male> what i try to communicate and you can help me if you agree is that aid for africa is just great value for money at a time when america really needs it putting it in the crassest possible terms
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1059.55 1070.98 <o,f0,male> the investment reaps huge returns not only in lives saved but in goodwill stability and security that we'll gain
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1072.46 1081.91 <o,f0,male> so this is what i hope that you will do if i could be so bold and not have it deducted from my number of wishes
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1084.28 1094.69 <o,f0,male> what i hope is that beyond individual merciful acts that you will tell the politicians to do right by
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1095.87 1097.80 <o,f0,male> by america and by the world
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1098.56 1104.43 <o,f0,male> give them permission if you like to spend their political capital and your financial
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1105.18 1119.46 <o,f0,male> your national purse on saving the lives of millions of people that's really what i would like you to do because we also need your intellectual capital your ideas your skills your ingenuity
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1120.18 1127.10 <o,f0,male> and you at this conference are in a unique position some of the technologies we've been talking about you invented
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1137.92 1142.20 <o,f0,male> pushed the boundaries and we'd like you to
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1167.39 1173.74 <o,f0,male> a lot of people are getting together and working under this umbrella i told you about earlier the one campaign
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1176.18 1182.65 <o,f0,male> i think they just have one idea in their mind which is
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1183.84 1189.44 <o,f0,male> where you live in the world should not determine whether you live
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1195.30 1195.92 <o,f0,female> like
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1196.86 1206.53 <o,f0,male> god is watching what we do when the history books get written i think our age will be remembered for three things really it's just three things
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1207.78 1216.49 <o,f0,male> this whole age will be remembered for the digital revolution yes the war against terror yes and what we did
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1217.55 1220.24 <o,f0,male> or did not do to put out the fires
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1222.10 1226.80 <o,f0,male> some say we can't afford to i say
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1228.42 1229.49 <o,f0,male> we can't afford not to
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1242.01 1245.71 <o,f0,male> the ones that ted has offered to grant
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1248.10 1255.34 <o,f0,male> you see if this is true and i believe it is that the digital world you all created has
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1256.48 1263.03 <o,f0,male> the creative imagination from the physical constraints of matter this should be a piece
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1268.93 1269.80 <o,f0,male> that this started out as a
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1270.88 1277.20 <o,f0,male> wishes most of them impossible some of them impractical and one or two of them certainly immoral
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1282.21 1282.65 <o,f0,male> business
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1283.63 1286.75 <o,f0,male> gets to be addictive you know what i mean when somebody else is picking up the
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1288.77 1296.05 <o,f0,male> anyway here 's number one i wish for you to help

Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1346.63 1355.83 <o,f0,male> we can't afford to be cool and sit this one out i do believe if we build a movement that's one million americans strong
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1358.45 1361.11 <o,f0,male> we will have the ear of congress
Bono_2005 1 Bono_2005 1363.94 1372.73 <o,f0,male> be the first page in condi rice 's briefing book and right into the oval office if there's one million americans and i really know this
