AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 13.94 20.35 <o,f0,female> when i was a little girl if you say a word often enough it becomes you and having grown up in a segregated city baltimore maryland
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 20.91 30.32 <o,f0,female> i sort of use that idea to go around america with a tape recorder thank god for technology to interview people thinking that if i walked in their words which is also why i don't wear shoes when i perform
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 61.60 62.31 <o,f0,female> sank
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 65.72 68.96 <o,f0,female> and bam it went down it went down
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 70.12 73.39 <o,f0,female> came up wow some century
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 75.57 79.09 <o,f0,female> so this is his answer about a defining moment in american history
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 81.74 82.61 <o,f0,female> american history i
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 83.08 85.05 <o,f0,female> think there's one you can't say
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 104.69 107.36 <o,f0,female> funny little play bit the atlanta airport is a modern
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 112.73 116.94 <o,f0,female> and on to a destination and these trains are smooth and
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 117.32 124.82 <o,f0,female> quiet and they're efficient and there's a voice on the train you know the voice was a human voice you see in the old days we
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 132.24 133.82 <o,f0,female> imitating robots
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 135.99 136.20 <o,f0,female> this
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 147.62 156.83 <o,f0,female> and they're just about to close the pneumatic doors and that voice without losing a beat says because of late entry we're delayed thirty seconds just
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 158.51 163.81 <o,f0,female> at this couple with hateful eyes and the couple 's going like this you know shrinking well
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 166.96 171.37 <o,f0,female> i do that to steel my nerves and so i imitate a train call
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 174.26 177.26 <o,f0,female> time has come you see well some of
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 187.60 189.11 <o,f0,female> at the foot of calvary
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 190.05 191.20 <o,f0,female> up you know just
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 192.16 194.62 <o,f0,female> i see a baby a
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 197.35 201.08 <o,f0,female> i know it's hispanic because she's speaking spanish
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 209.40 209.68 <o,f0,female> i
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 213.10 215.51 <o,f0,female> what is your considered opinion
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 217.96 219.40 <o,f0,female> and the baby looks you know the way
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 247.34 254.54 <o,f0,female> what huck did you see here 's huck he 's an illiterate kid he 's had no schooling but there's something in him and the official truth
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 254.87 256.67 <o,f0,female> the truth was the law was that
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 258.86 261.02 <o,f0,female> you see and huck gets on the raft
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 325.71 330.93 <o,f0,female> and more and more less and less awareness of the pain or the other
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 343.53 343.74 <o,f0,female> and
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 348.16 348.83 <o,f0,female> kids i
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 352.77 353.20 <o,f0,female> that's
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 362.49 370.21 <o,f0,female> talk about risk taking i'm going to do somebody that nobody likes you know most actors want to do characters that are
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 371.55 380.23 <o,f0,female> well not always but the notion especially at a conference like this i like to inspire people but since this was called risk taking i'm doing somebody who i never do
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 380.76 386.10 <o,f0,female> because she's so unlikeable that one person actually came backstage and told me to take her out of the show she
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 390.88 401.04 <o,f0,female> like this as a good thing but there are certain other connotations to the word risk and the same thing about the word nature what is nature maxine greene who 's a wonderful philosopher who 's
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 402.94 412.18 <o,f0,female> and was the head of a philosophy great big philosophy kind of an organization i went to her and asked her what are the two things that she doesn't
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 412.59 418.67 <o,f0,female> know that she still wants to know and she said well personally i still feel like i have to curtsey when i see the president of my university
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 419.17 433.27 <o,f0,female> and i still feel as though i've got to get coffee for my male colleagues even though i've outlived most of them and she said and then intellectually i don't know enough about the negative imagination and september eleventh certainly taught us that that's a whole area we don't investigate so
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 433.70 446.41 <o,f0,female> this piece is about a negative imagination it raises questions about what nature is what mother nature is and about what a risk can be and i got this in the maryland correctional institute for women everything i do is word for word
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 446.79 455.65 <o,f0,female> off of a tape and i title things because i think people speak in organic poems and this is called a mirror to her mouth and this is an inmate named paulette jenkins
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 462.69 464.90 <o,f0,female> i began to learn how to cover
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 467.36 471.56 <o,f0,female> because i didn't want nobody to know that this was happening in my home
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 472.53 476.78 <o,f0,female> i want everybody to think we were a normal family i mean we had all the materialistic
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 485.23 489.70 <o,f0,female> ran out of excuses about how we got black eyes and busted lips and bruises
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 490.20 492.45 <o,f0,female> i didn't had no more excuses and he beat me
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 493.48 497.52 <o,f0,female> but that didn't change the fact that it was a nightmare for my family it was a nightmare
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 498.80 503.76 <o,f0,female> and i failed them dramatically because i allowed it to go on and on and on
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 504.55 514.19 <o,f0,female> but the night that myesha got killed and the intensity just grew and grew and grew until one night we came home from getting drugs
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 515.42 518.48 <o,f0,female> and he got angry with myesha and he started beating her and he put her in a
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 520.30 530.34 <o,f0,female> oh he would use a belt he had a belt because he had this warped perverted thing that myesha was having sex with her little brother and they was fondling each other that would be his reason i'm just talking about the particular night
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 532.91 542.19 <o,f0,female> and so he put her in the bathtub and i was in the bedroom with the baby and four months before this happened four months before myesha died i thought i could really fix this man
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 543.03 549.34 <o,f0,female> so i had a baby by him insane thinking that if i gave him his own kid he would leave mine alone
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 549.82 550.93 <o,f0,female> and it didn't work
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 553.82 558.83 <o,f0,female> up with three children houston myesha and dominic who was four months old when i came to
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 560.32 565.87 <o,f0,female> and i was in the bedroom like i said he had her in the bathroom and he he every time he hit her she would fall
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 574.20 577.03 <o,f0,female> but i dared not to move i didn't move i didn't even go and see what was
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 578.35 579.60 <o,f0,female> i just sat there and
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 589.14 591.93 <o,f0,female> and so she set there for about four or five hours
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 604.46 607.54 <o,f0,female> all around her head was just swollen her head was about two sizes of
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 619.09 620.30 <o,f0,female> the next morning she was
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 625.26 627.43 <o,f0,female> on her for school and he got very excited
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 632.14 636.10 <o,f0,female> she was dead i didn't even want to accept the fact that she was dead so i
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 638.40 639.93 <o,f0,female> there was no thing nothing
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 641.02 646.80 <o,f0,female> coming out of her mouth he said he said he said we can 't we can't let nobody find out about this he say you've got to help me
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 647.16 648.06 <o,f0,female> i agree
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 649.77 654.84 <o,f0,female> i mean i've been keeping a secret for years and years and years so it just seemed like second hand to me just to keep on keeping it a secret
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 656.77 658.04 <o,f0,female> so we went to the mall
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 659.07 661.40 <o,f0,female> and we told a police that we had like lost her
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 665.29 666.74 <o,f0,female> we told a security guard
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 667.95 669.18 <o,f0,female> that she was missing
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 671.03 671.33 <o,f0,female> she
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 712.68 713.02 <o,f0,female> to
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 722.57 725.51 <o,f0,female> so that's an investigation of the negative imagination
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 734.89 741.29 <o,f0,female> search for an american character with my tape recorder i thought that i was going to go around america and find it in all its aspects bull riders
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 742.18 749.27 <o,f0,female> pig farmers drum majorettes but i sort of got tripped on race relations because my first big show was a show
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 762.70 774.56 <o,f0,female> it's a kind of an aria i would say and in many tapes that i have everybody knows that the los angeles riots happened because four cops beat up a black man named rodney king it was captured on video tape technology
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 775.10 784.94 <o,f0,female> was played all over the world everybody thought the four cops would go to jail they did not so there were riots and what a lot of people forget is there was a second trial ordered by george bush sr and that
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 786.89 792.49 <o,f0,female> came back with two cops going to jail and two cops declared innocent i was at that trial
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 803.21 812.09 <o,f0,female> whose stores had been burned to the ground and so this woman misters young soon han i suppose will have taught me the most that i have learned about race and she
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 821.86 824.97 <o,f0,female> in society and this is called swallowing the bitterness
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 826.70 828.31 <o,f0,female> i used to believe
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 834.33 834.66 <o,f0,female> many
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 852.60 853.32 <o,f0,female> but at the end
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 854.96 860.70 <o,f0,female> when we were in such turmoil and having all the financial problems and all the mental
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 861.47 864.11 <o,f0,female> i began to really realize that
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 867.33 874.52 <o,f0,female> out of this society and we are nothing why why do we have to be
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 889.93 895.51 <o,f0,female> amount of money to survive we didn't get any because we have a
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 900.26 903.41 <o,f0,female> and a house and we are
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 909.15 909.41 <o,f0,female> i
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 918.52 926.22 <o,f0,female> many african americans probably think that they won by the trial i was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict and all the
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 926.58 933.28 <o,f0,female> they were having a party they celebrated all of south central all the churches and they say well finally
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 938.78 939.66 <o,f0,female> well what about
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 957.32 958.33 <o,f0,female> as i do
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 961.59 964.81 <o,f0,female> he is the only model for black community i don't care jesse jackson
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 968.99 971.65 <o,f0,female> model of non violence non violence and
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 972.64 974.34 <o,f0,female> they would all like to be
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 984.66 991.42 <o,f0,female> and i wonder if that is really justice for them to get their rights
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 991.69 993.14 <o,f0,female> in that way
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1001.15 1003.18 <o,f0,female> sitting here alone and watching
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1004.31 1005.03 <o,f0,female> they became
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1020.04 1023.22 <o,f0,female> korean victims and other victims who
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1044.22 1049.23 <o,f0,female> in the mainstream that's why i understand that's why i have a mixed feeling about the verdict
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1050.42 1052.68 <o,f0,female> i wish that i wish that
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1053.48 1060.56 <o,f0,female> i wish that i could be part of the enjoyment i wish that i could live together with black people
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1066.75 1067.48 <o,f0,female> the riot
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1069.63 1070.54 <o,f0,female> much difference
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1077.65 1078.01 <o,f0,female> how do you
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1087.03 1088.24 <o,f0,female> igniting fire
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1090.14 1091.00 <o,f0,female> still there
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1093.90 1096.30 <o,f0,female> out any time
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1111.76 1113.78 <o,f0,female> the other reason that i don't wear
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1118.43 1124.16 <o,f0,female> and get into the feet of somebody walking really in somebody else's shoes and i told you that in
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1124.47 1138.78 <o,f0,female> you know i didn't give you the year but in seventy nine i thought that i was going to go around and find bull riders and pig farmers and people like that and i got sidetracked on race relations finally i did find a bull rider two years ago and i've been going to the rodeos with him and we've bonded
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1139.56 1147.70 <o,f0,female> and he 's the lead in an op ed i did about the republican convention he 's a republican i won 't say anything about my party affiliation
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1149.16 1161.21 <o,f0,female> anyway so this is my dear dear brent williams and this is on toughness in case anybody needs to know about being tough for the work that you do i think there's a real lesson in this and this is called
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1165.72 1176.47 <o,f0,female> well i'm an optimist i mean basically i'm an optimist i mean you know i mean it's like my wife jolene her family 's always saying you know you ever think he 's just a born loser it seems like he has so much bad luck you know but then
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1185.63 1196.35 <o,f0,female> and i mean funny things like this happen i was in a doctor 's office last cat scan and there was a reader 's digest october two thousand and two it was like seven ways to get lucky
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1220.13 1233.10 <o,f0,female> and she was saying you're going to make me look like an idiot because i've never been to college and i wouldn't be talking professional or anything i said well look the woman talked to me for four hours you know if i wasn't talking you know like you know she wanted me to talk i don't think she would even come out here
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1258.19 1264.44 <o,f0,female> movie eight seconds i mean like pat o 'mealey always said when i was a boy he say you know you got more try than any kid i ever seen and

AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1331.27 1337.78 <o,f0,female> and so they sewed my face up and then they had to straighten out my nose and they took these rods and shoved them up
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1 AnnaDeavereSmith_2005 1352.09 1358.49 <o,f0,female> thing was once they shoved those rods up there and straightened my nose out i could breathe and i hadn't been able to
