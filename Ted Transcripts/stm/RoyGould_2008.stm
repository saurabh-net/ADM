RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 13.14 20.68 <o,f0,male> less than a year from now the world is going to celebrate the international year of astronomy which marks the four hundredth anniversary of
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 21.24 28.13 <o,f0,male> galileo 's first glimpse of the night sky through a telescope in a few months the world is also going to celebrate
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 28.79 39.44 <o,f0,male> the launch of a new invention from microsoft research which i think is going to have as profound an impact on the way we view the universe as galileo did four centuries ago
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 40.90 42.76 <o,f0,male> it's called the worldwide telescope
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 43.42 54.70 <o,f0,male> and i want to thank ted and microsoft for allowing me to bring it to your attention and i want to urge you when you get a chance to give it a closer look at the ted lab downstairs
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 55.76 57.18 <o,f0,male> the worldwide telescope
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 70.40 72.87 <o,f0,male> to produce a holistic view of the universe
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 78.04 87.77 <o,f0,male> it's going to change the way we do astronomy it's going to change the way we teach astronomy and i think most importantly it's going to change the way we see ourselves in the universe
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 89.40 94.62 <o,f0,male> if we were having this ted meeting in our grandparent 's day that might not be so big a claim
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 97.99 101.57 <o,f0,male> you weren't allowed to drink if you were a woman you weren't allowed to vote
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 103.56 106.51 <o,f0,male> looked up at the stars and the milky way on a summer night
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 108.85 122.33 <o,f0,male> was thought to be the entire universe in fact the head of harvard 's observatory back then gave a great debate in which he argued that the milky way galaxy was the entire universe harvard was wrong big time of course we know today
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 123.03 134.10 <o,f0,male> that galaxies extend far beyond our own galaxy we can see all the way out to the edge of the observable universe all the way back in time almost to the moment of the big bang itself
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 134.80 141.28 <o,f0,male> we can see across the entire spectrum of light revealing worlds that had previously been invisible
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 143.15 154.54 <o,f0,male> we see these magnificent star nurseries where nature has somehow arranged for just the right numbers and just the right sizes of stars to be born for life to arise
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 156.44 157.60 <o,f0,male> alien worlds we see
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 165.06 173.83 <o,f0,male> we see black holes at the heart of our galaxy in the milky way and elsewhere in the universe where time itself seems to stand still
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 176.63 186.86 <o,f0,male> our view of the universe has been disconnected and fragmented and i think that many of the marvelous stories that nature has to tell us have fallen through the cracks and that's changing
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 187.12 197.30 <o,f0,male> i want to just briefly mention three reasons why my colleagues and i in astronomy and in education are so excited about the worldwide telescope and why we think it's truly
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 200.02 202.79 <o,f0,male> it enables you to experience the universe
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 213.89 215.48 <o,f0,male> you can tour the universe
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 215.82 223.08 <o,f0,male> with astronomers as your guides and i'm not talking here about just experts who are telling you what you're seeing but
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 224.43 232.62 <o,f0,male> people who are passionate about the various nooks and crannies of the universe who can share their enthusiasm and can make the universe a welcoming place
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 233.45 247.07 <o,f0,male> and third you can create your own tours you can share them with friends you can create them with friends and that's the part that i think i'm most excited about because i think that at heart we are all storytellers and in telling stories
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 247.87 251.36 <o,f0,male> each of us is going to understand the universe in our own way
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 252.11 253.57 <o,f0,male> we're going to have a personal universe
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 254.46 258.80 <o,f0,male> i think we're going to see a community of storytellers evolve and emerge
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 266.95 268.08 <o,f0,male> when i ask people
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 268.45 273.88 <o,f0,male> how does the night sky make you feel they often say oh tiny i feel tiny and insignificant
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 274.79 277.55 <o,f0,male> well our gaze fills the universe
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 278.09 280.95 <o,f0,male> and thanks to the creators of the worldwide telescope
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 282.29 285.11 <o,f0,male> we can now start to have a dialogue with the universe
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 286.19 290.27 <o,f0,male> i think the worldwide telescope will convince you that we may be tiny
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 302.17 302.29 <o,f0,female> i
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 313.67 320.84 <o,f0,male> so what you're seeing here is a wonderful presentation but it's one of the tours and actually this tour is one that was created earlier
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 321.14 329.87 <o,f0,male> and the tours are all totally interactive so that if i were to go somewhere you may be watching a tour and you can pause anywhere along the way pull up other information
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 340.83 351.93 <o,f0,male> microsoft this is a project that worldwide telescope is dedicated to jim gray who 's our colleague and a lot of his work that he did is really what makes this project possible
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 366.14 371.83 <o,f0,male> a free download thank you craig mundie and it'll be available at the website
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 374.20 376.35 <o,f0,male> which is something new and so
RoyGould_2008 1 RoyGould_2008 377.54 390.25 <o,f0,male> what you've seen today is less than a fraction of one percent of what is in here and in the ted lab we have a tour that was created by a six year old named benjamin that will knock your socks off so we'll see you there thank you
