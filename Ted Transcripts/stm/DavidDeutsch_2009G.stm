DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 16.38 25.20 <o,f0,female> sure that throughout the hundred thousand odd years of our species existence and even before
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 26.34 33.69 <o,f0,female> our ancestors looked up at the night sky and wondered what stars are wondering therefore
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 34.38 41.24 <o,f0,female> how to explain what they saw in terms of things unseen
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 45.03 54.92 <o,f0,male> so most people only wondered that occasionally like today in breaks from whatever normally preoccupied them but
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 55.60 60.71 <o,f0,male> what normally preoccupied them also involved yearning to know
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 63.13 71.35 <o,f0,male> how to prevent their food supply from sometimes failing and how they could rest when they were tired without
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 80.25 86.96 <o,f0,female> i bet those prehistoric cave artists would have loved to know how to draw better
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 88.89 97.88 <o,f0,female> in every aspect of their lives they wished for progress just as we do but
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 99.15 109.12 <o,f0,female> failed almost completely to make any they didn't know how to discoveries like fire
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 111.53 120.42 <o,f0,female> so rarely that from an individual 's point of view the world never improved nothing new was learned
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 142.30 147.66 <o,f0,female> but never mind the symbols think how many
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 177.01 185.10 <o,f0,female> ancient dream that had always eluded the alchemists was achieved through these same theories that explained starlight
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 185.74 193.34 <o,f0,female> and other ancient mysteries and new unexpected phenomena that all that
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 202.35 214.26 <o,f0,female> about stars and all those other urgent problems they had they even arrived at answers such as myths that dominated their lives yet
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 214.99 223.27 <o,f0,female> bore almost no resemblance to the truth the tragedy of that protracted stagnation
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 224.49 236.32 <o,f0,female> isn't sufficiently recognized i think these were people with brains of essentially the same design that eventually did discover all those things but
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 245.29 254.44 <o,f0,male> the event that revolutionized the human condition and changed the universe or so we should hope because that event was the
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 264.19 276.36 <o,f0,male> has been growing relentlessly now what had changed what were people now doing for the first time that made that difference between stagnation and
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 276.99 287.17 <o,f0,female> open ended discovery how to make that difference is surely the most important universal truth that it is possible to know
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 288.40 294.81 <o,f0,female> worryingly there is no consensus about what it is so i'll tell you but
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 295.11 302.20 <o,f0,female> i'll have to backtrack a little first before the scientific revolution they believed
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 302.43 309.43 <o,f0,male> that everything important knowable was already known enshrined in ancient writings institutions
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 309.77 317.34 <o,f0,male> and in some genuinely useful rules of thumb which were however entrenched as dogmas along with many
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 317.97 325.66 <o,f0,female> falsehoods so they believed that knowledge came from authorities that actually knew very little and
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 335.25 344.60 <o,f0,female> priests traditions and rulers which is why the scientific revolution had to have a wider context the enlightenment
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 345.00 356.08 <o,f0,female> a revolution in how people sought knowledge trying not to rely on authority take no one 's word for it but
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 356.73 371.06 <o,f0,female> that can't be what made the difference authorities had been rejected before many times and that rarely if ever caused anything like the scientific revolution at the time what they thought distinguished science
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 371.51 382.46 <o,f0,female> was a radical idea about things unseen known as empiricism all knowledge derives from the senses
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 383.80 396.67 <o,f0,female> well we've seen that that can't be true it did help by promoting observation and experiment but from the outset it was obvious that there was something horribly wrong with it
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 397.67 407.59 <o,f0,female> knowledge comes from the senses in what language certainly not the language of mathematics in which galileo rightly said the book of nature is written
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 408.63 419.75 <o,f0,female> look at the world you don't see equations carved on to mountainsides if you did it would be because people had carved them by the way why don't we do that
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 425.54 428.97 <o,f0,female> is inadequate because well
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 437.73 445.92 <o,f0,female> we don't see those nuclear reactions in stars we don't see the origin of species we don't see
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 446.55 454.02 <o,f0,female> the curvature of space time and other universes but we know about those things how
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 455.42 463.85 <o,f0,female> the classic empiricist answer is induction the unseen resembles the
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 464.79 475.86 <o,f0,female> but it doesn 't you know what the clinching evidence was that space time is curved it was a photograph not of space time but of an eclipse with
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 478.86 491.02 <o,f0,female> the evidence for evolution some rocks and some finches and parallel universes again dots there rather than there on a screen what we see in all these cases
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 491.86 503.83 <o,f0,female> no resemblance to the reality that we conclude is responsible only a long chain of theoretical reasoning and interpretation connects them
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 504.79 512.78 <o,f0,female> say creationists so you admit it's all interpretation no one has ever seen evolution we see
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 513.88 520.43 <o,f0,female> you have your interpretation we have ours yours comes from guesswork ours from the bible
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 521.89 530.09 <o,f0,female> what creationist and empiricists both ignore is that in that sense no one has ever seen a bible
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 532.05 544.68 <o,f0,female> that the eye only detects light which we don't perceive brains only detect nerve impulses and they don't perceive even those as what they really are namely electrical crackles so
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 545.07 559.35 <o,f0,female> we perceive nothing as what it really is our connection to reality is never just perception it's always as karl popper put it theory laden
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 574.72 583.88 <o,f0,female> so were testable conjectures the great innovation that opened the intellectual prison gates no contrary to what's usually
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 594.52 602.83 <o,f0,female> has got a testable prediction consider the ancient greek myth explaining seasons
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 604.08 611.49 <o,f0,female> hades god of the underworld kidnaps persephone the goddess of spring and negotiates a forced marriage contract
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 611.99 619.82 <o,f0,female> requiring her to return regularly and lets her go and each year she is magically compelled to return
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 620.35 628.64 <o,f0,female> and her mother demeter goddess of the earth is sad and makes it cold and barren
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 630.10 637.40 <o,f0,female> myth is testable if winter is caused by demeter 's sadness then it must happen
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 637.73 647.08 <o,f0,female> everywhere on earth simultaneously so if the ancient greeks had only known that austrailia is at its warmest when demeter is at her saddest
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 647.90 650.20 <o,f0,female> have known that their theory is false
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 651.16 660.78 <o,f0,female> so what was wrong with that myth and with all pre scientific thinking and what then made that momentous difference
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 661.41 673.71 <o,f0,female> i think there is one thing you have to care about and that implies testability the scientific method the enlightenment and everything and here is the crucial thing
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 674.28 683.28 <o,f0,female> there is such a thing as a defect in a story i don't just mean a logical defect i mean a bad explanation what does that mean
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 683.77 692.47 <o,f0,female> well explanation is an assertion about what's there unseen that accounts for what's seen because
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 692.89 706.63 <o,f0,female> the explanatory role of persephone 's marriage contract could be played equally well by infinitely many other ad hoc entities why a marriage contract and not any other reason for
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 707.13 716.05 <o,f0,female> regular annual action here is one persephone wasn't released she escaped and returns every spring
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 716.62 724.39 <o,f0,female> to take revenge on hades with her spring powers she cools his domain with spring air
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 725.56 735.79 <o,f0,female> venting heat up to the surface creating summer that accounts for the same phenomena as the original myth it's equally testable
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 736.40 743.78 <o,f0,female> yet what it asserts about reality is in many ways the opposite and that is possible because
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 743.96 751.49 <o,f0,female> the details of the original myth are unrelated to seasons except via the myth itself
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 752.26 760.31 <o,f0,female> this easy variability is the sign of a bad explanation because
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 761.04 771.01 <o,f0,female> without a functional reason to prefer one of countless variants advocating one of them in preference to the others
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 772.60 786.27 <o,f0,female> so for the essence of what makes the difference to enable progress seek good explanations the ones that can't be easily varied while still explaining the phenomena
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 787.21 794.44 <o,f0,female> our current explanation of seasons is that the earth 's axis is tilted like that so
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 794.66 806.26 <o,f0,female> each hemisphere tilts toward the sun for half the year and away for the other half better put that up that's a good explanation
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 807.18 814.31 <o,f0,female> hard to vary because every detail plays a functional role for instance we know independently of seasons
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 818.61 828.66 <o,f0,female> heated less and that a spinning sphere in space points in a constant direction and the tilt also explains
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 829.52 839.20 <o,f0,female> angle of elevation at different times of year and predicts that the seasons will be out of phase in the two hemispheres if they'd been observed in phase
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 839.55 850.32 <o,f0,female> the theory would have been refuted but now the fact that it's also a good explanation hard to vary makes the crucial difference
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 851.17 860.05 <o,f0,female> if the ancient greeks had found out about seasons in australia they could have easily varied their myth to predict that
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 860.43 867.85 <o,f0,female> for instance when demeter is upset she banishes heat from her vicinity into the other hemisphere where it makes
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 868.61 881.11 <o,f0,female> so being proved wrong by observation and changing their theory accordingly still wouldn't have got the ancient greeks one jot closer to understanding seasons because their explanation was
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 881.98 892.68 <o,f0,female> easy to vary and it's only when an explanation is good that it even matters whether it's testable if the axis tilt theory had been refuted its defenders would have had nowhere to go
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 893.15 901.44 <o,f0,female> no easily implemented change could make that tilt cause the same seasons in both hemispheres
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 902.25 909.64 <o,f0,female> the search for hard to vary explanations is the origin of all progress it's the basic
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 920.39 927.64 <o,f0,female> but the more important one is explanationless theories whenever you're told that some existing statistical trend
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 927.86 935.91 <o,f0,female> will continue but you aren't given a hard to vary account of what causes that trend you're being told a wizard did it
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 951.48 959.05 <o,f0,female> has been settled because there is evidence that a given percentage of our political opinions are genetically inherited
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 968.40 980.01 <o,f0,female> presumably so are their own that the truth consists of hard to vary assertions about reality is the most important fact
DavidDeutsch_2009G 1 DavidDeutsch_2009G 980.28 989.41 <o,f0,female> about the physical world it's a fact that is itself unseen yet impossible to vary thank you
