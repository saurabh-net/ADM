Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 15.77 33.23 <o,f0,male> last month the encyclopaedia britannica announced that it is going out of print after two hundred and forty four years which made me nostalgic because i remember playing a game with the colossal encyclopedia set in my hometown library back when i was a kid maybe twelve years old
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 33.23 35.97 <o,f0,male> and i wondered if i could update that game
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 35.97 39.42 <o,f0,male> not just for modern methods but for the modern me
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 39.42 47.51 <o,f0,male> so i tried i went to an online encyclopedia wikipedia and i entered the term earth you can start anywhere this time i chose earth
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 47.58 58.49 <o,f0,male> and the first rule of the game is pretty simple you just have to read the article until you find something you don 't know and preferably something your dad doesn 't even know and in this case
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 58.5 64.59 <o,f0,male> i quickly found this the furthest point from the center of the earth is not the tip of mount everest like i might have thought
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 64.7 68.17 <o,f0,male> it 's the tip of this mountain mount chimborazo in ecuador
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 68.43 74.61 <o,f0,male> the earth spins of course as it travels around the sun so the earth bulges a little bit around the middle like some earthlings
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 126.35 131.58 <o,f0,male> that took me to this wet and warm band of the tropics that encircles the earth
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 138.48 148.5 <o,f0,male> those are not cartographers lines like latitude or the borders between nations they are astronomical phenomena caused by the earth 's tilt and they change
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 148.5 161.39 <o,f0,male> they move they go up they go down in fact for years the tropic of cancer and the tropic of capricorn have been steadily drifting towards the equator at the rate of about fifteen meters per year and nobody told me that i didn 't know it
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 161.41 163.5 <o,f0,male> chimborazo so
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 164.68 180.33 <o,f0,male> to keep the game going i just have to find another term and look that one up since i 'm already in the tropics i chose tropical rainforest famous for its diversity human diversity there are still dozens and dozens of uncontacted tribes living on this planet
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 207.76 209.33 <o,f0,male> which turn out to be
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 209.38 219.68 <o,f0,male> beetles now i clicked on this on purpose but if i 'd somehow gotten here by mistake it does remind me for the band see the beatles for the car see volkswagon beetle but i am here
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 240.9 257.07 <o,f0,male> you are astonishingly well adapted there are scavenger beetles that pick the skin and flesh off of bones in museums there are predator beetles that attack other insects and still look pretty cute to us there are beetles that roll little balls of dung
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 257.07 270.66 <o,f0,male> great distances across the desert floor to feed to their hatchlings this reminded the ancient egyptians of their god khepri who renews the ball of the sun every morning which is how that dung rolling scarab became
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 276.92 291.25 <o,f0,male> have the most romantic flirtation in the animal kingdom fireflies are not flies fireflies are beetles fireflies are coleoptera and coleoptera communicate in other ways as well like my next link the chemical language
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 294.7 298.78 <o,f0,male> took me to a video of a sea urchin having sex
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 305.78 310.57 <o,f0,male> and the link to aphrodisiac now that 's something that increases sexual desire possibly
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 310.77 327.43 <o,f0,male> chocolate there is a compound in chocolate called phenethylamine that might be an aphrodisiac but as the article mentions because of enzyme breakdown it 's unlikely that phenethylamine will reach your brain if taken orally so those of you who only eat your chocolate you might have to experiment
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 336.72 338.32 <o,f0,male> but not when they 're together like that
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 338.89 343.77 <o,f0,male> i do like sympathy i do like magic so when i click on sympathetic magic i get
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 344.49 346.24 <o,f0,male> sympathetic magic
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 350.66 354.86 <o,f0,male> sympathetic magic is imitation if you imitate something maybe you can have an effect on it
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 366.63 375.75 <o,f0,male> we 've got tens of thousands years old artwork common themes around the globe include large wild animals and tracings of human hands usually
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 381.76 399.21 <o,f0,male> so even though i don 't know why a paleolithic person would trace his hand or blow pigment on it from a tube i can easily picture how he did it and i really don 't think it 's that different form our own little dominant hand avatar right there that i 'm going to use now to click on the term for hand
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 399.77 417.69 <o,f0,male> go to the page for hand where i found the most fun and possibly embarrassing bit of trivia i 've found in a long time it 's simply this the back of the hand is formally called the opisthenar now that 's embarrassing because up until now every time i 've said i know it like the back
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 425.68 436.01 <o,f0,male> and the link i clicked on here well lemurs monkeys and chimpanzees have the little opisthenar i click on chimpanzee and i get our closest genetic relative
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 436.65 439.83 <o,f0,male> pan troglodytes the name we give him means cave dweller
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 441.04 443.24 <o,f0,male> he doesn 't he lives in rainforests and savannas
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 443.24 450.77 <o,f0,male> it 's just that we 're always thinking of this guy as lagging behind us evolutionarily or somehow uncannily creeping up on us and in some cases
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 450.85 453.02 <o,f0,male> he gets places before us
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 453.02 455.89 <o,f0,male> like my next link the almost irresistible link
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 467.41 476.84 <o,f0,male> and more specifically his skeleton wound up in the smithsonian museum getting picked clean by beetles in between those two landmarks in ham 's life
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 477.57 481.16 <o,f0,male> he flew into space he experienced weightlessness
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 481.16 487.43 <o,f0,male> and re entry months before the first human being to do it soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 487.69 504.58 <o,f0,male> when i click on yuri gagarin 's page i get this guy who was surprisingly short in stature huge in heroism top estimates soviet estimates put this guy at one point six five meters that is less than five and a half feet tall max possibly because he was malnourished as a child
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 504.67 513 <o,f0,male> germans occupied russia a nazi officer took over the gagarin household and he and his family built and lived in a mud hut
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 513.22 516.44 <o,f0,male> years later the boy from that cramped mud hut
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 516.51 527.42 <o,f0,male> would grow up to be the man in that cramped capsule on the tip of a rocket who volunteered to be launched into outer space the first one of any of us to
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 527.45 530.93 <o,f0,male> really physically leave this planet and he didn 't just leave it
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 531.6 535.73 <o,f0,male> he circled it once fifty years later as a tribute
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 535.88 539.65 <o,f0,male> the international space station which is still up there tonight
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 541.93 544.92 <o,f0,male> with gagarin 's orbit at the exact same time of day
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 544.99 550.9 <o,f0,male> and filmed it so you can go online and you can watch over one hundred minutes of what must have been
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 558.27 562.34 <o,f0,male> you can click on one more link you can come back to earth
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 562.8 564.48 <o,f0,male> return to where you started
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 566.72 570.26 <o,f0,male> you can finish your game you just need to find one more fact that you didn 't know
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 570.53 572.79 <o,f0,male> and for me i quickly landed on this one
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 573.39 585.5 <o,f0,male> the earth has a tolerance of about seventeen percent from the reference spheroid which is less than the twenty two percent allowed in billiard balls this is the kind of fact i would have loved as a boy i found it myself
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 585.53 595.19 <o,f0,male> it 's got some math that i can do i 'm pretty sure my dad doesn 't know it what this means is that if you could shrink the earth to the size of a billiard ball
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 608.18 612.73 <o,f0,male> sea creatures making love in the deep blue sea you just shrink
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 615.02 616.99 <o,f0,male> it would be as smooth
Rives_2012S 1 Rives_2012S 621.05 623.08 <o,f0,male> with a slight bulge around the middle
