BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 18.97 21.93 <o,f0,male> and the way i 'm going to do that is present to you
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 22.07 36.95 <o,f0,male> five animations of five of my poems and let me just tell you a little bit of how that came about because the mixing of those two media is a sort of unnatural or unnecessary act but when i was united states poet laureate
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 37.49 39.42 <o,f0,male> and i love saying that
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 44.67 52.45 <o,f0,male> when i was him back then i was approached by j walter thompson the ad company and they were hired
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 52.45 66.5 <o,f0,male> sort of by the sundance channel and the idea was to have me record some of my poems and then they would find animators to animate them and i was initially resistant because i always think poetry can stand alone by itself
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 66.5 82.68 <o,f0,male> attempts to put my poems to music have had disastrous results in all cases and the poem if it 's written with the ear already has been set to its own verbal music as it was composed
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 82.68 93.11 <o,f0,male> and surely if you 're reading a poem that mentions a cow you don 't need on the facing page a drawing of a cow i mean let 's let the reader do a little work
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 93.11 102.4 <o,f0,male> but i relented because it seemed like an interesting possibility and also i 'm like a total cartoon junkie since childhood

BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 142.32 157.06 <o,f0,male> i created a poetry channel on delta airlines that lasted for a couple of years so you could tune into poetry as you were flying and my sense is it 's a good thing to get poetry off the shelves and more into public life
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 157.19 173.49 <o,f0,male> start a meeting with a poem that would be an idea you might take with you when you get a poem on a billboard or on the radio or on a cereal box or whatever it happens to you so suddenly that you don 't have time to deploy your anti poetry deflector shields
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 173.74 175.78 <o,f0,male> that were installed in high school
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 178.3 190.36 <o,f0,male> so let us start with the first one it 's a little poem called budapest and in it i reveal or pretend to reveal the secrets of the creative

BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 195.67 213.21 <o,f0,male> my pen moves along the page like the snout of a strange animal shaped like a human arm and dressed in the sleeve of a loose green sweater i watch it sniffing the paper ceaselessly intent as any forager
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 220.92 228.15 <o,f0,male> it wants only to be here tomorrow dressed perhaps in the sleeve of a plaid shirt
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 228.15 241.88 <o,f0,male> nose pressed against the page writing a few more dutiful lines while i gaze out the window and imagine budapest or some other city where i have never been
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 262.23 269.64 <o,f0,male> she said you know poetry is harder than writing which i found both erroneous and profound
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 312.42 318.89 <o,f0,male> legs at the knees if they come with that feature and fix them into the tiny wooden chairs
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 319.17 329.24 <o,f0,male> all afternoon they face one another the man in the brown suit the woman in the blue dress perfectly motionless perfectly

BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 342.01 348.24 <o,f0,male> very funny but how would you like it if you never knew from one day to the next
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 355.81 362.18 <o,f0,male> or sitting down there amidst the wallpaper staring straight ahead
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 362.58 364.75 <o,f0,male> with your little plastic
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 382.73 397.54 <o,f0,male> slippage and the poem begins with a certain species of forgetfulness that someone called literary amnesia in other words forgetting the things that you have read
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 403.19 411.24 <o,f0,male> of the author is the first to go followed obediently by the title the plot the heartbreaking conclusion

BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 416.49 418.05 <o,f0,male> never even heard of
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 418.67 420.7 <o,f0,male> it is as if one by one

BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 566.27 583.55 <o,f0,male> i wondered about you when you told me never to leave a box of wooden strike anywhere matches just lying around the house because the mice might get into them and start a fire but your face was absolutely straight
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 611.78 621.63 <o,f0,male> against rough hewn beam the sudden flare and the creature for one bright shining moment suddenly thrust ahead of his time

BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 655.3 664.54 <o,f0,male> thank you and the last poem is called the dead i wrote this after a friend 's funeral but not so much about the friend as something the eulogist kept saying as all eulogists tend to do which is
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 664.54 676.58 <o,f0,male> how happy the deceased would be to look down and see all of us assembled and that to me was a bad start to the afterlife having to witness your own funeral and feel gratified so the little poem is called
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 680.76 685.02 <o,f0,male> the dead are always looking down on us they say
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 701.85 706.17 <o,f0,male> and when we lie down in a field or on a couch
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 706.17 722.62 <o,f0,male> drugged perhaps by the hum of a warm afternoon they think we are looking back at them which makes them lift their oars and fall silent and wait like parents for us to close our eyes

BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 763.38 767.2 <o,f0,male> if it has a subject the subject is adolescence

BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 775.27 782.91 <o,f0,male> do you realize that if you had started building the parthenon on the day you were born you would be all done in only one more year
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 783.43 789.37 <o,f0,male> of course you couldn 't have done that all alone so never mind you 're fine just being yourself
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 789.43 791.71 <o,f0,male> you 're loved for just being you

BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 810.92 814.07 <o,f0,male> of course there will be time for all that later in your life
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 814.19 820.82 <o,f0,male> after you come out of your room and begin to blossom or at least pick up all your socks
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 822.4 828.49 <o,f0,male> for some reason i keep remembering that lady jane grey was queen of england when she was only fifteen
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 829.41 832.8 <o,f0,male> but then she was beheaded so never mind her as a role model
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 837.82 842.69 <o,f0,male> when he was your age franz schubert was doing the dishes for his family
BillyCollins_2012 1 BillyCollins_2012 843.06 851.78 <o,f0,male> but that did not keep him from composing two symphonies four operas and two complete masses as a youngster
