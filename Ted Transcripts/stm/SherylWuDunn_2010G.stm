SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 17.27 18.96 <o,f0,female> that i want to talk to you about today
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 19.58 25.83 <o,f0,female> rarely makes the front pages it however is enormous in both scale and
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 27.59 35.55 <o,f0,female> look you all are very well traveled this is tedglobal after all but i do hope to take you to some places you've never been to before
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 36.78 38.23 <o,f0,female> so let 's start off in china
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 38.71 40.47 <o,f0,female> this photo was taken two weeks ago
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 55.33 68.59 <o,f0,female> this is in the dabian mountains in the remote part of hubei province in central china dai manju is thirteen years old at the time the story starts she lives with her parents her two brothers and her great aunt
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 69.03 78.48 <o,f0,female> they have a hut that has no electricity no running water no wristwatch no bicycle and they share this great splendor with a very large pig
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 81.07 92.45 <o,f0,female> was in sixth grade when her parents said we 're going to pull you out of school because the thirteen dollar school fees are too much for us you're going to be spending the rest of your life in the rice paddies why would we waste this money on you
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 92.81 97.47 <o,f0,female> this is what happens to girls in remote areas turns out that dai manju was the
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 98.05 99.11 <o,f0,female> best pupil in her
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 100.12 108.93 <o,f0,female> she still made the two hour trek to the schoolhouse and tried to catch every little bit of information that seeped out of the doors we wrote about her in the new york times
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 109.60 111.09 <o,f0,female> we got a flood of donations
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 113.80 118.86 <o,f0,female> thirteen dollar checks because new york times readers are very generous in tiny amounts
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 122.04 125.80 <o,f0,female> but then we got a money transfer for dollar ten thousand
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 127.04 127.83 <o,f0,female> really nice guy
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 128.27 138.74 <o,f0,female> we turned the money over to that man there the principal of the school he was delighted he thought oh i can renovate the school i can give scholarships to all the girls you know if they work hard and stay in school
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 139.32 146.99 <o,f0,female> so dai manju basically finished out middle school she went to high school she went to vocational school for accounting
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 147.27 154.26 <o,f0,female> she scouted for jobs down in guangdong province in the south she found a job she scouted for jobs for her classmates and her friends
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 154.77 163.49 <o,f0,female> she sent money back to her family they built a new house this time with running water electricity a bicycle no
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 165.07 167.06 <o,f0,female> what we saw was a natural
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 167.96 178.76 <o,f0,female> it is rare to get an exogenous investment in girls education and over the years as we followed dai manju we were able to see that she was able to move out of a vicious cycle
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 178.96 187.15 <o,f0,female> and into a virtuous cycle she not only changed her own dynamic she changed her household she changed her family her village the village became
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 187.66 195.91 <o,f0,female> a real stand out of course most of china was flourishing at the time but they were able to get a road built to link them up to the rest of china
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 196.35 200.15 <o,f0,female> and that brings me to my first major of two tenets of
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 209.43 211.44 <o,f0,female> in the nineteenth century it was slavery
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 211.85 213.98 <o,f0,female> in the twentieth century it was totalitarianism
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 214.73 221.59 <o,f0,female> the cause of our time is the brutality that so many people face around the world because of their gender
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 225.78 228.55 <o,f0,female> she's exaggerating well let me ask you this question
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 241.21 243.55 <o,f0,female> most of you well you know this latter group you're wrong
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 245.03 250.37 <o,f0,female> there are true enough in europe and the west when women and men have
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 254.95 265.73 <o,f0,female> in most of the rest of the world that's not the case in fact demographers have shown that there are anywhere between sixty million and one hundred million missing females in the current population
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 267.07 274.39 <o,f0,female> and you know it happens for several reasons for instance in the last half century more girls were discriminated to death
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 274.97 283.75 <o,f0,female> all the people killed on all the battlefields in the twentieth century sometimes it's also because of the sonogram girls get aborted before they're even born
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 284.80 292.57 <o,f0,female> when there are scarce resources this girl here for instance is in a feeding center in ethiopia the entire center was filled with girls like her
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 303.08 307.23 <o,f0,female> boy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate because they depend upon the breast
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 310.04 311.73 <o,f0,female> from one to five
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 312.57 317.35 <o,f0,female> girls die at a fifty percent higher mortality rate than boys in all of india
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 322.71 327.29 <o,f0,female> the morality of all the right and wrong of it all and just on a purely practical level
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 339.17 340.66 <o,f0,female> three reasons why this is the case
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 343.39 352.16 <o,f0,female> one of the persistent causes of poverty and you know when you educate a boy his family tends to have fewer kids but only slightly
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 352.53 354.85 <o,f0,female> when you educate a girl she tends to
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 360.17 370.04 <o,f0,female> it has to do with spending it's kind of like the dirty little secret of poverty which is that not only do poor people take in very little income
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 370.85 384.70 <o,f0,female> also the income that they take in they don't spend it very wisely and unfortunately most of that spending is done by men so research has shown if you look at people who live under two dollars a day one metric of poverty
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 386.04 389.83 <o,f0,female> two percent of that take home pay goes to this basket here in education
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 398.67 404.41 <o,f0,female> just take four percentage points and put it into this basket you would have a transformative effect
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 406.05 410.62 <o,f0,female> the last reason has to do with women being part of the solution not the problem
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 411.57 420.30 <o,f0,female> you need to use scarce resources it's a waste of resources if you don't use someone like dai manju bill gates put it very well when he was traveling through saudi arabia
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 420.48 427.23 <o,f0,female> he was speaking to an audience much like yourselves however two thirds of the way there was a barrier on this side was
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 428.05 432.98 <o,f0,female> and then the barrier and this side was women and someone from this side of the room got up and said mister
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 433.82 440.83 <o,f0,female> we have here as our goal in saudi arabia to be one of the top ten countries when it comes to technology do you think we'll make it
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 441.62 444.28 <o,f0,female> so bill gates as he was staring out at the audience he said
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 444.63 450.99 <o,f0,female> if you're not fully utilizing half the resources in your country there is no way you will get anywhere near the top ten
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 451.36 452.78 <o,f0,female> so here is bill of arabia
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 455.36 458.85 <o,f0,female> so what would some of the specific challenges look like
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 460.36 466.34 <o,f0,female> i would say on the top of the agenda is sex trafficking and i'll just say two things about this
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 467.13 470.98 <o,f0,female> the slavery at the peak of the slave trade in the seventeen
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 473.29 477.64 <o,f0,female> there were about eighty thousand slaves transported from africa to the new world
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 478.84 487.29 <o,f0,female> now modern slavery according to state department rough statistics there are about eight hundred thousand ten times the number
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 487.74 495.91 <o,f0,female> that are trafficked across international borders and that does not even include those that are trafficked within country borders which is a substantial portion
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 509.36 513.12 <o,f0,female> you can buy a girl trafficked for few hundred dollars
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 513.53 516.28 <o,f0,female> which means she's actually more disposable
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 517.20 525.51 <o,f0,female> but you know there is progress being made in places like cambodia and thailand we don't have to expect a world where girls are bought and sold or killed
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 526.66 529.94 <o,f0,female> the second item on the agenda is maternal mortality
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 533.16 536.05 <o,f0,female> in this part of the world is a wonderful event
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 548.93 552.71 <o,f0,female> you know it's not as though we don't have the technological solution
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 553.18 555.87 <o,f0,female> but these women have three strikes against them
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 556.47 559.68 <o,f0,female> they are poor they are rural and they are female
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 566.48 570.97 <o,f0,female> end up with an injury and the most devastating injury is obstetric fistula
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 571.85 574.76 <o,f0,female> tearing during obstructed labor that leaves a woman
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 576.35 577.83 <o,f0,female> let me tell you about mahabuba
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 578.40 591.61 <o,f0,female> she lives in ethiopia she was married against her will at age thirteen she got pregnant ran to the bush to have the baby but you know her body was very immature and she ended up having obstructed labor
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 595.73 597.49 <o,f0,female> that meant she was incontinent
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 597.86 599.28 <o,f0,female> she couldn't control her wastes
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 616.34 618.84 <o,f0,female> she fought off the hyenas with that
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 619.86 625.46 <o,f0,female> and the next morning she new if she could get to a nearby village where there was a foreign missionary she would be saved
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 629.25 631.28 <o,f0,female> all the way thirty miles to that
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 638.13 640.65 <o,f0,female> her to a nearby fistula hospital
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 642.90 645.71 <o,f0,female> she was repaired with a three hundred and fifty dollar operation
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 660.88 664.89 <o,f0,female> the problem she's moved out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 668.16 672.35 <o,f0,female> talk about some of the solutions and there are predictable solutions
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 684.16 694.27 <o,f0,female> she tends to have kids later on in life she tends to have fewer kids and those kids that she does have she educates them in a more enlightened fashion with economic opportunity it can be
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 702.27 715.74 <o,f0,female> at the time she was miserable she was beaten every single day by her husband who was unemployed he was kind of a gambler type and unemployable therefore and took his frustrations out on her well when she had her second daughter her
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 717.91 721.03 <o,f0,female> i think you'd better get a second wife saima 's not going to produce you
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 725.70 728.90 <o,f0,female> at the time there was a microlending group in the village
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 730.59 731.78 <o,f0,female> sixty five dollar loan
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 735.31 737.00 <o,f0,female> and she started an embroidery business
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 738.54 751.16 <o,f0,female> the merchants liked her embroidery it sold very well and they kept asking for more and when she couldn't produce enough she hired other women in the village pretty soon she had thirty women in the village working for her embroidery business
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 751.67 753.72 <o,f0,female> and then when she had to
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 754.78 762.64 <o,f0,female> transport all of the embroidery goods from the village to the marketplace she needed someone to help her do the transport so she hired her husband
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 763.03 771.53 <o,f0,female> so now they're in it together he does the transportation and distribution and she does the production and sourcing and now they have a third daughter and
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 771.79 780.02 <o,f0,female> the daughters all of them are being tutored in education because saima knows what's really important which brings me to the final element which is education
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 782.08 793.37 <o,f0,female> larry summers when he was chief economist at the world bank once said that it may well be that the highest return on investment in the developing world is in girls education
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 802.78 807.72 <o,f0,female> she didn't go to school actually she had never been to school not to a lick one day
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 850.22 856.26 <o,f0,female> so at nine years of age beatrice started in first grade after all she'd never been to a lick of school with a six year
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 857.28 862.74 <o,f0,female> no matter she was just delighted to be in school she rocketed to the top of her class she stayed at the top of
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 866.98 878.06 <o,f0,female> and then in high school she scored brilliantly on the national examinations so that she became the first person in her village ever to come to the united states on scholarship
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 878.90 882.31 <o,f0,female> two years ago she graduated from connecticut college
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 883.58 890.38 <o,f0,female> on the day of her graduation she said i am the luckiest girl alive because of a goat
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 894.85 899.49 <o,f0,female> so you see how transformative little bits of help can be
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 899.90 901.83 <o,f0,female> i want to give you a reality check look
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 902.79 907.96 <o,f0,female> u s aid helping people is not easy and there have been books that have criticized u s
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 909.20 917.35 <o,f0,female> bill easterly 's book there's a book called dead aid you know the criticism is fair it isn't easy you know people say how
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 917.99 930.64 <o,f0,female> of all water well projects a year later failed when i was in zimbabwe we were touring a place with the village chief he wanted to raise money for a secondary school and there was some construction a few yards away and i said what
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 933.09 935.23 <o,f0,female> turns out that it's a failed irrigation project
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 935.65 940.39 <o,f0,female> few yards away was a failed chicken coop one year all the chickens died and no one wanted to put the chickens in there
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 940.98 945.00 <o,f0,female> it's true but we think that you don't through the baby out with the bathwater you actually
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 949.47 952.60 <o,f0,female> we also think that individuals can make a difference
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 953.26 956.43 <o,f0,female> and they should because individuals together
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 971.12 972.47 <o,f0,female> what's in it for you
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 979.94 981.01 <o,f0,female> research shows
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 983.20 988.30 <o,f0,female> you have all of your material needs taken care of which most of us all of us here in this room do
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 989.53 996.04 <o,f0,female> research shows that there are very few things in life that can actually elevate your level of happiness
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 996.54 998.15 <o,f0,female> one of those things is
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 1005.25 1011.33 <o,f0,female> it's an anecdote that i'll leave you with and that is the story of an aid worker in darfur
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 1012.72 1019.48 <o,f0,female> here was was a woman who had worked in darfur seeing things that no human being should see
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 1020.69 1021.98 <o,f0,female> throughout her time there
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 1035.28 1038.89 <o,f0,female> and she saw something that made her break down in tears
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 1045.84 1047.23 <o,f0,female> the great fortune
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 1047.71 1049.49 <o,f0,female> to be born in a country
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 1052.56 1055.33 <o,f0,female> we not only can feed clothe and
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 1065.60 1067.13 <o,f0,female> that with that great fortune
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 1074.13 1074.73 <o,f0,female> you me
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 1075.83 1077.47 <o,f0,female> all won the lottery of life
SherylWuDunn_2010G 1 SherylWuDunn_2010G 1088.07 1091.11 <o,f0,female> feel happier and help save the world thank you very much
