BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 21.01 23.74 <o,f0,female> i woke up the morning after i gave that talk
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 24.55 27.28 <o,f0,female> with the worst vulnerability hangover
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 35.22 37.39 <o,f0,female> the first time i left was to meet a friend
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 57.13 64.34 <o,f0,female> that i became a researcher to avoid vulnerability and that when being vulnerable emerged from my data
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 65.56 68.89 <o,f0,female> as absolutely essential to whole hearted living
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 69.8 73.26 <o,f0,female> i told these five hundred people that i had a breakdown
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 121.23 125.04 <o,f0,female> then we 'd have to break into his dorm room and then erase the tape
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 140.8 142.46 <o,f0,female> 'm thinking to myself
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 152.82 154.37 <o,f0,female> so i looked back up and she said
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 155.89 159.1 <o,f0,female> are you really going to try to break in
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 159.48 162.29 <o,f0,female> and steal the video before they put it on youtube
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 183.93 186.96 <o,f0,female> if five hundred turns into one thousand
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 194 197.34 <o,f0,female> i had no contingency plan for four million
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 203.98 209.73 <o,f0,female> and maybe the hardest part about my life ending is that i
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 224.75 226.49 <o,f0,female> staying right under the radar
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 228.98 233.99 <o,f0,female> but i want to talk about what i 've learned there 's two things that i 've learned in the last year
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 242.44 244.14 <o,f0,female> and that myth
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 257.97 263.86 <o,f0,female> how many of you honestly when you 're thinking about doing something vulnerable or saying something vulnerable
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 263.91 269.43 <o,f0,female> think god vulnerability 's weakness this is weakness how many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 283.98 285.57 <o,f0,female> vulnerability is not weakness
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 289.42 291.04 <o,f0,female> emotional risk
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 291.37 293.85 <o,f0,female> exposure uncertainty
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 294.6 296.65 <o,f0,female> it fuels our daily lives
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 300.57 304.34 <o,f0,female> that vulnerability is our most accurate
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 304.97 307.38 <o,f0,female> measurement of courage
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 309.13 312.79 <o,f0,female> to be vulnerable to let ourselves be seen to be honest
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 313.88 331.98 <o,f0,female> one of the weird things that 's happened is after the ted explosion i got a lot of offers to speak all over the country everyone from schools and parent meetings to fortune five hundred companies and so many of the calls went like this hey dr brown we loved your tedtalk we 'd like you to come in and speak
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 332.69 336.47 <o,f0,female> we 'd appreciate it if you wouldn 't mention vulnerability or shame
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 345.27 353.31 <o,f0,female> there 's three big answers this is mostly to be honest with you from the business sector innovation creativity and change
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 355.68 357.26 <o,f0,female> so let me go on the record
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 378.85 381.13 <o,f0,female> there 's nothing more vulnerable than that
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 381.91 385.26 <o,f0,female> adaptability to change is all about vulnerability
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 386.64 391.1 <o,f0,female> the second thing in addition to really finally understanding
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 391.54 395.51 <o,f0,female> the relationship between vulnerability and courage the second thing i learned is this
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 397.12 399.15 <o,f0,female> we have to talk about shame
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 401.6 403.78 <o,f0,female> and i 'm going to be really honest with you
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 407.6 414.09 <o,f0,female> and that became the focus because of the tedtalk and i 'm not kidding i 'll give you an example about
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 414.33 423.42 <o,f0,female> three months ago i was in a sporting goods store buying goggles and shin guards and all the things that parents buy at the sporting goods store about from a hundred
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 423.42 427.34 <o,f0,female> feet away this is what i hear vulnerability ted vulnerability ted
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 437.76 444.81 <o,f0,female> our family motto is lock and load i am not a natural vulnerability researcher
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 461.01 463.69 <o,f0,female> you 're the shame researcher who had the breakdown
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 488.62 490.57 <o,f0,female> and she looks back and does this
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 495.4 497.88 <o,f0,female> we watched your tedtalk in my book
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 497.94 503.6 <o,f0,female> then we read your book and we renamed ourselves the breakdown babes
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 505.11 509.24 <o,f0,female> she said our tagline is we 're falling apart and it feels
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 526.05 528.26 <o,f0,female> like ninja barbie but i 'm vulnerability ted
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 530.23 547.69 <o,f0,female> i thought i 'm going to leave that shame stuff behind because i spent six years studying shame before i really started writing and talking about vulnerability and i thought thank god because shame is this horrible topic no one wants to talk about it it 's the best way to shut people down on an airplane what do you do i study shame
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 561.38 565.78 <o,f0,female> i was reminded of a cardinal rule not a research rule
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 566.15 568.78 <o,f0,female> but a moral imperative
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 574.4 579.94 <o,f0,female> and i did not learn about vulnerability and courage and creativity and innovation
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 580.08 582.64 <o,f0,female> from studying vulnerability
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 582.83 585.88 <o,f0,female> i learned about these things from studying shame
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 586.72 590.04 <o,f0,female> and so i want to walk you in to shame
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 593.44 595.29 <o,f0,female> the swampland of the soul
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 596.72 602.73 <o,f0,female> and we 're going to walk in and the purpose is not to walk in and construct a home and live there
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 603.28 605.52 <o,f0,female> it is to put on some galoshes
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 606.98 609.28 <o,f0,female> and walk through and find our way around
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 631.97 639.04 <o,f0,female> because you cannot talk about race without talking about privilege and when people start talking about privilege they get paralyzed by shame
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 639.93 642.36 <o,f0,female> we heard a brilliant simple solution
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 642.54 645.36 <o,f0,female> to not killing people in surgery which is have a checklist
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 646.35 651.52 <o,f0,female> you can 't fix that problem without addressing shame because when they teach those folks how to suture
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 651.81 655.02 <o,f0,female> they also teach them how to stitch their self worth
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 655.57 657.12 <o,f0,female> to being all powerful
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 657.64 659.62 <o,f0,female> and all powerful folks don 't need
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 667.41 669.01 <o,f0,female> myshkin ingawale
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 684.12 693.17 <o,f0,female> and he said i saw this need so you know what i did i made it and everybody just burst into applause and they were like yes and he said and it didn 't work
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 693.62 697.1 <o,f0,female> and then i made it thirty two more times
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 718.2 720.94 <o,f0,female> because very few people here are afraid to fail
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 722.27 725.68 <o,f0,female> and no one who gets on the stage so far that i 've seen has not failed
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 731.45 733.17 <o,f0,female> because of shame
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 733.85 737.63 <o,f0,female> there 's a great quote that saved me this past year by theodore roosevelt
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 737.68 741.14 <o,f0,female> a lot of people refer to it as the man in the arena quote
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 756.23 759.45 <o,f0,female> whose face is marred with dust and blood
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 768.59 772.79 <o,f0,female> but when he fails when he loses he does so daring greatly
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 774.25 776.64 <o,f0,female> and that 's what this conference to me is about
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 777.05 785.9 <o,f0,female> that 's what life is about about daring greatly about being in the arena when you walk up to that arena and you put your hand on the door and you think i 'm going in and i 'm going to try this
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 786.18 789.91 <o,f0,female> shame is the gremlin who says
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 794.99 798.21 <o,f0,female> i know your dad really wasn 't in luxembourg he was in sing sing
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 804.18 808.33 <o,f0,female> i know you don 't think that you 're pretty enough or smart enough or talented enough or powerful enough
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 819.05 820.68 <o,f0,female> and say i 'm going to do this
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 837.09 839.08 <o,f0,female> and if you can talk it out of that one
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 845.27 851.62 <o,f0,female> shame is a focus on self guilt is a focus on behavior shame is i am bad guilt is i did something bad
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 853.06 861.14 <o,f0,female> how many of you if you did something that was hurtful to me would be willing to say i 'm sorry i made a mistake how many of you would be willing to say that
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 861.79 867.95 <o,f0,female> guilt i 'm sorry i made a mistake shame i 'm sorry i am a mistake
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 873.06 881.81 <o,f0,female> shame is highly highly correlated with addiction depression violence aggression bullying suicide eating disorders
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 889.73 899.21 <o,f0,female> the ability to hold something we 've done or failed to do up against who we want to be is incredibly adaptive it 's uncomfortable but it 's adaptive
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 902.7 907.62 <o,f0,female> the other thing you need to know about shame is it 's absolutely organized by gender
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 908.31 911.04 <o,f0,female> if shame washes over me and washes over chris
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 911.27 912.9 <o,f0,female> it 's going to feel the same
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 913.44 916.32 <o,f0,female> everyone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 916.93 922.3 <o,f0,female> we 're pretty sure that the only people who don 't experience shame are people who have no capacity for connection or empathy
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 923.25 926.6 <o,f0,female> which means yes i have a little shame no i 'm a sociopath
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 926.63 929.31 <o,f0,female> so i would opt for yes you have a little shame
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 932.68 936.45 <o,f0,female> shame feels the same for men and women but it 's organized by gender
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 963.23 971.05 <o,f0,female> i don 't know how much perfume that commercial sold but i guarantee you it moved a lot of antidepressants and anti anxiety meds
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 979.51 982.95 <o,f0,female> conflicting competing expectations about who we 're supposed to be
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 984.61 986.12 <o,f0,female> and it 's a straight jacket
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 986.97 991.57 <o,f0,female> for men shame is not a bunch of competing conflicting expectations
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1010.42 1012.21 <o,f0,female> and he said that 's convenient
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1019.33 1021.89 <o,f0,female> you say to reach out tell our story
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1049.16 1051.91 <o,f0,female> because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1053.56 1056.49 <o,f0,female> so i started interviewing men and asking questions
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1056.77 1058.7 <o,f0,female> and what i learned is this
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1059.73 1063.88 <o,f0,female> you show me a woman who can actually sit with a man in real vulnerability and fear
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1064.11 1066.7 <o,f0,female> i 'll show you a woman who 's done incredible work
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1067.56 1069.73 <o,f0,female> you show me a man who can sit with a woman
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1071.79 1074.11 <o,f0,female> can 't do it all anymore
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1075.34 1079.14 <o,f0,female> and his first response is not i unloaded the dishwasher
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1080.52 1082.65 <o,f0,female> but he really listens
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1087.12 1088.95 <o,f0,female> shame is an epidemic
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1096.56 1106.74 <o,f0,female> to find our way back to each other we have to understand how it affects us and how it affects the way we 're parenting the way we 're working the way we 're looking at each other
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1107.97 1111.25 <o,f0,female> very quickly some research by mahalik at boston college
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1111.36 1117.18 <o,f0,female> he asked what do women need to do to conform to female norms the top answers in this country
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1118.68 1122.68 <o,f0,female> nice thin modest and use all available resources for appearance
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1124.22 1131.17 <o,f0,female> when he asked about men what do men in this country need to do to conform with male norms the answers were
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1131.64 1133.55 <o,f0,female> always show emotional control
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1133.6 1135.11 <o,f0,female> work is first
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1142.23 1145.31 <o,f0,female> and know empathy because empathy 's the antidote to shame
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1145.73 1148.03 <o,f0,female> if you put shame in a petri dish
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1148.06 1152.29 <o,f0,female> it needs three things to grow exponentially secrecy silence and judgment
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1152.83 1157.03 <o,f0,female> if you put the same amount of shame in a petri dish and douse it with empathy it can 't survive
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1157.52 1161.86 <o,f0,female> the two most powerful words when we 're in struggle me too
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1162.77 1165.11 <o,f0,female> and so i 'll leave you with this thought
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1166.1 1169.68 <o,f0,female> if we 're going to find our way back to each other
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1170.52 1172.88 <o,f0,female> vulnerability is going to be that
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1174.47 1178.8 <o,f0,female> and i know it 's seductive to stand outside the arena because i think i did it my whole life
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1182.72 1185.2 <o,f0,female> when i 'm bulletproof and when i 'm perfect
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1187.25 1189.95 <o,f0,female> and that is seductive but the truth is
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1196.78 1199.56 <o,f0,female> when you got in there that 's not what we want to see
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1201.92 1203.65 <o,f0,female> we want you to go in
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1204.85 1207.36 <o,f0,female> we want to be with you and across from you
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1208.23 1209.76 <o,f0,female> and we just want
BreneBrown_2012 1 BreneBrown_2012 1210.13 1213.65 <o,f0,female> for ourselves and the people we care about and the people we work with
