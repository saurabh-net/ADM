RoryBremner_2009G 1 RoryBremner_2009G 437.15 446.17 <o,f0,male> very very difficult luckily somebody like george bush was really helpful he summed it up really at a dinner he was speaking at a dinner he said wall street got
RoryBremner_2009G 1 RoryBremner_2009G 449.80 450.23 <o,f0,male> and now it's

RoryBremner_2009G 1 RoryBremner_2009G 614.79 616.58 <o,f0,male> now he 's gone and it's great to see one of the
RoryBremner_2009G 1 RoryBremner_2009G 617.39 626.00 <o,f0,male> the worst speech makers in american history now given way to one of the greatest in obama you were there maybe on the night of his victory and he spoke to the crowd in chicago he said
RoryBremner_2009G 1 RoryBremner_2009G 627.58 630.43 <o,f0,male> if there is anyone out there

RoryBremner_2009G 1 RoryBremner_2009G 670.42 684.94 <o,f0,male> we all want to believe in president obama it's rather like that line in the film as good as it gets do you remember that film with helen hunt and jack nicholson and helen hunt says to jack nicholson what do you see in me and jack nicholson just says you make me want to be a better man
RoryBremner_2009G 1 RoryBremner_2009G 685.59 697.46 <o,f0,male> you want a leader that inspires and challenges and makes you want to be a better citizen right but at the moment it's a cicero thing we like what barack obama says but we don't do anything about it so he comes over to this country and he says
