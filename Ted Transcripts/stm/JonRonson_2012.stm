JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 27.03 42.51 <o,f0,male> every known mental disorder and it used to be back in the fifty s a very slim pamphlet and then it got bigger and bigger and bigger and now it 's eight hundred and eighty six pages long and it lists currently three hundred and seventy four mental disorders
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 91.5 104.99 <o,f0,male> crazier than i thought i was or maybe it 's not a good idea to diagnose yourself with a mental disorder if you 're not a trained professional or maybe the psychiatry profession has a strange desire to label
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 104.99 113.07 <o,f0,male> what 's essentially normal human behavior as a mental disorder i didn 't know which of these things was true but i thought it was kind of interesting and i thought maybe i should
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 113.07 119.71 <o,f0,male> meet a critic of psychiatry to get their view which is how i ended up having lunch with the scientologists
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 120.82 138.49 <o,f0,male> it was a man called brian who runs a crack team of scientologists who are determined to destroy psychiatry wherever it lies they 're called the cchr and i said to him can you prove to me that psychiatry is a pseudo science that can 't be trusted
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 138.81 141.18 <o,f0,male> and he said yes we can prove it to you
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 167.82 181.4 <o,f0,male> hardly anything he beat someone up or something and he decided to fake madness to get out of a prison sentence but he faked it too well and now he 's stuck in
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 190.7 202.66 <o,f0,male> so i got the train to broadmoor i began to yawn uncontrollably around kempton park which apparently is what dogs also do when anxious they yawn uncontrollably and we got to
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 316.81 324.69 <o,f0,male> because it would make me feel more normal and i said where 'd you get that from he said oh from a biography of ted bundy that they had at the prison library
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 350.67 353.1 <o,f0,male> i 've been in broadmoor for twelve years
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 371.78 383.02 <o,f0,male> recently it had an article about how the u s army was training bumblebees to sniff out explosives so i said to a nurse did you know that the u s army is training bumblebees to sniff out explosives
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 391.2 396.03 <o,f0,male> he said you know they 're always looking out for non verbal clues to my mental state
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 405.65 410.37 <o,f0,male> sitting like a journalist am i crossing my legs like a journalist
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 411.2 429.69 <o,f0,male> he said you know i 've got the stockwell strangler on one side of me and i 've got the tiptoe through the tulips rapist on the other side of me so i tend to stay in my room a lot because i find them quite frightening and they take that as a sign of madness they say it proves that i 'm aloof and grandiose
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 429.79 438.85 <o,f0,male> so only in broadmoor would not wanting to hang out with serial killers be a sign of madness anyway he seemed completely normal to me but what did i know
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 449.74 461.43 <o,f0,male> his hallucinations that had seemed quite cliche to begin with just vanished the minute he got to broadmoor however we have assessed him and we have determined that what he is is a psychopath
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 462.08 463.87 <o,f0,male> and in fact faking
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 476.12 487.54 <o,f0,male> and i spoke to other experts and they said the pinstriped suit classic psychopath speaks to items one and two on the checklist glibness superficial charm and grandiose sense of self worth
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 529.86 534.23 <o,f0,male> here 's the statistics one in a hundred regular people
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 544.67 550.94 <o,f0,male> although that figure rises to four percent of ceo 's and business leaders
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 567.41 573.27 <o,f0,male> capitalism at its most ruthless rewards psychopathic behavior
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 579.69 586.5 <o,f0,male> in fact capitalism perhaps at its most remorseless is a physical manifestation of psychopathy
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 587.27 589.64 <o,f0,male> it 's like a form of psychopathy that
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 698 704.18 <o,f0,male> i 've just bought myself a new car and he said you may have a new car but i 'll tell you what you don 't have a job
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 714.53 716.09 <o,f0,male> brain anomaly that makes you
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 728.47 730.79 <o,f0,male> might say that this makes you
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 764.79 769.31 <o,f0,male> and i said manipulative he said that 's leadership
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 795.43 814.02 <o,f0,male> to juvenile delinquency he said he got accepted into west point and they don 't let delinquents in west point he said no to many short term marital relationships he 's only ever been married twice admittedly his first wife cited in her divorce papers that he once threatened her with a knife and said he always wondered what human flesh tasted like
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 814.02 821.17 <o,f0,male> but people say stupid things to each other in bad marriages in the heat of an argument and his second marriage has lasted forty one years
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 821.4 823.18 <o,f0,male> so whenever he said anything to me that just
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 823.18 825.89 <o,f0,male> kind of non psychopathic i thought to myself
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 828.82 833.33 <o,f0,male> and then i realized that becoming a psychopath spotter had turned
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 833.59 843.94 <o,f0,male> me a little bit psychopathic because i was desperate to shove him in a box marked psychopath i was desperate to define him by
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 869.35 871.64 <o,f0,male> and this is a country that
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 872.12 874.96 <o,f0,male> over diagnoses certain
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 874.96 879.03 <o,f0,male> mental disorders hugely childhood bipolar children as young as
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 879.23 889.85 <o,f0,male> four are being labeled bipolar because they have temper tantrums which scores them high on their bipolar checklist when i got back to london
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 980.6 991.74 <o,f0,male> nothing bad happened he was living with a girl outside london he was according to brian the scientologist making up for lost time which i know sounds ominous but isn 't necessarily ominous
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 1010.24 1016.26 <o,f0,male> and then he phoned me and you know what i think it 's right
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 1025.46 1027.54 <o,f0,male> he 's a gray area
JonRonson_2012 1 JonRonson_2012 1027.6 1030.24 <o,f0,male> in a world that doesn 't like gray areas
