PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 18.76 29.55 <o,f0,male> i don 't think anyone in this room would disagree what worries me is when politicians with money and charismatic rock stars
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 29.55 36.45 <o,f0,male> use the words it all just sounds so so simple
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 38.97 44.99 <o,f0,male> now i 've got no bucket of money today and i 've got no policy to release
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 64.77 70.33 <o,f0,male> over the last twenty eight years this tough grinding dirty work
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 70.42 79.59 <o,f0,male> has been done by literally thousands of people around australia and more recently overseas and their work has proven
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 85.04 91.14 <o,f0,male> it can improve health and it can play a part in reducing if not eliminating poverty
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 93.05 103.99 <o,f0,male> i 'm going to start where the story began one thousand nine hundred and eighty five in central australia a man called yami lester an aboriginal man was running a health service
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 103.99 118.75 <o,f0,male> eighty percent of what walked in the door in terms of illness was infectious disease third world developing world infectious disease caused by a poor living environment
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 118.97 124.69 <o,f0,male> yami assembled a team in alice springs he got a medical doctor
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 150.37 156.85 <o,f0,male> which translated is a plan to stop people getting sick a profound brief
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 203.59 214.64 <o,f0,male> of local national and international health research that filled out the picture as to why these were the health targets the pictures that came a bit later
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 233.28 234.96 <o,f0,male> so we had the goals
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 235.53 240.79 <o,f0,male> and each one of these goals and i won 't go through them all puts at the center the person
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 240.9 246.95 <o,f0,male> and their health issue and it then connects them to the bits of the physical environment
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 310.16 324.33 <o,f0,male> if you get a green tick your shower 's working you and your kids are fine if you get a red cross well i 've looked carefully around the room and it 's not going to make much difference to this crew why because you 're all
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 343.72 360.36 <o,f0,male> washing is the antidote to the sort of bugs the common infectious diseases of the eyes the ears the chest and the skin that if they occur in the first five years of life permanently damage those organs
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 360.36 364.99 <o,f0,male> they leave a lifelong remnant
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 390.25 396.47 <o,f0,male> this is a big deal so the ticks and crosses on the screen are actually critical for young kids
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 396.51 409.32 <o,f0,male> those ticks and crosses represent the seven thousand eight hundred houses we 've looked at nationally around australia the same proportion what you see on the screen thirty five percent of those not so famous houses lived in by fifty thousand
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 409.32 411.04 <o,f0,male> indigenous people
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 411.05 427.4 <o,f0,male> thirty five percent had a working shower ten percent of those same seven thousand eight hundred houses had safe electrical systems and fifty eight percent of those houses had a working toilet
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 432.62 435.89 <o,f0,male> does it have hot and cold water two taps that work
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 466.32 481.77 <o,f0,male> we arrive in the morning with tools tons of equipment trades and we train up a local team on the first day to start work by the evening of the first day a few houses in that community are better than when we started in the morning
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 492.43 510.37 <o,f0,male> at the end of six months to a year we test every house again it 's very easy to spend money it 's very difficult to improve the function of all those parts of the house and for a whole house the nine healthy living practices we test check and fix two hundred and fifty items in every house
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 540.56 557.99 <o,f0,male> i think there 's an obvious question that i hope you 're thinking about why do we have to do this work why are the houses in such poor condition seventy percent of the work we do is due to lack of routine maintenance the sort of things that happen in all our houses things wear out
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 558.21 573.55 <o,f0,male> should have been done by state government or local government simply not done the house doesn 't work twenty one percent of the things we fix are due to faulty construction literally things that are built upside down and back to front they don 't work we have to fix them
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 577.46 588.71 <o,f0,male> the final cause you will have heard always that indigenous people trash houses it 's one of the almost rock solid pieces of evidence which i 've never seen evidence for
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 597.88 608.75 <o,f0,male> we argue strongly that the people living in the house are simply not the problem and we 'll go a lot further than that the people living in the house are actually a major part of the solution
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 608.75 619.56 <o,f0,male> seventy five percent of our national team in australia over seventy five at the minute are actually local indigenous people from the communities we work in
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 619.77 622.62 <o,f0,male> they do all aspects of the work
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 678.35 688.39 <o,f0,male> second the eye doctors tell us that dust scours the eye and lets the bug in quick so what do we do we call up the doctor of dust and there is such a person
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 688.39 693.08 <o,f0,male> he was loaned to us by a mining company he controls dust on mining company sites
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 693.08 708.78 <o,f0,male> and he came out and within a day it worked out that most dust in this community was within a meter of the ground the wind driven dust so he suggested making mounds to catch the dust before it went into the house area and affected the eyes of kids so we used dirt
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 709.4 728.58 <o,f0,male> to stop dust we did it he provided us dust monitors we tested and we reduced the dust then we wanted to get rid of the bug generally so how do we do that well we call up the doctor of flies and yes there is a doctor of flies as our aboriginal mate said you white fellows ought to get out more
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 751 763.37 <o,f0,male> the dung beetles ate the camel dung the flies died through lack of food and trachoma dropped and over the year trachoma dropped radically in this place and stayed low we changed the
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 763.37 770.77 <o,f0,male> environment not just treated the eyes and finally you get a good
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 826.1 835.87 <o,f0,male> we went in with no grand plan no grand promises of a great program just the offer to build two toilets for two families it was during the design of the first toilet
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 868.9 874.35 <o,f0,male> how do we actually get the smoke down so two problems and design should be about more than one thing
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 874.35 890.95 <o,f0,male> solution take human waste take animal waste put it into a chamber out of that extract biogas methane gas the gas gives three to four hours cooking a day clean smokeless and free for the family
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 914.71 923.84 <o,f0,male> there are now over one hundred toilets built in this village and a couple nearby well over one thousand people use those toilets yami lama
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 924.07 933.4 <o,f0,male> he 's a young boy he 's got significantly less gut infection because he 's now got toilets and there isn 't human waste on the ground
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 937.18 939.87 <o,f0,male> she 's probably right now cooking lunch
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 962.64 970.25 <o,f0,male> the leader of the team has now understood that not only have we built toilets we 've also built
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 996.92 1004.54 <o,f0,male> none of those are limited by geography by skin color or by religion none of them
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 1004.91 1010.28 <o,f0,male> the common link between all the work we 've had to do is one thing and that 's poverty
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 1018.74 1020.9 <o,f0,male> poverty is not natural
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 1021.25 1032.71 <o,f0,male> it 's man made and can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings i want to end by saying it 's been the actions of
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 1033.08 1039.22 <o,f0,male> thousands of ordinary human beings doing i think extraordinary work
PaulPholeros_2013X 1 PaulPholeros_2013X 1039.47 1041.74 <o,f0,male> that have actually improved health
