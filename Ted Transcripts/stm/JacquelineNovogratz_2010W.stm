JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 16.25 22.58 <o,f0,female> spending a lot of time traveling around the world these days talking to groups of students and professionals
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 22.62 29.02 <o,f0,female> and everywhere i 'm finding that i hear similar themes on the one hand people say the time for change is now
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 29.13 30.7 <o,f0,female> they want to be part of it
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 30.74 34.2 <o,f0,female> they talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 44.72 47.27 <o,f0,female> i don 't want to disappoint my family or friends
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 48.49 66.78 <o,f0,female> i work in global poverty and they say i want to work in global poverty but what will it mean about my career will i be marginalized will i not make enough money will i never get married or have children and as a woman who didn 't get married until i was a lot older and i 'm glad i waited
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 77.86 79.5 <o,f0,female> without a cost
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 80 84.73 <o,f0,female> these conversations really reflect what 's happening at the national and international level
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 84.84 92.29 <o,f0,female> our leaders and ourselves want everything but we don 't talk about the costs we don 't talk about the sacrifice
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 93.21 99.37 <o,f0,female> one of my favorite quotes from literature was written by tillie olsen the great american writer from the south
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 127.31 145.37 <o,f0,female> i 've been so privileged in my life to know extraordinary leaders who have chosen to live lives of immersion one woman i knew who was a fellow at a program that i ran at the rockefeller foundation was named ingrid washinawatok she was a leader of the menominee tribe a native american peoples
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 145.37 164.17 <o,f0,female> and when we would gather as fellows she would push us to think about how the elders in native american culture make decisions and she said they would literally visualize the faces of children for seven generations into the future looking at them from the earth
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 164.27 168.69 <o,f0,female> and they would look at them holding them as stewards for that future
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 168.92 175.06 <o,f0,female> ingrid understood that we are connected to each other not only as human beings but to every living thing on the planet
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 175.72 184.56 <o,f0,female> and tragically in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine when she was in colombia working with the u 'wa people focused on preserving their culture and language
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 184.92 189.75 <o,f0,female> she and two colleagues were abducted and tortured and killed by the farc
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 192.33 199.18 <o,f0,female> the farc and whenever we would gather the fellows after that we would leave a chair empty for her spirit and more than a decade later
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 207.07 211.11 <o,f0,female> they all say that they 're trying to integrate her wisdom and her spirit
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 211.11 218.24 <o,f0,female> and really build on the unfulfilled work of her life 's mission and when we think about legacy
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 239.72 245.1 <o,f0,female> and they focused and targeted the elites and the intellectuals the artists the dancers
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 245.22 254.38 <o,f0,female> and at the end of the war there were only thirty of these classical dancers still living and the women who i was so privileged to meet when there were three survivors
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 258.54 261.93 <o,f0,female> they said they would try so hard to remember the fragments
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 271.89 290.73 <o,f0,female> and she talked about the reunion of the thirty after the war and how extraordinary it was and these big tears fell down her face but she never lifted her hands to move them and the women decided that they would train not the next generation of girls because they had grown too old already but the next generation
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 290.92 303.15 <o,f0,female> and i sat there in the studio watching these women clapping their hands beautiful rhythms as these little fairy pixies were dancing around them wearing these beautiful silk colors and i
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 303.67 308.02 <o,f0,female> after all this atrocity this is how human beings really pray
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 308.54 313.51 <o,f0,female> because they 're focused on honoring what is most beautiful
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 324.84 326.87 <o,f0,female> are those things that we cannot measure
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 328.99 333.97 <o,f0,female> i also have been touched by the dark side of power and leadership
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 334.17 339.95 <o,f0,female> and i have learned that power particularly in its absolute form is an equal opportunity provider
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 352.78 358.24 <o,f0,female> she was one of the first three women parliamentarians in rwanda and her legacy should have been
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 366.09 368.27 <o,f0,female> this idea of empowering women
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 369.39 376.57 <o,f0,female> but agnes cared more about the trappings of power than she did principle at the end and though she had been part of building
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 376.69 381.77 <o,f0,female> a liberal party a political party that was focused on diversity and tolerance
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 382.45 401.99 <o,f0,female> about three months before the genocide she switched parties and joined the extremist party hutu power and she became the minister of justice under the genocide regime and was known for inciting men to kill faster and stop behaving like women she was convicted of category one crimes of genocide
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 402.11 404.46 <o,f0,female> and i would visit her in the prisons
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 404.82 407.72 <o,f0,female> sitting side by side knees touching
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 408.02 412.17 <o,f0,female> and i would have to admit to myself that monsters exist in all of us
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 417.57 420.5 <o,f0,female> sadnesses secret shame
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 428.09 432.46 <o,f0,female> and to make us look at other beings human beings as lesser than ourselves
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 433.36 436.23 <o,f0,female> in the extreme to do terrible things
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 448.98 452.82 <o,f0,female> and so in a gathering where we 're focused on women
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 452.97 461.9 <o,f0,female> while it is so critical that we invest in our girls and we even the playing field and we find ways to honor them we have to remember
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 461.9 473.94 <o,f0,female> that the girls and the women are most isolated and violated and victimized and made invisible in those very societies where our men and our boys feel disempowered
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 485.11 491.31 <o,f0,female> well then it 's easy to understand how the greatest source of status can come from a uniform and a gun
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 492.46 498.65 <o,f0,female> sometimes very small investments can release enormous infinite potential that exists in all of us
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 540.07 549.34 <o,f0,female> alex in some ways said it best he said we used to feel like nobodies but now we feel like somebodies and i think we have it all wrong when we think that income is the link
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 568.31 578.25 <o,f0,female> and they wanted to celebrate what 's beautiful about kibera and mathare the photojournalists and the creatives the graffiti artists the teachers and the entrepreneurs
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 578.82 582.46 <o,f0,female> and they 're doing it and my hat 's off to you in kibera
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 615.12 623.32 <o,f0,female> we 've invested more than fifty million dollars in fifty companies and those companies have brought another two hundred million dollars into these forgotten markets
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 623.6 635.34 <o,f0,female> this year alone they 've delivered forty million services like maternal health care and housing emergency services solar energy so that people can have more dignity in solving their problems
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 636.67 642.58 <o,f0,female> patient capital is uncomfortable for people searching for simple solutions easy categories
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 642.98 649.86 <o,f0,female> because we don 't see profit as a blunt instrument but we find those entrepreneurs who put people and the planet
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 649.95 651.61 <o,f0,female> before profit
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 651.92 654.93 <o,f0,female> and ultimately we want to be part of a movement
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 654.93 673.72 <o,f0,female> that is about measuring impact measuring what is most important to us and my dream is we 'll have a world one day where we don 't just honor those who take money and make more money from it but we find those individuals who take our resources and convert it into changing the world in the most positive
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 673.72 679.9 <o,f0,female> and it 's only when we honor them and celebrate them and give them status that the world will really change
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 687.27 706.98 <o,f0,female> one based on violence and the other on transcendence i happened to be in lahore pakistan on the day that two mosques were attacked by suicide bombers and the reason these mosques were attacked is because the people praying inside were from a particular sect of islam who fundamentalists don 't believe are fully muslim
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 707.25 710.99 <o,f0,female> and not only did those suicide bombers take a hundred lives
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 711.12 717.61 <o,f0,female> but they did more because they created more hatred more rage more fear and certainly despair
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 747.23 751.88 <o,f0,female> and he had a dream that he would build a housing community on this barren piece of land
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 752.33 759.16 <o,f0,female> using patient capital but he continued to pay a price he stood on moral ground and refused to pay bribes
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 759.41 762.18 <o,f0,female> it took almost two years just to register the land
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 762.47 768.13 <o,f0,female> but i saw how the level of moral standard can rise from one person 's action
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 768.33 776.18 <o,f0,female> today two thousand people live in three hundred houses in this beautiful community and there 's schools and clinics and shops
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 776.78 778.45 <o,f0,female> but there 's only one mosque
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 796.48 806.24 <o,f0,female> and we decided that we would elect the three most respected imams and those imams would take turns they would rotate who would say friday prayer but the whole community
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 806.56 812.01 <o,f0,female> all the different sects including shi 'a and sunni would sit together and pray
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 812.41 816.44 <o,f0,female> we need that kind of moral leadership and courage in our worlds
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 817.32 821.62 <o,f0,female> we face huge issues as a world the financial crisis
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 821.65 826.15 <o,f0,female> global warming and this growing sense of fear and otherness
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 839.32 853.09 <o,f0,female> a fear of each other distancing and blame or we can take the much more difficult path of transformation transcendence compassion and love but also accountability and justice
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 854.94 874.53 <o,f0,female> i had the great honor of working with the child psychologist dr robert coles who stood up for change during the civil rights movement in the united states and he tells this incredible story about working with a little six year old girl named ruby bridges the first child to desegregate schools in the south in this case new
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 874.53 887.36 <o,f0,female> and he said that every day this six year old dressed in her beautiful dress would walk with real grace through a phalanx of white people screaming angrily calling her a monster threatening to poison her
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 887.36 893.51 <o,f0,female> distorted faces and every day he would watch her and it looked like she was talking to the people
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 897.43 899.35 <o,f0,female> and finally he said ruby i see that
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 905.78 908.04 <o,f0,female> and he said well what are you praying
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 908.43 912.91 <o,f0,female> and she said i 'm praying father forgive them for they know not what they are doing
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 943.87 953.35 <o,f0,female> and he said to me at the end of his year jacqueline it was so humbling because i thought as a farmer and as an african i would understand how to transcend culture
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 953.66 960.52 <o,f0,female> but especially when i was talking to the african women i sometimes made these mistakes it was so hard for me to learn how to listen
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 974.51 984.22 <o,f0,female> and he said but right before the harvest it bends over with great gratitude and humility to touch the earth from where it came
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 985.48 987.54 <o,f0,female> we need leaders
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 987.89 991.39 <o,f0,female> we ourselves need to lead from a place
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 991.48 1007.85 <o,f0,female> that has the audacity to believe we can ourselves extend the fundamental assumption that all men are created equal to every man woman and child on this planet and we need to have the humility to recognize that we cannot do it alone
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1008.49 1013.55 <o,f0,female> robert kennedy once said that few of us have the greatness to bend history itself
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1019.23 1023.26 <o,f0,female> and it is in the total of all those acts that the history of this
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1023.26 1025.41 <o,f0,female> generation will be written
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1025.88 1028.4 <o,f0,female> our lives are so short
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1032.43 1034.93 <o,f0,female> and all we have is each other
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2010W 1035.78 1039.57 <o,f0,female> so may each of you live lives of immersion
