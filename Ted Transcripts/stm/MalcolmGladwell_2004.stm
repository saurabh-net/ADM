MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 15.86 18.75 <o,f0,male> i think i was supposed to talk about my new book which
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 19.70 23.07 <o,f0,male> called blink and it's about snap judgments and first impressions
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 23.52 25.44 <o,f0,male> it comes out in january and i hope
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 26.06 34.52 <o,f0,male> you all buy it in triplicate but i was thinking about this and i realized that although my new book makes me happy and
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 35.38 36.86 <o,f0,male> i think would make my mother happy
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 37.37 41.19 <o,f0,male> it's not really about happiness so i decided instead
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 42.15 50.11 <o,f0,male> i would talk about someone who i think has done as much to make americans happy as perhaps anyone over the last twenty years
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 50.42 59.58 <o,f0,male> a man who is a great personal hero of mine someone by the name of howard moskowitz who is most famous for reinventing spaghetti sauce
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 60.97 63.57 <o,f0,male> howard 's about this high
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 64.89 67.51 <o,f0,male> round and he 's in his sixties and he has
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 68.21 69.64 <o,f0,male> big huge glasses and
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 81.60 87.78 <o,f0,male> of medieval history and by profession he 's a psychophysicist now i should tell you that
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 88.15 99.28 <o,f0,male> i have no idea what psychophysics is although at some point in my life i dated a girl for two years who was getting her doctorate in psychophysics which should tell you something about that relationship
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 102.28 103.09 <o,f0,female> as far as i know
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 103.40 111.42 <o,f0,male> is about measuring things and howard is very interested in measuring things and he graduated with his doctorate from harvard and he set up a little consulting shop
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 111.89 120.01 <o,f0,male> in white plains new york and one of his first clients was this is many years ago back in the early seventies one of his first clients was pepsi
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 120.87 134.28 <o,f0,male> and pepsi came to howard and they said you know there's this new thing called aspartame and we would like to make diet pepsi we'd like you to figure out how much aspartame we should put in each can of diet pepsi in order to have the perfect drink
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 135.18 136.83 <o,f0,male> now that sounds like an incredibly
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 139.48 141.88 <o,f0,male> and that's what howard thought because pepsi told him look
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 141.99 147.52 <o,f0,male> we're working with a band between eight and twelve percent anything below eight percent sweetness is not sweet enough
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 155.15 167.74 <o,f0,male> now if i gave you this problem to do you would all say it's very simple what we do is you make up a big experimental batch of pepsi at every degree of sweetness eight percent eight point one eight point two eight point three all the way up to twelve
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 168.23 176.67 <o,f0,male> and we try this out with thousands of people and we plot the results on a curve and we take the most popular concentration right really simple
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 188.47 192.02 <o,f0,male> now most people in that business in the world of testing food
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 192.37 200.01 <o,f0,male> and such are not dismayed when the data comes back a mess they think well you know figuring out what people think about cola 's not that easy
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 200.35 208.23 <o,f0,male> you know maybe we made an error somewhere along the way you know let 's just make an educated guess and they simply point and they go for ten percent right
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 209.60 222.70 <o,f0,male> howard is not so easily placated howard is a man of a certain degree of intellectual standards and this was not good enough for him and this question bedeviled him for years and he would think it through and say what was wrong why could we not make sense of
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 223.23 225.09 <o,f0,male> this experiment with diet pepsi
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 225.78 239.37 <o,f0,male> and one day he was sitting in a diner in white plains about to go trying to dream up some work for nescafe and suddenly like a bolt of lightning the answer came to him and that is that when they analyzed the diet pepsi data they were asking the wrong question
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 239.96 241.84 <o,f0,male> they were looking for the perfect pepsi
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 247.20 248.90 <o,f0,male> this was an enormous revelation
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 265.42 273.15 <o,f0,male> would look at him with a blank look and they would say what are you talking about this is craziness and they would say you know move next tried to get business nobody would hire him
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 273.46 282.07 <o,f0,male> he was obsessed though and he talked about it and talked about it and talked about it howard loves the yiddish expression to a worm in horseradish the world is horseradish this
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 282.23 286.61 <o,f0,female> was his horseradish he was obsessed with it
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 287.49 289.90 <o,f0,female> and finally he had a breakthrough
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 292.36 300.91 <o,f0,male> and they said mister moskowitz doctor moskowitz we want to make the perfect pickle and he said there is no perfect pickle there are only perfect pickles
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 301.83 303.74 <o,f0,male> he came back to them and he said you don't just need
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 303.82 306.66 <o,f0,male> to improve your regular you need to create zesty
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 322.26 330.72 <o,f0,male> next to ragu which was the dominant spaghetti sauce of the seventies and eighties now in the industry i don't know whether you care about this or how much time i have to go into this but
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 331.64 340.53 <o,f0,male> it was technically speaking this is an aside prego is a better tomato sauce than ragu the quality of the tomato paste is much better the spice mix is far superior
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 350.95 355.89 <o,f0,male> on right and the ragu would all go to the bottom and the prego would sit on top
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 370.20 376.17 <o,f0,male> and howard looked at their product line and he said what you have is a dead tomato society
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 379.07 389.10 <o,f0,male> got together with the campbell 's soup kitchen and he made forty five varieties of spaghetti sauce and he varied them according to every conceivable way that you can vary tomato sauce
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 389.39 397.01 <o,f0,male> by sweetness by level of garlic by tartness by sourness by tomatoey ness by visible solids my favorite term
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 399.10 400.13 <o,f0,female> sauce business
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 400.34 408.20 <o,f0,male> every conceivable way you can vary spaghetti sauce he varied spaghetti sauce and then he took this whole raft of forty five
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 433.20 434.48 <o,f0,male> the spaghetti sauce was
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 434.91 441.49 <o,f0,male> at the end of that process after doing it for months and months he had a mountain of data about how the american people feel
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 442.04 451.39 <o,f0,male> about spaghetti sauce and then he analyzed the data now did he look for the most popular brand variety of spaghetti sauce no howard doesn't believe that there is such a thing
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 462.46 464.59 <o,f0,male> and sure enough if you sit down
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 464.73 471.27 <o,f0,male> and you analyze all this data on spaghetti sauce you realize that all americans fall into one of three groups
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 471.71 473.94 <o,f0,male> there are people who like their spaghetti sauce plain
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 474.74 476.96 <o,f0,male> there are people who like their spaghetti sauce spicy
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 477.42 479.26 <o,f0,male> and there are people who like it extra chunky
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 480.33 481.60 <o,f0,male> and of those three facts
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 482.13 492.02 <o,f0,male> the third one was the most significant because at the time in the early nineteen eighties if you went to a supermarket you would not find extra chunky spaghetti sauce
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 492.58 498.60 <o,f0,male> and prego turned to howard and they said you telling me that one third of americans crave extra chunky
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 499.32 503.63 <o,f0,male> spaghetti sauce and yet no one is servicing their needs and he said yes
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 505.35 506.58 <o,f0,female> and prego then went back
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 506.68 515.44 <o,f0,male> and completely reformulated their spaghetti sauce and came out with a line of extra chunky that immediately and completely took over the spaghetti sauce business in this country
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 515.74 522.47 <o,f0,male> and over the next ten years they made six hundred million dollars off their line of extra chunky sauces
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 527.76 539.79 <o,f0,male> we've been thinking all wrong and that's when you started getting seven different kinds of vinegar and fourteen different kinds of mustard and seventy one different kinds of olive oil and then eventually even ragu
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 540.55 548.64 <o,f0,male> hired howard and howard did the exact same thing for ragu that he did for prego and today if you go to the supermarket a really good one and you look at how many ragus there are do you know how many they are
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 551.35 552.21 <o,f0,male> in six varieties
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 563.09 564.36 <o,f0,male> extra chunky garden
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 566.39 571.68 <o,f0,male> that's howard 's doing that is howard 's gift to the american people now why is that important
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 574.43 577.36 <o,f0,male> it is in fact enormously important i'll explain to you
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 578.16 582.77 <o,f0,male> what howard did is he fundamentally changed the way the food industry thinks about making you
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 593.09 601.97 <o,f0,male> and for years and years and years and years ragu and prego would have focus groups and they would sit all you people down and they would say what do you want in a spaghetti sauce tell us
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 603.40 604.74 <o,f0,male> for all those years
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 608.47 611.50 <o,f0,male> no one ever said they wanted extra chunky
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 626.96 635.74 <o,f0,male> a critically important step in understanding our own desires and tastes is to realize that we cannot always explain what we want
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 638.93 639.82 <o,f0,male> what you want in a coffee
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 644.40 645.91 <o,f0,male> rich hearty roast
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 659.07 660.74 <o,f0,male> most of you like milky weak coffee
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 662.22 666.57 <o,f0,female> you will never ever say to someone who asks you what you want that i want a milky weak
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 672.04 674.81 <o,f0,male> number two thing that howard did is he made us realize
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 675.54 677.01 <o,f0,male> another very critical point
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 677.56 679.98 <o,f0,male> he made us realize in the importance of what
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 688.21 691.67 <o,f0,male> what were they obsessed with in the early eighties they were obsessed with mustard
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 696.58 706.81 <o,f0,male> there were two mustards french 's and gulden 's what were they yellow mustard what's in yellow mustard yellow mustard seeds turmeric and paprika that was mustard grey poupon came along with a dijon
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 708.21 710.91 <o,f0,male> much more volatile brown mustard seed
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 711.45 718.76 <o,f0,male> some white wine a nose hit much more delicate aromatics and what do they do they put it in a little tiny glass jar
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 729.84 740.28 <o,f0,male> bottle the way the french 's and gulden 's did they decided to charge four dollars and then they had those ads right with the guy in the rolls royce and he 's eating the grey poupon the other rolls royce pulls up and he says do you have any grey poupon
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 749.06 751.55 <o,f0,male> the way to get to make people happy
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 752.42 757.22 <o,f0,male> is to give them something that is more expensive something to aspire to
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 758.06 770.97 <o,f0,male> to make them turn their back on what they think they like now and reach out for something higher up the mustard hierarchy a better mustard a more expensive mustard a mustard of more sophistication and culture
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 778.12 781.80 <o,f0,male> mustard exists just like tomato sauce on a horizontal plane
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 791.84 793.13 <o,f0,male> he fundamentally
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 803.17 804.45 <o,f0,male> and perhaps the most important
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 805.16 807.77 <o,f0,male> is howard confronted the notion of the platonic dish
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 811.78 813.60 <o,f0,male> for the longest time in the food industry
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 813.94 819.37 <o,f0,male> there was a sense that there was one way a perfect way to make a dish
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 820.03 834.09 <o,f0,male> you go to chez panisse they give you the red tail sashimi with roasted pumpkin seeds in a something something reduction they don't give you five options on the reduction right they don't say do you want the extra chunky reduction or do you want
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 835.74 843.73 <o,f0,male> just get the reduction why because the chef at chez panisse has a platonic notion about red tail sashimi this is the way it ought to be
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 844.30 852.21 <o,f0,male> and she serves it that way time and time again and if you quarrel with her she will say you know what you're wrong
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 852.97 854.17 <o,f0,male> this is the best way it ought to be in
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 855.22 859.04 <o,f0,male> now that same idea fueled the commercial food industry as well
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 859.74 865.05 <o,f0,male> they had a notion a platonic notion of what tomato sauce was and where did that come from it came from italy
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 867.72 868.96 <o,f0,male> it's blended it's
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 869.91 871.58 <o,f0,male> the culture of tomato sauce was
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 872.28 873.50 <o,f0,male> we talked about authentic
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 882.03 895.41 <o,f0,male> you just put a little bit over it and it sunk down to the bottom of the pasta that's what it was and why were we attached to that because we thought that what it took to make people happy was to provide them with the most culturally authentic tomato sauce
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 896.50 904.90 <o,f0,male> and b we thought that if we gave them the culturally authentic tomato sauce then they would embrace it and that's what would please the maximum number of people
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 906.20 911.01 <o,f0,male> and the reason we thought that in other words people in the cooking world were looking for cooking universals
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 911.73 919.10 <o,f0,male> they were looking for one way to treat all of us and it's good reason for them to be obsessed with the idea of universals because all of science
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 932.76 943.06 <o,f0,male> that changed right what is the great revolution in science of the last ten fifteen years it is the movement from the search for universals to the understanding of variability
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 943.86 952.57 <o,f0,male> now in medical science we don't want to know how necessarily just how cancer works we want to know how your cancer is different from my cancer
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 966.48 969.08 <o,f0,male> and for that we owe him a great vote of thanks
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 970.77 972.79 <o,f0,male> give you one last illustration of variability
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 973.65 979.70 <o,f0,male> and that is oh i'm sorry howard not only believed that but he took it a second step which was to say that
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 980.13 983.61 <o,f0,male> when we pursue universal principles in food
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 984.33 990.95 <o,f0,male> just making an error we are actually doing ourselves a massive disservice and the example he used was coffee
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 991.96 994.42 <o,f0,male> coffee is something he did a lot of work with
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 996.18 1000.74 <o,f0,male> if i were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee a type of coffee a brew
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 1001.20 1008.56 <o,f0,male> that made all of you happy and then i asked you to rate that coffee the average score in this room for coffee would be about sixty on a scale of zero to one hundred
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 1009.28 1010.51 <o,f0,male> if however you allowed me to
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 1010.98 1022.77 <o,f0,male> you into coffee clusters maybe three or four coffee clusters and i could make coffee just for each of those individual clusters your scores would go from sixty to seventy five or seventy eight
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 1023.41 1032.55 <o,f0,male> the difference between coffee at sixty and coffee at seventy eight is a difference between coffee that makes you wince and coffee that makes you
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 1035.82 1041.86 <o,f0,male> the final and i think most beautiful lesson of howard moskowitz that in embracing the diversity
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 1042.26 1045.85 <o,f0,male> of human beings we will find a surer way to true happiness
