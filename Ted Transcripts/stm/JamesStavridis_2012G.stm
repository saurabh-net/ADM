JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 16.29 24.42 <o,f0,male> 'm gonna talk a little bit about open source security because we 've got to get better at security in this twenty first century
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 24.42 41.31 <o,f0,male> let me start by saying let 's look back to the twentieth century and kind of get a sense of how that style of security worked for us this is verdun a battlefield in france just north of the nato headquarters in belgium
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 41.31 52.87 <o,f0,male> at verdun in one thousand nine hundred and sixteen over a three hundred day period seven hundred thousand people were killed so about two thousand a day
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 52.87 66.33 <o,f0,male> if you roll it forward twentieth century security into the second world war you see the battle of stalingrad three hundred days two million people killed
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 66.33 84.51 <o,f0,male> we go into the cold war and we continue to try and build walls we go from the trench warfare of the first world war to the maginot line of the second world war and then we go into the cold war the iron curtain the berlin wall
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 84.51 86.56 <o,f0,male> walls don 't work
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 104.71 116.04 <o,f0,male> and it talks about how in that very troubled part of europe and the balkans over time there 's been enormous building of walls more recently in the last
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 116.04 124.99 <o,f0,male> decade we begin to see these communities start hesitatingly to come together i would argue again
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 124.99 137.47 <o,f0,male> open source security is about connecting the international the interagency the private public and lashing it together with strategic communication
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 137.47 156.31 <o,f0,male> largely in social networks so let me talk a little bit about why we need to do that because our global commons is under attack in a variety of ways and none of the sources of threat to the global commons will be solved by building walls
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 156.31 165.6 <o,f0,male> now i 'm a sailor obviously this is a ship a liner clipping through the indian ocean what 's wrong with this picture
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 165.6 171.92 <o,f0,male> it 's got concertina wire along the sides of it that 's to prevent pirates from attacking it
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 171.92 178.42 <o,f0,male> piracy is a very active threat today around the world this is in the indian ocean
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 178.42 192.51 <o,f0,male> piracy is also very active in the strait of malacca it 's active in the gulf of guinea we see it in the caribbean it 's a dollar ten billion a year discontinuity in the global transport system
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 192.51 204.57 <o,f0,male> last year at this time there were twenty vessels five hundred mariners held hostage this is an attack on the global commons we need to think about how to address it
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 209.86 229.23 <o,f0,male> here are photographs of two young men at the moment they 're incarcerated they conducted a credit card fraud that netted them over ten billion dollars this is part of cybercrime which is a dollar two trillion a year
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 247.75 254.19 <o,f0,male> another thing i worry about in the global commons is the threat posed by trafficking
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 272.19 283.15 <o,f0,male> above all perhaps we worry about human trafficking and the awful cost of it trafficking moves largely at sea but in other parts of the global commons
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 283.15 294.64 <o,f0,male> this is a photograph and i wish i could tell you that this is a very high tech piece of us navy gear that we 're using to stop the trafficking
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 294.64 313.51 <o,f0,male> the bad news is this is a semi submersible run by drug cartels it was built in the jungles of south america we caught it with that low tech raft laughter and it was carrying six
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 313.51 330.73 <o,f0,male> tons of cocaine crew of four sophisticated communications sweep this kind of trafficking in narcotics in humans in weapons god forbid in weapons of mass destruction is part of the threat to the global commons
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 330.73 337.91 <o,f0,male> and let 's pull it together in afghanistan today this is a field of poppies in afghanistan
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 365.3 369.14 <o,f0,male> we know our twentieth century tools are not going to work
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 369.14 371.37 <o,f0,male> what should we do
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 371.37 389.06 <o,f0,male> i would argue that we will not deliver security solely from the barrel of a gun we will not deliver security solely from the barrel of a gun we will need the application of military force when we do it we must do it well and competently
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 389.06 391.7 <o,f0,male> but my thesis is
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 391.71 400.35 <o,f0,male> open source security is about international interagency private public connection pulled together
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 403.74 415.94 <o,f0,male> on the internet let me give you a couple of examples of how this works in a positive way this is afghanistan these are afghan soldiers they are all holding books
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 415.94 418.84 <o,f0,male> you should say that 's odd
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 418.84 431.02 <o,f0,male> i thought i read that this demographic young men and women in their twenty s and thirty s is largely illiterate in afghanistan you would be correct
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 431.02 449.18 <o,f0,male> eighty five percent cannot read when they enter the security forces of afghanistan why because the taliban withheld education during the period of time in which these men and women would have learned to read so the question is so why are they all standing there holding books
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 449.18 463.36 <o,f0,male> the answer is we are teaching them to read in literacy courses by nato in partnership with private sector entities in partnership with development agencies
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 463.36 470.36 <o,f0,male> we 've taught well over two hundred thousand afghan security forces to read and write at a basic level
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 470.36 476.04 <o,f0,male> when you can read and write in afghanistan you will typically put a pen in your pocket
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 476.04 484.02 <o,f0,male> at the ceremonies when these young men and women graduate they take that pen with great pride and put it in their pocket
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 484.02 490.08 <o,f0,male> this is bringing together international there are fifty nations involved in this mission
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 490.08 509.12 <o,f0,male> interagency these development agencies and private public to take on this kind of security now we are also teaching them combat skills of course but i would argue open source security means connecting in ways that create longer lasting security effect
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 509.12 514.66 <o,f0,male> here 's another example this is a us navy warship
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 514.66 519.3 <o,f0,male> it 's called the comfort there 's a sister ship called the mercy
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 519.3 527.21 <o,f0,male> they are hospital ships this one the comfort operates throughout the caribbean and the coast of south america
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 527.21 534.31 <o,f0,male> conducting patient treatments on a typical cruise they 'll do four hundred thousand patient treatments
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 534.31 545.06 <o,f0,male> it is crewed not strictly by military but by a combination of humanitarian organizations operation hope project smile
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 545.06 556.14 <o,f0,male> other organizations send volunteers interagency physicians come out they 're all part of this to give you one example of the impact this can have
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 556.14 563 <o,f0,male> this little boy eight years old walked with his mother two days to come to
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 580.32 593.95 <o,f0,male> multiply this by four hundred thousand patient treatments this private public collaboration with security forces and you begin to see the power of creating security in a very different way
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 593.95 598.22 <o,f0,male> here you see baseball players
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 598.22 603.76 <o,f0,male> can you pick out the two us army soldiers in this photograph
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 621.93 627.66 <o,f0,male> who are real soldiers with real skills but participate in this mission
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 627.66 635.22 <o,f0,male> and they put on clinics throughout latin america and the caribbean in honduras in nicaragua
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 635.22 653.04 <o,f0,male> in all of the central american and caribbean nations where baseball is so popular and it creates security it shows role models to young men and women about fitness and about life that i would argue help create security for us
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 653.04 657.93 <o,f0,male> another aspect of this partnership is in disaster relief
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 675.66 678.53 <o,f0,male> the kashmiri earthquake in pakistan
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 678.53 684.21 <o,f0,male> two thousand and five eighty five thousand dead the haitian earthquake
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 684.21 687.04 <o,f0,male> about three hundred thousand dead
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 687.04 701.2 <o,f0,male> more recently the awful earthquake tsunami combination which struck japan and its nuclear industry in all of these instances we see partnerships between international actors
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 701.2 713.6 <o,f0,male> interagency private public working with security forces to respond to this kind of natural disaster so these are examples of this idea of open source security
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 713.6 732.37 <o,f0,male> we tie it together increasingly by doing things like this now you 're looking at this thinking ah admiral these must be sea lanes of communication or these might be fiber optic cables no this is a graphic of the world according to twitter
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 732.37 751.9 <o,f0,male> purple are tweets green are geolocation white is the synthesis it 's a perfect evocation of that great population survey the six largest nations in the world in descending order china india facebook the united states
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 751.9 766.27 <o,f0,female> twitter and indonesia laughter why do we want to get in these nets why do we want to be involved we talked earlier about the arab spring and the power of all this i 'll give you another example and it 's how you move this message
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 766.27 773.98 <o,f0,male> i gave a talk like this in london a while back about this point i said as i say to all of you i 'm on facebook friend me
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 773.98 786.36 <o,f0,male> got a little laugh from the audience there was an article which was run by ap on the wire got picked up in two places in the world finland and indonesia
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 786.36 790.45 <o,f0,male> the headline was nato admiral needs friends
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 815.97 823.26 <o,f0,female> we laugh but this is how we move the message and moving that message is how we connect international interagency
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 828.52 841.31 <o,f0,male> now let me hit a somber note this is a photograph of a brave british soldier he 's in the scots guards he 's standing the watch in helmand in southern afghanistan
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 841.31 855.39 <o,f0,male> i put him here to remind us i would not want anyone to leave the room thinking that we do not need capable competent militaries who can create real military effect
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 865.58 875.96 <o,f0,male> but you know life is not an on and off switch you don 't have to have a military that is either in hard combat or is in the barracks
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 880.24 889.16 <o,f0,male> you have to dial it in and as i think about how we create security in this twenty first century there will be times
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 889.16 907.4 <o,f0,male> when we will apply hard power in true war and crisis but there will be many instances as we 've talked about today where our militaries can be part of creating twenty first century security international interagency private public
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 907.4 910.11 <o,f0,male> connected with competent
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 910.11 911.81 <o,f0,male> communication
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 911.81 914.77 <o,f0,male> i would close by saying that
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 914.77 923.64 <o,f0,male> we heard earlier today about wikipedia i use wikipedia all the time to look up facts and as all of you appreciate
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 923.64 935.99 <o,f0,male> wikipedia is not created by twelve brilliant people locked in a room writing articles wikipedia every day is tens of thousands of people inputting information
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 935.99 942.42 <o,f0,male> and every day millions of people withdrawing that information it 's a perfect image
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 942.42 955.16 <o,f0,male> for the fundamental point that no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together no one person no one alliance no one nation no one of us is as smart as all of
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 955.16 966.3 <o,f0,male> us thinking together the vision statement of wikipedia is very simple a world in which every human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge
JamesStavridis_2012G 1 JamesStavridis_2012G 966.3 976.32 <o,f0,male> my thesis for you is that by combining international interagency private public strategic communication together
