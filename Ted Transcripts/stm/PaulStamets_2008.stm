PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 15.78 21.38 <o,f0,male> i love a challenge and saving the earth is probably a good one we all know the earth is in trouble
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 22.00 30.90 <o,f0,male> we have now entered in the six x the sixth major extinction on this planet i often wondered if there was a united organization of organisms otherwise known as
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 33.46 40.47 <o,f0,male> every organism had a right to vote would we be voted on the planet or off the planet i think that vote is occurring right now
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 41.35 48.08 <o,f0,male> i want to present to you a suite of six mycological solutions using fungi and these solutions are based
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 69.18 81.06 <o,f0,male> we have now discovered that there is a multi directional transfer of nutrients between plants mitigated by the mcyelium so the mycelium is the mother that is giving nutrients from alder and birch trees to hemlocks cedars and douglas firs
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 83.23 86.36 <o,f0,male> we like to say on sunday this is where we go to church
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 86.94 92.64 <o,f0,male> i'm in love with the old growth forest and i'm a patriotic american because we have those
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 93.17 103.37 <o,f0,male> most of you are familiar with portobello mushrooms and frankly i face a big obstacle when i mention mushrooms to somebody they immediately think portobellos or magic mushrooms their eyes glaze over and they
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 104.78 112.19 <o,f0,male> so i hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group we call it mycophobia the irrational fear of the unknown
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 112.82 120.00 <o,f0,male> it comes to fungi mushrooms are very fast in their growth day twenty one day twenty three day twenty five
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 136.32 144.79 <o,f0,male> we share in common the same pathogens fungi don't like to rot from bacteria and so our best antibiotics come from fungi
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 145.13 159.25 <o,f0,male> but here is a mushroom that's past its prime after they sporulate they do rot but i propose to you that the sequence of microbes that occur on rotting mushrooms are essential for the health of the forest they give rise to the trees they create the debris fields that feed the mycelium
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 160.49 162.61 <o,f0,male> and so we see a mushroom here sporulating
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 163.16 175.99 <o,f0,male> and the spores are germinating and the mycelium forms and goes underground in a single cubic inch of soil there can be more than eight miles of these cells my foot is covering approximately three hundred miles of mycelium
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 177.23 185.71 <o,f0,male> this is photo micrographs from nick read and patrick hickey and notice that as the mycelium grows it conquers territory and then it begins the net
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 197.64 205.66 <o,f0,male> we exhale carbon dioxide so does mycelium it inhales oxygen just like we do but these are essentially externalized stomachs
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 223.32 233.44 <o,f0,male> and so the spongy soil not only resists erosion but sets up a microbial universe that gives rise to a plurality of other organisms
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 234.21 238.96 <o,f0,male> i first proposed in the early nineteen nineties that mycelium is earth 's natural internet
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 240.13 241.73 <o,f0,male> when you look at the mycelium
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 244.10 256.35 <o,f0,male> highly branched and if there's one branch that is broken then very quickly because of the nodes of crossing internet engineers maybe call them hot points there's alternative pathways for channeling nutrients
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 272.08 280.71 <o,f0,male> so i believe the invention of the computer internet is an inevitable consequence of a previously proven biologically successful model
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 281.83 287.34 <o,f0,male> the earth invented the computer internet for its own benefit and we now being the top
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 288.12 294.30 <o,f0,male> organism on this planet are trying to allocate resources in order to protect the biosphere
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 295.66 299.39 <o,f0,male> way out dark matter conforms to the same mycelial archetype
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 300.46 310.09 <o,f0,male> i believe matter begets life life becomes single cells single cells become strings strings become chains chains network and this is the paradigm that we see throughout
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 313.77 319.46 <o,f0,male> most of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land they came to land one point three billion years ago
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 319.89 324.19 <o,f0,male> and plants followed several hundred million years later how is that possible
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 338.26 340.31 <o,f0,male> and the first step in the generation of soil
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 341.33 344.86 <o,f0,male> oxalic acid is two carbon dioxide molecules joined together
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 345.63 353.63 <o,f0,male> so fungi and mycelium sequester carbon dioxide in the form of calcium oxalates and all sorts of other oxalates are also sequestering
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 366.99 368.98 <o,f0,male> four hundred and twenty million years ago
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 369.69 374.11 <o,f0,male> this organism existed it was called prototaxites prototaxites
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 374.91 376.63 <o,f0,male> laying down was about three feet tall
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 377.12 379.31 <o,f0,male> the tallest plants on earth at that
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 379.55 381.27 <o,f0,male> time were less than two feet
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 383.05 385.94 <o,f0,male> doctor boyce at the university of chicago
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 398.85 400.33 <o,f0,male> were dotted these giant mushrooms
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 405.01 407.18 <o,f0,male> and these existed for tens of millions of years
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 423.97 426.41 <o,f0,male> and fungi inherited the earth
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 427.82 430.43 <o,f0,male> those organisms that paired with fungi were rewarded
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 431.20 432.42 <o,f0,male> fungi do not need light
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 433.54 436.63 <o,f0,male> more recently at einstein university they just determined
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 437.38 442.62 <o,f0,male> fungi use radiation as a source of energy much like plants use light
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 443.57 449.28 <o,f0,male> so the prospect of fungi existing on other planets elsewhere i think is a foregone conclusion at least in my own mind
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 450.71 456.64 <o,f0,male> the largest organism in the world is in eastern oregon i couldn't miss it it was two thousand two hundred acres in size
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 457.93 464.82 <o,f0,male> two hundred acres in size two thousand years old the largest organism on the planet is a mycelial mat one cell wall thick
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 465.44 467.37 <o,f0,male> how is it that this organism
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 468.02 476.36 <o,f0,male> can be so large and yet be one cell wall thick whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us the mycelium in the right conditions produces a mushroom
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 496.68 504.01 <o,f0,male> with enzymes one pile was treated with bacteria and our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 504.63 507.05 <o,f0,male> the mycelium absorbs the oil
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 508.67 517.34 <o,f0,male> enzymes peroxydases that break carbon hydrogen bonds these are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together so the mycelium becomes saturated with the oil
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 530.91 535.72 <o,f0,male> the enzymes re manufactured the hydrocarbons into carbohydrates fungal sugars
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 544.30 552.79 <o,f0,male> in my life they sporulated the spores attract insects the insects laid eggs eggs became larvae birds then came
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 553.41 556.06 <o,f0,male> in seeds and our pile became an oasis of life
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 556.92 566.84 <o,f0,male> the other three piles were dead dark and stinky and the pah 's the aromatic hydrocarbons went from ten thousand parts per million to less than two hundred in eight weeks
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 567.20 575.64 <o,f0,male> the last image we don't have the entire pile was a green berm of life these are gateway species vanguard species that open the door for
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 586.03 595.43 <o,f0,male> you can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream from a farm that's producing e coli or other wastes or a factory with chemical toxins and it leads to habitat restoration
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 596.15 609.19 <o,f0,male> so we set up a site in mason county washington and we've seen a dramatic decrease in the amount of coliforms and i'll show you a graph here this is a logarithmic scale ten to the eighth power there's more than a one hundred million colonies per gram
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 629.97 644.18 <o,f0,male> so this one mushroom in particular has drawn our interest over time this is my wife dusty with a mushroom called fomitopsis officinalis agaricon it's a mushroom exclusive to the old growth forest that dioscorides first described in sixty five a d as a treatment against consumption
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 654.84 656.98 <o,f0,male> this is extremely rare fungus
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 657.35 665.70 <o,f0,male> our team and we have a team of experts that go out we went out twenty times in the old growth forest last year we found one sample to be able to get into culture
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 673.70 687.61 <o,f0,male> the u s defense department bioshield program we submitted over three hundred samples of mushrooms that were boiled in hot water and mycelium harvesting these extracellular metabolites and a few years ago we received these results
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 689.52 699.18 <o,f0,male> we have three different strains of agaricon mushrooms that were highly active against pox viruses doctor earl kern who 's a smallpox expert of the u s defense department
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 710.76 722.55 <o,f0,male> there's a vetted press release that you can read it's vetted by dod if you google stamets and smallpox or you can go to npr org and listen to a live interview so encouraged by this
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 725.58 735.98 <o,f0,male> and so for the first time i am showing this we have three different strains of agaricon mushrooms highly active against flu viruses here 's the selectivity index numbers against pox you saw ten and twenties
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 736.30 745.89 <o,f0,male> now against flu viruses compared to the ribavirin controls we have an extraordinarily high activity and we're using a natural extract within the same dosage window as a pure
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 761.91 762.28 <o,f0,male> index
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 766.70 768.88 <o,f0,male> i then think that we can make the argument
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 794.22 805.20 <o,f0,male> i did something that nobody else had done i actually chased the mycelium when it stopped producing spores these are spores this is in their spores i was able to morph the culture into a non sporulating form
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 805.66 819.50 <o,f0,male> and so the industry has spent over one hundred million dollars specifically on bait stations to prevent termites from eating your house but the insects aren't stupid and they would avoid the spores when they came close and so i morphed the cultures into a non sporulating form
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 827.19 835.63 <o,f0,male> the ants were attracted to the mycelium because there's no spores they gave it to the queen one week later i had no sawdust piles whatsoever
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 836.79 848.04 <o,f0,male> and then a delicate dance between dinner and death the mycelium is consumed by the ants they become mummified and boing a mushroom pops out of their head
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 850.80 854.77 <o,f0,male> now after sporulation the spores repel so the house is no
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 855.07 857.27 <o,f0,male> longer suitable for invasion
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 857.62 866.85 <o,f0,male> so you have a near permanent solution for re invasion of termites and so my house came down i received my first patent against carpenter ants termites and fire ants
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 873.08 886.29 <o,f0,male> then received my second patent and this is a big one it's been called an alexander graham bell patent it covers over two hundred thousand species this is the most disruptive technology i've been told by executives of the pesticide industry that they have ever witnessed
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 886.54 901.00 <o,f0,male> this could totally revamp the pesticide industries throughout the world you could fly one hundred ph d students under the umbrella of this concept because my supposition is that entomopathogenic fungi prior to sporulation attract the very insects that are otherwise repelled by those spores
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 906.21 909.43 <o,f0,male> the life box you're gonna be getting a dvd of the ted conference
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 910.03 912.16 <o,f0,male> you add soil you add water
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 912.78 921.61 <o,f0,male> you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores like of the agaricon mushroom the seeds then are mothered by this mycelium
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 922.17 928.59 <o,f0,male> and then you put tree seeds in here and then you end up growing potentially an old growth
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 929.16 938.27 <o,f0,male> from a cardboard box i want to re invent the delivery system and the use of cardboard around the world so they become ecological footprints if there's a youtube like
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 938.87 952.42 <o,f0,male> site that you could put up you could make it interactive zip code specific where people could join together and through satellite imaging systems through virtual earth or google earth you could confirm carbon credits are being sequestered by the trees that are coming through life boxes
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 953.07 965.56 <o,f0,male> you could take a cardboard box delivering shoes you could add water i developed this for the refugee community corns beans and squash and onions i took several containers my wife said if i could do this anybody could
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 966.31 977.56 <o,f0,male> and i ended up growing a seed garden then you harvest the seeds and thank you eric rasmussen for your help on this and then you're harvesting the seed garden then you can harvest the kernels
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 984.51 989.09 <o,f0,male> now three corn cobs no other grain lots of mushrooms begin to form
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 992.10 994.79 <o,f0,male> and so this population will be shut down but watch what happens here
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 1003.22 1005.59 <o,f0,male> the mycelium has converted the cellulose
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 1025.33 1027.02 <o,f0,male> go from cellulose to ethanol
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 1027.85 1029.65 <o,f0,male> is ecologically unintelligent
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 1030.19 1041.13 <o,f0,male> and i think that we need to be econologically intelligent about the generation of fuels so we build the carbon banks on the planet renew the soils these are a species that we need to join with
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 1045.65 1047.72 <o,f0,male> can help save the world thank you very much
