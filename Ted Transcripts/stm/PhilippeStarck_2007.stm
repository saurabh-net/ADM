PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 14.41 21.89 <o,f0,male> you will understand nothing with my type of english it's good for you because you can have a
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 24.90 30.33 <o,f0,male> fantastic people i must tell you i am like that not very
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 31.61 38.94 <o,f0,male> because usually in life i think my job is absolutely useless i mean i
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 41.91 45.90 <o,f0,male> after carolyn and all the
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 54.12 65.61 <o,f0,male> i don't know why i am here but you know the nightmare you can have like you are an impostor you arrive at the opera and they push you you must sing i don't know
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 69.34 73.14 <o,f0,male> so so because i have nothing to show
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 75.42 75.94 <o,f0,male> to say
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 77.96 85.79 <o,f0,male> about something else we can start if you want by understanding it's just to start it's not interesting but
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 87.63 97.83 <o,f0,male> how i work when somebody comes to me and ask for what i am known i mean yes lemon squeezer
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 101.05 103.68 <o,f0,male> toothpick beautiful toilet seats
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 119.25 128.59 <o,f0,male> one we can call it the cynical design that means the design invented by raymond loewy in the fifties who said what
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 132.65 140.51 <o,f0,male> which is terrible it means the design must be just the weapon for marketing for producer to make product
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 148.54 151.87 <o,f0,male> that the cynical design after there is
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 154.13 155.20 <o,f0,male> design it's
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 163.57 170.34 <o,f0,male> there is people like me who try to deserve to exist and who are so
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 171.27 178.89 <o,f0,male> to make this useless job who try to do it in another way and they try i try to
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 180.24 194.30 <o,f0,male> make the object for the object but for the result for the profit for the human being the person who will use it if we take the toothbrush i don't think about the toothbrush i think what
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 210.26 218.03 <o,f0,male> in what society this guy live what civilization creates this society
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 218.67 223.55 <o,f0,male> what animal species creates this civilization when i
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 236.57 244.79 <o,f0,male> anything but when i come back i can understand why i shall not do it because today to not
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 250.57 255.52 <o,f0,male> but to come back where i am at the animal species
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 255.82 262.91 <o,f0,male> there is things to see there is things to see there is the big challenge the big challenge in front of us
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 263.65 267.95 <o,f0,male> because there is not a human production which exists
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 269.71 272.58 <o,f0,male> of what i call the big image the
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 280.30 284.30 <o,f0,male> mutation our life we must remember and we can see that
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 296.33 296.58 <o,f0,male> yes
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 306.20 312.06 <o,f0,male> there was this soup called soupe primordiale this first soup bloop bloop
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 313.67 316.95 <o,f0,male> sort of dirty mud no life nothing
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 323.04 323.45 <o,f0,male> and that
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 328.89 335.70 <o,f0,male> up at the end finally that succeeds and life appears we was so
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 336.46 348.56 <o,f0,male> so stupid the most stupid bacteria even i think we copy our way to reproduce you know what i mean and something of
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 350.02 360.92 <o,f0,male> after we become a fish after we become a frog after we become a monkey after we become what we are today a super monkey
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 361.52 369.11 <o,f0,male> and the fun is the super monkey we are today is at half of the story
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 369.76 378.71 <o,f0,male> can you imagine from that stupid bacteria to us with a microphone with a computer with an ipod four billion years
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 379.93 385.46 <o,f0,male> and we know and especially carolyn that
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 389.63 391.76 <o,f0,male> don't know what and
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 394.12 394.99 <o,f0,male> four billion years
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 396.07 399.35 <o,f0,male> yes she said something like that ok that means we are
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 404.08 411.43 <o,f0,male> can you imagine it's very symbolic because the bacteria we was had no idea of what we are today
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 412.23 419.51 <o,f0,male> and today we have no idea of what we shall be in four billion years and this territory is
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 420.85 426.08 <o,f0,male> that is our poetry that is our beautiful story it's our
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 428.82 439.54 <o,f0,male> we are mutants and if we don't deeply understand if we don't integrate that we are mutants we completely miss the story
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 441.34 447.99 <o,f0,male> every generation thinks we are the final one we have a way to look at earth like that you know i am the man
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 451.76 456.60 <o,f0,male> we mutate during four billion years before but now because it's me we stop
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 462.59 463.59 <o,f0,male> jacket something like that
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 465.43 467.67 <o,f0,male> i am not sure of that
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 470.62 478.02 <o,f0,male> because that is our intelligence of mutation and things like that there is so many things to do it's so fresh
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 478.61 486.24 <o,f0,male> and here is something nobody is obliged to be a genius
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 486.83 494.18 <o,f0,male> but everybody is obliged to participate and to participate for a mutant there is a minimum of
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 495.46 505.52 <o,f0,male> minimum of sport we can say that the first if you want there is so many but one which is very easy to do is the duty of vision
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 506.83 508.40 <o,f0,male> i can explain you i shall try
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 510.94 511.42 <o,f0,male> you walk
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 519.11 530.53 <o,f0,male> but perhaps because you walk with the eyes like that you will not see oh there is a hole and you will fall and you will die dangerous that's why perhaps you will try
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 534.98 535.53 <o,f0,male> i can see
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 538.82 543.97 <o,f0,male> and they continue up up up i raise the angle of vision
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 544.28 551.84 <o,f0,male> but it's still very selfish selfish egoiste yes selfish you you survive it's ok
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 553.10 561.69 <o,f0,male> if you raise the level of your eyes a little more you go i see you oh my god you are here how are you i can
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 563.91 571.84 <o,f0,male> i can design for you a new toothbrush new toilet brush something like that i live in society i live in community it's ok
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 572.65 581.23 <o,f0,male> to be in the territory of intelligence we can say from this level
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 586.90 597.26 <o,f0,male> more you will be important for the society the more you will rise the more you will be important for the civilization the more you will rise
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 597.72 610.82 <o,f0,male> to see far and high like that the more you will be important for the story of our mutation that means intelligent people are in this angle that
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 612.65 615.40 <o,f0,male> from this to here that
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 619.84 624.26 <o,f0,male> einstein things like that nobody 's obliged to be a genius it's better but nobody
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 625.92 631.54 <o,f0,male> take care in this training to be a good mutant
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 633.40 639.07 <o,f0,male> trap one trap the vertical because at the vertical of us if you look like that
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 645.05 646.14 <o,f0,male> when we don't know
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 652.11 660.43 <o,f0,male> when your brain is not enough big when you don't understand you go ah it's god it's god that's ridiculous that's why jump
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 663.66 668.60 <o,f0,male> come back because after there is another trap if you look like that you look
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 669.70 675.47 <o,f0,male> or you look inside if you are very flexible inside yourself it's called schizophrenia and you
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 676.95 688.13 <o,f0,male> that's why every morning now because you are a good mutant you will raise your angle of view out more of the horizontal you
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 689.47 691.92 <o,f0,male> never forget like that like that
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 693.09 696.96 <o,f0,male> it's very very very important what
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 699.23 706.41 <o,f0,male> what else we can say about that why do that it's because we
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 708.14 711.71 <o,f0,male> we look from far we see
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 714.35 726.24 <o,f0,male> of evolution this line of evolution is clearly positive from far this line looks very smooth like that but if you take a lens
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 727.17 734.70 <o,f0,male> that this line is ack ack ack ack ack like that it's made of light
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 735.23 743.68 <o,f0,male> and shadow we can say light is civilization shadow is barbaria and it's very important to know where we are
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 744.40 755.52 <o,f0,male> because some cycle there is a spot in the cycle and you have not the same duty in the different parts of the cycle that means
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 757.39 765.95 <o,f0,male> we can imagine i don't say it was fantastic but in the eighties there was not too much
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 766.93 774.22 <o,f0,male> like that it was we can imagine that the civilization can become
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 775.59 784.84 <o,f0,male> in this case people like me are acceptable we can say it 's luxurious time we have time to think we have time to
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 797.95 802.65 <o,f0,male> so fast so fast to shadow we fall so fast to barbaria
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 804.05 811.51 <o,f0,male> many many many many face of barbaria because it's not the barbaria we have today it's
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 813.53 820.89 <o,f0,male> we think there is different type of barbaria that's why we must adapt that means
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 822.93 828.26 <o,f0,male> when barbaria is back forget the beautiful chairs forget the beautiful
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 828.96 835.70 <o,f0,male> forget design even i'm sorry to say forget art forget all that there is priority there is
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 836.75 850.70 <o,f0,male> you must go back to politics you must go back to radicalization i'm sorry if that's not very english you must go back to fight to battle that's why today i'm so ashamed to make this job that's why
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 851.77 865.60 <o,f0,male> to try to do it the best possible but i know that even i do it the best possible that's why i'm the best it's nothing because it's not the right time that's why i say that i say that
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 898.72 912.72 <o,f0,male> this scenario of this civilization was about becoming powerful intelligent like this idea we have invented this concept of god we are god now
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 913.16 922.17 <o,f0,male> we are it's almost done we have just to finish the story that is very very important and when you don't understand
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 922.60 930.41 <o,f0,male> really what's happened you cannot go and fight and work and build and things like that you go to the future
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 931.38 937.49 <o,f0,male> back back back back like that and you can fall and it's very dangerous no you
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 940.93 952.90 <o,f0,male> because we have almost finished i'll repeat this story and the beauty of this in perhaps fifty years sixty years we can finish completely this civilization and
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 954.51 961.64 <o,f0,male> to our children the possibility to invent a new story a new poetry a new
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 964.37 972.63 <o,f0,male> people who have been born worked lived and died before us these people who have worked so much
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 972.97 981.89 <o,f0,male> we have now bring beautiful things beautiful gifts we know so many things we can say to our children ok
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 982.43 990.02 <o,f0,male> done that was our story that passed now you have a duty invent a new story
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 990.94 999.57 <o,f0,male> a new poetry the only rule is we have not to have any idea about the next story
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 1000.36 1011.57 <o,f0,male> we give you white pages invent we give you the best tools the best tools and now do
PhilippeStarck_2007 1 PhilippeStarck_2007 1013.02 1019.25 <o,f0,male> it that's why i continue to work even if it's for toilet brush
