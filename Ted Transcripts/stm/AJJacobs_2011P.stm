AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 9.09 12.63 <o,f0,female> the
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 12.63 21.25 <o,f0,female> last decade subjecting myself to pain and humiliation hopefully for a good cause which is self improvement
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 21.25 37.32 <o,f0,female> and i 've done this in three parts so first i started with the mind and i decided to try to get smarter by reading the entire encyclopedia britannica from a to z or more precisely from
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 56.54 59.77 <o,f0,female> it had its downsides
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 90.75 95.72 <o,f0,female> because leviticus says you cannot shave so this is what i looked like by the end
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 95.72 108.69 <o,f0,female> thank you for that reaction laughter i look a little like moses or ted kaczynski i got both of them so there was the topiary there
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 108.69 123.67 <o,f0,female> and there 's the sheep now the final part of the trilogy was i wanted to focus on the body and try to be the healthiest person i could be the healthiest person alive so that 's what i 've been doing the last couple of years
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 123.67 132.76 <o,f0,female> and i just finished a couple of months ago and i have to say thank god because living so healthily was killing me
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 132.76 138.23 <o,f0,female> it was so overwhelming because the amount of things you have to do it 's just
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 138.23 143.8 <o,f0,female> mind boggling i was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 143.8 160.26 <o,f0,female> and they were telling me all the things i had to do i had to eat right exercise meditate pet dogs because that lowers the blood pressure i wrote the book on a treadmill and it took me about a thousand miles to write the book
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 173.9 179.39 <o,f0,female> went into sunscreen i was like a glazed doughnut for most of the year
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 185.74 194.63 <o,f0,female> that i should also wipe down all of the remote controls and iphones in my house because those are just orgies of germs so that
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 228.6 242.03 <o,f0,female> now it 's a little extreme i admit but if you think about this this is actually the freakonomics authors wrote about this that more people die on a per mile basis from drunk walking than from drunk driving
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 242.03 246 <o,f0,female> so something to think about tonight if you 've had a couple
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 246.46 251.17 <o,f0,female> so i finished and it was a success
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 283.77 286.83 <o,f0,female> so i finished and i
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 299.88 305.77 <o,f0,female> without the sex part because i have three young kids so that wasn 't happening but
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 309.58 313.12 <o,f0,female> and i finally
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 313.12 316.23 <o,f0,female> have stabilized so now i 'm back to
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 316.23 333.72 <o,f0,female> adopting many not all i don 't wear a helmet anymore but dozens of healthy behaviors that i adopted during my year it was really a life changing project and i of course don 't have time to go into all of them let me just tell you two really quickly
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 333.72 341.73 <o,f0,female> the first is and this was surprising to me i didn 't expect this to come out but i live a much quieter life now
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 354.28 372.3 <o,f0,female> and this is a real underestimated under appreciated health hazard not just because it harms our hearing which it obviously does but it actually initiates the fight or flight response a loud noise will get your fight or flight response going and this
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 372.3 376.74 <o,f0,female> over the years can cause real damage cardiovascular damage
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 376.74 390.71 <o,f0,female> the world health organization just did a big study that they published this year and it was done in europe and they estimated that one point six million years of healthy living are lost
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 390.71 403.07 <o,f0,female> every year in europe because of noise pollution so they think it 's actually very deadly and by the way it 's also terrible for your brain
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 410.43 429.69 <o,f0,female> they put dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall so that they could concentrate so without noise reduction technology our country would not exist so as a patriot i felt it was important to i wear all the earplugs and the earphones
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 443.15 462.7 <o,f0,female> that joy is so important to your health that very few of these behaviors will stick with me unless there 's some sense of pleasure and joy in them and just to give you one instance of this food
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 472.83 490.6 <o,f0,female> but i think we can use their techniques and apply them to healthy food to give just one example we love crunchiness mouthfeel so i basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness into a lot of my recipes throw in some sunflower seeds
AJJacobs_2011P 1 AJJacobs_2011P 490.6 495.44 <o,f0,female> and you can almost trick yourself into thinking you 're eating doritos laughter and
