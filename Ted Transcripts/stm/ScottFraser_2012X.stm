ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 21.61 25.01 <o,f0,male> january the eighteenth one thousand nine hundred and ninety one
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 25.8 27.86 <o,f0,male> in a small
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 28.16 29.95 <o,f0,male> bedroom community
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 39.7 49.24 <o,f0,male> to tell his teenage son and his five friends that it was time for them to stop horsing around on the front lawn and on the sidewalk to get home
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 49.29 52.75 <o,f0,male> finish their schoolwork and prepare themselves for bed
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 53.29 60.38 <o,f0,male> and as the father was administering these instructions a car drove by slowly
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 65.37 68.28 <o,f0,male> from the front passenger window
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 72.42 74.02 <o,f0,male> and the car sped off
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 81.31 87.79 <o,f0,male> they considered all the usual culprits and in less than twenty four hours they had selected their suspect
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 88.34 91.97 <o,f0,male> francisco carrillo a seventeen year old kid
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 92.04 95.31 <o,f0,male> who lived about two or three blocks away from where the shooting occurred
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 96.67 98.58 <o,f0,male> they found photos of him
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 115.53 118.28 <o,f0,male> that was all a preliminary hearing judge had to
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 125.87 132.88 <o,f0,male> in the investigation that followed before the actual trial each of the other five teenagers was shown
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 133.13 136.01 <o,f0,male> photographs the same photo array
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 145.34 158.01 <o,f0,male> the reason we 're not sure absolutely is because of the nature of evidence preservation in our judicial system but that 's another whole tedx talk for later
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 163.18 172.05 <o,f0,male> all six of the teenagers testified and indicated the identifications they had made in the photo array
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 174.96 177.05 <o,f0,male> he was convicted he was sentenced to life imprisonment
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 183.63 185.14 <o,f0,male> so what 's wrong
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 185.68 189.05 <o,f0,male> straightforward fair trial full investigation
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 190.5 193.12 <o,f0,male> oh yes no gun was ever found
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 207.9 210.23 <o,f0,male> and mr carrillo 's alibi
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 211.81 216.98 <o,f0,male> which of those parents here in the room might not lie
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 217.31 220.55 <o,f0,male> concerning the whereabouts of your son or daughter
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 232.17 234.8 <o,f0,male> which he has consistently for twenty one years
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 236.88 238.53 <o,f0,male> so what 's the problem
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 240.32 242.57 <o,f0,male> the problems actually for this kind of case
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 247.77 249.59 <o,f0,male> involving human memory
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 268.92 272.2 <o,f0,male> on the basis of later dna analysis
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 272.87 277.63 <o,f0,male> and you know that over three quarters of all of those cases of exoneration
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 283.57 285.32 <o,f0,male> during the trial that convicted
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 291.59 300.1 <o,f0,male> the other comes from an interesting aspect of human memory that 's related to various brain functions but i can sum up for the sake of brevity here
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 316.1 319.48 <o,f0,male> bits and pieces of the entire experience in front of us
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 319.9 321.8 <o,f0,male> and they 're stored in different parts of the brain
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 322.17 324.35 <o,f0,male> so now when it 's important
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 329.68 334.55 <o,f0,male> we have an incomplete we have a partial store
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 342.7 346.86 <o,f0,male> the brain fills in information that was not there
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 347.49 352.41 <o,f0,male> not originally stored from inference from speculation
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 352.7 358.38 <o,f0,male> from sources of information that came to you as the observer after the observation
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 379.06 383.99 <o,f0,male> that was part of the instigation for a group of appeal attorneys
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 384.41 387.83 <o,f0,male> led by an amazing lawyer named ellen eggers
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 398.58 402.71 <o,f0,male> they retained me as a forensic neurophysiologist
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 403.07 409.67 <o,f0,male> because i had expertise in eyewitness memory identification which obviously makes sense for this case
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 414.97 417.71 <o,f0,male> the nature of human night vision
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 424.91 426.8 <o,f0,male> in this carrillo case
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 427.26 434.21 <o,f0,male> one of the things that suddenly strikes you is that the investigating officers said the lighting was good
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 444.53 448.76 <o,f0,female> but this occurred in mid january in the northern hemisphere
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 448.95 450.52 <o,f0,female> at seven p m
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 473.82 478.81 <o,f0,male> the screen right here the only lighting in that area had to come from artificial sources
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 479.19 492.87 <o,f0,male> and that 's where i go out and i do the actual reconstruction of the scene with photometers with various measures of illumination and various other measures of color perception along with special cameras and high speed film
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 503.22 505.82 <o,f0,male> looking at the car going by and shooting
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 506.18 509.96 <o,f0,male> this is looking directly across the street from where they were standing
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 518.59 524.54 <o,f0,male> this is looking down to the east where the shooting vehicle sped off
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 531.98 535.56 <o,f0,male> as you can see it is at best
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 535.82 548.29 <o,f0,male> no one 's going to call this well lit good lighting and in fact as nice as these pictures are and the reason we take them is i knew i was going to have to testify in court and a picture is worth
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 548.29 556.53 <o,f0,male> more than a thousand words when you 're trying to communicate numbers abstract concepts like lux the international measurement of illumination
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 594.17 598.32 <o,f0,male> so these are some of the pictures that in fact i used when i testified
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 598.36 603.34 <o,f0,male> but more importantly were to me as a scientist are those readings the photometer readings which i can
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 613.27 614.88 <o,f0,male> and from my readings
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 628.01 643.65 <o,f0,male> and that there would be only scotopic vision which means there would be very little resolution what we call boundary or edge detection and that furthermore because the eyes would have been totally dilated under this light the depth of field the distance at which you can focus and see details
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 643.75 646.76 <o,f0,male> would have been less than eighteen inches away
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 649.52 656.76 <o,f0,male> i testified to that to the court and while the judge was very attentive it had been a very very long hearing
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 671.87 673.87 <o,f0,male> and here i became a bit audacious
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 674.47 687.28 <o,f0,male> and i turned and i asked the judge i said your honor i think you should go out and look at the scene yourself now i may have used a tone which was more like a dare than a request
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 693.71 696.44 <o,f0,male> that he said yes i will
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 697.02 699.95 <o,f0,male> a shocker in american jurisprudence
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 700.92 712.06 <o,f0,male> so in fact we found the same identical conditions we reconstructed the entire thing again he came out with an entire brigade of sheriff 's officers to protect him in this community
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 725.16 727.83 <o,f0,male> so he stood a few feet from the curb
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 730.21 733.27 <o,f0,male> we had a car that came by
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 733.42 737.34 <o,f0,male> same identical car as described by the teenagers
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 764.39 768.63 <o,f0,male> this is the car thirty feet away from the judge
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 771.67 775.65 <o,f0,male> there 's an arm sticking out of the passenger side and pointed back at you
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 776.28 778.37 <o,f0,male> that 's thirty feet away
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 784.53 786.07 <o,f0,male> there 's fifteen feet
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 788.25 790.16 <o,f0,male> at this point i became a little concerned
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 790.98 794.69 <o,f0,male> this judge is someone you 'd never want to play poker with
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 809.84 813.4 <o,f0,male> he turned to me and he says is there anything else you want me to look at
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 839.04 842.94 <o,f0,male> and i want it to come and i want it to stop
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 843.39 848.04 <o,f0,male> right in front of you three to four feet away and i want
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 848.04 855.68 <o,f0,male> the passenger to extend his hand with a black object and point it right at you and you can look at it as long as you want
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 858.08 862.05 <o,f0,male> and that 's what he saw
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 873.13 874.68 <o,f0,male> furthermore the roof of the
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 874.68 881.87 <o,f0,female> car is causing what we call a shadow cloud inside the car which is making it darker
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 883.21 886.08 <o,f0,female> and this is three to four feet away
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 888.32 893.19 <o,f0,female> why did i take the risk i knew that the depth of field was eighteen inches or less
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 894.01 896.29 <o,f0,male> three to four feet it might as well have been
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 896.85 898.42 <o,f0,male> a football field away
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 904.86 908.27 <o,f0,male> there was a few more days of evidence that was heard at the end
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 914.47 923.62 <o,f0,male> and furthermore he released mr carrillo so that he could aid in the preparation of his own defense if the prosecution decided to retry
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 942.96 946.78 <o,f0,male> he his girlfriend was pregnant when he went to trial
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 950.43 954.94 <o,f0,male> he and his son are both attending cal state long beach right now taking classes
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 968.44 973.56 <o,f0,male> first of all there 's a long history of antipathy between science and the law
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 973.56 975.24 <o,f0,male> in american jurisprudence
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 980.19 983.43 <o,f0,male> over decades of experience as a forensic expert
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 988.04 991.51 <o,f0,male> the opposing council always fight it and oppose it
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 993.52 998.03 <o,f0,male> one suggestion is that all of us become much more attuned to the necessity
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 1004.96 1011.38 <o,f0,male> i think one large step toward that is more requirements with all due respect to the law schools
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 1011.86 1014.72 <o,f0,male> of science technology engineering
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 1021.75 1027.31 <o,f0,male> think about how we select our judges in this country it 's very different than most other cultures
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 1031.01 1040.52 <o,f0,male> the caution that all of us have to have i constantly have to remind myself about just how accurate are the memories that we know are true
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 1040.86 1042.42 <o,f0,male> that we believe in
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 1044.4 1047.05 <o,f0,male> there is decades of research
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 1047.74 1050.78 <o,f0,male> examples and examples of cases like this
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 1051.22 1052.92 <o,f0,male> where individuals
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 1053.59 1058.69 <o,f0,male> really really believe none of those teenagers who identified
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 1061.69 1064.49 <o,f0,male> none of them thought they couldn 't see the person 's face
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 1064.94 1066.83 <o,f0,male> we all have to be very careful
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 1066.85 1070.38 <o,f0,male> all our memories are reconstructed memories
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 1070.93 1075.84 <o,f0,male> they are the product of what we originally experienced and everything that 's happened afterwards
ScottFraser_2012X 1 ScottFraser_2012X 1085.66 1091.91 <o,f0,male> that the accuracy of our memories is not measured in how vivid they are
