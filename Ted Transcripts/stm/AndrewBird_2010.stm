AndrewBird_2010 1 AndrewBird_2010 344.54 348.82 <o,f0,male> so i wanted to do something special
AndrewBird_2010 1 AndrewBird_2010 374.05 387.18 <o,f0,male> so this is basically a song about loops but not the kind of loops that i make up here they 're feedback loops and in the audio world that 's when the microphone gets too close to

AndrewBird_2010 1 AndrewBird_2010 786.59 791.15 <o,f0,male> i 'm going to finish up with a song of mine called weather systems
