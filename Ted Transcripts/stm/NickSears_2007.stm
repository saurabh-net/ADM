NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 17.73 21.81 <o,f0,male> fuller presented a particularly audacious proposal for the geoscope
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 22.02 24.89 <o,f0,male> it was a two hundred foot diameter geodesic sphere
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 35.24 40.56 <o,f0,male> he felt could truly inform and deeply affect the decision making of this body through
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 49.07 54.38 <o,f0,male> and today forty five years later we clearly have no less need for this kind of clarity and perspective
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 55.13 61.10 <o,f0,male> but what we do have is improved technology today we don't need one million lightbulbs to create a spherical display we can use
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 62.92 66.92 <o,f0,male> are smaller they're cheaper they're longer lasting they're more efficient
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 67.50 69.88 <o,f0,male> most importantly for this they're faster and this
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 71.29 80.41 <o,f0,male> combined with today 's high performance micro controllers allowed us to actually simulate in this piece over seventeen thousand leds using just sixty four
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 90.32 92.71 <o,f0,male> the equator 's speed is actually about sixty miles per hour
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 94.11 97.69 <o,f0,male> on board micro controllers that each time this ring rotates
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 98.73 106.90 <o,f0,male> it as it passes the rear of the display it picks up a position signal and from that the on board micro controllers can extrapolate the position of the ring
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 107.36 114.56 <o,f0,male> at all points around the revolution and display arbitrary bitmap images and animations but this is really just the beginning
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 115.46 123.68 <o,f0,male> in addition to higher resolution versions of this display my father and i are working on a new patent pending design for a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 124.32 137.63 <o,f0,male> it achieves this by rotating leds about two axes so as you can see here this is a eleven inch diameter circuit board these blocks represent leds and so you could see that as this disc rotates about this axis it will create
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 138.16 141.84 <o,f0,male> a disc of light that we can control that's nothing new that's a propeller clock that's
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 142.38 148.70 <o,f0,male> the rims that you can buy for your car but what is new is that when we rotate this disc about this axis
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 149.46 152.27 <o,f0,male> now this disc of light actually becomes a sphere of light
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 152.63 162.50 <o,f0,male> and so we can control that with micro controllers and create a fully volumetric three dimensional display with just two hundred and fifty six leds now this piece is currently in process
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 162.84 171.46 <o,f0,male> due out in may but what we've done is we've put together a small demo just to show the geometric translation of points into a sphere
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 186.35 190.61 <o,f0,male> and here you can see it's rotating about the vertical axis only creating circles
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 198.70 205.00 <o,f0,male> the shutter speed of the camera actually makes it slightly less effective in this case but this piece is due out in may
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 225.27 227.68 <o,f0,male> love to talk to you all and invite you to come down and take a closer look
