NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 15.68 21.88 <o,f0,male> the awesome story it begins about forty years ago when my mom and my dad came to canada

NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 45.80 59.11 <o,f0,male> we had quiet happy childhoods we had close family good friends a quiet street we grew up taking for granted a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted when they grew up things like
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 60.38 68.12 <o,f0,male> power always on in our houses things like schools across the street and hospitals down the road and popsicles in the backyard
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 69.38 72.37 <o,f0,male> we grew up and we grew older i went to high school

NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 85.10 98.21 <o,f0,male> but life was pretty good life was pretty good two thousand and six was a great year under clear blue skies in july in the wine region of ontario i got married surrounded by one hundred and fifty family
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 98.74 99.72 <o,f0,male> and friends
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 100.98 101.89 <o,f0,male> two thousand and seven was
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 103.50 108.75 <o,f0,male> i graduated from school and i went on a road trip with two of my closest friends
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 109.03 120.34 <o,f0,male> 's a picture of me and my friend chris on the coast of the pacific ocean we actually saw seals out of our car window and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them and then blocked them with our giant heads
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 122.97 128.37 <o,f0,female> so you can't actually see them but it was breathtaking believe me
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 135.93 148.12 <o,f0,male> not just me first of all the news was so heavy it's still heavy now and it was heavy before that but when you flip open a newspaper when you turned on the tv it was about ice caps melting
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 148.88 157.42 <o,f0,male> going on around the world earthquakes hurricanes and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse and then eventually did
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 159.51 165.53 <o,f0,male> so many of us losing our homes or our jobs or our retirements or our livelihoods
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 173.96 179.65 <o,f0,male> my marriage wasn't going well and we just were growing further and further apart
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 180.89 189.09 <o,f0,male> one day my wife came home from work and summoned the courage through a lot of tears to have a very honest conversation and she said
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 191.88 192.72 <o,f0,male> and it was
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 193.89 198.38 <o,f0,male> one of the most painful things i'd ever heard and certainly the most heartbreaking thing i'd ever heard
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 199.12 203.17 <o,f0,male> until only a month later when i heard something even more heartbreaking
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 203.98 214.25 <o,f0,male> my friend chris who i just showed you a picture of had been battling mental illness for some time and for those of you whose lives have been touched by mental illness you know how challenging it can be
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 214.61 220.70 <o,f0,male> i spoke to him on the phone at ten thirty pm on a sunday night we talked about the tv show we watched that evening
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 221.38 223.80 <o,f0,male> and monday morning i found out that he
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 230.10 235.00 <o,f0,male> it was a really heavy time and as these dark clouds were circling me and i was
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 238.45 243.66 <o,f0,male> i said to myself that i really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 244.56 246.44 <o,f0,male> so i came home from work one
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 247.37 253.43 <o,f0,male> and i logged onto the computer and i started up a tiny website called one thousand awesomethings com
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 255.30 267.98 <o,f0,male> i was trying to remind myself of the simple universal little pleasures that we all love but we just don't talk about enough things like waiters and waitresses who bring you free refills without asking being the first table to get called up to the dinner buffet at a wedding
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 268.49 274.21 <o,f0,male> wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer or when cashiers open up a new check out lane at the grocery store and you get to be first in line
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 280.35 288.33 <o,f0,male> and slowly over time i started putting myself in a better mood i mean fifty thousand
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 288.67 296.93 <o,f0,male> blogs are started a day and so my blog was just one of those fifty thousand and nobody read it except for my mom
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 298.26 302.95 <o,f0,male> although i should say that my traffic did skyrocket and go up by one hundred percent when she forwarded it to my dad
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 306.47 314.06 <o,f0,female> i got excited when it started getting tens of hits and then i started getting excited when it started getting dozens and then hundreds
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 314.24 317.15 <o,f0,male> and then thousands and then millions
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 318.64 321.40 <o,f0,male> getting bigger and bigger and bigger and then i got a phone call
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 324.17 326.30 <o,f0,male> you 've just won the best blog in the world award
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 327.76 329.53 <o,f0,female> was like that sounds totally fake
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 343.86 344.99 <o,f0,female> it turns out i
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 345.21 355.20 <o,f0,male> on a plane and i ended up walking a red carpet between sarah silverman and jimmy fallon and martha stewart and i went onstage to accept a webby award for best blog and the surprise and
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 356.81 367.00 <o,f0,male> the amazement of that was only overshadowed by my return to toronto when in my inbox ten literary agents were waiting for me to talk about putting this into a book
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 392.30 399.68 <o,f0,male> over the last few years i haven't had that much time to really think but lately i have had the opportunity to take a step back and ask myself
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 400.10 407.33 <o,f0,male> what is it over the last few years that helped me grow my website but also grow myself and i've summarized those things for me personally
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 408.41 410.95 <o,f0,male> three a 's they are attitude
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 415.61 417.30 <o,f0,male> talk about each one briefly
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 418.44 419.31 <o,f0,male> so attitude
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 421.10 430.10 <o,f0,male> we're all going to get lumps and we're all going to get bumps none of us can predict the future but we do know one thing about it and that's that it ain't gonna go according to plan
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 431.27 439.02 <o,f0,male> we will all have high highs and big days and proud moments of smiles on graduation stages father daughter dances at weddings and
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 446.98 450.59 <o,f0,male> it's sad and it's not pleasant to talk about but
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 451.66 455.20 <o,f0,male> your husband might leave you your girlfriend could cheat
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 467.17 467.77 <o,f0,male> scenes
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 469.11 470.58 <o,f0,male> your mom could get cancer
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 471.52 478.73 <o,f0,male> your dad could get mean and there are times in life when you will be tossed in the well too with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 487.70 497.30 <o,f0,male> one you can swirl and twirl and gloom and doom forever or two you can grieve and then face the future with newly sober eyes
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 498.30 508.44 <o,f0,male> having a great attitude is about choosing option number two and choosing no matter how difficult it is no matter what pain hits you choosing to move forward and move on and take baby steps into the future
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 511.62 513.84 <o,f0,male> the second a is awareness
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 515.51 517.30 <o,f0,male> i love hanging out with three year olds
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 519.43 527.00 <o,f0,male> i love the way that they see the world because they're seeing the world for the first time i love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk i love the way that
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 527.49 539.50 <o,f0,male> stare slack jawed at their first baseball game with wide eyes and a mitt on their hand soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts and the smell of the hotdogs i love the way that they'll spend hours picking dandelions in the backyard and putting them into
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 550.63 554.24 <o,f0,male> having a sense of awareness is just about embracing your inner three year old
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 561.54 565.30 <o,f0,male> they're in there and being aware is just about remembering that
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 566.13 568.54 <o,f0,male> you saw everything you've seen for the first time
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 570.01 584.14 <o,f0,male> so there was a time when it was your first time ever hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work there was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery and smelt the bakery air or the first time you pulled a twenty dollar bill out of your old jacket pocket and said found money
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 586.77 588.15 <o,f0,male> the last a is
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 603.73 614.02 <o,f0,male> or rosey grier as people used to call him grew up and grew into a three hundred lb six foot five linebacker in the nfl he 's number seventy six in the picture
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 614.42 628.15 <o,f0,male> here he is pictured with the fearsome foursome these were four guys on the l a rams in the nineteen sixties you did not want to go up against they were tough football players doing what they love which was crushing skulls and separating shoulders on the football
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 629.12 638.30 <o,f0,male> but rosey grier also had another passion in his deeply authentic self he also loved needlepoint
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 640.84 645.13 <o,f0,female> he loved knitting he said that it calmed him down it relaxed him it took away his fear of flying
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 650.60 654.56 <o,f0,male> so much that after he retired from the nfl he started joining clubs and he even put out a
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 655.48 657.01 <o,f0,female> called rosey grier 's needlepoint
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 665.23 667.33 <o,f0,female> if you notice he 's actually needlepointing his own face
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 670.78 672.61 <o,f0,female> what i love about this story is that
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 701.07 703.49 <o,f0,male> so those are the three a 's
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 703.75 708.50 <o,f0,male> for the closing thought i want to take you all the way back to my parents coming to canada
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 708.99 710.68 <o,f0,male> i don't know what it would feel like
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 711.27 718.07 <o,f0,male> coming to a new country when you're in your mid twenties i don't know because i never did it but i would imagine that it would take a great attitude
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 719.06 726.15 <o,f0,male> i would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your surroundings and appreciating the small wonders that you're starting to see in your new world
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 726.67 733.14 <o,f0,male> and i think you'd have to be really authentic you'd have to be really true to yourself in order to get through what you're being exposed to
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 772.49 780.48 <o,f0,male> it's a great story because what happened was he got off the plane at the toronto airport and he was welcomed by a non profit group which i'm sure someone in this room runs
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 782.95 787.36 <o,f0,male> this non profit group had a big welcoming lunch for all the new immigrants to canada
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 796.76 803.92 <o,f0,male> was olives those little white onions there was rolled up turkey cold cuts rolled up ham cold cuts rolled up roast beef cold cuts and little cubes
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 813.69 816.93 <o,f0,male> tarts and there was pies lots and lots of pies
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 818.10 823.36 <o,f0,male> my dad tells the story he says the craziest thing was i'd never seen any of that before except bread
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 825.92 828.88 <o,f0,female> i didn't know what was meat what was vegetarian i was eating
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 832.37 835.29 <o,f0,female> i just couldn't believe how many things you can get here
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 837.55 843.17 <o,f0,male> when i was five years old my dad used to take me grocery shopping and he would
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 853.91 856.99 <o,f0,male> date from morocco he 's like do you know where morocco even
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 862.16 862.47 <o,f0,female> a
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 864.49 864.77 <o,f0,female> and
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 883.34 894.95 <o,f0,male> and then sailed all the way across the atlantic ocean and then put it in another truck and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house so they could sell it to us for twenty five cents
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 896.74 902.04 <o,f0,male> i don't believe that and he 's like i don't believe it either things are amazing there's just so many things to be happy about
NeilPasricha_2010X 1 NeilPasricha_2010X 902.87 912.18 <o,f0,male> when i stop to think about it he 's absolutely right there are so many things to be happy about we are the only species on the only life giving
