BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 16.02 28.56 <o,f0,male> this is about state budgets this is probably the most boring topic of the whole morning but i want to tell you i think it 's an important topic that we need to care about
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 28.56 35.1 <o,f0,male> state budgets are big big money i 'll show you the numbers
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 35.1 50.73 <o,f0,male> and they get very little scrutiny the understanding is very low many of the people involved have special interests or short term interests that get them not thinking about what the implications of the trends are
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 50.73 53.67 <o,f0,male> and these budgets
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 53.67 71.46 <o,f0,male> are the key for our future they 're the key for our kids most education funding whether it 's k through twelve or the great universities or community colleges most of the money for those things is coming out of these state budgets but we have a problem
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 71.46 78.25 <o,f0,male> here 's the overall picture u s economy is big fourteen point seven trillion
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 83.65 99.74 <o,f0,male> so this is combining the federal level which is the largest the state level and the local level and it 's really in this combined way that you get an overall sense of what 's going on because there 's a lot of complex things like medicaid and research money that flow across those boundaries
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 116.07 130.58 <o,f0,male> sort of a mind blowing number and some of that in fact is due to the fact that we 've had an economic recession receipts go down some spending programs go up but most of it is not because of that
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 130.58 136.39 <o,f0,male> most of it is because of ways that the liabilities are building up and the trends
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 136.39 139.45 <o,f0,male> and that creates a huge challenge
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 139.45 157.74 <o,f0,male> in fact this is the forecast picture there are various things in here i could say we might raise more revenue or medical innovation will make the spending even higher it is an increasingly difficult picture even assuming the economy does quite well probably better than
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 164.57 170.96 <o,f0,male> how did we get here how could you have a problem like this after all at least on paper
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 170.96 188.25 <o,f0,male> there 's this notion that these state budgets are balanced only one state says they don 't have to balance the budget but what this means actually is that there 's a pretense there 's no real true balancing going on and in a sense the games they play
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 188.25 191.85 <o,f0,male> to hide that actually obscure the topic so much
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 191.85 197.43 <o,f0,male> that people don 't see things that are actually pretty straight forward challenges
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 197.43 214.6 <o,f0,male> when jerry brown was elected this was the challenge that was put to him that is through various gimmicks and things a so called balanced budget had led him to have twenty five billion missing out of the seventy six billion in proposed spending
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 214.6 220.71 <o,f0,male> now he 's put together some thoughts about half of that he 'll cut another half
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 220.71 225.81 <o,f0,male> perhaps in a very complex set of steps taxes will be approved
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 225.81 233.63 <o,f0,male> but even so as you go out into those future years various pension costs health costs go up enough
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 233.63 249.83 <o,f0,male> and the revenue does not go up enough so you get a big squeeze what were those things that allowed us to hide this well some really nice little tricks and these were somewhat noticed the paper said it 's not really balanced it 's got holes
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 249.83 256.31 <o,f0,male> it perpetuates deficit spending it 's riddled with gimmicks and
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 256.31 257.86 <o,f0,male> really when you get down to it
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 258.33 272.6 <o,f0,male> the guys at enron never would have done this this is so blatant so extreme is anyone paying attention to some of the things these guys do they borrow money
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 272.6 281.85 <o,f0,male> they 're not supposed to but they figure out a way they make you pay more in withholding just to help their cash flow out they sell off the assets
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 281.85 284.14 <o,f0,male> they defer the payments
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 284.14 292.26 <o,f0,male> they sell off the revenues from tobacco and california 's not unique in fact there 's about five states that are worse and only really four states
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 292.26 304.4 <o,f0,male> that don 't face this big challenge so it 's systemic across the entire country it really comes from the fact that certain long term obligations health care where innovation makes it more expensive
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 304.4 313.54 <o,f0,male> early retirement and pension where the age structure gets worse for you and just generosity that these mis accounting things allow to develop over time
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 328.13 342.13 <o,f0,male> the forecast for the medical piece alone is to go from twenty six percent of the budget to forty two percent well what 's going to give well in order to accommodate that you would have to cut education spending in half
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 342.13 361.85 <o,f0,male> it really is this young versus the old to some degree if you don 't change that revenue picture if you don 't solve what you 're doing in health care you 're going to be deinvesting in the young the great university of california university system the great things that have gone on won 't happen
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 361.85 381.24 <o,f0,male> so far it 's meant layoffs increased class sizes within the education community there 's this discussion of should it just be the young teachers who get laid off or the less good teachers who get laid off and there 's a discussion if you 're going to increase class sizes where do you do that how much effect does that have and unfortunately as you get into that people get confused and think
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 381.24 386.51 <o,f0,male> well maybe you think that 's okay in fact no education spending should not be cut
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 386.51 390.6 <o,f0,male> there 's ways if it 's temporary to minimize the impact
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 390.6 407.43 <o,f0,male> but it 's a problem it 's also really a problem for where we need to go technology has a role to play well we need money to experiment with that to get those tools in there there 's the idea of paying teachers for effectiveness measuring them giving them feedback taking videos in the classroom
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 415.58 421.81 <o,f0,male> in a situation where you have growth you put the new money into this or even if you 're flat you might shift money into it
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 432.84 451.47 <o,f0,male> so what 's going on where 's the brain trust that 's in error here well there really is no brain trust laughter it 's sort of the voters it 's sort of us showing up just look at this spending california will spend over one hundred billion
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 451.47 455.96 <o,f0,male> microsoft thirty eight google about nineteen
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 455.96 470.33 <o,f0,male> the amount of iq in good numeric analysis both inside google and microsoft and outside with analysts and people of various opinions should they have spent on that no they wasted their money on this what about this thing it really is quite phenomenal
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 470.33 477.79 <o,f0,male> everybody has an opinion there 's great feedback and the numbers are used
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 477.79 485.89 <o,f0,male> to make decisions if you go over the education spending and the health care spending particularly these long term trends you don 't have
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 485.9 493.74 <o,f0,male> that type of involvement on a number that 's more important in terms of equity in terms of learning so what do we need to do
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 493.74 510.99 <o,f0,male> we need better tools we can get some things out on the internet i 'm going to use my website to put up some things that will give the basic picture we need lots more there 's a few good books one about school spending and where the money comes from how that 's changed over time and the challenge
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 510.99 518.98 <o,f0,male> we need better accounting we need to take the fact that the current employees the future liabilities they create that should come out of the current budget
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 518.98 524.84 <o,f0,male> we need to understand why they 've done the pension accounting the way they have it should be more like
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 524.84 527.88 <o,f0,male> private accounting it 's the gold standard
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 527.88 537.27 <o,f0,male> and finally we need to really reward politicians whenever they say there 's these long term problems we can 't say oh you 're the messenger with bad news we just shot you
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 537.27 549.73 <o,f0,male> in fact there are some like these erskine bowles alan simpson and others who have gone through and given proposals for this overall federal health spending state level problem but in fact their work
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 557.64 559.43 <o,f0,male> than their assumptions
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 559.43 569.74 <o,f0,male> so we need these pieces now i think this is a solvable problem it 's a great country with lots of people but we have to draw
BillGates_2011U 1 BillGates_2011U 582.3 596.96 <o,f0,male> and that 's the kind of thing the investment in the young that makes us great allows us to contribute it allows us to do the art the biotechnology the software and all those magic things
