DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 30.71 39.00 <o,f0,male> and the reason i'm saying this is that you may have the idea this problem is relatively recent that people have just sort of figured out about it and now with
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 39.35 45.42 <o,f0,male> kyoto and the governator and people beginning to actually do something we may be on the road to a solution the fact is
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 46.85 57.46 <o,f0,male> we've known about this problem for fifty years depending on how you count it we have talked about it endlessly over the last decade or so and we've accomplished close to zip
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 58.46 68.03 <o,f0,male> this is the growth rate of co two in the atmosphere you've seen this in various forms but maybe you haven't seen this one what this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 79.43 85.99 <o,f0,male> to make the projections look as bad as possible that emissions would never grow as fast as that red line but in fact they're growing
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 95.21 103.88 <o,f0,male> and the rate at which the arctic sea ice is going away is a lot quicker than models so despite all sorts of experts like me flying around the planet and burning jet fuel
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 113.49 125.50 <o,f0,male> really need to do to put the brakes on this very high inertial thing our big economy we've really hardly started really we're doing this basically really not very much
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 127.68 137.56 <o,f0,male> i don't want to depress you too much the problem is absolutely soluble and even soluble in a way that's reasonably cheap cheap meaning sort of the cost of the military not the cost of
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 139.10 145.33 <o,f0,male> medical care cheap meaning a few percent of gdp no this is really important to have this sense of scale
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 145.60 155.60 <o,f0,male> so the problem is soluble and the way we should go about solving it is say dealing with electricity production which causes something like forty three or so percent and rising of co two emissions
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 184.88 194.14 <o,f0,male> what you do if you don't stop the emissions quickly enough and you need to deal somehow break the link between human actions that change climate and the climate change itself
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 194.48 206.32 <o,f0,male> and that's particularly important because of course while we can adapt to climate change and it's important to be honest here there will be some benefits to climate change oh yes i think it's bad i've spent my whole life working to stop it but one of the reasons it's politically hard
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 217.35 227.15 <o,f0,male> so this problem is absolutely soluble this geo engineering idea in it's simplest form is basically the following you could put signed particles say sulfuric acid particles sulfates
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 227.49 239.40 <o,f0,male> into the upper atmosphere the stratosphere where they'd reflect away sunlight and cool the planet and i know for certain that that will work not that there aren't side effects but i know for certain it will work and the reason is it's been done
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 240.07 241.25 <o,f0,male> and it was done not by us
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 242.14 251.74 <o,f0,male> but by nature here 's mount pinatubo in the early nineties that put a whole bunch of sulfur in the stratosphere with a sort of atomic bomb like cloud the result of that was pretty dramatic
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 252.12 261.57 <o,f0,male> after that and some previous volcanoes we have you see a quite dramatic cooling of the atmosphere so this lower bar is the upper atmosphere the stratosphere and it heats up after these volcanoes
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 261.89 271.73 <o,f0,male> but you'll notice that in the upper bar which is the lower atmosphere and the surface it cools down because we shielded the atmosphere a little bit there's no big mystery about it there's lots of mystery in the details
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 271.95 280.72 <o,f0,male> and there's some bad side effects like it partially destroys the ozone layer and i'll get to that in a minute but it clearly cools down and one other thing it's fast
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 282.08 288.19 <o,f0,male> really important to say so much of the other things that we ought to do like slowing emissions are intrinsically slow because
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 297.86 305.72 <o,f0,male> is the sum of emissions over time so you can't step on the brakes very quickly but if you do this it's quick and there are times you might like to do something quick
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 307.42 313.75 <o,f0,male> another thing you might wonder about is does it work can you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 324.77 330.43 <o,f0,male> with twice the amount of co two in the air the lower graph is with twice the amount of co two and one point eight percent less sunlight
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 330.65 342.38 <o,f0,male> and you're back to the original climate and this graph from ken caldera it's important to say came because ken at a meeting that i believe marty hoffart was also at in the mid nineties ken and i stood up at the back of the meeting and said geo engineering won 't work and
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 360.59 371.87 <o,f0,male> in fact which had all the modern climate science the only thing they talked about doing was geo engineering it didn't even talk about cutting emissions which is an incredible shift in our thinking about this problem i'm not saying we shouldn 't cut emissions we should
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 372.20 380.94 <o,f0,male> but it made exactly this point so in a sense there's not much new the one new thing is this essay so i should say i guess that since the time of
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 396.04 408.32 <o,f0,male> hot topic if i may make the pun in the last fifteen years this became so un pc we couldn't talk about it it just sunk below the surface we weren't allowed to speak about it but in the last year paul crutzen published this essay
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 409.04 422.91 <o,f0,male> saying roughly what's all been said before that maybe given our very slow rate of progress in solving this problem and the uncertain impacts we should think about things like this he said roughly what's been said before the big deal was he happened to have won the nobel prize for ozone chemistry and so people took him seriously
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 423.10 431.07 <o,f0,male> when he said we should think about this even though there would be some ozone impacts and in fact he had some ideas to make them go away there was all sorts of press coverage all over the world
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 431.61 444.74 <o,f0,male> going right down to doctor strangelove saves the earth from the economist and that got me thinking i've worked on this topic on and off but not so much technically and i was actually lying in bed thinking one night and i thought about this child 's toy hence the title of my talk
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 458.90 471.41 <o,f0,male> and it turns out i woke up the next morning and i started to calculate this it was very hard to calculate from first principles i was stumped but then i found out that there were all sorts of papers already published that addressed this topic because it happens already in the natural atmosphere
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 490.69 500.62 <o,f0,male> gas molecules that bounce off the warm side bounce away with some extra velocity because it's warm and so you see a net force away from the sun that's called the photophoretic force
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 511.73 522.26 <o,f0,male> but it looks like we could achieve long atmospheric lifetimes much longer than before because they're levitated we can move things out of the stratosphere into the mesosphere in principle solving the ozone problem
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 522.91 531.91 <o,f0,male> i'm sure there will be other problems that arise finally we could make the particles migrate to over the poles so we could arrange the climate engineering so it really focused on the poles
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 556.98 570.67 <o,f0,male> that if engineers and scientists really turned their minds to this it's amazing how we can affect the planet the one thing about this is that it gives us extraordinary leverage this improved science and engineering will whether we like it or not
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 587.32 588.52 <o,f0,male> now suppose that
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 589.24 599.42 <o,f0,male> space aliens arrived maybe they're going to land at the un headquarters down the road here or maybe they'll pick a smarter spot but suppose they arrive and they give you a box
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 623.75 630.54 <o,f0,male> we're building that box the scientists and the engineers of the world are building it piece by piece in their labs even when they're doing it for other reasons
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 631.74 639.74 <o,f0,male> just working on protecting the environment they have no interest in crazy ideas like engineering the whole planet they develop science that makes it easier and easier to do
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 640.54 643.98 <o,f0,male> and so i guess my view on this is not that i want to do it i do not
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 644.80 656.00 <o,f0,male> but that we should move this out of the shadows and talk about it seriously because sooner or later we'll be confronted with decisions about this and it's better if we think hard about it even if we want to think hard about reasons why we should never do
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 658.97 664.04 <o,f0,male> give you two different ways to think about this problem that are the beginning of my
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 664.51 672.23 <o,f0,male> thinking about how to think about it but what we need is not just a few oddballs like me thinking about this we need a broader debate a debate that involves
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 681.78 695.33 <o,f0,male> so here 's one way to think about it which is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because it's cheaper i guess the thing i haven't said about this is it is absurdly cheap it's conceivable that say using the sulfates method or this method i've come up with you could
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 695.97 706.03 <o,f0,male> create an ice age at a cost of one percent of gdp it's very cheap we have a lot of leverage it's not a good idea but it's just important i'll tell you how big
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 707.03 716.36 <o,f0,male> the lever is the lever is that big and that calculation isn't much in dispute you might argue about the sanity of it but the leverage is
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 720.47 733.17 <o,f0,male> so because of this we could deal with the problem simply by stopping reducing emissions and just as the concentrations go up we can increase the amount of geo engineering i don't think anybody takes that seriously
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 733.76 741.90 <o,f0,male> because under this scenario we walk further and further away from the current climate we have all sorts of other problems like ocean acidification that come from co two in the atmosphere anyway
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 742.84 749.01 <o,f0,male> nobody but maybe one or two very odd folks really suggest this but here 's a case which is harder to reject
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 749.93 761.10 <o,f0,male> let 's say that we don't do geo engineering we do what we ought to do which is get serious about cutting emissions but we don't really know how quickly we have to cut them there's a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much climate change is too much
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 782.36 791.89 <o,f0,male> we've seen the worst of it but maybe on that day we also find that the greenland ice sheet is really melting unacceptably fast fast enough to put meters of sea level
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 793.55 799.36 <o,f0,male> on the oceans in the next one hundred years and remove some of the biggest cities from the map that's an absolutely possible scenario
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 808.15 819.73 <o,f0,male> that's a very different way to look at the problem it's using this as risk control not instead of action it's saying that you do some geo engineering for a little while to take the worst of the heat off not that you'd use it as a substitute for action
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 820.13 828.31 <o,f0,male> but there is a problem with that view and the problem is the following knowledge that geo engineering is possible makes the climate impacts look less fearsome
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 828.50 835.04 <o,f0,male> and that makes a weaker commitment to cutting emissions today this is what economists call a moral hazard
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 835.48 848.33 <o,f0,male> and that's one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about and in general i think it's the underlying reason that it's been politically unacceptable to talk about this but you don't make good policy by hiding things in a drawer
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 849.24 850.90 <o,f0,male> three questions and then one final quote
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 851.54 853.29 <o,f0,male> should we do serious research on this topic
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 854.66 863.21 <o,f0,male> should we have a national research program that looks at this not just at how you would do it better but also what all the risks and downsides of it are right now you have a few enthusiasts talking about it
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 863.58 870.35 <o,f0,male> some in a positive side some in a negative side but that's a dangerous state to be in because there's very little depth of knowledge on this topic
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 870.71 880.54 <o,f0,male> a very small amount of money would get us some many of us maybe now me think we should do that but i have a lot of reservations my reservations are principally about the moral hazard problem
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 881.16 890.59 <o,f0,male> and i don't really know how we can best avoid the moral hazard i think there is a serious problem as you talk about this people begin to think they don't need to work so hard to cut emissions another thing is maybe we need
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 904.35 915.59 <o,f0,male> they may not be very interested in our moral conversations about how to do this and they may just decide they'd really rather have a geo engineered world than a non geoengineered world and we'll have no international mechanism to figure out who makes the decision
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 916.41 927.06 <o,f0,male> so here 's one last thought which was said much much better twenty five years ago in the u s national academy report than i can say today and i think it really summarizes where we are here
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 927.58 941.47 <o,f0,male> that the co two problem the climate problem that we've heard about is driving lots of things innovations in energy technologies that will reduce emissions but also i think inevitably it will drive us towards thinking about climate and weather control whether we like it or not
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 942.76 950.15 <o,f0,male> begin thinking about it even if the reason we're thinking about it is to construct arguments for why we shouldn 't do it thank you very much
