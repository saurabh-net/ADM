SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 13.11 21.51 <o,f0,male> i want to talk to you about is what we can learn from studying the genomes of living people and extinct humans
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 21.51 36.75 <o,f0,male> but before doing that i just briefly want to remind you about what you already know that our genomes our genetic material are stored in almost all cells in our bodies in chromosomes in the form of dna which is this famous double helical molecule
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 68.17 86.21 <o,f0,male> and we can then see the result of such mutations when we compare dna sequences among us here in the room for example if we compare my genome to the genome of you approximately every one thousand two hundred one thousand three hundred letters will differ between us
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 125.59 144.83 <o,f0,male> and because these mutations happen approximately as a function of time you can transform these differences to estimates of time where the two humans typically will share a common ancestor about half a million years ago and with the chimpanzees it will be in the order of five million years ago
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 144.83 163.91 <o,f0,male> so what has now happened in the last few years is that there are account technologies around that allow you to see many many pieces of dna very quickly so we can now in a matter of hours determine a whole human genome each of us of course contains two human genomes one from our mothers and one from our fathers
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 163.91 166.47 <o,f0,male> and they are around three billion
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 166.47 168.02 <o,f0,male> such letters long
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 168.04 183.43 <o,f0,male> and we will find that the two genomes in me or one genome of mine we want to use will have about three million differences in the order of that and what you can then also begin to do is to say how are these genetic differences distributed across
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 194.87 208.47 <o,f0,male> this is surprising of course because in the order of six to eight times fewer people live in africa than outside africa yet the people inside africa have more genetic variation
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 235.1 252.64 <o,f0,male> and together with the methods to date these genetic differences this has led to the insight that modern humans humans that are essentially indistinguishable from you and me evolved in africa quite recently between one hundred and two hundred thousand years ago
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 252.64 272.08 <o,f0,male> and later between one hundred and fifty thousand years ago or so went out of africa to colonize the rest of the world so what i often like to say is that from a genomic perspective we are all africans we either live inside africa today or in quite recent exile
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 272.08 289.84 <o,f0,male> another consequence of this recent origin of modern humans is that genetic variants are generally distributed widely in the world in many places and they tend to vary as gradients from a bird 's eye perspective
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 302.75 310.07 <o,f0,male> estimate where that person comes from provided that its parents or grandparents haven 't moved around too much
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 319.37 324.21 <o,f0,male> well we can begin to ask those questions also there is for example a project
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 324.21 342.13 <o,f0,male> that 's underway to sequence a thousand individuals their genomes from different parts of the world they 've sequenced one hundred and eighty five africans from two populations in africa they 've sequenced approximately equally as many people in europe and in china
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 342.13 353.54 <o,f0,male> and we can begin to say how much variance do we find how many letters that vary in at least one of those individual sequences and it 's a lot thirty eight million
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 385.14 403.63 <o,f0,male> this may be surprising maybe a single individual is misclassified or so so we can relax the criterion a bit and say how many positions do we find where ninety five percent of people in africa have one variant ninety five percent another variant and the number of that is twelve
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 403.63 419.41 <o,f0,male> so this is very surprising it means that when we look at people and see a person from africa and a person from europe or asia we cannot for a single position in the genome with one hundred percent accuracy predict what the person would carry
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 419.49 424.78 <o,f0,male> and only for twelve positions can we hope to be ninety five percent right
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 424.78 432.96 <o,f0,male> this may be surprising because we can of course look at these people and quite easily say where they or their ancestors came from
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 432.96 442.28 <o,f0,male> so what this means now is that those traits we then look at and so readily see facial features skin color hair structure
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 442.28 453.4 <o,f0,male> are not determined by single genes with big effects but are determined by many different genetic variants that seem to vary in frequency between different parts of the world
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 480.72 495.78 <o,f0,male> or that have to do with how our immune systems deal with microbes that try to invade our bodies but so those are all parts of our bodies where we very directly interact with our environment in a direct confrontation if you like
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 521.95 527.69 <o,f0,male> so there 's another interesting thing that comes from this realization
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 527.72 532.49 <o,f0,male> that humans have a recent common origin in africa
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 542.2 552.64 <o,f0,male> most famously perhaps neanderthals these robust forms of humans compared to the left here with a modern human skeleton on the right
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 552.64 563.94 <o,f0,male> that existed in western asia and europe since several hundreds of thousands of years so an interesting question is what happened when we met what happened to the neanderthals
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 563.94 579.17 <o,f0,male> and to begin to answer such questions my research group since over twenty five years now works on methods to extract dna from remains of neanderthals and extinct animals that are tens of thousands of years old
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 579.17 594.34 <o,f0,male> so this involves a lot of technical issues in how you extract the dna how you convert it to a form you can sequence you have to work very carefully to avoid contamination of experiments with dna from yourself
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 594.34 604.28 <o,f0,male> and this then in conjunction with these methods that allow very many dna molecules to be sequenced very rapidly allowed us last year
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 604.28 616.93 <o,f0,male> to present the first version of the neanderthal genome so that any one of you can now look on the internet on the neanderthal genome or at least on the fifty five percent of it that we 've been able to reconstruct so far
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 616.93 621.92 <o,f0,male> and you can begin to compare it to the genomes of people who live today
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 621.92 638.84 <o,f0,male> and one question that you may then want to ask is what happened when we met did we mix or not and the way to ask that question is to look at the neanderthal that comes from southern europe and compare it to genomes of people who live today
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 638.84 656.4 <o,f0,male> so we then look to do this with pairs of individuals starting with two africans looking at the two african genomes finding places where they differ from each other and in each case ask what is a neanderthal like does it match one african or the other african
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 656.4 675.57 <o,f0,male> we would expect there to be no difference because neanderthals were never in africa they should be equal have no reason to be closer to one african than another african and that 's indeed the case statistically speaking there is no difference in how often the neanderthal matches one african or the other
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 712.09 717.06 <o,f0,male> presumably they did so first in the middle east where there were neanderthals living
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 717.06 730.14 <o,f0,male> if they then mixed with each other there then those modern humans that became the ancestors of everyone outside africa carried with them this neanderthal component in their genome to the rest of the world
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 730.14 738.41 <o,f0,male> so that today the people living outside africa have about two and a half percent of their dna from neanderthals
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 738.41 746.74 <o,f0,male> so having now a neanderthal genome on hand as a reference point and having the technologies to look at
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 746.77 752.39 <o,f0,male> ancient remains and extract the dna we can begin to apply them elsewhere in the world
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 790.08 806.02 <o,f0,male> and we found that this individual shared a common origin for his dna sequences with neanderthals around six hundred and forty thousand years ago and further back eight hundred thousand years ago is there a common origin with present day humans
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 806.02 825.13 <o,f0,male> so this individual comes from a population that shares an origin with neanderthals but far back and then have a long independent history we call this group of humans that we then described for the first time from this tiny tiny little piece of bone the denisovans after this place where they were first described
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 825.13 834.42 <o,f0,male> so we can then ask for denisovans the same things as for the neanderthals did they mix with ancestors of present day people
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 834.42 845.97 <o,f0,male> if we ask that question and compare the denisovan genome to people around the world we surprisingly find no evidence of denisovan dna in any people living
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 845.97 855.05 <o,f0,male> even close to siberia today but we do find it in papua new guinea and in other islands in melanesia and the pacific
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 855.05 869.94 <o,f0,male> so this presumably means that these denisovans had been more widespread in the past since we don 't think that the ancestors of melanesians were ever in siberia so from studying these genomes of extinct humans
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 869.94 876.54 <o,f0,male> we 're beginning to arrive at a picture of what the world looked like when modern humans started coming out of africa
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 876.54 895.33 <o,f0,male> in the west there were neanderthals in the east there were denisovans maybe other forms of humans too that we 've not yet described we don 't know quite where the borders between these people were but we know that in southern siberia there were both neanderthals and denisovans at least at some time in the past
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 895.33 915.03 <o,f0,male> then modern humans emerged somewhere in africa came out of africa presumably in the middle east they meet neanderthals mix with them continue to spread over the world and somewhere in southeast asia they meet denisovans and mix with them and continue on out into the pacific
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 961.43 977.97 <o,f0,male> and there were older earlier forms of humans there and since we mixed elsewhere i 'm pretty sure that one day when we will perhaps have a genome of also these earlier forms in africa we will find that they have also mixed with early modern humans in africa
