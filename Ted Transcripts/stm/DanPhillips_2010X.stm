DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 23.40 31.67 <o,f0,male> thank you very much i have a few pictures and i'll talk a little bit about how i'm able to do what i do all these houses
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 32.24 41.60 <o,f0,male> are built from between seventy and eighty percent recycled material stuff that was headed to the mulcher the landfill the burn pile it was all just gone this is the first house i built
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 42.69 53.38 <o,f0,male> this double front door here with the three light transom that was headed to the landfill have a little turret there and then these buttons on the coribles here
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 54.37 62.65 <o,f0,male> right there those are hickory nuts and these buttons there those are chicken eggs of course first you have breakfast
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 62.99 69.88 <o,f0,male> and then you fill the shell full of bondo and paint it and nail it up and you have an architectural button in just a fraction of the time
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 71.38 78.29 <o,f0,male> then this is a look at the inside you can see the three light transom there with the eyebrow windows certainly an architectural antique
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 88.06 96.82 <o,f0,male> cool stove this is going up into the turret i got that staircase for dollar twenty including delivery to my lot
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 100.44 107.27 <o,f0,male> then looking up in the turret you see there are bulges and pokes and sags and so forth well if that ruins your life
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 107.60 108.99 <o,f0,male> well then you shouldn 't live there
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 111.58 112.31 <o,f0,male> this is
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 112.99 122.53 <o,f0,male> a laundry shoot and this right here is a shoe last and those are those cast iron things you see at antique shops so i had one of those so i made some low tech gadgetry there
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 122.70 133.24 <o,f0,male> where you just stomp on the shoe last and then the door flies open you throw your laundry down and then if you're smart enough it goes on a basket on top of the washer if not if goes into the
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 136.14 143.45 <o,f0,male> a bathtub i made made out of scrap two by four here started with a rim there and then glued and nailed it up into a
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 157.71 158.49 <o,f0,female> then this
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 160.15 166.13 <o,f0,male> faucet here is piece of osage organge it looks a little phallic but after all it's a
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 170.23 181.84 <o,f0,male> is a house based on a budweiser can it doesn't look like a can of beer but the design take offs are absolutely unmistakable the barely hops design worked up into the eaves then the dentil work comes directly off the can 's red white blue and silver
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 182.48 190.76 <o,f0,male> then these coribles going down underneath the eaves are that little design that comes off the can i just put a can on a copier and kept enlarging it until i got the size i want
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 192.46 202.79 <o,f0,male> on the can it says this is the famous budweiser beer we know of no other beer blah blah blah so we changed that and put this is the famous budweiser house we don't know of any other house and so forth and so on
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 203.30 212.67 <o,f0,male> is a deadbolt it 'd a fence from a nineteen thirties shaper which is a very angry woodworking machine and they gave me the fence but they didn't give me the shaper so we made a deadbolt out of
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 220.65 227.90 <o,f0,male> the shower is intended to simulate a glass of beer we've got bubbles going up there then suds at the top with lumpy tiles where do you get lumpy tiles
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 228.15 235.98 <o,f0,male> well of course you don 't but i get a lot of toilets and so you just dispatch a toilet with a hammer and then you have lumpy tiles and then
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 236.73 238.96 <o,f0,male> the faucet there is a beer tap
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 242.07 253.01 <o,f0,male> then this panel of glass is the same panel of glass that occurs in every middle class front door in america we're getting tired of it it's kind of cliched now so if you put it in the front door
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 254.15 264.55 <o,f0,male> design fails so don't put it in the front door put it somewhere else it's a pretty panel of glass but then if you put it in the front door people say oh you're trying to be like those guys and you didn't make it so don't put it there
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 266.65 277.09 <o,f0,male> then another bathroom upstairs this light up here is the same light that occurs in every middle class foyer in america don't put it in the foyer put it in the shower or
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 278.17 282.85 <o,f0,male> but not in the foyer then somebody gave me a bidet so
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 286.76 295.05 <o,f0,male> this little house here those branches there are made out of bois d 'ark or osage orange and these pictures will keep scrolling as i talk a little bit
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 295.49 303.81 <o,f0,male> in order to do what i do you have to understand what causes waste in the building industry our housing has become a commodity
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 304.48 312.20 <o,f0,male> and i'll talk a little bit about that but the first cause of waste is probably even buried in our dna human beings have a need for maintaining consistency for the
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 315.14 326.23 <o,f0,male> what it means is for every perception we have it needs to tally with the one like it before or we don't have continuity and we become a little bit disoriented so i can show you an object you've never seen before
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 327.29 336.88 <o,f0,male> that's a cellphone but you've never this one before what you're doing is sizing up the pattern of structural features here and then you go through your
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 338.68 344.32 <o,f0,male> that's a cellphone if i took a bit out of it you'd go wait a second
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 345.98 349.96 <o,f0,male> not a cellphone that's one of those new chocolate cellphones
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 351.99 354.89 <o,f0,male> have to start a new category right between cellphones and
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 371.57 384.58 <o,f0,male> never mind that it doesn't affect our lives at all it only rattles that expected pattern and unity of structural features however if we took a small hammer and we added cracks to all the other windows
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 386.83 394.27 <o,f0,male> then we have a pattern because gestalt psychology emphasizes recognition of pattern over parts that comprise a pattern we'll go ooh that's
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 396.50 400.99 <o,f0,male> that serves me every day repetition creates pattern if i have a hundred of these a hundred of those
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 401.20 409.63 <o,f0,male> it doesn't make any difference what these and those are if i can repeat anything i have the possibility of a pattern from hickory nuts and chicken eggs shards of glass branches
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 421.08 433.19 <o,f0,male> he said that cultures tend to swing between one of two perspectives on the one hand we have an apollonian perspective which is very crisp and premeditated and intellectualized and perfect
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 446.20 452.50 <o,f0,male> or hangs a picture is they'll get out a transit and a laser level and a micrometer
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 453.08 462.79 <o,f0,male> okay honey a thousandth of an inch to the left that's where we want the picture right perfect predicated on plum level square and centered the dionysian personality takes the picture and
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 471.64 482.55 <o,f0,male> feature blemish i feature organic process dead center john dewey apollonian mindset creates mountains of waste if something isn't perfect
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 482.95 491.54 <o,f0,male> if it does line up with that premeditated model dumpster oops scratch dumpster oops this oops that landfill landfill landfill the third thing
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 492.18 498.73 <o,f0,male> is arguably the industrial revolution started in the renaissance with the rise of humanism then got a little jump start
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 509.37 519.12 <o,f0,male> that we up to that point had to do my hand so now we have standardized materials well trees don't grow two inches by four inches eight ten and twelve feet tall
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 520.48 532.44 <o,f0,male> we create mountains of waste and they're doing a pretty good job there in the forest working all the byproduct of their industry with osb and particle board and so forth and so on but it does no good
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 532.88 539.93 <o,f0,male> to be responsible at the point of harvest in the forest if consumers are wasting the harvest at the point of consumption and that's what's
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 552.04 559.95 <o,f0,male> well i feature all those warped things because repetition creates pattern and it's from a dionysian perspective the fourth thing
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 560.96 568.60 <o,f0,male> labor is disproportionately more expensive than materials well that's just a myth and here 's a story jim tulles one of the guys i trained
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 569.58 577.08 <o,f0,male> it's time now i got a job for you as a foreman on a framing crew it's time for you to go dan i just don't think i'm ready jim now it's time
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 578.83 585.73 <o,f0,male> so we hired on and he was out there with his tape measure going through the trash heap looking for header material which is the board that goes over
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 600.64 612.42 <o,f0,male> he said you know if you were paying me dollar three hundred an hour i can see how you might say that but right now i'm saving you five dollars a minute do the math
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 639.82 647.83 <o,f0,male> and we force environmental resources to accommodate that so all have in our head the perfect house the american dream which is a house the
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 657.90 668.81 <o,f0,male> it's a chattel mortgage just like furniture just like a car you write the check and instantly it depreciates thirty percent after a year you can't get insurance on everything you have in it only on seventy percent
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 669.34 678.47 <o,f0,male> wired with fourteen gauge wire typically nothing wrong with that unless you ask it to do what twelve gauge wire 's supposed to do and that's what happens it out gasses formaldehyde so much
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 679.21 686.12 <o,f0,male> that there is a federal law in place to warn new mobile home buyers of the formaldehyde atmosphere danger
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 686.60 693.78 <o,f0,male> are we just being numbingly stupid the walls are this thick the whole thing has the structural value of corn
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 695.65 701.54 <o,f0,male> so i thought palm harbor village was over there no no we had a wind last night it's gone now
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 705.01 709.16 <o,f0,male> then when they degrade what do you do with them now all that
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 710.04 717.47 <o,f0,male> that apollonian platonic model is what the building industry is predicated on and there are a number of things that exacerbate that
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 718.17 726.44 <o,f0,male> one is that all the professionals all the tradesmen vendors inspectors engineers architects all think like this
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 726.91 736.01 <o,f0,male> and then it works its way back to the consumer who demands the same model it's a self fulfilling prophesy we can't get out of it then here come the marketeers and the advertisers
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 739.33 742.38 <o,f0,female> we buy stuff we didn't know we needed all we
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 742.51 747.63 <o,f0,male> to do is look at what one company did with carbonated prune juice how disgusting
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 749.80 752.17 <o,f0,male> but you know what they did they hooked a metaphor into it
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 764.07 774.89 <o,f0,male> my oh my that makes it worse and we get sucked into that faster than anything then a man named jean paul sartre wrote a book titled being and nothingness it's a pretty quick read you can snap through it
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 777.24 780.30 <o,f0,male> maybe two years if you read eight hours a day
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 781.05 790.20 <o,f0,male> there he talked about the divided self he said human beings act differently when they know they're alone than when they know somebody else is around so if i'm eating spaghetti and i know i'm alone
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 790.53 800.92 <o,f0,male> i can eat like backhoe i can wipe my mouth on my sleeve napkin on the table chew with my mouth open make little noises scratch wherever i want
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 802.70 804.36 <o,f0,male> but as soon as you walk in i go
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 808.06 818.24 <o,f0,male> bites chew with my mouth closed no scratching now what i'm doing is fulfilling your expectations of how i should live my life
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 819.24 827.72 <o,f0,male> i feel that expectation and so i accommodate it and i'm living my life according to what you expect me to do that happens in the building industry as well
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 828.04 839.06 <o,f0,male> that's why all of our subdivisions look the same sometimes we even have these formalized cultural expectations i'll bet all your shoes match sure enough we all buy into that
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 841.55 849.45 <o,f0,male> gated communities we have a formalized expectation with a home owners association sometimes those guys are nazis my
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 851.45 851.65 <o,f0,male> that
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 852.97 861.96 <o,f0,male> continues this model the last thing is gregariousness human beings are a social species we like to hand together in groups
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 874.07 880.80 <o,f0,male> and so you see this in junior high a lot those kids they'll work all summer long kill themselves
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 881.15 891.63 <o,f0,male> so that they can afford one pair of designer jeans so along about september they can stride in and go i 'm important today see
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 904.58 913.61 <o,f0,male> and so that happens in the building industry as well we have confused maslow 's hierarchy of needs just a little bit
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 913.97 919.27 <o,f0,male> on the bottom tier we have basic needs shelter clothing food water
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 941.55 952.38 <o,f0,male> housing has become a commodity and it takes a little bit of nerve to dive into those primal terrifying parts of ourselves
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 952.96 965.18 <o,f0,male> and make our own decisions and not make our housing a commodity but make it something that bubbles up from seminal sources that takes a little bit of nerve and darn it once in a while you fail
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 966.71 967.15 <o,f0,male> but
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 967.34 972.53 <o,f0,male> that's okay if failure destroys you then you can't do this i fail
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 972.76 976.79 <o,f0,male> all the time everyday and i've had some whopping failures i
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 978.03 990.47 <o,f0,male> big public humiliating embarrassing failures everybody points and laughs and they say he tried it a fifth time and it still didn't work what a moron early on contractors come by and say dan you're a cute little bunny but
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 995.40 996.45 <o,f0,male> and your instinct is
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 1001.05 1008.22 <o,f0,male> but you don't say that because they're the guys you're targeting and so what we've done
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 1008.71 1017.79 <o,f0,male> and this isn't just in housing it's in clothing and food and our transportation needs our energy we sprawl just a little bit and
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 1018.34 1028.25 <o,f0,male> when i get a little bit of press i hear from people all over the world and we may have invented excess but the problem of waste is
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 1032.47 1040.54 <o,f0,male> we're in trouble and i don't wear ammo belts crisscrossing my chest and a red bandana but we're clearly in trouble
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 1041.14 1048.24 <o,f0,male> and what we need to do is reconnect with those really primal parts of ourselves
DanPhillips_2010X 1 DanPhillips_2010X 1060.26 1067.45 <o,f0,male> what we need to do is reconnect with who we really are and that's thrilling indeed thank you very much
