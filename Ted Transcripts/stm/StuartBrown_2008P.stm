StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 17.87 19.53 <o,f0,male> go a flyby of play
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 20.40 30.01 <o,f0,male> it's got to be serious if the new york times puts a cover story of their february seventeenth sunday magazine about play
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 30.49 38.13 <o,f0,male> at the bottom of this it says it 's deeper than gender seriously but dangerously fun
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 39.33 42.95 <o,f0,male> a sandbox for new ideas about evolution
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 43.65 47.97 <o,f0,male> not bad except if you look at that cover what's missing
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 48.71 49.93 <o,f0,male> you see any adults
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 51.58 54.12 <o,f0,male> well lets go back to the fifteenth century
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 55.57 57.36 <o,f0,male> this is a courtyard in europe
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 57.98 62.03 <o,f0,male> and a mixture of one hundred and twenty four different kinds of play
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 62.23 66.68 <o,f0,male> all ages solo play body play
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 67.71 76.49 <o,f0,male> games taunting and there it is and i think this is a typical picture of what it was like in a courtyard then
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 77.26 79.86 <o,f0,male> i think we may have lost something in our culture
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 81.21 83.02 <o,f0,male> so i'm gonna take you through
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 110.40 117.21 <o,f0,male> and from out of stage left comes this wild male polar bear with a predatory gaze
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 117.60 126.23 <o,f0,male> of you who 've been to africa or had a junkyard dog come after you there is a fixed kind of predatory gaze that you know you're in trouble
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 127.10 131.73 <o,f0,male> but on the other side of that predatory gaze is a female husky
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 132.39 139.59 <o,f0,male> in a play bow wagging her tale and something very unusual happens that fixed behavior
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 139.93 149.50 <o,f0,male> which is rigged and stereotyped and ends up with a meal changes and this polar bear stands over the husky
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 150.37 154.05 <o,f0,male> no claws extended no fangs taking a look
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 162.46 169.56 <o,f0,male> this is in nature it overrides a carnivorous nature and what otherwise would have been a short fight to the death
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 170.45 176.07 <o,f0,male> if you'll begin to look closely at the husky that's bearing her throat to the polar bear
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 176.46 179.38 <o,f0,male> and look a little more closely they're in an altered
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 179.76 182.41 <o,f0,male> state they're in a state of play
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 183.21 184.82 <o,f0,male> and it's that state
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 186.41 187.69 <o,f0,male> that allows these
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 188.04 195.57 <o,f0,male> two creatures to explore the possible they are beginning to do something that neither would have done without the play signals
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 197.40 204.68 <o,f0,male> and it is a marvelous example of how a differential in power can be overridden
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 205.10 211.49 <o,f0,male> by a process of nature that's within all of us now how did i get involved in this john mentioned that i've done some
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 211.75 215.75 <o,f0,male> with murderers and i have the texas tower murderer opened my eyes
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 216.04 221.00 <o,f0,male> in retrospect when we studied his tragic mass murder
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 221.50 229.82 <o,f0,male> to the importance of play in that this individual by deep study was found to have severe play deprivation charles whitman was his name
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 230.51 240.82 <o,f0,male> and our committee which consisted of a lot of hard scientists did feel at the end of that study that the absence of play and a progressive suppression of developmentally normal play
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 241.29 254.31 <o,f0,male> led him to be more vulnerable to the tragedy that he perpetrated and that finding has stood the test of time unfortunately even into more recent times at virginia tech
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 255.13 260.72 <o,f0,male> and other studies of populations at risk sensitized me to the importance of play
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 261.58 272.10 <o,f0,male> but i didn't really understand what it was and it was many years in taking play histories of individuals before i really began to recognize that
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 272.74 278.49 <o,f0,male> i didn't really have a full understanding of it and i don't think any of us has a full understanding of it by any means but
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 279.08 289.65 <o,f0,male> there are ways of looking at it that i think can give you give us all a taxonomy a way of thinking about it and this image is for humans the beginning point of play
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 290.30 296.68 <o,f0,male> when that mother and infant lock eyes and the infant 's old enough to have a social smile what happens
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 309.36 311.32 <o,f0,male> brain of each of them
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 311.87 322.28 <o,f0,male> becomes attuned so that the joyful emergence of this earliest of play scenes and the physiology of that is something we're beginning to get a handle on
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 323.17 329.43 <o,f0,male> and i'd like you to think that every bit of more complex play builds on this base
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 329.74 337.54 <o,f0,male> for us humans and so now i'm going to take you through sort of a way of looking at play but it's never just
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 338.49 342.02 <o,f0,male> one thing we're going to look at body play
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 342.70 348.77 <o,f0,male> which is a spontaneous desire to get ourselves out of gravity this is a
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 349.67 358.50 <o,f0,male> if you're having a bad day try this jump up and down wiggle around you're going to feel better and you may feel like this character who is also just
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 359.23 373.38 <o,f0,male> for its own sake it doesn't have a particular purpose and that's what's great about play if its purpose is more important than the act of doing it it's probably not play and there's a whole other type of play which is object play
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 379.08 387.90 <o,f0,male> and they don't throw it at each other but this is a fundamental part of being playful the human hand in manipulation of objects
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 388.52 396.67 <o,f0,male> is the hand in search of a brain the brain is in search of a hand and play is the medium by which those two are linked in the best way
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 399.84 405.26 <o,f0,male> we heard this morning jpl is an incredible place they have located two consultants
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 422.32 430.96 <o,f0,male> tried to figure out why and he came to the conclusion quite on his own that the students who could no longer solve problems such as fixing cars hadn't worked with their hands
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 439.91 450.55 <o,f0,male> before they will hire a research and development problem solver even if they're summa cum laude from harvard or cal tech if they haven't fixed cars haven't done stuff with their hands early in life
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 451.08 458.76 <o,f0,male> with their hands they can't problem solve as well so play is practical and it's very important now one of the things about play
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 464.11 472.12 <o,f0,male> has to be safe exploration this happens to be ok he 's an anatomically interested little boy and that's his mom other situations wouldn't be quite so
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 472.48 482.35 <o,f0,male> good but curiosity exploration are part of the play scene if you want to belong you need social play and social play is part of what we're about here today
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 482.90 490.98 <o,f0,male> and is a byproduct of the play scene rough and tumble play these lionesses seen from a distance looked like they were fighting
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 498.54 505.92 <o,f0,male> open mouth with no fangs balletic movements curvilinear movements all specific to play and rough and tumble play
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 506.48 514.77 <o,f0,male> a great learning medium for all of us preschool kids for example should be allowed to dive hit whistle scream be chaotic
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 515.03 526.38 <o,f0,male> and develop through that a lot of emotional regulation and a lot of the other social byproducts cognitive emotional and physical that come as a part of rough and tumble play
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 534.12 547.16 <o,f0,male> rare where the red sox won the world series but take a look at the face and the body language of everybody in this fuzzy picture and you can get a sense that they're all at play imaginative play
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 561.69 566.71 <o,f0,male> really important part of being a player is imaginative solo play
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 567.52 580.74 <o,f0,male> and i love this one because it's also what we're about we all have an internal narrative that's our own inner story the unit of intelligibility of most of our brains is the story
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 581.26 583.26 <o,f0,male> i'm telling you a story today about play
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 583.84 591.84 <o,f0,male> well this bushman i think is talking about the fish that got away that was that long but it's a fundamental part of the play scene
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 592.30 594.54 <o,f0,male> so what does play do for the brain
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 595.60 597.29 <o,f0,male> well a lot
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 598.09 600.19 <o,f0,male> we don't know a whole lot about what it
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 600.46 605.89 <o,f0,male> does for the human brain because funding has not been exactly
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 606.84 614.38 <o,f0,male> heavy for research on play i walked into the carnegie asking for a grant they'd given me a large grant when i was an academician
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 614.83 625.35 <o,f0,male> for the study of felony drunken drivers and i thought i had a pretty good track record and by the time i had spent half an hour talking about play it was obvious that they were not
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 634.57 641.83 <o,f0,male> is some good science nothing lights up the brain like play three dimensional play fires up the cerebellum
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 642.68 649.09 <o,f0,male> a lot of impulses into the frontal lobe the executive portion helps contextual memory be developed
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 649.67 657.59 <o,f0,male> and and and and so it's for me its been an extremely nourishing scholarly adventure
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 657.81 667.96 <o,f0,male> to look at the neuroscience that's associated with play and to bring together people who in their individual disciplines hadn't really thought of it that way and that's part of what the national
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 676.29 683.77 <o,f0,male> i'm sorry i don't have a playful looking subject but it allows mobility which has limited the actual study of play
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 684.22 697.79 <o,f0,male> and we've got a mother infant play scenario that we're hoping to complete underway at the moment the reason i put this here is also to queue up my thoughts about objectifying what play does
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 706.62 709.99 <o,f0,male> to play at a certain period of their juvenile years
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 710.63 718.05 <o,f0,male> and you suppress play they squeak they wrestle they pin each other that's part of their play if you stop that behavior
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 718.68 725.79 <o,f0,male> on one group that you're experimenting with and you allow it in another group that you're experimenting with and then you present those rats
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 726.32 728.98 <o,f0,male> with a cat odor saturated collar
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 729.66 731.32 <o,f0,male> they're hardwired to flee and
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 737.68 739.03 <o,f0,male> they both hide out
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 740.23 742.27 <o,f0,male> the non players never come out
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 743.05 745.15 <o,f0,male> they die the players
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 746.19 751.32 <o,f0,male> slowly explore the environment and begin again to test things out
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 752.06 759.76 <o,f0,male> that says to me at least in rats and i think they have the same neurotransmitters that we do and a similar cortical architecture that
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 760.21 767.13 <o,f0,male> play may be pretty important for our survival and and and there are a lot more animal studies that i could talk about now
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 768.20 768.82 <o,f0,female> this is a
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 783.80 791.46 <o,f0,male> in domestic animals and others when they're play deprived they and rats also they don't develop a brain that is normal
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 792.13 795.91 <o,f0,male> now the program says that the opposite of play is not work
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 799.60 802.64 <o,f0,male> and i think if you think about life without play
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 803.61 809.93 <o,f0,male> no humor no flirtation no movies no games no fantasy
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 810.91 812.99 <o,f0,male> and and and try and imagine
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 813.22 815.36 <o,f0,male> a culture or a life adult or otherwise
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 818.41 825.28 <o,f0,male> and the thing that's so unique about our species is that we're really designed to play through our whole lifetime
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 826.43 836.67 <o,f0,male> and we all have capacity to play signal nobody misses that dog i took a picture of on a carmel beach a couple of weeks ago what's going to follow from that behavior
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 837.31 848.02 <o,f0,male> is play and you can trust it the basis of human trust is established through play signals and we begin to lose those signals culturally and otherwise as
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 848.82 859.93 <o,f0,male> that's a shame i think we've got a lot of learning to do now jane goodall has here a play face along with one of her favorite chimps so part of the signaling system of play
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 860.44 870.17 <o,f0,male> has to do with vocal facial body gestural you know you can tell and i think when we're getting into collective play its really important for
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 870.43 878.92 <o,f0,male> groups to gain a sense of safety through their own sharing of play signals you may not know this word
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 880.53 891.37 <o,f0,male> it should be your biological first name and last name because neoteny means the retention of immature qualities into adulthood and we are by physical anthropologists
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 891.96 904.62 <o,f0,male> by many many studies the most neotenous the most youthful the most flexible the most plastic of all creatures and therefore the most playful and this gives us a leg up on adaptability
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 906.47 912.95 <o,f0,male> now there is a way of looking at play that i also want to emphasize here
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 913.47 926.85 <o,f0,male> which is the play history your own personal play history is unique and often is not something we think about particularly this is a book written by a consummate player by the name of kevin carroll
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 927.61 938.88 <o,f0,male> kevin carroll came from extremely deprived circumstances alcoholic mother absent father inner city philadelphia black had to take care of a younger brother
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 940.04 941.29 <o,f0,male> found that when he looked at a
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 941.72 945.06 <o,f0,male> out of a window into which he had been confined
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 945.58 948.66 <o,f0,male> he felt something different and so he followed up on
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 950.95 957.83 <o,f0,male> the transformation of his life from the deprivation and what one would expect potentially prison or death
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 958.76 966.16 <o,f0,male> become a linguist a trainer for the seventy six ers and now is a motivational speaker and he gives play as
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 969.17 977.02 <o,f0,male> force over his entire life now there's another play history that i think is a work in progress
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 979.32 982.90 <o,f0,male> those of you who remember al gore during the
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 983.92 990.33 <o,f0,male> first term and then during his successful but unelected run for the presidency
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 997.55 1009.59 <o,f0,male> and looking at his history which is common in the press it seems to me at least looking at it from a shrink 's point of view that a lot of his life was
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 1012.19 1013.83 <o,f0,male> summers were hard hard work
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 1014.34 1024.17 <o,f0,male> in the heat of tennessee summers he had the expectations of his senatorial father and washington d c and although
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 1031.82 1033.88 <o,f0,male> i think as he now is
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 1034.49 1044.82 <o,f0,male> by paying attention to what is his own passion and his own inner drive which i think has its basis in all of us in our play history
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 1063.06 1065.25 <o,f0,male> into how that connects with your life now
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 1065.81 1075.36 <o,f0,male> and you'll find you may change jobs which has happened to a number people when i've had them do this in order to be more empowered through their play
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 1075.81 1083.41 <o,f0,male> or you'll be able to enrich your life by prioritizing it and paying attention to it most of us work with groups and i
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 1083.52 1092.69 <o,f0,male> put this up because the d school the design school at stanford thanks to david kelley and a lot of others who have been visionary about its establishment
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 1122.30 1129.96 <o,f0,male> this is our maiden voyage in this we're about two and a half three months into it and it's really been fun there is our star
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 1147.49 1154.39 <o,f0,male> nobel prize stuart thompson in neuroscience so we've had brendan who 's from ideo and the rest of us sitting aside
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 1154.56 1160.92 <o,f0,male> and watching these students as they put play principles into practice in the classroom
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 1162.12 1165.29 <o,f0,male> and one of their projects was to
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 1167.21 1169.72 <o,f0,male> see what makes meetings boring
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 1169.91 1171.83 <o,f0,male> and to try and do something about it
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 1172.88 1179.61 <o,f0,male> so what will follow is a student made film about just that
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 1180.79 1193.25 <o,f0,female> flow is the mental state of apparition in which the person is fully immersed in what he or she is doing characterized by a feeling of energized focus full involvement and success in the process of the activity
StuartBrown_2008P 1 StuartBrown_2008P 1196.52 1203.18 <o,f0,female> an important key insight that we learned about meetings is that people pack them in one after another disruptive to
