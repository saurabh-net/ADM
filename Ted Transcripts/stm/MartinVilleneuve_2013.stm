MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 37.43 47.91 <o,f0,male> it 's shot on green screen yet this is the kind of movie that i wanted to make ever since i was a kid really back when i was reading some comic books and dreaming about what the future might be
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 48.19 52.88 <o,f0,male> when american producers see my film they think that i had
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 56.25 66.49 <o,f0,male> twenty three million but in fact i had ten percent of that budget i did mars et avril for only two point three million so you might wonder what 's the deal here how did i do this
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 77.16 80.76 <o,f0,male> the second aspect is love i got
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 101.01 111.69 <o,f0,male> in my early twenty s i did some graphic novels but they weren 't your usual graphic novels they were books telling a science fiction story through images and text
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 111.69 125.78 <o,f0,male> and most of the actors who are now starring in the movie adaptation they were already involved in these books portraying characters into a sort of experimental theatrical simplistic way
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 126.15 143.16 <o,f0,male> and one of these actors is the great stage director and actor robert lepage and i just love this guy i 've been in love with this guy since i was a kid his career i admire a lot and i wanted this guy to be involved in my crazy project and he was
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 143.16 148.78 <o,f0,male> kind enough to lend his image to the character of eugene spaak who is a
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 172.33 176.11 <o,f0,male> and to write direct and produce the film myself
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 176.11 183.15 <o,f0,male> and robert is actually the very first example of how constraints can boost creativity
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 183.15 197.82 <o,f0,male> because this guy is the busiest man on the planet i mean his agenda is booked until two thousand and forty two and he 's really hard to get and i wanted him to be in the movie to reprise his role in the movie
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 198.26 214.18 <o,f0,male> but the thing is had i waited for him until two thousand and forty two my film wouldn 't be a futuristic film anymore so i just couldn 't do that right but that 's kind of a big problem how do you get somebody who is too busy to star in a movie
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 214.18 223.03 <o,f0,male> well i said as a joke in a production meeting and this is a true story by the way i said why don 't we turn this guy into a hologram
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 223.03 238.08 <o,f0,male> because you know he is everywhere and nowhere on the planet at the same time and he 's an illuminated being in my mind and he 's in between reality and virtual reality so it would make perfect sense to turn this guy into a hologram
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 238.08 245.12 <o,f0,male> everybody around the table laughed but the joke was kind of a good solution so that 's what we ended up doing
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 245.24 262.72 <o,f0,male> here 's how we did it we shot robert with six cameras he was dressed in green and he was like in a green aquarium each camera was covering sixty degrees of his head so that in post production we could use pretty much any angle we needed and we shot only his head
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 262.72 267.99 <o,f0,male> six months later there was a guy on set a mime portraying the body the
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 267.99 270.29 <o,f0,male> vehicle for the head
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 270.29 272.96 <o,f0,male> and he was wearing a green hood
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 273.07 282.58 <o,f0,male> so that we could erase the green hood in postproduction and replace it with robert lepage 's head so he became like a renaissance man and here 's what it looks like in the movie
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 356.03 358.22 <o,f0,male> and they carry a nice story with them
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 358.68 360.43 <o,f0,male> actually i knew
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 364.96 377.29 <o,f0,male> but my problem was i didn 't have the money to pay for them i couldn 't afford them so that 's kind of a big problem too how do you get something that you can 't afford
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 377.59 386.89 <o,f0,male> and you know i woke up one morning with a pretty good idea i said what if i have somebody else pay for them
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 397.91 401.15 <o,f0,male> and i thought of cirque du soleil in montreal because
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 401.36 416.56 <o,f0,male> who better to understand the kind of crazy poetry that i wanted to put on screen so i found my way to guy laliberte cirque du soleil 's ceo and i presented my crazy idea to him with sketches like this and visual references and something
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 416.72 426.29 <o,f0,male> pretty amazing happened guy was interested by this idea not because i was asking for his money but because i came to him with a good idea
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 440.49 457.66 <o,f0,male> and the artist dominique engel brilliant guy he was happy too because he had a dream project to work on for a year and obviously i was happy because i got the instruments in my film for free which was kind of what i tried to do
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 457.66 460.49 <o,f0,male> so here they are and
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 460.56 465.83 <o,f0,male> my last example of how constraints can boost creativity comes from
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 466.5 485 <o,f0,male> the green because this is a weird color a crazy color and you need to replace the green screens eventually and you must figure that out sooner rather than later and i had again pretty much ideas in my mind as to what the world would be but
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 495.2 510.69 <o,f0,male> and this guy is another guy i admire a lot and i wanted him to be involved in the movie as a production designer but people told me you know martin it 's impossible the guy is too busy and he will say no well i said you know what instead of
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 510.7 528.45 <o,f0,male> mimicking his style i might as well call the real guy and ask him and i sent him my books and he answered that he was interested in working on the film with me because he could be a big fish in a small aquarium in other words there was space for him to dream with me
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 528.45 534.6 <o,f0,male> so here i was with one of my childhood heroes drawing every single frame that 's in the film
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 534.82 537.73 <o,f0,male> to turn that into montreal in the future
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 537.87 548.22 <o,f0,male> and it was an amazing collaboration to work with this great artist whom i admire but then you know eventually you have to turn all these drawings into reality
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 548.22 563.16 <o,f0,male> so again my solution was to aim for the best possible artist that i could think of and there 's this guy in montreal another quebecois called carlos monzon and he 's a very good vfx artist this guy had been
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 576.07 585.6 <o,f0,male> instead of working on the next spielberg movie he accepted to work on mine why because i offered him a space to dream so if you don 't have
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 604.36 609.95 <o,f0,male> sixty artists to work full time for six months to do this crazy film
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 609.95 625.97 <o,f0,male> so i want to tell you that if you have some crazy ideas in your mind and that people tell you that it 's impossible to make well that 's an even better reason to want to do it because people have a tendency to see the problems rather than the final result
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 640.9 643.8 <o,f0,male> who knows you might even end up going
