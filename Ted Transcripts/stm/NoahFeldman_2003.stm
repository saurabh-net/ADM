NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 15.89 26.43 <o,f0,female> argue to you that in fact politics and religion which are the two primary factors not the sole but overwhelmingly the primary factors which are driving towards
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 26.59 39.08 <o,f0,female> a war which looks extremely likely bordering on the inevitable at this point whether one is in favor of that or not that politics and religion are in fact themselves better conceptualized as kinds of technology
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 39.47 48.50 <o,f0,female> and subject to kinds of questions that we regularly consider in the space of conceptual design here 's what i mean
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 61.83 73.27 <o,f0,female> you can deploy power in a wide range of ways the famous ones despotism is a good one anarchy is a way to not deploy the power in any organized way to do it in a radically diffused fashion and democracy is a set of technologies
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 73.69 82.10 <o,f0,female> which have the effect of in principle diffusing the power source to a large number of people and then re concentrating it in a smaller group of people who govern
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 82.56 89.22 <o,f0,female> and who themselves are in principle authorized to govern by virtue of what the broader public has done
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 104.93 114.90 <o,f0,female> i would put it in the following equation no nine eleven no war at the beginning of the bush administration when president bush now president bush was running for president
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 115.32 124.76 <o,f0,female> he made it very clear that he was not interested in intervening broadly in the world in fact the trend was for disengagement with the rest of the world that's why we heard about the backing away from the kyoto protocol for example
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 125.31 135.43 <o,f0,female> after nine eleven the tables were turned and the president decided with his advisors to undertake some kind of an active intervention in the world around us
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 135.97 144.09 <o,f0,female> that began with afghanistan and when afghanistan went extremely smoothly and quickly a decision was made through the technology of democracy
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 144.76 155.83 <o,f0,female> again notice not a perfect technology but through the technology of democracy that this administration was going to push in the direction of another war this time a war in iraq now
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 156.49 169.44 <o,f0,female> the reason i begin by saying no nine eleven no war is that we have to acknowledge that islam as interpreted by a very very small extremely radical group of people
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 170.29 177.51 <o,f0,female> was a precipitating cause of the nine eleven attacks the precipitating cause of the nine eleven attacks and as a consequence at one
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 177.84 185.28 <o,f0,female> degree of remove the precipitating cause of the coming war that we're about to be engaged in and i would add that bin laden and his followers
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 185.46 193.90 <o,f0,female> are consciously devoted to the goal of creating a conflict between democracy or at least capitalist democracy on the one hand and
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 194.49 199.51 <o,f0,female> the world of islam as they see and define it now how is islam a technology in this
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 200.76 210.75 <o,f0,female> well it's a technology for first salvation in its most basic sense it's meant to be a mechanism for construing the universe in a way that will bring about the salvation of the individual believer
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 223.55 237.13 <o,f0,female> within the sphere of people who have that view and it's a large number of people in the muslim world who disagree with bin laden in his application but agree that islam is the answer islam represents a way of engaging the world through which one can achieve certain desirable goals
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 237.71 248.26 <o,f0,female> and the goals from the perspective of muslims are in principle peace justice and equality but on terms that correspond to traditional muslim teachings
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 249.10 262.64 <o,f0,female> now i don't want to leave a misimpression by identifying either of these propositions rather either of these phenomena democracy or islam as technologies i don't want to suggest that they're a single thing that you can point to and i think a good way to prove this
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 263.08 273.30 <o,f0,female> is simply to demonstrate to you what my thought process was when deciding what to put on the wall behind me when i spoke and i ran immediately into a conceptual problem you can't show a picture of democracy
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 299.71 307.75 <o,f0,female> it follows from that that all of the people in the world who say that they are muslims can in principle subscribe to a wide range of different interpretations
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 307.89 313.97 <o,f0,female> of what islam really is and the same is true of democracy in other words unlike
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 315.10 326.05 <o,f0,female> the word hope which one could look up in a dictionary and derive origins for and perhaps reach some kind of a consensual use analysis these are essentially contested concepts they're ideas
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 333.20 343.11 <o,f0,female> it's very very difficult for anyone to say i have the right version of islam you know post nine eleven we were treated to the amazing phenomenon of george w bush saying islam means peace
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 343.61 350.37 <o,f0,female> well so says george w bush other people would say it means something else some people would say that islam means submission
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 350.64 358.74 <o,f0,female> other people would say it means an acknowledgement or recognition of god 's sovereignty there are a wide range of different things that islam can mean and ostensibly the same is true of democracy
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 365.45 374.04 <o,f0,female> free speech free press equality of citizens these are contested points and it's impossible to answer them by saying ah ha i looked in the right place and i found out what these concepts mean
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 375.76 383.14 <o,f0,female> now if islam and democracy are at present in a moment of great confrontation what does that mean
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 383.91 392.10 <o,f0,female> well you could fit it into a range of different interpretative frameworks you could begin with the one that we began with a couple of days ago which was fear
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 393.30 402.63 <o,f0,female> fear is not an implausible reaction with a war just around the corner and with a very very high likelihood that many many people are going to die as a consequence of this confrontation
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 403.11 415.77 <o,f0,female> a confrontation which many many people in the muslim world do not want many many people in the american democracy do not want many people elsewhere in the world do not want but which nonetheless is favored by a large enough number of people at least in the relevant
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 435.20 446.05 <o,f0,female> that islam and democracy are technologies and by virtue of being technologies they're manipulable and they're manipulable in ways that can produce some extremely positive outcomes what do i have in mind
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 446.82 455.08 <o,f0,female> well all over the muslim world there are people who take islam deeply seriously people who care about islam for whom it's a source either of faith
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 455.27 465.08 <o,f0,female> or of civilization or of deep values or just a source of powerful personal identity who think and are saying loudly that islam and democracy are in fact not in conflict
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 465.61 477.65 <o,f0,female> but are in fact deeply compatible and these muslims and it's the vast majority of muslims disagree profoundly with bin laden 's approach profoundly and they furthermore think
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 487.67 497.99 <o,f0,female> one can see that they're saying that their concern in their own countries is primarily free up themselves to have choice in the spheres of personal life
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 498.35 506.39 <o,f0,female> in the sphere of economics in the sphere of politics and yes in the sphere of religion which is itself closely regulated in most of the muslim world
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 506.95 520.52 <o,f0,female> and many of these muslims further say that their disagreement with the united states is that it in the past and still in the present has sided with autocratic rulers in the muslim world in order to
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 529.89 538.19 <o,f0,female> it may be that there was a great war to be fought between west and east and it was necessary on the axis of democracy against communism and it was necessary
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 538.34 545.01 <o,f0,female> in some way for these to contradict each other and as a consequence you have to make friends wherever you can get them but now that the cold war is over
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 567.99 580.98 <o,f0,female> who are promoting their own religious values who are elected by their own people because they were perceived as honest and sincere because of their religious values but who do not think that islam and a democratic system of governance are fundamentally incompatible
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 581.37 594.48 <o,f0,female> now you may say but surely what we've seen on television about saudi islam convinces us that it can't possibly be compatible with what we consider the core of democracy namely free political choice basic liberty and basic equality
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 595.06 607.49 <o,f0,female> but i'm here to tell you that technologies are more malleable than that i'm here to tell you that many many muslims believe the vast majority in fact in fact i think i would go so far as to say that many muslims in saudi arabia believe
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 608.08 618.69 <o,f0,female> the core values of islam namely acknowledgement of god 's sovereignty and basic human equality before god are themselves compatible with liberty equality and free political choice
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 631.83 641.53 <o,f0,female> so for example a group of young activists in egypt try to form a party known as the center party which advocated the compatibility of islam and democracy they weren't even allowed to form a party
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 654.82 662.26 <o,f0,female> people who present themselves to the electorate as islamic democrats were far and away the most successful vote getters every place they were allowed to run freely
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 674.41 682.77 <o,f0,female> now what i want to suggest to you is that the reason for hope in this case is that we are on the edge of a real transformation in the muslim world
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 693.14 703.92 <o,f0,female> believe through the malleability of the technology of democracy and the malleability and synthetic capability of the technology of islam that these two ideas can work together
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 721.58 734.57 <o,f0,female> it will also not look exactly the way either the people in this room or muslims out in the rest of the world i don't mean to imply there aren't muslims here there probably are conceptualize islam it will be transformative of islam as well
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 735.74 743.75 <o,f0,female> as a result of this convergence this synthetic attempt to make sense of these two ideas together there's a real possibility
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 744.02 753.40 <o,f0,female> that instead of a clash of islamic civilization if there is such a thing and democratic civilization if there is such a thing will in fact have close compatibility
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 753.97 764.58 <o,f0,female> now i began with the war because it's the elephant in the room and you can't pretend that there isn't about to be a war if you're talking about these issues the war has tremendous risks for the model that i'm describing
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 764.90 773.88 <o,f0,female> because it's very possible that as a consequence of a war many muslims will conclude that the united states is not the kind of place that they want to emulate with respect to it's forms of political
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 775.34 783.33 <o,f0,female> on the other hand there's a further possibility that many americans swept up in the fever of a war will say and feel and think
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 783.80 793.53 <o,f0,female> that islam is the enemy somehow that islam ought to be construed as the enemy and even though for political tactical reasons the president has been very very good about saying that islam is not the enemy
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 813.59 821.61 <o,f0,female> are also not to be underestimated even by and i would say especially by people who are deeply skeptical about whether we should go to war in the first place
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 822.23 834.27 <o,f0,female> those who oppose the war ought to realize that if a war happens it cannot be the right strategy either pragmatically or spiritually or morally to say after the war
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 834.92 844.94 <o,f0,female> well let 's let it all run itself out and play out however it wants to play out because we opposed the war in the first place that's not the way human circumstances operate you face the circumstances you have in front of you and you go forward
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 845.34 859.22 <o,f0,female> well what i'm here to say then is for people who are skeptical about the war it's especially important to recognize that in the aftermath of the war there is a possibility for the government of the united states and the muslim peoples with whom it interacts
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 859.57 868.25 <o,f0,female> to create real forms of government that are truly democratic and also truly islamic and it is crucial it is crucial in a practical activist way
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 868.97 880.54 <o,f0,female> for people who care about these issues to make sure that within the technology of democracy in this system they exercise their preferences their choices and their voices to encourage that outcome
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 881.01 890.35 <o,f0,female> that's a hopeful message but it's a message that's hopeful only if you understand it as incurring serious obligation for all of us and i think that we are capable of taking on that obligation
NoahFeldman_2003 1 NoahFeldman_2003 890.59 898.00 <o,f0,female> but only if we put what we can into it and if we do then i don't think that the hope will be unwarranted altogether thanks
