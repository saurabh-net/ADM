JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 47.81 55.55 <o,f0,male> design bad design there 's just no excuse for it it 's letting stuff happen without thinking about it every object
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 55.55 68.15 <o,f0,male> should be about something john it should imagine a user it should cast that user in a story starring the user and the object good design my dad said is about supplying
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 80.23 93.29 <o,f0,male> he designed chairs and desks and other office equipment for steelcase that was important i knew design was important in my house because for heaven 's sake it put food on our table right and design was in everything my dad did
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 93.57 96.32 <o,f0,male> he had a dixieland jazz band when we were growing up
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 96.71 111.32 <o,f0,male> and he would always cover louis armstrong tunes and i would ask him every once in a while dad do you want it to sound like the record we had lots of old jazz records lying around the house and he said no never john never the song is just a given that 's how you have to think about it you gotta make
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 111.32 117.49 <o,f0,male> your own you gotta design it show everyone what you intend is what he said
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 117.49 122.11 <o,f0,male> doing that acting by design is what we all should be doing
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 122.46 124.16 <o,f0,male> it 's where we all belong
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 159.34 162.4 <o,f0,male> that 's right i was in a poorly designed automobile
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 162.8 164.81 <o,f0,male> that hit a poorly designed
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 176.82 183.36 <o,f0,male> but ever since then the wheelchair has been a given in my life my life at the mercy of good design
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 188.17 190.64 <o,f0,male> a wheelchair is a very difficult object
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 191.04 204.96 <o,f0,male> it mostly projects tragedy and fear and misfortune and it projects that message that story so strongly that it almost blots out anything else i roll swiftly through an airport right and moms grab their
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 204.96 211.98 <o,f0,male> kids out of the way and say don 't stare the poor kid you know has this terrified look on his face god knows what they think and for
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 239.77 246.75 <o,f0,male> nothing whatsoever worked until a few years ago my six year old daughters were looking at this wheelchair catalog that i had
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 252.73 254.62 <o,f0,male> and i said oh girls
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 331.17 334.32 <o,f0,male> they 're not for safety
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 336.51 343 <o,f0,male> what 's the difference here the wheelchair with no lights and the wheelchair with lights the difference
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 348.94 353.81 <o,f0,male> i 'm no longer a victim i chose to change the situation i 'm the commander of the starship wheelchair with the phaser wheels in the front
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 371.26 373.75 <o,f0,male> it suggests that someone is driving
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 374.35 376.95 <o,f0,male> it 's reassuring people are drawn to it
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 377.27 385.49 <o,f0,male> someone making the experience their own covering the tragic tune with something different
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 385.52 388.53 <o,f0,male> something radically different
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 402.57 409.51 <o,f0,male> now if he intended to kill in olso norway last year dozens and dozens of young people
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 422.12 424.96 <o,f0,male> if he was motivated by some random
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 425.02 430.56 <o,f0,male> mental illness he 's in a completely different category we may put him away for life but
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 430.81 432.78 <o,f0,male> we watch him clinically
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 434.41 436.04 <o,f0,female> it 's a completely different domain
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 436.69 441.87 <o,f0,male> as an intentional murderer anders breivik is merely evil
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 442.16 448.74 <o,f0,male> but as a dysfunctional as a dysfunctional murderer psychotic he 's something much more complicated he 's the breath
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 448.74 450.97 <o,f0,male> of some primitive
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 451.23 453.48 <o,f0,male> ancient chaos
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 453.55 456.32 <o,f0,male> he 's the random state of nature we emerged from
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 457.3 470.29 <o,f0,male> he 's something very very different it 's as though intent is an essential component for humanity it 's what we 're supposed to do somehow we 're supposed to act with intent we 're supposed to do things by design
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 475.46 477.71 <o,f0,male> now here 's an example a little closer to home
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 477.87 480.04 <o,f0,male> my family is all about intent
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 480.28 490.08 <o,f0,male> you can probably tell there are two sets of twins the result of ivf technology in vitro fertilization technology due to some physical limitations i won 't go into
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 490.21 508.99 <o,f0,male> anyway in vitro technology ivf is about as intentional as agriculture let me tell you some of you may have the experience in fact the whole technology of sperm extraction for spinal cord injured males was invented by a veterinarian i met the dude he 's a great guy he carried this big
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 508.99 519 <o,f0,male> leather bag full of sperm probes for all of the animals that he 'd worked with all the different animals probes he designed
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 525.25 527.63 <o,f0,female> laughter
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 531.93 549.23 <o,f0,male> but anyway so when my wife and i decided to upgrade our early middle age we had four kids after all with a little different technology that i won 't explain in too much detail here my urologist assured me i had nothing whatsoever to worry about no need for birth control doc are you sure about that
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 549.23 551.39 <o,f0,male> john john
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 551.74 553.4 <o,f0,male> i looked at your chart
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 553.43 558.35 <o,f0,male> from your sperm tests we can confidently say that you 're basically a form
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 558.36 559.91 <o,f0,female> of birth control
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 568.94 588.07 <o,f0,male> yes and after a couple very liberating weekends my wife and i utilizing some cutting edge erectile technology that is certainly worthy of a tedtalk someday but i won 't get into it now we noticed some familiar if unexpected symptoms
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 588.39 591.31 <o,f0,male> i wasn 't exactly a form of birth control
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 592.23 598.98 <o,f0,male> look at that font there my wife was so pissed i mean did a designer come up with that no i don 't think a designer did come up with that
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 599.28 601.12 <o,f0,male> in fact maybe that 's the problem
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 601.25 607.81 <o,f0,male> and so little ajax was born he 's like our other children but the experience is completely different
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 608.07 611.14 <o,f0,male> it 's something like my accident
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 613.49 622.29 <o,f0,male> but we all had to change but not just react to the given we bend to this new experience with intent
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 626.4 628.23 <o,f0,male> facing the given with intent
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 628.46 636.52 <o,f0,male> doing things by design hey the name ajax you can 't get much more intentional than that right we 're really hoping he thanks us
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 640.78 644.7 <o,f0,male> but i never became a designer no no no no never attempted never even close
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 654.13 657.88 <o,f0,male> man i love that thing i could afford that
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 668.66 674.13 <o,f0,male> but there were some lessons even there this guy plato it turns out he 's a designer
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 674.21 675.89 <o,f0,male> he designed a state
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 683.84 697.86 <o,f0,male> the state in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern is always the best and most quietly governed and the state in which they are most eager the worst well got that wrong didn 't we
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 698.48 704.37 <o,f0,male> but look at that statement it 's all about intent that 's what i love about it but consider what plato is doing here
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 704.4 716.32 <o,f0,male> what is he doing it 's a grand idea of design a huge idea of design common to all of the voices of religion and philosophy that emerged in the classical period what was going on then
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 716.65 723.72 <o,f0,male> they were trying to answer the question of what would human beings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survive
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 723.77 730.5 <o,f0,male> as the human race emerged from a prehistoric chaos a confrontation with random
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 730.54 732.4 <o,f0,male> brutal nature
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 732.49 735.82 <o,f0,male> they suddenly had a moment to think and there was a lot to think about
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 736.05 739.78 <o,f0,male> all of a sudden human existence needed an intent
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 740.73 745.86 <o,f0,male> human life needed a reason reality itself needed a designer
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 745.87 750.37 <o,f0,male> the given was replaced by various aspects of intent
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 751.25 753.21 <o,f0,male> by various designs
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 753.41 755.42 <o,f0,male> by various gods
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 756.8 758.46 <o,f0,male> gods we 're still fighting about
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 763.26 768.45 <o,f0,male> today it is the chaos of humanity 's impact on the earth itself that we confront
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 769.18 771.97 <o,f0,male> this young discipline called design i think
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 792.35 798.87 <o,f0,male> on all the places we change the consequences of a planet with seven billion people and counting
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 799.55 803.45 <o,f0,male> that 's the tune we 're all covering today all of us
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 803.89 806.09 <o,f0,male> and we can 't just imitate the past no
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 828.09 845.82 <o,f0,male> the place was falling apart it was a horrible horrible place and i needed to go and explore the center of kinshasa to report on the rioting and the looting people were carrying off vehicles carrying off pieces of buildings soldiers were in the streets shooting at looters and herding some in mass arrests
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 846.31 851.45 <o,f0,male> in the middle of this chaos i 'm rolling around in a wheelchair and i was completely invisible
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 856.51 863.96 <o,f0,male> i was in a wheelchair i didn 't look like a journalist particularly at least from their perspective and i didn 't look like a soldier that 's for sure
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 864.62 870.37 <o,f0,male> i was part of this sort of background noise of the misery of zaire completely invisible
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 870.55 876.7 <o,f0,male> and all of a sudden from around a corner comes this young man paralyzed just like me in this
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 889.45 894.05 <o,f0,male> and i looked at him he didn 't know any other english than that but we didn 't need english no no no
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 901.17 908.67 <o,f0,male> and i looked at his whacky pedal mechanism he was full of pride over his design i wish i could show you that contraption
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 908.99 913.55 <o,f0,male> his smile our glow as we talked a universal language
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 919.14 923.13 <o,f0,male> his machine homemade bolted rusty comical
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 923.13 926.34 <o,f0,male> my machine american made confident sleek
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 926.94 932.39 <o,f0,male> he was particularly proud of the comfortable seat really comfortable seat he had made in his chariot
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 943.32 948.44 <o,f0,male> he would have understood those a chariot of pure intent think about it
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 948.69 951.13 <o,f0,male> in a city out of control
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 951.61 954.17 <o,f0,male> design blew it all away for a moment
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 954.84 962.38 <o,f0,male> we spoke for a few minutes and then each of us vanished back into the chaos he went back to the streets of kinshasa i went to my hotel
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 975.6 978.33 <o,f0,male> it has power it 's treasure we 're drawn to it
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 979.23 981.19 <o,f0,male> an object devoid of intent
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 981.41 983.69 <o,f0,male> it 's random it 's imitative
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 984.13 988.63 <o,f0,male> it repels us it 's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away this
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 988.77 990.74 <o,f0,male> is what we must demand
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 990.86 996.18 <o,f0,male> of our lives of our objects of our things of our circumstances
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 1013.12 1014.68 <o,f0,male> thirty six years ago
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 1015.04 1016.74 <o,f0,male> at nearly this moment
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 1018.22 1020.88 <o,f0,male> a nineteen year old boy awoke from a coma
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 1020.97 1022.86 <o,f0,male> to ask a nurse a question
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 1023.02 1025.24 <o,f0,male> but the nurse was already there with an answer
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 1025.54 1028.78 <o,f0,male> you 've had a terrible accident young man you 've broken your back
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 1038.32 1043.33 <o,f0,male> you see i knew that the car had gone over the guardrail on the twenty eighth of february
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 1043.67 1046.83 <o,f0,male> and i knew that one thousand nine hundred and seventy six was a leap year
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 1047.85 1051.56 <o,f0,male> nurse is this the twenty eighth or the twenty nine
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 1077.74 1079.47 <o,f0,male> lived by design
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 1091.68 1093.27 <o,f0,female> to get back to this to get back to design
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 1094.38 1096.83 <o,f0,male> and as my daddy suggested a long time ago
JohnHockenberry_2012 1 JohnHockenberry_2012 1097.24 1098.86 <o,f0,male> make the song your own
