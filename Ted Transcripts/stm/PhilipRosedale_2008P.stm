PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 17.06 25.01 <o,f0,male> things a little differently i'm not going to show you a presentation i'm going to talk to you and at the same time we're going to look at
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 25.49 33.05 <o,f0,male> just images from a photo stream that is pretty close to live of things that snapshots
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 41.19 52.31 <o,f0,male> come from there i thought i'd talk a little bit about some just big ideas about this and then get john back out here so we can talk interactively a little bit more and
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 53.67 62.53 <o,f0,male> ask questions you know i guess the first question is why build a virtual world at all
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 63.24 72.10 <o,f0,male> and i think the answer to that is always going to be at least driven to a certain extent by the people initially crazy enough to start the project
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 73.04 82.45 <o,f0,male> you know so i can give you a little bit of first background just on me and what moved me as a really going back as far as a teenager and then
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 82.86 92.36 <o,f0,male> an adult to actually try and build this kind of thing i was a very creative kid who read a lot and got into
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 93.00 99.56 <o,f0,male> electronics first and then later programming computers when i was really young i was just always
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 100.36 111.91 <o,f0,male> trying to make things i was just obsessed with taking things apart and building things and just anything i could do with my hands or with wood or electronics or metal or anything else
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 112.53 122.04 <o,f0,male> and so for example and it's a great second life thing i had a bedroom and every kid you know as a teenager has got his bedroom he retreats to but i wanted my door
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 122.50 132.43 <o,f0,male> i thought it would be cool if my door went up rather than opened like on star trek i thought it would be neat to do that and so i got up in the ceiling and i cut through the ceiling joists
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 133.66 142.40 <o,f0,male> much to my parents delight and put the door you know being pulled up through the ceiling i built i put a garage door opener up in the
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 143.15 152.26 <o,f0,male> would pull this door up you can imagine the amount of time that it took me to do this to the house and the displeasure of my parents the thing that
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 167.62 173.90 <o,f0,male> cobble together the materials and go through the actual execution phase of building something that you imagine from a design perspective
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 174.26 182.77 <o,f0,male> and so for me i know that when the internet came around and i was doing computer programming and just you know just generally trying to run my own little company and
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 183.71 190.53 <o,f0,male> figure out what to do with the internet and with computers i was just immediately struck by how
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 202.06 209.71 <o,f0,male> to sort of recreate the laws of physics and the rules of how things went together the sort of
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 210.14 220.91 <o,f0,male> the idea of atoms and how to make things and do that inside a computer so that we could all get in there and make stuff and so for me that was the thing that was so
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 222.01 230.29 <o,f0,male> enticing i just wanted this place where you could build things and so i think you see that in the genesis of what has happened with second life
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 230.99 242.62 <o,f0,male> and i think it's important i also think that more generally the use of the internet and technology as a kind of a space between us for creativity and design is a general
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 242.87 252.13 <o,f0,male> trend it is a sort of a great human progress technology is just generally being used to allow us to create
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 252.76 257.73 <o,f0,male> in as shared and social a way as possible and i think that second life and virtual
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 257.96 270.30 <o,f0,male> more generally represent the best we can do to achieve that right now you know another way to look at that and related to the content and you know thinking about space is to connect sort of virtual worlds
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 270.51 276.87 <o,f0,male> to space i thought that might be a fun thing to talk about for a second if you think about going into space
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 277.53 290.25 <o,f0,male> it's a fascinating thing so many movies so many kids we all sort of dream about exploring space now why is that stop for a moment and ask why that conceit why do we as people want to do that
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 301.44 311.88 <o,f0,male> in some sense you would become someone else in that journey because there wouldn't be you'd leave society and life as you know it behind and so inevitably you would transform yourself
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 322.42 334.43 <o,f0,male> you can find out there oh yeah you have no idea what you're going to find once you get there into space it's going to be different than here and in fact
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 352.66 365.60 <o,f0,male> virtual worlds and where we're going with more and more computing technology represent essentially the likely really tactically possible
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 366.31 376.00 <o,f0,male> version of space exploration we are moved by the idea of virtual worlds because like space they allow us to reinvent ourselves and they contain
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 416.71 427.34 <o,f0,male> web and virtual reality with internet you can find exactly the same articles written about everything that people are observing to give you an idea of scale
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 427.74 437.72 <o,f0,male> second life is about twenty thousand cpus at this point it's about twenty thousand computers connected together in three facilities in the united states right now
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 446.67 456.47 <o,f0,male> active population is something like a smallish city the space itself is about ten times the size of san francisco and it's about as densely built out
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 471.93 479.35 <o,f0,male> so that sort of space exploration thing is matched up here by the amount of content that's in there and i think that amount is critical
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 479.61 495.41 <o,f0,male> it was critical with the virtual world that it be this space of truly infinite possibility we're very sensitive to that as humans you know you know when you see it you know when you can do anything in a space and you know when you can 't second life today is this twenty thousand machines and it's about one hundred million or so user
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 495.64 503.73 <o,f0,male> created objects where you know an object would be something like this possibly interactive ten of millions of them are thinking all the time they have code attached to them
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 504.10 511.18 <o,f0,male> so it's a really large world already in terms of the amount of stuff that's there and that's very important if anybody plays like world of warcraft world
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 512.12 521.88 <o,f0,male> comes on like four dvds second life by comparison has about one hundred terabytes of user created data making it about twenty five thousand times larger
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 522.97 527.01 <o,f0,male> so again like the internet compared to aol and
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 542.56 551.91 <o,f0,male> that whatever this is going to evolve into is going to be bigger in total usage than the web itself and let me justify that with two statements
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 573.36 584.22 <o,f0,male> the web puts information in the form of text and images the topology the geography of the web is text to text links for the most part
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 584.93 595.84 <o,f0,male> that's one way of organizing information but there are two things about the way you access information in a virtual world that i think are the important ways that they're very different and much better than what
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 595.97 600.93 <o,f0,male> we've been able to do to date with the web the first is that as i said
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 602.96 612.49 <o,f0,male> the well the first difference for virtual worlds is that information is presented to you in the virtual world using the most powerful iconic symbols
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 612.96 622.53 <o,f0,male> that you can possibly use with human beings so for example c h a i r is the english word for that but a picture of this
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 623.13 633.25 <o,f0,male> is a universal symbol everybody knows what it means there's no need to translate it it's also more memorable if i show you that picture and i show you c h a i r on a piece of paper
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 639.26 648.76 <o,f0,male> so when you organize information using the symbols of our memory using the most common symbols that we've been immersed in all our lives you maximally
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 649.36 660.08 <o,f0,male> both excite stimulate are able to remember transfer and manipulate data and so virtual worlds are the best way for us to essentially organize and experience information
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 666.43 675.92 <o,f0,male> that lifelike environments are really important in some magical way to us but the second thing and i think this one is less obvious is that the
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 682.91 691.89 <o,f0,male> is in the virtual world implicitly and inherently social you are always there with other people and we as humans
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 692.55 700.78 <o,f0,male> social creatures and must or are aided by or enjoy more the consumption of information in the presence of others
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 701.03 709.82 <o,f0,male> it's essential to us you can't escape it when you're on amazon com and you're looking for digital cameras or whatever you're on
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 711.09 718.23 <o,f0,male> right now when you're on the site with like five thousand other people but you can't talk to them you can't just turn
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 718.59 726.86 <o,f0,male> to the people that are browsing digital cameras on the same page as you and ask them hey have you seen one of these before because i'm thinking about buying it
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 727.41 739.09 <o,f0,male> that experience of like shopping together just as a simple example is an example of how as social creatures we want to experience information in that way so that second point that we inherently
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 749.67 758.80 <o,f0,male> to connect us and so i think again that it's likely that in the next decade or so these virtual worlds are going to be
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 758.93 768.92 <o,f0,male> the most common way as human beings that we kind of use the electronics of the internet if you will to be together to consume information
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 769.77 776.76 <o,f0,male> you know mapping in india that's such a great example maybe the solution there involves talking to other people in real time
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 777.30 784.97 <o,f0,male> asking for advice rather than any possible way that you could just statically organize a map
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 786.15 792.01 <o,f0,male> so i think that's another big point i think that wherever this is all going whether it's second life
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 792.66 801.87 <o,f0,male> its descendants or something broader that happens all around the world at a lot of different points this is what we're going to see the internet used for and total traffic
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 802.19 809.92 <o,f0,male> and total unique users is going to invert so that the web and its bibliographic set of text and graphical information
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 810.16 817.05 <o,f0,male> is going to become a tool or a part of that consumption pattern but the pattern itself is going to happen mostly in this type of an environment
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 817.47 828.59 <o,f0,male> big idea but i think highly defensible so let me stop there and bring john back and maybe we can just have a longer conversation
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 851.92 861.87 <o,f0,male> such a deep question yeah is a virtual world likely to be a utopia would be one way i'd say it the answer is no and i think the reason why is because
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 862.03 872.59 <o,f0,male> the web itself as a good example is profoundly bottoms up that idea of infinite possibility that magic of anything can happen only happens in an environment where
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 872.95 885.83 <o,f0,male> you really know that there's a fundamental freedom at the level of the individual actor at the level of the lego blocks if you will that make up the virtual world you have to have that level of freedom and so i'm often asked that you know is there a kind of utopian or
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 886.47 895.05 <o,f0,male> is there a utopian tendency to second life and things like it that you would create a world that has a grand scheme to it those top down schemes are alienating
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 895.18 907.03 <o,f0,male> to just about everybody even if you mean well when you build them and what's more human society when it's controlled when you set out a grand scheme of rules a new way of people interacting or
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 907.36 914.84 <o,f0,male> a new way of laying out a city or whatever that stuff historically has never scaled much beyond you know i always laughingly say the mall of america
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 925.78 934.82 <o,f0,male> give me a story of a tool you created at the beginning in second life that you were pretty sure people would want to use in the creation of their avatars or in communicating
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 958.99 967.90 <o,f0,male> more private conversation but it wasn't instant messaging because you had to sort of befriend somebody it was just this idea that you could kind of have a private chat i just remember it was one of those examples of
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 968.22 978.70 <o,f0,male> data driven design i thought it was such a good idea from my perspective and it was just absolutely never used and we ultimately i think we've now turned it off if i remember we finally gave up took it out of the code
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 979.56 988.68 <o,f0,male> but more generally you know one other example i think about this which is great relative to the utopian idea second life originally had sixteen simulators
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 988.97 996.45 <o,f0,male> now has twenty thousand so when it only had sixteen it was only about as big as this college campus and we had
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 996.59 1009.61 <o,f0,male> we zoned it you know we put a nightclub we put a disco where you could dance and then we had a place where you could fight with guns if you wanted to and we had another place that was like a boardwalk kind of a coney island
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1010.36 1021.52 <o,f0,male> and we laid out the zoning but of course people could build all around it however they wanted to and what was so amazing right from the start
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1023.23 1033.05 <o,f0,male> concept basically was instantly and thoroughly ignored and like two months into the whole thing which is really a small amount of time even in second life time i remember
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1034.05 1043.20 <o,f0,male> the users the people who were then using second life the residents came to me and said we want to buy the disco because i had built it we want to buy that land and raze it
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1043.78 1052.67 <o,f0,male> and put houses on it and i sold it to them i mean we transferred ownership and they had a big party and blew up the entire building and i remember that that
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1053.64 1061.89 <o,f0,male> was just so telling you know that you didn't know exactly what was going to happen when you think about stuff that people have built that's popular jh cbgbs has to close eventually
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1063.67 1067.82 <o,f0,male> and it but it closed on day one basically in internet time
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1069.17 1076.51 <o,f0,male> you know an example of something pregnancy you can have a baby in second life this is done
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1077.42 1086.72 <o,f0,male> entirely using kind of the tools that are built into second life so the innate concept of becoming pregnant and having a baby of course second life is at
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1087.21 1097.23 <o,f0,male> the platform level at the level of the company at linden lab second life has no game properties to it whatsoever there is no attempt to structure the experience to make it utopian in that sense that
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1097.81 1109.01 <o,f0,male> we put into it so of course we never would have put a mechanism for having babies or you know taking two avatars and merging them or something but people built the ability to have babies and care for babies
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1109.37 1118.38 <o,f0,male> as a purchasable experience that you can have in second life and so i mean that's a pretty fascinating example of you know what goes on in the overall economy and of course
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1146.84 1148.42 <o,f0,male> questions for philip rosedale right here
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1173.81 1181.36 <o,f0,male> had a fantastic avatar a female avatar that i used to be once in a while but my avatar is a guy wearing
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1182.92 1195.67 <o,f0,male> chaps spiky hair spikier than this kind of orange hair handlebar mustache kind of a village people sort of a character so very cool jh and your question
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1200.03 1212.38 <o,f0,male> the question is there appears to be a lack of cultural fine tuning in second life it doesn't seem to have its own culture and the sort of differences that exist in the real world aren't translated into the second life
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1213.20 1223.72 <o,f0,male> first of all we're very early so this has only been going on for a few years and so part of what we see is the same evolution of human behavior that you see in emerging societies so
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1223.97 1230.43 <o,f0,male> a fair criticism is what it is of second life today is that it's more like the wild west than it is like rome
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1230.91 1245.43 <o,f0,male> from a cultural standpoint that said the evolution of and the nuanced interaction that creates culture is happening at ten times the speed of the real world and in an environment where if you walk into a bar in second life
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1259.28 1270.67 <o,f0,male> that you drag onto your body and they basically kind of pop up on your screen and allow you to use google or babelfish or one of the other online text translators to on the fly translate
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1271.39 1284.37 <o,f0,male> spoken i'm sorry typed text between individuals and so the multicultural nature and the sort of cultural melting pot that's happening inside second life is quite i think quite remarkable relative to what
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1285.30 1297.45 <o,f0,male> in real human terms in the real world we've ever been able to achieve so i think that culture will fine tune it will emerge but we still have some years to wait while that happens as you would naturally expect jh other questions
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1299.23 1301.27 <o,f0,male> right here
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1312.93 1319.46 <o,f0,male> the use of second life increases dramatically as your physical age increases so as you go from
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1319.86 1327.65 <o,f0,male> age thirty to age sixty and there are many people in their sixties using second life this is also not a sharp curve it's very very distributed
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1328.54 1334.22 <o,f0,male> usage goes up in terms of like hours per week by forty percent as you go from age thirty to age sixty
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1334.61 1343.43 <o,f0,male> in real life so there's not many people make the mistake of believing that second life is some kind of an online game actually it's generally unappealing
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1344.15 1350.16 <o,f0,male> just speaking broadly and critically it's not very appealing to people that play online video games because the graphics are not yet
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1350.72 1359.12 <o,f0,male> equivalent to i mean these are very nice pictures but in general the graphics are not quite equivalent to the fine tuned graphics that you see in a grand theft auto four
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1372.29 1383.64 <o,f0,male> if you take the uk and europe together they make up about fifty five percent of the usage base in second life in terms of psychographic oh men and women men and women are almost equally
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1384.53 1389.42 <o,f0,male> matched in second life so about forty five percent of the people online right now on second life are women
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1390.53 1398.79 <o,f0,male> use second life though about thirty to forty percent more on an hours basis than men do meaning that more men sign up than women and more women stay and use it than men
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 1400.96 1409.49 <o,f0,male> so that's another demographic fact in terms of psychographic you know the people in second life are remarkably dissimilar
