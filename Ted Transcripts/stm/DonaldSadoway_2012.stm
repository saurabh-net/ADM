DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 16.4 19.16 <o,f0,male> electricity powering the lights in this theater
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 19.34 21.55 <o,f0,male> was generated just moments ago
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 21.8 24.35 <o,f0,male> because the way things stand today
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 24.74 30.08 <o,f0,male> electricity demand must be in constant balance with electricity supply
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 30.46 38.97 <o,f0,male> if in the time that it took me to walk out here on this stage some tens of megawatts of wind power stopped pouring into the grid
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 39.64 41.89 <o,f0,male> the difference would have to be made up
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 42.17 44.92 <o,f0,male> from other generators immediately
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 50.79 65.14 <o,f0,male> a giant battery could with a giant battery we 'd be able to address the problem of intermittency that prevents wind and solar from contributing to the grid in the same way that coal gas and nuclear do today
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 69.88 84.55 <o,f0,male> device here with it we could draw electricity from the sun even when the sun doesn 't shine and that changes everything because then renewables such as wind and solar come out from the wings
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 84.55 91.86 <o,f0,male> here to center stage today i want to tell you about such a device it 's called the liquid metal battery
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 91.87 94.23 <o,f0,male> it 's a new form of energy storage
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 94.23 96.16 <o,f0,male> that i invented at mit
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 96.18 98.7 <o,f0,male> along with a team of my students
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 98.72 100.26 <o,f0,male> and post docs
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 100.67 104.04 <o,f0,male> now the theme of this year 's ted conference is full spectrum
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 104.23 117.77 <o,f0,male> the oed defines spectrum as the entire range of wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation from the longest radio waves to the shortest gamma rays of which the range of visible light
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 117.78 129.98 <o,f0,male> is only a small part so i 'm not here today only to tell you how my team at mit has drawn out of nature a solution to one of the world 's great problems i want to go full spectrum
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 130.15 140.56 <o,f0,male> and tell you how in the process of developing this new technology we 've uncovered some surprising heterodoxies that can serve as lessons for innovation
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 140.96 142.69 <o,f0,male> ideas worth spreading
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 149.69 164.32 <o,f0,male> we can 't just conserve our way out we can 't just drill our way out we can 't bomb our way out we 're going to do it the old fashioned american way we 're going to invent our way out working together
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 184.6 193.26 <o,f0,male> perhaps overlooked volta 's invention of the battery for the first time also demonstrated the utility of a professor
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 200.28 202.14 <o,f0,male> here 's the first battery
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 202.42 208.27 <o,f0,male> a stack of coins zinc and silver separated by cardboard soaked in brine
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 208.28 211.78 <o,f0,male> this is the starting point for designing a battery
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 211.87 215.86 <o,f0,male> two electrodes in this case metals of different composition
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 216.16 221.89 <o,f0,male> and an electrolyte in this case salt dissolved in water the science is that simple
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 226.21 230.16 <o,f0,male> i 've taught you that battery science is straightforward
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 230.18 233.32 <o,f0,male> and the need for grid level storage is compelling
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 233.84 244.18 <o,f0,male> but the fact is that today there is simply no battery technology capable of meeting the demanding performance requirements of the grid
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 244.32 250.77 <o,f0,male> namely uncommonly high power long service lifetime and super low cost
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 251.09 253.77 <o,f0,male> we need to think about the problem differently
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 253.97 257.19 <o,f0,female> we need to think big we need to think cheap
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 257.34 267.82 <o,f0,male> so let 's abandon the paradigm of let 's search for the coolest chemistry and then hopefully we 'll chase down the cost curve by just making lots and lots of product
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 267.83 272.71 <o,f0,male> instead let 's invent to the price point of the electricity market
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 273.04 279 <o,f0,male> so that means that certain parts of the periodic table are axiomatically off limits
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 279.22 287.68 <o,f0,male> this battery needs to be made out of earth abundant elements i say if you want to make something dirt cheap make it out of dirt
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 294.56 297.35 <o,f0,male> and we need to be able to build this thing
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 297.4 302.84 <o,f0,male> using simple manufacturing techniques and factories that don 't cost us a fortune
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 315.96 325.75 <o,f0,male> in fact i looked to a technology that neither stores nor generates electricity but instead consumes electricity huge amounts of it
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 326.07 329.1 <o,f0,male> i 'm talking about the production of aluminum
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 329.45 344.51 <o,f0,male> the process was invented in one thousand eight hundred and eighty six by a couple of twenty two year olds hall in the united states and heroult in france and just a few short years following their discovery aluminum changed from a precious metal costing as much as silver
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 344.72 347.4 <o,f0,male> to a common structural material
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 347.66 351.31 <o,f0,male> you 're looking at the cell house of a modern aluminum smelter
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 351.31 365.76 <o,f0,male> it 's about fifty feet wide and recedes about half a mile row after row of cells that inside resemble volta 's battery with three important differences volta 's battery works at room temperature
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 365.76 372.26 <o,f0,male> it 's fitted with solid electrodes and an electrolyte that 's a solution of salt and water
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 372.26 379.83 <o,f0,male> the hall heroult cell operates at high temperature a temperature high enough that the aluminum metal product is liquid
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 379.83 393.4 <o,f0,male> the electrolyte is not a solution of salt and water but rather salt that 's melted it 's this combination of liquid metal molten salt and high temperature that allows us to send high current through this thing
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 394.54 396.94 <o,f0,female> today we can produce
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 401.13 415.45 <o,f0,male> that 's the economic miracle of modern electrometallurgy it is this that caught and held my attention to the point that i became obsessed with inventing a battery that could capture this gigantic economy of scale
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 420.34 425.28 <o,f0,male> liquid metals for both electrodes and a molten salt for the electrolyte
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 451.5 454.62 <o,f0,male> put a high density liquid metal at the bottom
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 457.65 460.2 <o,f0,male> and molten salt in between
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 473.28 481.18 <o,f0,male> with the periodic table enunciated by another professor dimitri mendeleyev everything we know
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 481.21 487.29 <o,f0,male> is made of some combination of what you see depicted here and that includes our own bodies
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 487.86 500.21 <o,f0,male> i recall the very moment one day when i was searching for a pair of metals that would meet the constraints of earth abundance different opposite density
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 500.99 507.01 <o,f0,male> and high mutual reactivity i felt the thrill of realization when i knew i 'd come upon the answer
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 517.72 522.74 <o,f0,male> you know i 've got to tell you one of the greatest benefits of being a professor
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 543.91 547.12 <o,f0,male> the electrons go to work in the real world out here
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 554.98 557.25 <o,f0,male> now to charge the battery
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 557.27 562.12 <o,f0,male> we connect a source of electricity it could be something like a wind farm
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 563.38 566.09 <o,f0,male> and then we reverse
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 573.98 578.3 <o,f0,male> and return to the upper electrode restoring the initial
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 579.34 581.36 <o,f0,male> constitution of the battery
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 581.97 587.43 <o,f0,male> and the current passing between the electrodes generates enough heat to keep it at temperature
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 610.56 612.54 <o,f0,male> to see it from my perspective
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 616.29 621.36 <o,f0,male> david bradwell who in this image appears to be wondering if this thing will ever work
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 622.23 626.52 <o,f0,male> what i didn 't tell david at the time was i myself wasn 't convinced it would work
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 626.89 629.03 <o,f0,male> but david 's young and he 's smart
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 643.94 650.5 <o,f0,male> which were paid with seed funds at mit i was able to attract major
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 655.57 672.94 <o,f0,male> and that allowed me to expand my group to twenty people a mix of graduate students post docs and even some undergraduates and i was able to attract really really good people people who share my passion for science and service to society not science and service for career building
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 676.69 680.37 <o,f0,male> on liquid metal battery their answer would hearken back to president
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 731.75 741.51 <o,f0,male> but the pace wasn 't fast enough for us so a year and a half ago david and i along with another research staff member formed a company to accelerate
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 759.43 767.79 <o,f0,male> four kilowatt hour cell on the horizon it 's going to be thirty six inches in diameter we call that the bistro table but it 's not ready yet for prime time viewing
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 768.11 780.22 <o,f0,male> and one variant of the technology has us stacking these bistro tabletops into modules aggregating the modules into a giant battery that fits in a forty foot shipping container for placement in the field
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 780.33 795.48 <o,f0,male> and this has a nameplate capacity of two megawatt hours two million watt hours that 's enough energy to meet the daily electrical needs of two hundred american households so here you have it grid level storage silent
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 796.24 799.55 <o,f0,male> emissions free no moving parts
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 799.8 806.65 <o,f0,male> remotely controlled designed to the market price point without subsidy
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 807.87 810.03 <o,f0,male> so what have we learned from all this
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 822.66 825.51 <o,f0,male> they lie beyond the visible temperature
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 826.14 828.03 <o,f0,male> conventional wisdom says
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 828.12 840.74 <o,f0,male> set it low at or near room temperature and then install a control system to keep it there avoid thermal runaway liquid metal battery is designed to operate at elevated temperature with minimum regulation
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 841.64 846.85 <o,f0,male> our battery can handle the very high temperature rises that come from current surges
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 848.39 858.08 <o,f0,male> scaling conventional wisdom says reduce cost by producing many liquid metal battery is designed to reduce cost by producing fewer
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 863.85 870.98 <o,f0,male> hire battery experts seasoned professionals who can draw upon their vast experience and knowledge
DonaldSadoway_2012 1 DonaldSadoway_2012 870.98 885.07 <o,f0,male> to develop liquid metal battery i hired students and post docs and mentored them in a battery i strive to maximize electrical potential when mentoring i strive to maximize human potential
