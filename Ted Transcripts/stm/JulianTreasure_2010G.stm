JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 16.26 21.01 <o,f0,male> say nada brahma one translation of which is the world is sound
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 21.29 33.59 <o,f0,male> and in a way that 's true because everything is vibrating in fact all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies so you are in fact a chord each of you an individual
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 34.32 38.29 <o,f0,male> one definition of health may be that that chord is in complete harmony
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 38.36 55.08 <o,f0,male> your ears can 't hear that chord they can actually hear amazing things your ears can hear ten octaves incidentally we see just one octave your ears are always on you have no ear lids they work even when you sleep the smallest sound you can perceive moves your eardrum just four atomic diameters
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 55.15 58.99 <o,f0,male> the loudest sound you can hear is a trillion times more powerful than that
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 63.06 78.07 <o,f0,male> listening is an active skill whereas hearing is passive listening is something that we have to work at it 's a relationship with sound and yet it 's a skill that none of us are taught for example have you ever considered that there are listening positions places you can listen from here are two of them
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 78.72 94.07 <o,f0,male> reductive listening is listening for it reduces everything down to what 's relevant and it discards everything that 's not relevant men typically listen reductively so he 's saying i 've got this problem he 's saying here 's your solution thanks very much next that 's the way we talk right guys
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 94.49 96.32 <o,f0,male> expansive listening on the other hand
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 96.41 98.9 <o,f0,male> is listening with not listening for
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 98.91 116.98 <o,f0,male> it 's got no destination in mind it 's just enjoying the journey women typically listen expansively if you look at these two eye contact facing each other possibly both talking at the same time laughter men if you get nothing else out of this talk practice expansive listening and you can transform your relationships
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 117.63 122.82 <o,f0,male> the trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear is noise surrounding us all the time
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 123.17 126.04 <o,f0,male> noise like this according to the european union
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 126.18 132.07 <o,f0,male> is reducing the health and the quality of life of twenty five percent of the population of europe
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 132.52 140.07 <o,f0,male> two percent of the population of europe that 's sixteen million people are having their sleep devastated by noise like that
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 140.41 144.31 <o,f0,male> noise kills two hundred thousand people a year in europe
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 144.53 152.91 <o,f0,male> it 's a really big problem now when you were little if you had noise and you didn 't want to hear it you 'd stick your fingers in your ears and hum these days you can do a similar thing it just looks a bit cooler
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 169.81 185.12 <o,f0,male> so we 're inviting into our lives the voices of people who are not present with us i think there 's something deeply unhealthy about living all the time in schizophonia the second problem that comes with headphone abuse is compression we squash music to fit it into our pocket
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 185.12 190.09 <o,f0,male> and there is a cost attached to this listen to this this is an uncompressed piece of music
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 195.39 199.06 <o,f0,male> and now the same piece of music with ninety eight percent of the data removed
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 202.5 217.73 <o,f0,male> i do hope that some of you at least can hear the difference between those two there is a cost of compression it makes you tired and irritable to have to make up all of that data you 're having to imagine it it 's not good for you in the long run the third problem with headphones is this deafness
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 217.79 233.72 <o,f0,male> noise induced hearing disorder ten million americans already have this for one reason or another but really worryingly sixteen percent roughly one in six of american teenagers suffer from noise induced hearing disorder as a result of headphone abuse
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 233.74 245.4 <o,f0,male> one study at an american university found that sixty one percent of college freshmen had damaged hearing as a result of headphone abuse we may be raising an entire generation of deaf people
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 263.84 277.22 <o,f0,male> and thirdly if you 're in bad sound it 's fine to put your fingers in your ears or just move away from it protect your ears in that way let 's move away from bad sound and look at some friends that i urge you to seek out wwb wind water
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 277.35 290.27 <o,f0,male> birds stochastic natural sounds composed of lots of individual random events all of it very healthy all of it sound that we evolved to over the years seek those sounds out they 're good for you and so it this
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 293.58 298.99 <o,f0,male> silence is beautiful the elizabethans described language as decorated silence
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 299.37 305.5 <o,f0,male> i urge you to move away from silence with intention and to design soundscapes just like works of art
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 305.5 323.12 <o,f0,male> have a foreground a background all in beautiful proportion it 's fun to get into designing with sound if you can 't do it yourself get a professional to do it for you sound design is the future and i think it 's the way we 're going to change the way the world sounds i 'm going to just run quickly through eight modalities eight ways sound can improve health
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 323.2 334.06 <o,f0,male> first ultrasound we 're very familiar with it from physical therapy it 's also now being used to treat cancer lithotripsy saving thousands of people a year from the scalpel by pulverizing stones with high intensity sound
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 357.03 361.12 <o,f0,male> and four modalities where you need to take some action and get involved
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 361.36 378.73 <o,f0,male> first of all listen consciously i hope that that after this talk you 'll be doing that it 's a whole new dimension to your life and it 's wonderful to have that dimension secondly get in touch with making some sound create sound the voice is the instrument we all play and yet how many of us are trained in using our voice get trained
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 378.73 382.87 <o,f0,male> learn to sing learn to play an instrument musicians have bigger brains it 's true
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 382.9 391.82 <o,f0,male> you can do this in groups as well it 's a fantastic antidote to schizophonia to make music and sound in a group of people whichever style you enjoy particularly
JulianTreasure_2010G 1 JulianTreasure_2010G 411.54 425.31 <o,f0,male> my vision is of a world that sounds beautiful and if we all start doing these things we will take a very big step in that direction so i urge you to take that path i 'm leaving you with a little more birdsong which is very good for you i wish you sound health
