AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 20.48 24.47 <o,f0,male> or b climate change or c nuclear holocaust
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 24.48 26.48 <o,f0,male> or d all of the above
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 36.72 40.72 <o,f0,male> could we have fuel without fear could we reinvent fire
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 41.32 49.7 <o,f0,male> you see fire made us human fossil fuels made us modern but now we need a new fire that makes us safe secure healthy and durable
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 68.37 83.6 <o,f0,male> they 've created our wealth they 've enriched the lives of billions but they also have rising costs to our security economy health and environment that are starting to erode if not outweigh their benefits so we need a new fire
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 83.87 91.6 <o,f0,male> and switching from the old fire to the new fire means changing two big stories about oil and electricity
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 91.6 105.56 <o,f0,male> each of which puts two fifths of the fossil carbon in the air but they 're really quite distinct less than one percent of our electricity is made from oil although almost half is made from coal
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 105.58 116.76 <o,f0,male> their uses are quite concentrated three fourths of our oil fuel is transportation three fourths of our electricity powers buildings and the rest of both runs factories so very efficient
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 116.91 127.21 <o,f0,male> vehicles buildings and factories save oil and coal and also natural gas that can displace both of them but today 's energy system is not just inefficient
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 127.29 132.15 <o,f0,male> it is also disconnected aging dirty and insecure
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 132.3 138.2 <o,f0,male> so it needs refurbishment by two thousand and fifty though it could become efficient
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 138.31 148.84 <o,f0,male> connected and distributed with elegantly frugal autos factories and buildings all relying on a modern secure and resilient
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 148.84 162.03 <o,f0,male> electricity system we can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by two thousand and fifty and use one third less natural gas while switching to efficient use
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 162.11 163.81 <o,f0,male> and renewable supply
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 164.66 168.74 <o,f0,male> this could cost by two thousand and fifty five
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 168.74 173.86 <o,f0,male> trillion dollars less in net present value that is expressed as a lump sum today
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 183.96 200.01 <o,f0,male> yet this cheaper energy system could support one hundred and fifty eight percent bigger u s economy all without needing oil or coal or for that matter nuclear energy moreover this transition needs no new inventions and no acts of congress
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 200.08 207.83 <o,f0,male> and no new federal taxes mandate subsidies or laws and running washington gridlock
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 208.18 218.75 <o,f0,male> let me say that again i 'm going to tell you how to get the united states completely off oil and coal five trillion dollars cheaper with no act of congress led by business for profit
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 219.56 223.26 <o,f0,male> in other words we 're going to use our most effective institutions
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 223.26 242.2 <o,f0,male> private enterprise co evolving with civil society and sped by military innovation to go around our least effective institutions and whether you care most about profits and jobs and competitive advantage or national security or environmental stewardship and climate protection and public health
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 242.2 246.74 <o,f0,male> reinventing fire makes sense and makes money
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 247.03 261.93 <o,f0,male> general eisenhower reputedly said that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem makes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies so in reinventing fire we integrated all four sectors that use energy
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 261.93 270.95 <o,f0,male> transportation buildings industry and electricity and we integrated four kinds of innovation not just technology and policy
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 270.95 282.03 <o,f0,male> but also design and business strategy those combinations yield very much more than the sum of the parts especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 283.61 296.4 <o,f0,male> oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day plus another four billion dollars a day in hidden economic and military costs raising its total cost to over a sixth of gdp
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 296.4 307.07 <o,f0,male> our mobility fuel goes three fifths to automobiles so let 's start by making autos oil free two thirds of the energy it takes to move a typical car is caused by its weight
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 307.41 317.29 <o,f0,male> and every unit of energy you save at the wheels by taking out weight or drag saves seven units in the tank because you don 't have to waste six units getting the energy to the wheels
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 317.29 333.85 <o,f0,male> unfortunately over the past quarter century epidemic obesity has made our two ton steel cars gain weight twice as fast as we have but today ultralight ultrastrong materials like carbon fiber composites
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 333.85 340 <o,f0,male> can make dramatic weight savings snowball and can make cars simpler and cheaper to build
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 340 356.27 <o,f0,male> lighter and more slippery autos need less force to move them so their engines get smaller indeed that sort of vehicle fitness then makes electric propulsion affordable because the batteries or fuel cells
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 356.27 372.35 <o,f0,male> also get smaller and lighter and cheaper so sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today while the driving cost even from the start is very much lower so these innovations together can transform
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 372.35 387.01 <o,f0,male> automakers from wringing tiny savings out of victorian engine and seal stamping technologies to the steeply falling costs of three linked innovations that strongly reenforce each other
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 387.01 394.79 <o,f0,male> namely ultralight materials making them into structures and electric propulsion the sales can grow
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 394.8 414.41 <o,f0,male> and the prices fall even faster with temporary feebates that is rebates for efficient new autos paid for by fees on inefficient ones and just in the first two years the biggest of europe 's five feebate programs has tripled the speed of improving automotive efficiency
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 414.6 430.52 <o,f0,male> the resulting shift to electric autos is going to be as game changing as shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers of course computers and electronics are now america 's biggest industry while typewriter makers have vanished
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 430.52 443.3 <o,f0,male> so vehicle fitness opens a new automotive competitive strategy that can double the oil savings over the next forty years but then also make electrification affordable and that
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 443.3 452.22 <o,f0,male> displaces the rest of the oil america could lead this next automotive revolution currently the leader is germany
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 452.53 454.39 <o,f0,male> last year volkswagen
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 454.61 474.21 <o,f0,male> announced that by next year they 'll be producing this carbon fiber plugin hybrid getting two hundred and thirty miles a gallon also last year bmw announced this carbon fiber electric car they said that its carbon fiber is paid for by needing fewer batteries and they said we do not intend to be a typewriter maker
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 477.25 485.36 <o,f0,male> seven years ago an even faster and cheaper american manufacturing technology was used to
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 485.59 490.38 <o,f0,male> make this little carbon fiber test part
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 490.49 492.25 <o,f0,male> which doubles as a carbon cap
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 496.32 507.49 <o,f0,male> and you can tell from the sound how immensely stiff and strong it is don 't worry about dropping it it 's tougher than titanium tom friedman actually whacked it as hard as he could with a sledgehammer without even scuffing it
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 507.49 525.85 <o,f0,male> but such manufacturing techniques can scale to automotive speed and cost with aerospace performance they can save four fifths of the capital needed to make autos they can save lives because this stuff can absorb up to twelve times as much crash energy per pound as steel if we made all of our autos this way
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 525.94 544.94 <o,f0,male> it would save oil equivalent to finding one and a half saudi arabias or half an opec by drilling in the detroit formation a very prospective play and all those mega barrels under detroit cost an average of eighteen bucks a barrel they are all american carbon free and inexhaustible
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 544.94 564.05 <o,f0,male> the same physics and the same business logic also apply to big vehicles in the five years ending with two thousand and ten walmart saved sixty percent of the fuel per ton mile in its giant fleet of heavy trucks through better logistics and design but just the technological savings in heavy trucks can get to two thirds
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 564.05 571.15 <o,f0,male> and combined with triple to quintuple efficiency airplanes now on the drawing board can save close to a trillion dollars
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 571.15 587.39 <o,f0,male> also today 's military revolution in energy efficiency is going to speed up all of these civilian advances in much the same way that military r d has given us the internet the global positioning system and the jet engine and microchip industries
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 587.39 597.39 <o,f0,male> as we design and build vehicles better we can also use them smarter by harnessing four powerful techniques for eliminating needless driving
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 597.39 613.55 <o,f0,male> instead of just seeing the travel grow we can use innovative pricing charging for road infrastructure by the mile not by the gallon we can use some smart it to enhance transit and enable car sharing and ride sharing
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 613.55 618.19 <o,f0,male> we can allow smart and lucrative growth models
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 618.26 628.19 <o,f0,male> that help people already be near where they want to be so they don 't need to go somewhere else and we can use smart it to make traffic free flowing
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 628.23 631.76 <o,f0,male> together those things can give us the same or better access
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 631.76 650.77 <o,f0,male> with forty six to eighty four percent less driving saving another zero point four trillion dollars plus zero point three trillion dollars from using trucks more productively so forty years hence when you add it all up a far more mobile u s economy can use no oil
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 662.7 676.67 <o,f0,male> so to get mobility without oil to phase out the oil we can get efficient and then switch fuels those one hundred and twenty five to two hundred and forty mile per gallon equivalent autos can use any
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 676.67 693.12 <o,f0,male> mixture of hydrogen fuel cells electricity and advanced biofuels the trucks and planes can realistically use hydrogen or advanced biofuels the trucks could even use natural gas but no vehicles will need oil
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 693.12 697.71 <o,f0,male> and the most biofuel we might need just three million barrels a day
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 697.71 709.91 <o,f0,male> can be made two thirds from waste without displacing any cropland and without harming soil or climate our team speeds up these kinds of oil savings by what we call institutional acupuncture we figure out where the
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 709.91 719.59 <o,f0,male> business logic is congested and not flowing properly we stick little needles in it to get it flowing working with partners like ford and walmart and the pentagon and the long transition is already
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 719.6 722.21 <o,f0,male> well under way in fact three years ago
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 722.21 741.85 <o,f0,male> mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil not in supply but in demand and deutsche bank even said world oil use could peak around two thousand and sixteen in other words oil is getting uncompetitive even at low prices before it becomes unavailable even at high prices
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 741.85 744.35 <o,f0,male> but the electrified
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 744.35 758.35 <o,f0,male> vehicles don 't need to burden the electricity grid rather when smart autos exchange electricity and information through smart buildings with smart grids they 're adding to the grid valuable flexibility and storage that help the grid integrate
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 758.35 772.33 <o,f0,male> varying solar and wind power so the electrified autos make the auto and electricity problems easier to solve together than separately and they also converge the oil story with our second big story
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 772.33 779.36 <o,f0,male> saving electricity and then making it differently and those twin revolutions in electricity
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 779.36 790.77 <o,f0,male> will bring to that sector more numerous and profound and diverse disruptions than any other sector because we 've got twenty first century technology and speed colliding head on
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 790.77 802.85 <o,f0,male> with twentieth and nineteenth century institutions rules and cultures changing how we make electricity gets easier if we need less of it most of it now is wasted
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 802.85 808 <o,f0,male> and the technologies for saving it keep improving faster than we 're installing them so the
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 812.77 828.96 <o,f0,male> but as efficiency in buildings and industry starts to grow faster than the economy america 's electricity use could actually shrink even with the little extra use required for those efficient electrified autos
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 828.96 844.32 <o,f0,male> and we can do this just by reasonably accelerating existing trends over the next forty years buildings which use three quarters of the electricity can triple or quadruple their energy productivity saving one point four trillion dollars
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 844.33 849.1 <o,f0,male> net present value with a thirty three percent internal rate of return
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 849.46 860.28 <o,f0,male> or in english the savings are worth four times what they cost and industry can accelerate too doubling its energy productivity with a twenty one percent internal rate of return
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 860.28 865.42 <o,f0,male> the key is a disruptive innovation that we call integrative design
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 865.42 882.1 <o,f0,male> that often makes very big energy savings cost less than small or no savings that is it can give you expanding returns not diminishing returns that is how our two thousand and ten retrofit is saving over two fifths of the energy in the empire state building
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 890.44 907.16 <o,f0,male> plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the maximum cooling load by a third and then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones saved seventeen million dollars of capital cost which helped pay for the other improvements
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 907.35 911.53 <o,f0,male> and reduce the payback to just three years
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 920.99 938.09 <o,f0,male> but industry as a whole has another half trillion dollars of energy still to save for example three fifths of the world 's electricity runs motors half of that runs pumps and fans and those can all be made more efficient and the motors that turn them can
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 938.31 955.44 <o,f0,male> have their system efficiency roughly doubled by integrating thirty five improvements paying back in about a year but first we ought to be capturing bigger cheaper savings that are normally ignored and are not in the textbooks for example pumps the biggest use of motors move liquid through pipes
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 955.5 957.87 <o,f0,male> but a standard industrial pumping loop
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 957.95 970.44 <o,f0,male> was redesigned to use at least eighty six percent less energy not by getting better pumps but just by replacing long thin crooked pipes with fat short straight pipes
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 970.44 979.28 <o,f0,male> this is not about new technology it 's just rearranging our metal furniture of course it also shrinks the pumping equipment and its capital costs
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 979.28 985.7 <o,f0,male> so what do such savings mean for the electricity that is three fifths used in motors
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 985.7 988.96 <o,f0,male> well from the coal burned at the power plant
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 989.13 991.6 <o,f0,male> through all these compounding losses
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 992.31 1007.23 <o,f0,male> only a tenth of the fuel energy actually ends up coming out the pipe as flow but now let 's turn those compounding losses around backwards and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1007.7 1019.31 <o,f0,male> saves ten units of fuel cost pollution and what hunter lovins calls global weirding back at the power plant and of course as you go back upstream the components get smaller and therefore cheaper
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1019.31 1032.46 <o,f0,male> our team has lately found such snowballing energy savings in more than thirty billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns everything from data centers and chip fabs to mines and refineries
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1032.46 1043.27 <o,f0,male> typically our retrofit designs save about thirty to sixty percent of the energy and pay back in a few years while the new facility designs save forty to ninety odd percent
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1043.27 1047.78 <o,f0,male> with generally lower capital cost now
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1047.78 1064.86 <o,f0,male> needing less electricity would ease and speed the shift to new sources of electricity chiefly renewables china leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost in fact these solar power module costs have just fallen off the bottom of the chart
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1064.86 1069.51 <o,f0,male> and germany now has more solar workers than america has steel workers
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1069.84 1072.32 <o,f0,male> already in about twenty states
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1072.67 1091.84 <o,f0,male> private installers will come put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down and beat your utility bill such unregulated products could ultimately add up to a virtual utility that bypasses your electric company just as your cellphone bypassed your wireline phone company
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1091.84 1109.55 <o,f0,male> and this sort of thing gives utility executives the heebee jeebees and it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams renewables are no longer a fringe activity for each of the past four years half of the world 's new generating capacity has been renewable mainly lately in developing countries
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1109.55 1113.68 <o,f0,male> in two thousand and ten renewables other than big hydro
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1113.68 1120.66 <o,f0,male> particularly wind and solar cells got one hundred and fifty one billion dollars of private investment
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1120.76 1139.79 <o,f0,male> and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity of nuclear power in the world by adding sixty billion watts in that one year that happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity that the world can now make every year a number that goes up sixty or seventy percent a year in contrast
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1139.79 1145.83 <o,f0,male> the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity and the orders behind those
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1145.83 1159.94 <o,f0,male> keep fading because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk in fact in this country no new nuclear power plant has been able to raise any private construction capital despite seven years of one hundred plus percent subsidies
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1176.09 1178.82 <o,f0,male> cost but we only need to replace them once
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1178.97 1194.25 <o,f0,male> we 're often told though that only coal and nuclear plants can keep the lights on because they 're twenty four seven whereas wind and solar power are variable and hence supposedly unreliable actually no generator is twenty four seven they all break
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1194.25 1199.58 <o,f0,male> and when a big plant goes down you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1199.58 1202.37 <o,f0,male> often for weeks or months often without warning
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1202.37 1205.05 <o,f0,male> that is exactly why we 've designed the grid
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1205.05 1218.69 <o,f0,male> to back up failed plants with working plants and in exactly the same way the grid can handle wind and solar power 's forecastable variations
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1233.01 1236.71 <o,f0,male> and that 's true both for continental areas like the u s or europe
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1236.71 1256.04 <o,f0,male> and for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid that is how for example four german states in two thousand and ten were forty three to fifty two percent wind powered portugal was forty five percent renewable powered denmark thirty six and it 's how all of europe
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1256.04 1259.11 <o,f0,male> can shift to renewable electricity
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1259.15 1269.48 <o,f0,male> in america our aging dirty and insecure power system has to be replaced anyway by two thousand and fifty and whatever we replace it with is going to cost about the same
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1269.48 1280.5 <o,f0,male> about six trillion dollars at present value whether we buy more of what we 've got or new nuclear and so called clean coal or renewables that are more or less centralized but
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1280.53 1293.05 <o,f0,male> those four futures at the same cost differ profoundly in their risks around national security fuel water finance technology climate and health
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1293.05 1307.71 <o,f0,male> for example our over centralized grid is very vulnerable to cascading and potentially economy shattering blackouts caused by bad space weather or other natural disasters or a terrorist attack
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1307.71 1314.98 <o,f0,male> but that blackout risk disappears and all of the other risks are best managed with distributed renewables
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1315.15 1324.94 <o,f0,male> organized into local micro grids that normally interconnect but can stand alone at need that is they can disconnect fractally and then reconnect seamlessly
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1324.98 1335.07 <o,f0,male> that approach is exactly what the pentagon is adopting for its own power supply they think they need that how about the rest of us that they 're defending we want our stuff to work too
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1335.07 1349.72 <o,f0,male> at about the same cost as business as usual this would maximize national security customer choice entrepreneurial opportunity and innovation together efficient use and diverse
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1349.86 1362.48 <o,f0,male> dispersed renewable supply are starting to transform the whole electricity sector traditionally utilities build a lot of giant coal and nuclear plants and a bunch of big gas plants and maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1362.48 1370.29 <o,f0,male> and those utilities were rewarded as they still are in thirty four states for selling you more electricity
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1370.29 1388.93 <o,f0,male> however especially where regulators are now instead rewarding cutting your bills the investments are shifting radically toward efficiency demand response cogeneration renewables and ways to knit them all together reliably with less transmission and little or no
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1388.93 1396.05 <o,f0,male> bulk electricity storage so our energy future is not fate but choice and that choice is very flexible
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1411.39 1418.21 <o,f0,male> but with today 's much better technologies more mature delivery channels and integrative design we can do
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1418.21 1421.04 <o,f0,male> far more and even cheaper
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1421.04 1431.52 <o,f0,male> so to solve the energy problem we just needed to enlarge it and the results may at first seem incredible but as marshall mcluhan said only puny secrets need
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1431.52 1437.55 <o,f0,male> protection big discoveries are protected by public incredulity
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1471.03 1482.14 <o,f0,male> now if you like any of those outcomes you can support reinventing fire without needing to like all of them and without needing to agree about which of them is most important
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1482.14 1496.5 <o,f0,male> so focusing on outcomes not motives can turn gridlock and conflict into a unifying solution to america 's energy challenge this also turns out to be the best way to cope with global
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1496.55 1506.11 <o,f0,male> challenges climate change nuclear proliferation energy insecurity energy poverty all of which make us less safe
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1532.87 1536.31 <o,f0,male> because he said they simply won 't be around long term
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1536.45 1555.52 <o,f0,male> i 've described not just a once in a civilization business opportunity but one of the most profound transitions in the history of our species we humans are inventing a new fire not dug from below but flowing from above
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1556.33 1564.16 <o,f0,male> not scarce but bountiful not local but everywhere not transient but permanent not costly
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1577.57 1582.47 <o,f0,male> efficiently used it really can do our work without working our undoing
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1582.77 1588.17 <o,f0,male> each of you owns a piece of that dollar five trillion prize
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1588.35 1590.35 <o,f0,male> and our new book reinventing fire
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1590.56 1592.49 <o,f0,male> describes how you can capture it
AmoryLovins_2012S 1 AmoryLovins_2012S 1592.66 1606.66 <o,f0,male> so with the conversation just begun at reinventingfire com let me invite you each to engage with us and with each other with everyone around you to help make the world richer fairer cooler
