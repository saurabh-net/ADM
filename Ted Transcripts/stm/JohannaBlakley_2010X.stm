JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 42.3 46.62 <o,f0,female> now the academics in this audience may think well that sounds like plagiarism
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 46.95 59.63 <o,f0,female> but to a fashionista what it really is is a sign of prada 's genius that she can root through the history of fashion and pick the one jacket that doesn 't need to be changed by one iota and to be current and to be now
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 59.84 63.32 <o,f0,female> you might also be asking whether it 's possible
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 63.82 66.45 <o,f0,female> that this is illegal for her to do this
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 66.7 72.39 <o,f0,female> well it turns out that it 's actually not illegal in the fashion industry there 's very little intellectual
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 76.19 77.95 <o,f0,female> but no copyright protection and no patent protection
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 89.14 91.15 <o,f0,female> and sell it as their own design
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 91.21 95.96 <o,f0,female> the only thing that they can 't copy is the actual trademark label within that
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 107.86 110.79 <o,f0,female> but if you go to santee alley yeah
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 141.04 144.84 <o,f0,female> but too utilitarian i mean is that the way you think of fashion
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 181.69 189.11 <o,f0,female> because there 's no copyright protection in this industry there 's a very open and creative ecology of creativity
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 189.16 200.94 <o,f0,female> unlike their creative brothers and sisters who are sculptors or photographers or filmmakers or musicians fashion designers can sample from all their peers designs
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 201.02 212.17 <o,f0,female> they can take any element from any garment from the history of fashion and incorporate it into their own design they 're also notorious for riffing off of the zeitgeist and here i suspect
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 212.72 214.67 <o,f0,female> they were influenced by the costumes
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 219.8 225.65 <o,f0,female> now fashion designers have the broadest palette imaginable in this creative industry
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 232.95 236.17 <o,f0,female> i 've heard this dress actually sort of sounds like wind chimes as they walk through
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 250.13 266.27 <o,f0,female> some people believe that there are a few people at the top of the fashion food chain who sort of dictate to us what we 're all going to wear but if you talk to any designer at any level including these high end designers they always say their main inspiration comes from the street
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 266.27 270.41 <o,f0,female> where people like you and me remix and match our own fashion looks
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 270.56 274.71 <o,f0,female> and that 's where they really get a lot of their creative inspiration
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 274.94 278.27 <o,f0,female> so it 's both a top down and a bottom up kind of industry
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 293.91 301.81 <o,f0,female> but those lawsuits are usually not won by fashion designers the courts have said over and over again you don 't need any more intellectual property protection
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 302.03 311.72 <o,f0,female> when you look at copies like this you wonder how do the luxury high end brands remain in business if you can get it for two hundred bucks why pay a thousand
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 355.9 365.44 <o,f0,female> as an original high end design at least in terms of the materials they 're always made of cheaper materials but even sometimes a cheaper version can actually have some
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 365.6 369.78 <o,f0,female> charming aspects can breathe a little extra life into a dying trend
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 370.38 378.2 <o,f0,female> there 's lots of virtues of copying one that a lot of cultural critics have pointed to is that we now have a much broader
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 378.6 389.48 <o,f0,female> palette of design choices to choose from than we ever have before and this is mainly because of the fast fashion industry actually and this is a good thing we need lots of options fashion whether you like it or not
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 389.48 392.23 <o,f0,female> helps you project who you are to the world
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 392.94 394.65 <o,f0,female> because of fast fashion
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 394.76 404.99 <o,f0,female> global trends actually get established much more quickly than they used to and this actually is good news to trendsetters they want trends to be set so that they can move product
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 420.95 429.95 <o,f0,female> every season these designers have to struggle to come up with the new fabulous idea that everybody 's going to love and this let me tell you is very good for the bottom line
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 430.73 444.11 <o,f0,female> now of course there 's a bunch of effects that this culture of copying has on the creative process and stuart weitzman is a very successful shoe designer he has complained a lot about people copying him but in one interview i read
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 444.18 462.42 <o,f0,female> he said it has really forced him to up his game he had to come up with new ideas new things that would be hard to copy he came up with this bowden wedge heel that has to be made out of steel or titanium if you make it from some sort of cheaper material it 'll actually crack in two it forced him to be a little more innovative
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 467.38 469.95 <o,f0,female> i don 't know if you 've heard this anecdote but i
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 484.85 499.95 <o,f0,female> and that 's what fashion designers are doing all the time they 're trying to put together a signature look an aesthetic that reflects who they are when people knock it off everybody knows because they 've put that look out on the runway and it 's a coherent
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 513.35 515.98 <o,f0,female> so when one liners were really popular
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 551.87 553.57 <o,f0,female> the santee alley
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 554.32 571.84 <o,f0,female> now some fashion designers will say it 's only in the united states that we don 't have any respect in other countries there is protection for our artful designs but if you take a look at the two other biggest markets in the world it turns out that the protection that 's offered is really ineffectual
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 572.16 578.07 <o,f0,female> in japan for instance which i think is the third largest market they have a design law it protects apparel
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 578.14 582.48 <o,f0,female> but the novelty standard is so high you have to prove that your garment
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 582.5 595.97 <o,f0,female> has never existed before it 's totally unique and that 's sort of like the novelty standard for a u s patent which fashion designers never get rarely get here in the states in the european union they went in the other direction
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 596.15 604.79 <o,f0,female> very low novelty standard anybody can register anything but even though it 's the home of the fast fashion industry and you have a lot of luxury designers there
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 604.85 608.63 <o,f0,female> they don 't register their garments generally and there 's not a lot of litigation
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 615.77 631.69 <o,f0,female> cut off three inches from the bottom go to the e u and register it as a new original design so that does not stop the knock off artists if you look at the registry actually a lot of the registered things in the e u are nike t shirts that are almost identical to one another
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 632.13 643.5 <o,f0,female> but this has not stopped diane von furstenberg she is the head of the council of fashion designers of america and she has told her constituency that she is going to get copyright
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 655.78 658.21 <o,f0,female> and something that 's just part of a global trend
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 658.26 659.96 <o,f0,female> who owns a look
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 660.12 668.5 <o,f0,female> that is a very difficult question to answer it takes lots of lawyers and lots of court time and the retailers decided that would be way too expensive
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 670.57 679.19 <o,f0,female> you know it 's not just the fashion industry that doesn 't have copyright protection there 's a bunch of other industries that don 't have copyright protection including the food industry
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 679.31 689.17 <o,f0,female> you cannot copyright a recipe because it 's a set of instructions it 's fact and you cannot copyright the look and feel of even the most unique dish
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 690.09 697.6 <o,f0,female> same with automobiles it doesn 't matter how wacky they look or how cool they look you cannot copyright the sculptural design
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 697.65 700.1 <o,f0,female> it 's a utilitarian article that 's why
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 704.96 716.52 <o,f0,female> magic tricks i think they 're instructions sort of like recipes no copyright protection hairdos no copyright protection open source software these guys decided they didn 't want copyright protection
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 719.38 725.3 <o,f0,female> it 's really hard to get copyright for databases tattoo artists they don 't want it it 's not cool
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 777.47 782.6 <o,f0,female> they might have to think about this because right now those industries with a lot of copyright protection
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 782.72 789.34 <o,f0,female> are operating in an atmosphere where it 's as if they don 't have any protection and they don 't know what to do
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 791.11 796.8 <o,f0,female> when i found out that there are a whole bunch of industries that didn 't have copyright protection
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 805.8 813.17 <o,f0,female> these are the two main sort of binary oppositions within the logic of copyright law it is more complex than this
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 813.35 818.16 <o,f0,female> first is something an artistic object then it deserves protection
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 818.43 832.83 <o,f0,female> is it a utilitarian object then no it does not deserve protection this is a difficult unstable binary the other one is is it an idea is it something that needs to freely circulate in a free society
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 851.93 858.08 <o,f0,female> nowadays we don 't really recognize a book as something that sits on our shelf
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 879.15 881.2 <o,f0,female> now the conceptual issues are
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 886.06 890.7 <o,f0,female> and let me tell you we don 't want to leave this just to lawyers to figure out they 're smart
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 903.77 915.23 <o,f0,female> in a digital world that 's going to lead to the most innovation and my suggestion is that fashion might be a really good place to start looking for a model for creative industries in the future
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 915.66 918.82 <o,f0,female> if you want more information about this research project
JohannaBlakley_2010X 1 JohannaBlakley_2010X 922.86 925.49 <o,f0,female> and i really want to thank veronica jauriqui for making
