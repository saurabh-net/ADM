CharlesMoore_2009U 1 CharlesMoore_2009U 66.86 80.47 <o,f0,male> now melting point has a lot to do with this plastic is not purified by the re melting process like glass and metal it begins to melt below the boiling point of water and does not drive off oily contaminants for which it is a sponge
CharlesMoore_2009U 1 CharlesMoore_2009U 92.54 103.22 <o,f0,male> to the sea here is the accumulation at biona creek next to the airport and here is the flotsam near california state university long beach and the de sal plant we visited yesterday
CharlesMoore_2009U 1 CharlesMoore_2009U 103.60 112.50 <o,f0,male> in spite of deposit fees much of this trash leading out to the sea will be plastic beverage bottles we use two million of them in the united states every five minutes
CharlesMoore_2009U 1 CharlesMoore_2009U 112.82 120.47 <o,f0,male> here imaged by ted presenter chris jordan who artfully documents mass consumption and zooms in for more detail

CharlesMoore_2009U 1 CharlesMoore_2009U 144.96 154.61 <o,f0,male> are produced in separate factories from a different plastic polypropylene they will float in seawater but unfortunately do not get recycled under the bottle bills
CharlesMoore_2009U 1 CharlesMoore_2009U 168.42 174.69 <o,f0,male> after ten years a lot of the japanese caps are in what we call the eastern garbage patch while ours litter the philippines
CharlesMoore_2009U 1 CharlesMoore_2009U 175.25 185.47 <o,f0,male> after twenty years we see emerging the debris accumulation zone of the north pacific gyre it so happens that millions of albatross nesting on kure and midway atolls

CharlesMoore_2009U 1 CharlesMoore_2009U 200.75 210.60 <o,f0,male> hundreds of thousands of the goose sized chicks are dying with stomachs full of bottle caps and other rubbish like cigarette lighters
CharlesMoore_2009U 1 CharlesMoore_2009U 211.90 218.83 <o,f0,male> but mostly bottle caps sadly their parents mistake bottle caps for food tossing about in the ocean surface
CharlesMoore_2009U 1 CharlesMoore_2009U 219.30 229.32 <o,f0,male> the retainer rings for the caps also have consequences for aquatic animals this is mae west still alive at a zookeeper 's home in new orleans

CharlesMoore_2009U 1 CharlesMoore_2009U 238.24 247.44 <o,f0,male> at the east end of our long beach we cleaned up the swaths of beach shown i offered five cents each for bottle caps i got plenty of takers
CharlesMoore_2009U 1 CharlesMoore_2009U 247.87 256.95 <o,f0,male> here are the one thousand one hundred bottle caps they collected i thought i would spend twenty bucks that day i ended up spending nearly sixty i separated them by color
CharlesMoore_2009U 1 CharlesMoore_2009U 257.17 267.35 <o,f0,male> and put them on display the next earth day at cabrillo marine aquarium in san pedro governor schwarzenegger and his wife maria stopped by to discuss the display in spite of my girly man hat

CharlesMoore_2009U 1 CharlesMoore_2009U 284.53 292.00 <o,f0,male> our ocean has become look like trawling a zooplankton net on the surface for a mile produces samples like this
CharlesMoore_2009U 1 CharlesMoore_2009U 295.24 298.67 <o,f0,male> now when the debris washes up on the beaches of hawaii it looks like this
CharlesMoore_2009U 1 CharlesMoore_2009U 299.41 311.77 <o,f0,male> and this particular beach is kailua beach the beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving to washington now how do we analyze samples like this one that contain more plastic than plankton
CharlesMoore_2009U 1 CharlesMoore_2009U 312.17 326.07 <o,f0,male> we sort the plastic fragments into different size classes from five millimeters to one third of a millimeter small bits of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutants up to a million times their levels in the surrounding seawater
CharlesMoore_2009U 1 CharlesMoore_2009U 326.56 335.41 <o,f0,male> we wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean at the base of the food chain was ingesting these poison pills we did hundreds of necropsies
CharlesMoore_2009U 1 CharlesMoore_2009U 335.82 344.98 <o,f0,male> and over a third had polluted plastic fragments in their stomachs the record holder only two and a half inches long had eighty four pieces in its tiny stomach
