PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 16.68 30.51 <o,f0,female> my work is play and i play when i design i even looked it up in the dictionary to make sure that i actually do that and the definition of play number one was engaging in a childlike activity or endeavor
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 30.90 40.03 <o,f0,female> and number two was gambling and i realize i do both when i'm designing i'm both a kid and i'm gambling all the time
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 40.72 51.20 <o,f0,female> and i think that if you're not there's probably something inherently wrong with the structure or the situation you're in if you're a designer but the serious part is what threw me and i
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 51.67 59.60 <o,f0,female> couldn't quite get a handle on it until i remembered an essay and it's an essay i read thirty years
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 59.96 71.86 <o,f0,female> was written by russell baker who used to write an observer column in the new york times he 's a wonderful humorist and i'm going to read you this essay or an excerpt from it because it
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 72.32 81.65 <o,f0,female> hit home for me here is a letter of friendly advice be serious it says what it means of course is be solemn
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 82.75 95.67 <o,f0,female> being solemn is easy being serious is hard children almost always begin by being serious which is what makes them so entertaining when compared with adults as a class adults on the whole are solemn
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 96.78 109.27 <o,f0,female> in politics the rare candidate who is serious like adlai stevenson is easily overwhelmed by one who is solemn like eisenhower that's because it is hard for most people to recognize seriousness which is rare
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 109.53 119.39 <o,f0,female> but more comfortable to endorse solemnity which is commonplace jogging which is commonplace and widely accepted as good for you is solemn
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 119.98 129.81 <o,f0,female> poker is serious washington d c is solemn new york is serious going to educational conferences to tell you anything about the future
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 130.05 137.74 <o,f0,female> is solemn taking a long walk by yourself during which you devise a foolproof scheme for robbing tiffany 's is serious
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 139.48 146.65 <o,f0,female> now when i apply russell baker 's definition of solemnity or seriousness to design it doesn't necessarily make any particular point about quality
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 147.18 152.09 <o,f0,female> solemn design is often important and very effective design solemn design is also socially correct
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 152.52 162.41 <o,f0,female> and is accepted by appropriate audiences it's what right thinking designers and all the clients are striving for serious design serious play is something else
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 163.12 167.76 <o,f0,female> for one thing it often happens spontaneously intuitively
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 168.29 178.84 <o,f0,female> accidentally or incidentally it can be achieved out of innocence or arrogance or out of selfishness sometimes out of carelessness but mostly it's achieved through all those kind of crazy
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 190.82 197.80 <o,f0,female> often quite unsuccessful from the solemn point of view that's because the art of serious play is about invention change
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 198.32 205.99 <o,f0,female> not perfection perfection happens during solemn play now i always saw design careers
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 216.23 233.28 <o,f0,female> are very short and you make huge discoveries you sort of leap up very quickly in your youth that's because you don't know anything and you have a lot to learn and so that anything you do is a learning experience and you're just jumping right up there as you get older the risers get shallower and the steps get wider
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 233.82 246.48 <o,f0,female> and you start moving along at a slower pace because you're making fewer discoveries and as you get older and more decrepit you sort of inch along on this sort of depressing long staircase leading you into oblivion
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 248.99 258.02 <o,f0,female> i find it's actually getting really hard to be serious i'm hired to be solemn but i find more and more that i'm solemn when i don't have to be
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 282.48 292.77 <o,f0,female> and what the way i looked at design and the way i looked at the world was what was going on around me and the things that came at the time i walked into design were the enemy
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 293.49 299.58 <o,f0,female> i really really really hated the typeface helvetica i thought the typeface helvetica
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 309.23 327.11 <o,f0,female> when i was in my college days this was the sort of design that was fashionable and popular this is actually quite a lovely book jacket by rudi de harra but i just hated it because it was designed with helvetica and i made parodies about it i just thought it was you know completely boring
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 329.58 339.74 <o,f0,female> so so my goal in life was to do stuff that wasn't made out of helvetica and to do stuff that wasn't made out of helvetica was actually kind of hard because you had to find
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 340.62 353.54 <o,f0,female> and there weren't a lot of books about the history of design in the early seventies there weren't there wasn't a plethora of design publishing you actually had to go to antique stores you had to go to europe you had to go places and find the stuff and what i responded to
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 353.96 359.64 <o,f0,female> you know art nouveau or deco or victorian typography
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 359.77 370.11 <o,f0,female> or things that were just completely not helvetica and i taught myself design this way and this was sort of my early years and i used these things
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 370.52 383.50 <o,f0,female> in really goofy ways on record covers and in my design i wasn't educated i just sort of put these things together i mixed up victorian designs with pop and i mixed up art nouveau with something else
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 397.52 407.42 <o,f0,female> kind of passion drove me into very serious play a kind of play i could never do now because i'm too well educated and there's
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 410.17 417.79 <o,f0,female> form of youth where you can let yourself grow and play and be really a brat
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 418.17 427.60 <o,f0,female> and then accomplish things by the end of the seventies actually the stuff became known i mean these covers appeared all over the world and they started winning awards and
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 428.36 440.93 <o,f0,female> people knew them and i was suddenly a post modernist and i began a career as in my own business and first i was praised for it then criticized for it but the fact of the matter was i had become solemn
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 441.58 454.01 <o,f0,female> i didn't do what i think was a piece of serious work again for about fourteen years i spent most of the eighties being quite solemn turning out these sorts of designs that i was expected to do because
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 454.17 461.24 <o,f0,female> that's who i was and i was living in this cycle of going from serious to solemn to hackneyed to dead and getting rediscovered all over
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 463.36 470.42 <o,f0,female> so here was the second condition for which i think i accomplished some serious play
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 471.83 482.38 <o,f0,female> paul newman movie that i love called the verdict i don't know how many of you have seen it but it's a beaut and in the movie he plays a down and out lawyer who 's become an ambulance
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 483.25 489.79 <o,f0,female> and he 's taken on he 's given actually a malpractice suit to handle that's sort of an easy deal
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 490.29 501.37 <o,f0,female> and in the midst of trying to connect the deal he starts to empathize and identify with his client and he regains his morality and purpose and he goes on to win the case
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 502.00 516.36 <o,f0,female> and in the depth of despair in the midst of the movie when it looks like he can't pull this thing off and he needs this case he needs to win this case so badly there's a shot of paul newman alone in his office
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 517.28 523.93 <o,f0,female> saying this is the case there are no other cases this is the case there are no other cases
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 524.26 528.09 <o,f0,female> and in that moment of desire and focus
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 540.34 552.11 <o,f0,female> a theater director named george wolf who was going to have me design an identity for the new york shakespeare festival then known and then became the public theater
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 552.64 566.56 <o,f0,female> and i began getting immersed in this project in a way i never was before this is what theater advertising looked like at that time this is what was in the newspapers and in the new york times so this is sort of a comment on the time
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 567.08 574.66 <o,f0,female> and the public theater actually had much better advertising than this they had no logo and no identity but they had these very iconic
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 575.11 584.85 <o,f0,female> posters painted by paul davis and george wolf had taken over from another director and he wanted to change the theater and he wanted to make it urban and loud and
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 585.20 587.01 <o,f0,female> place that was inclusive
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 596.88 610.53 <o,f0,female> was that i really became the voice the visual voice of a place in a way i had never done before where every aspect the smallest ad the ticket whatever it was was designed by me there was no format
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 610.91 620.91 <o,f0,female> there was no in house department that these things were pushed to i literally for three years made everything every scrap of paper everything online that this theater did
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 621.56 633.17 <o,f0,female> and it was the only job even though i was doing other jobs i lived and breathed it in a way i haven't with a client since it enabled me to really express myself and grow
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 633.45 643.37 <o,f0,female> and i think that you know when you're going to be given this position and it's rare but when you get it and you have this opportunity it's the moment of serious play
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 643.85 653.34 <o,f0,female> i did these things and i still do them i still work for the public theater i'm on their board and i still am involved with it the
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 663.01 673.82 <o,f0,female> but something happened to it and what happened to it was it became very popular and that is a kiss of death for something serious because it makes it solemn
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 674.46 680.62 <o,f0,female> and what happened was identity that new york city to a degree ate my identity
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 681.47 689.17 <o,f0,female> because people began to copy it here 's an ad in the new york times somebody did for a play called mind games
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 690.03 698.91 <o,f0,female> then chicago came out used some more graphics and the public theater 's identity was just totally eaten and taken away which meant i had to change it
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 699.22 710.75 <o,f0,female> so i changed it so that every season was different and i continued to do these posters but they never had the seriousness of the first identity because they were too individual and they didn't have
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 711.52 714.45 <o,f0,female> of everything being the same thing
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 714.96 724.72 <o,f0,female> now and i think since the public theater i must have done more than a dozen cultural identities for major institutions and i don't think i ever i ever grasped
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 724.84 732.23 <o,f0,female> that seriousness again i do them for very big important institutions in new york city the institutions are solemn
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 733.18 742.08 <o,f0,female> and so is the design they're better crafted than the public theater was and they spend more money on them but i think that that moment comes and goes
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 742.20 751.17 <o,f0,female> the best way to accomplish serious design which i think we all have the opportunity to do is to be totally and completely unqualified for the job
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 751.61 760.74 <o,f0,female> that doesn't happen very often but it happened to me in the year two thousand when for some reason or another a whole pile of different architects started to ask me to design
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 761.34 769.14 <o,f0,female> the insides of theaters with them where i would take environmental graphics and work them into buildings i'd never done this kind of work before i didn't know how to read
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 769.66 780.38 <o,f0,female> an architectural plan i didn't know what they were talking about and i really couldn't handle the fact that a job a single job could go on for four years because i was used to immediacy in graphic design
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 780.67 787.07 <o,f0,female> and that kind of attention to detail was really bad for somebody like me with add so it was a rough it was a rough
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 788.18 796.34 <o,f0,female> but i fell in love with this process of actually integrating graphics into architecture because i didn't know what i was
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 796.64 810.34 <o,f0,female> doing i said why can't the signage be on the floor new yorkers look at their feet and then i found that actors and actresses actually take their cues from the floor so it turned out that these sorts of sign systems began to make sense
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 810.92 817.43 <o,f0,female> they integrated with the building in really peculiar ways they ran around corners they went up sides of buildings
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 818.32 826.40 <o,f0,female> and they melded into the architecture this is symphony space on ninetieth street and broadway and the type is interwoven into the stainless steel and
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 827.67 835.60 <o,f0,female> with fiber optics and the architect jim polshek essentially gave me a canvas to play typography out
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 836.39 843.91 <o,f0,female> and it was serious play this is the children 's museum in pittsburgh pennsylvania made out of completely inexpensive materials
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 863.73 874.25 <o,f0,female> i think my favorite of these was this little job in newark new jersey it's a performing arts school this is the building that they had no money and they had to recast it
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 874.45 883.80 <o,f0,female> and they said if we give you one hundred thousand dollars what can you do with it and i did a little photoshop job on it and i said well i think we can paint it and we did
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 893.86 896.04 <o,f0,female> i hired guys who paint flats
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 913.32 925.92 <o,f0,female> was quite wonderful by the time i did bloomberg 's headquarters my work had begun to become accepted people wanted it in big expensive places and that began to make it solemn
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 926.57 936.59 <o,f0,female> bloomberg was all about numbers and we did big numbers through the space and the numbers were projected on a spectacular led that my partner lisa strausfeld
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 937.87 944.88 <o,f0,female> but it became the end of the seriousness of the play and it started to once again become solemn
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 945.32 955.05 <o,f0,female> this is a current project in pittsburgh pennsylvania where i got to be goofy i was invited to design a logo for this neighborhood called the north
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 955.27 968.97 <o,f0,female> side and i thought it was silly for a neighborhood to have a logo i think that's rather creepy actually why would a neighborhood have a logo a neighborhood has a thing it's got a landmark it's got a place it's got a restaurant it doesn't have a logo i mean what would that be so i had to actually give
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 970.28 983.41 <o,f0,female> to a city council and neighborhood constituents and i went to pittsburgh and i said you know really what you have here are all these underpasses that separate the neighborhood from the center of town
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 984.04 995.06 <o,f0,female> why don't you celebrate them and make the underpasses landmarks so i began doing this crazy presentation of these installations potential installations on
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 995.55 1002.64 <o,f0,female> these underpass bridges and stood up in front of the city council and was a little bit scared i have to admit
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1003.35 1011.16 <o,f0,female> but i was so utterly unqualified for this project and so utterly ridiculous and ignored the brief
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1011.73 1020.30 <o,f0,female> so desperately that i think they just embraced it with wholeheartedness just completely because it was so goofy to begin with
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1020.76 1029.93 <o,f0,female> and this is the bridge they're actually painting up and preparing as we speak it will change every six months and it will become an art installation in the north side of pittsburgh
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1030.28 1038.17 <o,f0,female> and it will probably become a landmark in the area john hockenberry told you a bit about my travail with citibank
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1039.09 1049.09 <o,f0,female> that is now a ten year relationship and i still work with them and i actually am amused by them and like them and think that as a very very very very very big corporation they actually
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1049.65 1057.88 <o,f0,female> keep their graphics very nice i drew the logo for citibank on a napkin in the first meeting that was the play part of the job
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1058.37 1063.40 <o,f0,female> and then i spent a year going to long
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1074.34 1082.81 <o,f0,female> showing how the citi logo made sense and how it was really derived from an umbrella and we made animations of these things and we came back and forth and back and forth and back and forth
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1083.44 1091.26 <o,f0,female> and it was worth it because they bought this thing and it played out on such a grand scale and it's so internationally recognizable
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1091.98 1105.20 <o,f0,female> but for me it was actually a very very depressing year as a matter of fact they actually never bought onto the logo until fallon put it on its very good live richly campaign and then everybody accepted it all over the world
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1105.98 1119.77 <o,f0,female> so during this time i needed some kind of counterbalance for this crazy crazy existence of going to these long idiotic meetings and i was up in my country house and for some reason i began painting these very
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1120.57 1133.48 <o,f0,female> very involved laborious complicated maps of the entire world and listing every place on the planet and putting them in and misspelling them and putting things in the wrong spot and completely controlling the information
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1141.69 1157.32 <o,f0,female> here 's the united states every single city of the united states is on here and it hung for about eight months at the cooper hewitt and people walked up to it and they would point to a part of the map and they'd say oh i've been here and of course they couldn't have been because it's in the wrong spot
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1170.51 1174.30 <o,f0,female> one of my favorites was this painting i did of florida after the two
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1174.51 1180.44 <o,f0,female> thousand election that has the election results rolling around in the water i keep that for evidence
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1182.83 1193.37 <o,f0,female> somebody was up at my house and saw the paintings and recommended them to a gallery and i had a first show about two and a half years ago and i showed these paintings that
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1194.28 1199.14 <o,f0,female> i'm showing you now and then a funny thing happened they sold
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1209.37 1216.77 <o,f0,female> one from the series this is a print from the united states which we did in red white and blue we began doing these big silkscreen prints
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1225.72 1234.70 <o,f0,female> that i really had to paint these paintings much faster than i had ever done them and i they started to become more political and i picked
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1235.16 1251.53 <o,f0,female> areas that sort of were in the news or that i had some feeling about and i began doing these things and then this funny thing happened i found that i was no longer at play i was actually in this solemn landscape of fulfilling an expectation
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1251.68 1259.91 <o,f0,female> for a show which is not where i started with these things so while they became successful i know how to make them
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1260.22 1266.69 <o,f0,female> so i'm not a neophyte and they're no longer serious they have become solemn
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1267.80 1279.39 <o,f0,female> and that's a terrifying factor when you start something and it turns that way because it means that all that's left for you is to go back and to find out what the next thing is
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1279.58 1287.28 <o,f0,female> that you can push that you can invent that you can be ignorant about that you can be arrogant about that you can fail with
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1287.97 1302.74 <o,f0,female> and that you can be a fool with because in the end that's how you grow and that's all that matters so i'm plugging along here and i'm just going to have to blow up the staircase thank you very much
