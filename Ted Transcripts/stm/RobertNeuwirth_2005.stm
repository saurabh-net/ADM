RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 27.76 36.99 <o,f0,male> this is the squatter community in sanjay gandhi national park in bombay india what's called mumbai these days this is hosinia
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 37.71 46.46 <o,f0,male> the largest and most urbanized favela in rio de janeiro and this is sultanbelyi which is one of the largest squatter communities in
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 50.62 60.84 <o,f0,male> they are what i consider to be the cities of tomorrow the new urban world now why do i say that to tell you about that i have to talk about this fellow here his name is julius
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 61.40 69.96 <o,f0,male> and i met julius the last week that i was living in kibera so i had been there almost three months
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 70.49 81.69 <o,f0,male> and i was touring around the city going to different squatter areas and julius was tagging along and he was bug eyed and at certain points we were walking around he grabbed my hand for support
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 81.93 92.28 <o,f0,male> which is something most kenyans would never consider doing they're very polite and they don't get so forward so quickly and i found out later that it was julius first
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 92.56 96.07 <o,f0,female> day in nairobi and
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 97.18 107.14 <o,f0,male> he 's one of many so close to two hundred thousand people a day migrate from the rural to the urban areas
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 108.97 115.85 <o,f0,male> and i'm going to be fair to the statisticians who talked this morning not almost one point five million people a week but almost one point four million people a week
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 116.10 123.55 <o,f0,male> but i'm a journalist and we exaggerate so almost one point five million people a week close to seventy million people a year
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 124.14 133.75 <o,f0,male> and if you do the math that's one hundred and thirty people every minute so that'll be in the eighteen minutes that i'm given to talk here between two and three thousand people will have journeyed
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 150.93 159.06 <o,f0,male> better than one in three people on earth so these are the cities of the future
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 160.05 160.42 <o,f0,female> and
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 162.30 170.98 <o,f0,male> we have to engage them and i was thinking this morning of the good life and before i show you the rest of my
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 179.98 189.51 <o,f0,male> because i think it says something about reversing our perception of what we think the good life is
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 191.51 203.33 <o,f0,male> so the hut was made of corrugated metal set on a concrete pad it was a ten by ten cell armstrong o 'brian jr shared it with three other men
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 215.54 224.91 <o,f0,male> they did have electricity but it was illegal service tapped from someone else's wires and could only power one feeble bulb this was southland
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 225.09 234.01 <o,f0,male> a small shanty community on the western side of nairobi kenya but it could 've been anywhere in the city because more than half the city of nairobi lives like this
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 234.26 241.26 <o,f0,male> one point five million people stuffed into mud or metal huts with no services no toilets no rights
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 254.15 262.27 <o,f0,male> in case you owe one month the landlord will come with his henchmen and bundle you out he will confiscate your things armstrong said not one month one day
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 262.67 271.78 <o,f0,male> his roommate hilary kibagendi onsomu who was cooking ugali the spongy white cornmeal concoction that is the staple food in the country cut into the conversation
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 272.10 278.58 <o,f0,male> they called their landlord a wabenzi meaning that he is a person who has enough money to drive a mercedes benz
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 292.57 307.29 <o,f0,male> put on a wool sports jacket and we headed out into the glare outside a mound of garbage formed the border between southland and the adjacent legal neighborhood of langata it was perhaps eight feet tall forty feet long and ten feet wide
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 333.91 335.23 <o,f0,male> squatted and
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 336.44 347.94 <o,f0,male> the flies buzzed hungrily around his legs when twenty families one hundred people or so share a single latrine a boy pooping on a garbage pile is perhaps no big thing
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 348.40 355.92 <o,f0,male> but it stood in jarring contrast to something armstrong had said as we were eating that he treasured the quality of life in his neighborhood
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 356.11 368.81 <o,f0,male> for armstrong southland wasn't constrained by its material conditions instead the human spirit radiated out from the metal walls and garbage heaps to offer something no legal neighborhood could
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 369.55 379.20 <o,f0,male> freedom this place is very addictive he had said it 's a simple life but nobody is restricting you nobody is controlling what you do
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 379.64 388.25 <o,f0,male> once you have stayed here you cannot go back he meant back beyond that mountain of trash back in the legal city of legal buildings
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 388.39 396.37 <o,f0,male> with legal leases and legal rights once you have stayed here he said you can stay for the rest of your life
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 413.26 423.31 <o,f0,male> this is getting ready for the monsoon in bombay india this is home improvement putting plastic tarps on your roof this is
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 423.73 435.13 <o,f0,male> in rio de janeiro and it's getting a bit better right we're seeing scavenged terra cotta tile and little pieces of signs and plaster over the brick some color
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 435.75 443.84 <o,f0,male> and this is sulay montakaya 's house in sultanbelyi and it's getting even better he 's got a fence he scavenged a door he 's got new
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 451.52 460.57 <o,f0,male> here are multi story they develop you can see on the far right one where it seems to just stack on top of each other room after room after room
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 461.06 468.02 <o,f0,male> and what people do is they develop their home on one or two stories and they sell their loggia or roof rights
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 468.34 477.35 <o,f0,male> and someone else builds on top of their building and then that person sells the roof rights and someone else builds on top of their building all of these buildings are made out of reinforced concrete and brick
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 489.83 498.27 <o,f0,male> on their roofs but the green building on behind you can see that the top floor is not occupied so people are building with the possibility of expansion
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 498.62 508.33 <o,f0,male> and it's built to a pretty high standard of design and then you finally get squatter homes like this which is built on the suburban model hey that's a single family home in the squatter community
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 518.16 529.50 <o,f0,male> that runs through it lots of people out on the street these communities in these cities are actually more vital than the illegal communities they have more things going on in them this is a typical pathway in
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 546.08 557.85 <o,f0,male> these becos are normally very crowded and people hump furniture up them or refrigerators up them all sorts of things beer is all carried in on your shoulders beer is a very important thing in brazil
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 558.86 567.76 <o,f0,male> this is commerce in kenya right along the train tracks so close to the train tracks that the merchants sometimes have to pull the merchandise out of the way
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 568.74 577.75 <o,f0,male> this is a marketplace also in kenya toi market lots of dealers in almost everything you want to buy those green things in the foreground are mangoes
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 578.33 592.03 <o,f0,male> this is a shopping street in kibera and you can see that there's a soda dealer a health clinic two beauty salons a bar two grocery stores and a church and more it's a typical
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 603.03 613.13 <o,f0,male> and what hotel means in kenya and india is an eating place so that's a restaurant people steal electrical power this is rio
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 613.65 627.47 <o,f0,male> people tap in and they have thieves who are called grillos or crickets and they steal the electrical power and wire the neighborhood people burn trash to get rid of the garbage
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 628.11 637.71 <o,f0,male> and they dig their own sewer channels talk about more plastic bags than plankton and sometimes they have natural trash disposal
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 638.83 649.81 <o,f0,male> and when they have more money they cement their streets and they put in sewers and good water pipes and stuff like that this is water going to rio people run their water
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 659.15 668.28 <o,f0,male> houses so the question is how do you go from the mud hut village to the more developed city
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 668.88 678.63 <o,f0,male> to the even highly developed sultanbelyi i say there are two things one is people need a guarantee they won 't be evicted that does not necessarily mean property rights and i would disagree with
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 680.07 692.50 <o,f0,male> on that question because property rights create a lot of complications they're most often sold to people and people then wind up in debt and have to pay back the debt and sometimes have to sell their property in order to pay back the debt
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 701.95 714.16 <o,f0,male> and that can mean two things that can mean community organizing from below but it can also mean possibilities from above and i say that because the system in turkey is
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 724.90 732.38 <o,f0,male> in turkey you can't be evicted without due process of law if they don't catch you during the night and the second aspect is
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 741.12 749.16 <o,f0,male> and when you're a legal sub municipality you suddenly have politics you're allowed to have an elected government collect taxes provide municipal services and that's exactly what they
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 750.29 760.75 <o,f0,male> so these are the civic leaders of the future the woman in the center is geeta jiwa she lives in one of those tents on the highway median in mumbai
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 770.25 778.28 <o,f0,male> this woman is nine which means grandma in turkish and there were three old ladies who lived in that's her self built house behind her and
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 788.83 798.18 <o,f0,male> he makes money taking pictures of the neighborhood and the people in the neighborhood and is a great resource in the community and finally my choice to run for mayor of rio
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 798.66 806.09 <o,f0,male> is cezinio the fruit merchant with his two kids here and a more honest and giving and caring man i don't know
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 806.28 813.68 <o,f0,male> the future of these communities is in the people and in our ability to work with those people so i think
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 814.08 823.31 <o,f0,male> the message i take from what i read from the book from what armstrong said and from all these people is that these are neighborhoods the issue is not urban poverty the issue is not
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 823.70 831.04 <o,f0,male> the larger over arching thing the issue is for us to recognize that these are neighborhoods this is a legitimate form of urban development and
RobertNeuwirth_2005 1 RobertNeuwirth_2005 831.39 838.52 <o,f0,male> that cities have to engage these residents because they are building the cities of the future thank you very much
