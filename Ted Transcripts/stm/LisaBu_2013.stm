LisaBu_2013 1 LisaBu_2013 12.98 25.77 <o,f0,female> i was trained to become a gymnast for two years in hunan china in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s when i was in the first grade the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes all expenses paid
LisaBu_2013 1 LisaBu_2013 26.03 44.06 <o,f0,female> but my tiger mother said no my parents wanted me to become an engineer like them after surviving the cultural revolution they firmly believed there 's only one sure way to happiness a safe and well paid job it is not important if i like the job or not
LisaBu_2013 1 LisaBu_2013 44.55 47.22 <o,f0,female> but my dream was to become

LisaBu_2013 1 LisaBu_2013 71.75 77.05 <o,f0,female> only my friends supported me but they were kids just as powerless as i was

LisaBu_2013 1 LisaBu_2013 158.04 164 <o,f0,female> but the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany you shall honor your father and mother
LisaBu_2013 1 LisaBu_2013 173.31 176.94 <o,f0,female> and to restart my relationship with my parents
LisaBu_2013 1 LisaBu_2013 189.04 198.27 <o,f0,female> because this is what chinese students grew up with it had never occurred to me china doesn 't have to be at the center of the world
