RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 13.24 16.53 <o,f0,female> talk dirty
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 16.79 21.95 <o,f0,female> a few years ago oddly enough i needed the bathroom
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 35.43 42.79 <o,f0,female> and for some reason that day instead i asked myself a question and it was where does this stuff
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 43.57 48.88 <o,f0,female> and with that question i found myself plunged into the world
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 65.64 68.37 <o,f0,female> to go back to that toilet
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 80.9 90 <o,f0,female> but it had a lockable door it had privacy it had water it had soap so i could wash my hands and i did because i 'm a woman and we do that
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 96.05 113.04 <o,f0,female> but that day when i asked that question i learned something and that was that i 'd grown up thinking that a toilet like that was my right when in fact it 's a privilege two point five billion people worldwide have no adequate toilet they don 't have
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 113.07 115.02 <o,f0,female> a bucket or a box
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 115.29 118.46 <o,f0,female> forty percent of the world with no adequate toilet
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 133.2 136.87 <o,f0,female> and every day probably that guy in the picture walks on by
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 137.55 142.21 <o,f0,female> because he sees that little boy but he doesn 't see him but he should
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 142.38 144.8 <o,f0,female> because the problem with all that poop lying around
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 145.51 152.65 <o,f0,female> is that poop carries passengers fifty communicable diseases like to travel in human shit
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 153.11 161.9 <o,f0,female> all those things the eggs the cysts the bacteria the viruses all those can travel in one gram of human feces
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 179.81 185.56 <o,f0,female> in what i call the flushed and plumbed world that most of us in this room are lucky to live in
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 185.73 198.64 <o,f0,female> the most common symptoms associated with those diseases diarrhea is now a bit of a joke it 's the runs the hershey squirts the squits where i come from we call it delhi belly as a legacy of empire
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 198.67 212.74 <o,f0,female> but if you search for a stock photo of diarrhea in a leading photo image agency this is the picture that you come up with laughter still not sure about the bikini
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 215.58 220.39 <o,f0,female> and here 's another image of diarrhea this is marie saylee nine months old
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 221.11 225.81 <o,f0,female> you can 't see her because she 's buried under that green grass in a little village in liberia
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 225.88 228.79 <o,f0,female> because she died in three days from diarrhea
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 229.48 232.63 <o,f0,female> the hershey squirts the runs a joke
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 241.5 243.11 <o,f0,female> and they do every day
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 244.24 248.12 <o,f0,female> diarrhea is the second biggest killer of children worldwide
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 249.31 254.31 <o,f0,female> and you 've probably been asked to care about things like hiv aids or t b or measles
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 259.47 264.41 <o,f0,female> it 's a very potent weapon of mass destruction
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 264.41 282.18 <o,f0,female> and the cost to the world is immense two hundred and sixty billion dollars lost every year on the losses to poor sanitation these are cholera beds in haiti you 'll have heard of cholera but we don 't hear about diarrhea it gets a fraction of the attention and funding given to any of those other diseases
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 282.18 284.99 <o,f0,female> but we know
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 289.8 296.44 <o,f0,female> wonderful victorian engineers installed systems of sewers and wastewater treatment and the flush toilet
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 296.44 316.4 <o,f0,female> and disease dropped dramatically child mortality dropped by the most it had ever dropped in history the flush toilet was voted the best medical advance of the last two hundred years by the readers of the british medical journal and they were choosing over the pill anesthesia and surgery it 's a wonderful waste disposal device
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 333.72 338.86 <o,f0,female> because i can 't explain otherwise when i look at the figures what 's going on
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 339.43 346.36 <o,f0,female> we know how to solve diarrhea and sanitation but if you look at the budgets of countries developing and developed
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 346.82 350.26 <o,f0,female> you 'll think there 's something wrong with the math because
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 350.26 362.42 <o,f0,female> you 'll expect absurdities like pakistan spending forty seven times more on its military than it does on water and sanitation even though one hundred and fifty thousand children die of diarrhea in pakistan every year
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 381.17 384 <o,f0,female> think about it that little boy who 's running back into his house
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 384.37 390.15 <o,f0,female> he may have a nice clean fresh water supply but he 's got dirty hands that he 's going to contaminate his water supply with
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 390.87 405.91 <o,f0,female> and i think that the real waste of human waste is that we are wasting it as a resource and as an incredible trigger for development because these are a few things that toilets and poop itself can do for us
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 405.91 415.63 <o,f0,female> so a toilet can put a girl back in school twenty five percent of girls in india drop out of school because they have no adequate sanitation
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 415.63 422.74 <o,f0,female> they 've been used to sitting through lessons for years and years holding it in we 've all done that but they do it every day
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 423.26 427.97 <o,f0,female> and when they hit puberty and they start menstruating it just gets too much
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 452.37 461.45 <o,f0,female> in rwanda they are now getting seventy five percent of their cooking fuel in their prison system from the contents of prisoners bowels
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 478.29 480.67 <o,f0,female> it gives off gas and you can cook with it
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 481.47 499.18 <o,f0,female> and you might think it 's just good karma to see these guys stirring shit but it 's also good economic sense because they 're saving a million dollars a year they 're cutting down on deforestation and they 've found a fuel supply that is inexhaustible infinite and free at the point of production
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 500.37 503.45 <o,f0,female> it 's not just in the poor world that poop can save lives
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 537.11 538.93 <o,f0,female> maybe it 's the ick factor
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 539.12 551.61 <o,f0,female> that 's okay because there 's a team of research scientists in canada who have now created a stool sample a fake stool sample which is called repoopulate so you 'd be thinking by now okay the solution 's simple we give everyone a toilet
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 551.66 557.68 <o,f0,female> and this is where it gets really interesting because it 's not that simple because we are not simple so
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 557.94 567.18 <o,f0,female> the really interesting exciting work this is the engaging bit in sanitation is that we need to understand human psychology we need to understand
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 587.41 595.15 <o,f0,female> so the idea is to manipulate human emotion it 's been done for decades the soap companies did it in the early twentieth century
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 595.39 613.92 <o,f0,female> they tried selling soap as healthy no one bought it they tried selling it as sexy everyone bought it in india now there 's a campaign which persuades young brides not to marry into families that don 't have a toilet it 's called no loo no i do
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 648.03 657.15 <o,f0,female> and she was scared she was scared of drunks hanging around she was scared of snakes she was scared of rape after three days she did an unthinkable thing she left
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 657.18 664.52 <o,f0,female> and if you know anything about rural india you 'll know that 's an unspeakably courageous thing to do but not just that she got her toilet
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 664.77 674.42 <o,f0,female> and now she goes around all the other villages in india persuading other women to do the same thing it 's what i call social contagion and it 's really powerful and really exciting
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 674.42 686.24 <o,f0,female> another version of this another village in india near where priyanka lives is this village called lakara and about a year ago it had no toilets whatsoever kids were dying of diarrhea and cholera
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 701.68 706.8 <o,f0,female> not only that but they were ingesting their neighbors shit that 's what really made them change their behavior
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 719.63 727.93 <o,f0,female> so when i get despondent about the state of sanitation even though these are pretty exciting times because we 've got the bill and melinda gates foundation
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 727.93 738.22 <o,f0,female> reinventing the toilet which is great we 've got matt damon going on bathroom strike which is great for humanity very bad for his colon but there are things to worry about
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 740.93 746.8 <o,f0,female> it 's about fifty or so years off track we 're not going to meet targets providing people with sanitation at this rate
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 747.59 750.9 <o,f0,female> so when i get sad about sanitation
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 764.43 776.22 <o,f0,female> they have in built bidet nozzles for a lovely hands free cleaning experience and they have various other features like a heated seat and an automatic lid raising device which is known as the marriage saver
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 793.29 798.04 <o,f0,female> i hope that we can do that it 's not a difficult thing to do
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 798.42 800.23 <o,f0,female> all we really need to do
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 802.27 803.83 <o,f0,female> as the urgent
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 803.86 806.34 <o,f0,female> shameful issue that it is
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 806.56 810.82 <o,f0,female> and don 't think that it 's just in the poor world that things are wrong our sewers are crumbling
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 811.36 813.19 <o,f0,female> things are going wrong here too
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 813.94 821.88 <o,f0,female> the solution to all of this is pretty easy i 'm going to make your lives easy this afternoon and just ask you to do one thing and that 's to go out
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 822.67 825.89 <o,f0,female> protest speak about the unspeakable
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 826.08 827.62 <o,f0,female> and talk shit
RoseGeorge_2013 1 RoseGeorge_2013 827.84 829.81 <o,f0,female> thank you
