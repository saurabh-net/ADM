BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 12.57 20.23 <o,f0,male> what i'd like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world i'm not going to talk about the skeptical environmentalist probably that's also a good choice
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 21.20 33.55 <o,f0,male> but i am going talk about what are the big problems in the world and i must say before i go on i should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because i'm actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that so get out your pen and paper
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 33.85 42.06 <o,f0,male> bottom line is there is a lot of problems out there in the world i'm just going to list some of them there are eight hundred million people starving there's a billion people without clean drinking water
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 53.15 58.56 <o,f0,male> change so on there are many many problems out there in an ideal world we would solve
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 59.60 68.12 <o,f0,male> but we don 't we don't actually solve all problems and if we do not the question i think we need to ask ourselves and that's why it's on the economy session
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 80.64 87.46 <o,f0,male> to spend to do good in this world where should we spend it we identified ten of the biggest challenges in the world
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 87.98 95.25 <o,f0,male> just briefly read them climate change communicable diseases conflicts education financial instability governance and corruption malnutrition and hunger
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 104.07 112.99 <o,f0,male> the obvious question would be to ask what do you think are the biggest things where should we start on solving these problems but that's a wrong problem to ask that was actually the problem
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 113.90 119.54 <o,f0,male> in davos in january but of course there's a problem in asking people to focus on problems because
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 138.30 145.32 <o,f0,male> to communicable diseases it might be health clinics or mosquito nets to conflicts it would be u n s peacekeeping forces and so on
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 145.73 159.40 <o,f0,male> the point that i would like to ask you to try to do is just in thirty seconds and i know this is in a sense an impossible task write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities and also and that 's of course where economics gets evil
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 159.76 173.41 <o,f0,male> to put down what are the things we should not do first what should be at the bottom of the list please just take thirty seconds perhaps talk to your neighbor and just figure out what should be the top priorities and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have to the world 's biggest issues
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 173.77 180.51 <o,f0,male> the amazing part of this process and of course i mean i would love to i only have eighteen minutes i've already given you quite a substantial amount of my
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 189.05 191.23 <o,f0,male> these discussions afterwards to think about
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 191.79 201.93 <o,f0,male> how do we actually prioritize of course you have to ask yourself why on earth was such a list never done before and one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 212.53 221.95 <o,f0,male> spots on the list than there is number ones it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list we've had the u n for almost sixty years yet we've never actually made
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 222.31 230.29 <o,f0,male> a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world and said which of them should we do first so it doesn't mean
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 230.65 241.91 <o,f0,male> that we are not prioritizing any decision is a prioritization so of course we are still prioritizing if only implicitly and that's unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the prioritization and went in and talked about
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 242.21 250.54 <o,f0,male> so what i'm proposing is really to say that we have for a very long time had a situation when we've had a menu of choices there are many many things we can do out there
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 251.41 260.65 <o,f0,male> not had the prices nor the sizes we have not had an idea imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card but you have no idea what the price is you know you
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 260.85 269.94 <o,f0,male> have a pizza you've no idea what the price is it could be at one dollar it could be one thousand dollars it could be a family size pizza it could be a very individual size pizza right we'd like to know these things
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 270.21 278.16 <o,f0,male> and that is what the copenhagen consensus is really trying to do to try to put prices on these issues and so basically this has been the copenhagen consensus process
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 278.42 286.36 <o,f0,male> we got thirty of the world 's best economists three in each area so we have three of world 's top economists write about climate change what can we do
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 287.19 295.51 <o,f0,male> what will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that likewise in communicable diseases three of the world 's top experts saying what can we do what would be the price
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 296.04 301.70 <o,f0,male> what should we do about it and what will be the outcome and so on then we had some of the world 's top economists
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 302.60 310.94 <o,f0,male> of the world 's top economists including three nobel laureates meet in copenhagen in may two thousand and four we called them the dream team the cambridge university
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 312.98 323.38 <o,f0,male> call them the real madrid of economics that works very well in europe but it doesn't really work over here and what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list and then you ask why economists
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 323.80 334.56 <o,f0,male> and of course i'm very happy you asked that question because that's a very good question the point is of course if you want to know about malaria you ask a malaria expert if you want to know about climate you ask a climatologist
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 334.80 344.19 <o,f0,male> but if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first you can't ask either of them because that's not what they do that is what economists do they prioritize they make that
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 345.21 350.15 <o,f0,male> in some ways disgusting task of saying which one should we do first and which one should we do afterwards
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 350.54 361.05 <o,f0,male> so this is the list and this is the one i'd like to share with you of course you can also see it on the website and we'll also talk about it more i'm sure as the day goes on they basically came up with a list where they said there were
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 363.02 375.60 <o,f0,male> projects where if you invest a dollar you get less than a dollar back then there's fair projects good projects and very good projects and of course it's the very good projects we should start doing i'm going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 379.08 387.72 <o,f0,male> as you might see the bottom of the list was climate change this offends a lot of people and that's probably one of the things where people will say i shouldn 't come back
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 399.33 409.88 <o,f0,male> reason why they came up with saying that kyoto or doing something more than kyoto is a bad deal is simply because it's very inefficient it's not saying that global warming is not happening it's not saying that it's not a big problem but it's saying
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 410.27 413.93 <o,f0,male> that what we can do about it is very little at a very high cost
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 414.96 423.16 <o,f0,male> what they basically show us the average of all macroeconomic models is that kyoto if everyone agreed would cost about one hundred and fifty billion dollars a year
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 423.86 433.14 <o,f0,male> that's a substantial amount of money that's two to three times the global development aid that we give the third world every year yet it would do very little good all models show it will postpone warming
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 442.39 452.90 <o,f0,male> so the idea here really is to say well we've spent a lot of money doing a little good and just to give you a sense of reference the u n actually estimate that for half that amount for about seventy five billion dollars a year
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 453.21 461.73 <o,f0,male> we could solve all major basic problems in the world we could give clean drinking water sanitation basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 462.30 466.46 <o,f0,male> so we have to ask ourselves do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 466.84 469.32 <o,f0,male> or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 470.07 477.26 <o,f0,male> and that is really why it becomes a bad project it's not to say that if we had all the money in the world we wouldn't want to do it but it's to say when we don
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 477.94 490.70 <o,f0,male> it's just simply not our first priority the fair projects notice i'm not going to comment on all these but communicable diseases scale of basic health services just made it simply because yes scale of basic health services is a great thing it would do a lot of
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 491.05 503.26 <o,f0,male> but it's also very very costly again what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation if you look at the good projects a lot of sanitation and water projects came in again sanitation and water is incredibly important
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 503.68 509.70 <o,f0,male> but it also costs a lot of infrastructure so i'd like to show you the top four priorities which should be at least the first ones
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 510.01 523.48 <o,f0,male> that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world the fourth best problem is malaria dealing with malaria the incidence of malaria is about a couple of people get infected every year it might even cost up towards
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 524.13 534.04 <o,f0,male> percentage point of gdp every year for affected nations if we invested about thirteen billion dollars over the next four years we could bring that incidence down to half
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 540.82 549.05 <o,f0,male> we would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with of course in the long run also to deal with global warming
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 550.14 558.67 <o,f0,male> third best one was free trade basically the model showed that if we could get free trade and especially cut subsidies in the u s and europe
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 559.13 566.67 <o,f0,male> we could basically enliven the global economy to an astounding number of about two thousand four hundred billion dollars a year
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 566.86 574.35 <o,f0,male> half of which would accrue to the third world again the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 585.04 594.59 <o,f0,male> there's a very cheap way of dealing with malnutrition namely the lack of micronutrients basically about half of the world 's population is lacking in iron zinc iodine and vitamin a
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 594.92 604.70 <o,f0,male> if we invest about twelve billion dollars we could make a severe inroad into that problem that would be the second best investment that we could do and the very best project would be
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 605.47 615.77 <o,f0,male> to focus on hiv aids basically if we invest twenty seven billion dollars over the next eight years we could avoid twenty eight new million cases of hiv aids
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 616.10 624.73 <o,f0,male> again what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with hiv aids one is treatment the other one is
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 625.91 628.21 <o,f0,male> and again in an ideal world we would do both
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 628.73 632.09 <o,f0,male> but in a world where we don't do either or don't do it very well
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 632.51 646.52 <o,f0,male> we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first and treatment is much much more expensive than prevention so basically what this focuses on is saying we can do a lot more by investing in prevention basically for the amount of money that we spend
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 646.91 661.20 <o,f0,male> we can do x amount of good in treatment and ten times as much good in prevention so again what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment at first rate what this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 662.26 667.96 <o,f0,male> have you look at your priority list and say did you get it right or did you get close to what we came up with
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 668.88 680.42 <o,f0,male> well of course one of the things is climate change again i find a lot of people find it very very unlikely that we should do that we should also do climate change if for no other reason simply because it's such a big problem
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 680.94 686.47 <o,f0,male> but of course we don't do all problems there are many problems out there in the world and what i want to make
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 688.12 695.57 <o,f0,male> if we actually focus on problems that we focus on the right ones the ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good and i think actually
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 696.95 707.72 <o,f0,male> thomas schelling one of the participants in the dream team he put it very very well one of things that people forget is that in one hundred years when we're talking about most of the climate change impacts will be
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 708.16 715.67 <o,f0,male> people will be much much richer even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the u n estimate that the average person in the developing world
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 716.27 724.31 <o,f0,male> one hundred will be about as rich as we are today much more likely they will be two to four times richer than we are and of course we'll be even richer than that
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 724.51 735.74 <o,f0,male> but the point is to say when we talk about saving people or helping people in bangladesh in two thousand one hundred we're not talking about a poor bangladeshi we're actually talking about a fairly rich dutch guy
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 736.06 743.75 <o,f0,male> and so the real point of course is to say do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little one hundred years from now a fairly rich dutch guy
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 744.27 754.51 <o,f0,male> or do we want to help real poor people right now in bangladesh who really need the help and whom we can help very very cheaply or as schelling put it imagine if you were
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 755.81 764.86 <o,f0,male> will be a rich chinese a rich bolivian a rich congolese in two thousand one hundred thinking back on two thousand and five and saying how
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 766.29 771.46 <o,f0,male> that they cared so much about helping me a little bit through climate change
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 772.08 773.59 <o,f0,male> and cared so fairly little
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 774.07 776.92 <o,f0,male> about helping my grandfather and my great grandfather
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 777.39 778.84 <o,f0,male> they could have helped so much more
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 779.20 781.41 <o,f0,male> and who needed the help so much more
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 782.04 793.86 <o,f0,male> so i think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight even if it doesn't accord to the typical way we see this problem of course that's mainly because climate change has such good pictures
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 794.09 803.28 <o,f0,male> we have you know the day after tomorrow it looks great right it's a good film in the sense that i certainly want to see it right but don't expect emmerich
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 804.02 817.23 <o,f0,male> to cast brad pitt in his next movie digging latrines in tanzania or something it just doesn't make for as much of a movie so in many ways i think of the copenhagen consensus and the whole discussion of priorities as a defense for boring problems
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 817.54 829.89 <o,f0,male> to make sure that we realize it's not about making us feel good it's not about making things that have the most media attention but it's about making places where we can actually do the most good
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 830.25 840.26 <o,f0,male> the other objections i think that are important to say is that i'm somehow or we are somehow positing a false choice of course we should do all things in an ideal world i would certainly agree
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 859.72 873.05 <o,f0,male> likewise people are also saying but what about the iraq war you know we spend one hundred billion dollars why don't we spend that on doing good in the world i'm all for that if any one of you guys can talk bush into doing that that's fine but the point of course is still to say if you get another one hundred billion dollars
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 876.62 884.65 <o,f0,male> so the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities i should just mention briefly is this really the right list that we got out
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 884.87 892.40 <o,f0,male> you know when you ask the world 's best economists you inevitably end up asking old white american men and they're not necessarily
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 894.92 903.03 <o,f0,male> ways of looking at the entire world so we actually invited eighty young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem the only two requirements were that they were
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 903.78 906.05 <o,f0,male> studying at the university and they spoke english
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 907.00 917.22 <o,f0,male> the majority of them were first from developing countries they had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion and they certainly did to come up with their own lists and the surprising thing was
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 917.71 927.33 <o,f0,male> that the list was very similar with malnutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom we've done this many other times there's been many other seminars and university students and different things
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 927.59 935.91 <o,f0,male> they all come out with very much the same list and that gives me great hope really in saying that i do believe that there is a
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 936.96 946.11 <o,f0,male> to get us to start thinking about priorities and saying what is the important thing in the world of course in an ideal world again we'd love to do everything but if we don't do it
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 946.38 953.93 <o,f0,male> then we can start thinking about where should we start i see the copenhagen consensus as a process we did it in two thousand and four and we hope to assemble many more people
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 954.18 962.03 <o,f0,male> getting much better information for two thousand and eight two thousand and twelve map out the right path for the world but also to start thinking about political
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 976.64 984.62 <o,f0,male> at the end of the day you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these but we have to be honest and frank about saying if there's some things we do
