TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 18.13 24.89 <o,f0,male> progresses and as it advances many of us assume that these advances make us more intelligent make us smarter
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 25.16 37.16 <o,f0,male> and more connected to the world and what i'd like to argue is that that's not necessarily the case as progress is simply a word for change and with change you gain something but you also lose something
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 37.41 48.61 <o,f0,male> and to really illustrate this point what i'd like to do is to show you how technology has dealt with a very simple a very common an everyday question and that question is this
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 51.12 55.47 <o,f0,male> time is it if you glance at your iphone it's so simple to tell the time but
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 55.56 64.71 <o,f0,male> i'd like to ask you how would you tell the time if you didn't have an iphone how would you tell the time say six hundred years ago how would you do it well
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 65.11 67.87 <o,f0,male> the way you would do it is by using a device
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 68.22 70.00 <o,f0,male> that's called an astrolabe
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 71.43 77.79 <o,f0,male> so an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today 's world but at the time in the thirteenth century
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 78.07 86.43 <o,f0,male> it was the gadget of the day it was the world 's first popular computer and it was a device that in fact is a model of the sky
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 87.14 98.82 <o,f0,male> so the different parts of the astrolabe in this particular type the rete corresponds to the positions of the stars the plate corresponds to a coordinate system and the mater has some scales and puts it all together
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 99.26 111.52 <o,f0,male> if you were an educated child you would know how to not only use the astrolabe you would know how to make an astrolabe and we know this because the first treatise on the astrolabe the first technical manual in the english language
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 120.28 132.96 <o,f0,male> and in this book little lewis would know the big idea and the central idea that makes this computer work is this thing called stereographic projection and basically the concept is how do you
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 141.00 148.67 <o,f0,male> the idea is actually relatively simple imagine that that earth is at the center of the universe and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 149.04 155.66 <o,f0,male> each point on the surface of the sphere is mapped through the bottom pole onto a flat surface where it is then recorded
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 155.80 164.18 <o,f0,male> so the north star corresponds to the center of the device the ecliptic which is the path of the sun moon and planets correspond to an offset circle
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 164.54 174.82 <o,f0,male> the bright stars correspond to little daggers on the rete and the altitude corresponds to the plate system now the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 175.04 189.18 <o,f0,male> the real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems so they fit perfectly there is the position of the sun moon and planets on the movable rete and then their location on the sky as seen from a certain latitude on the back plate
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 190.18 194.28 <o,f0,male> okay so how would you use this device
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 196.63 197.15 <o,f0,female> me first
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 205.10 212.93 <o,f0,male> pretty impressive isn't it and so this astrolabe is on loan from us from the oxford school of museum of history and
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 213.74 221.24 <o,f0,male> you can see the different components this is the mater the scales on the back this is the rete okay do you see that that's the movable part of
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 221.82 230.17 <o,f0,male> the sky and in the back you can see a spiderweb pattern and that spiderweb pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 230.43 239.79 <o,f0,male> this is a rule device and on the back are some other devices measuring tools and scales to be able to make some calculations
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 241.32 251.93 <o,f0,male> you know i've always wanted one of these for my thesis i actually built one of these out of paper and this one this is a replica from a fifteenth century
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 252.57 262.88 <o,f0,male> device and it's worth probably about three macbook pros but a real one would cost about as much as my house and the house next to it and actually every house on the block
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 263.04 273.00 <o,f0,male> on both sides of the street maybe a school thrown in and some you know a church they are just incredibly expensive but let me show you how to work this device so let 's go to step one
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 292.46 305.27 <o,f0,male> its altitude there so i can see it clearly now and then i measure its altitude so it's about twenty six degrees you can't see it from over there step three is identify the star on the front
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 305.67 320.35 <o,f0,male> of the device deneb is there i can tell step four is i then move the rete move the sky so the altitude of the star corresponds to the scale on the back okay so when that happens
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 320.95 334.43 <o,f0,male> everything lines up i have here a model of the sky that corresponds to the real sky okay so it is in a sense holding a model of the universe in my hands and then finally i take a rule
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 335.65 339.62 <o,f0,male> and move the rule to a date line which then tells me the time here
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 340.35 342.69 <o,f0,male> right so that's how the device is used
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 344.96 357.83 <o,f0,male> so i know you're thinking that 's a lot of work isn't it isn't it a ton of work to be able to tell the time as you glance at your ipod to just check out the time but there is a difference between the two because with your ipod you can tell
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 358.45 370.32 <o,f0,male> your iphone you can tell exactly what the time is with precision the way little lewis would tell the time is by a picture of the sky he would know where things would fit in the sky he would not only know
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 370.92 378.96 <o,f0,male> what time it was he would also know where the sun would rise and how it would move across the sky he would know what time the sun would rise
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 379.20 387.45 <o,f0,male> what time it would set and he would know that for essentially every celestial object in the heavens so in computer graphics and computer
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 388.49 396.37 <o,f0,male> user interface design there is a term called affordances so affordances are the qualities of an object that allow us to
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 396.71 409.18 <o,f0,male> perform an action with it and what the astrolabe does is it allows us it affords us to connect to the night sky to look up into the night sky and be much more to see the visible and the invisible together
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 410.13 418.89 <o,f0,male> so that's just one use incredible there is probably three hundred and fifty four hundred uses in fact there is a text and that has over a thousand uses
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 419.15 427.63 <o,f0,male> of this first computer on the back there is scales and measurements for terrestrial navigation you can survey with it the city of baghdad was surveyed with it
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 427.82 434.77 <o,f0,male> it can be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types and it would take a full university course to illustrate it
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 496.70 509.41 <o,f0,male> so what does the astrolabe inspire well i think the first thing is that it reminds us just how resourceful people were our forebears were years and years ago it's an incredible device
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 510.92 519.52 <o,f0,male> every technology advances every technology is transformed and moved by others and what we gain with a new technology of course is precision and accuracy
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 519.75 532.04 <o,f0,male> but what we lose i think is accurate a felt sense of the sky a sense of context knowing the sky knowing your relationship with the sky is
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 532.56 537.46 <o,f0,male> the center of the real answer to knowing what time it is
TomWujec_2009GU 1 TomWujec_2009GU 538.08 545.74 <o,f0,male> so it's i think astrolabes are just remarkable devices and so what can you learn from these devices well primarily that
