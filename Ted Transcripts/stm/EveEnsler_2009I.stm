EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 16.85 20.20 <o,f0,female> morning i'm very happy to be here in india
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 21.08 34.55 <o,f0,female> and i've been thinking a lot about what i have learned over these last particularly eleven years with v day and the vagina monologues traveling the world essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet to stop violence against women
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 35.76 48.65 <o,f0,female> what i want to talk about today is is this particular cell or grouping of cells that is in each and every one of us and i want to call it the girl cell and it's in men as well as in women
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 48.78 58.10 <o,f0,female> i want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells is central to the evolution of our species and the continuation of the human race
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 120.31 131.64 <o,f0,female> then let 's think how compassion informs wisdom and that vulnerability is our greatest strength and that emotions have inherent logic which lead to radical appropriate saving action
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 132.03 139.15 <o,f0,female> and then let 's remember that we've been taught the exact opposite by the powers that be that compassion clouds your thinking that it gets in the way
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 139.53 147.37 <o,f0,female> that vulnerability is weakness that emotions are not to be trusted and you're not supposed to take things personally which is one of my favorites
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 148.63 150.45 <o,f0,female> i think the whole world has
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 151.24 158.52 <o,f0,female> been brought up not to be a girl how do we bring up boys what does it mean to be a boy to be a boy really means not to be a girl
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 159.07 167.55 <o,f0,female> to be a man means not to be a girl to be a woman means not to be a girl to be strong means not to be a girl to be a leader means not to be a girl
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 167.99 176.10 <o,f0,female> i actually think that being a girl is so powerful that we've had to train everyone not to be that
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 192.32 202.31 <o,f0,female> have now come to live in a world where the most extreme forms of violence the most horrific poverty genocide mass rapes the destruction of the earth
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 202.60 212.79 <o,f0,female> is completely out of control and because we have suppressed our girl cells and suppressed our girl ship we do not feel what is going on so we are not being
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 213.76 225.90 <o,f0,female> charged with the adequate response to what is happening i want to talk a little bit about the democratic republic of congo for me it was the turning point of my life i have spent a lot of time there in the last three years
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 226.47 238.18 <o,f0,female> i feel up to that point i had seen a lot in the world a lot of violence i essentially lived in the rape mines of the world for the last twelve years but the democratic republic of congo really
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 239.07 251.93 <o,f0,female> was the turning point in my soul i went and i spent time in a place called bukavu in a hospital called the panzi hospital with a doctor who was a close to a saint as any person i've ever met his name is doctor
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 253.46 262.60 <o,f0,female> and in the congo for those of you who don't know there has been a war raging for the last twelve years a war that has killed nearly six million people
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 274.46 284.28 <o,f0,female> and lined up every day to tell me their stories and their stories were so horrific and so mind blowing and so on the other side of human existence that to be perfectly honest with you i was shattered
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 286.05 293.14 <o,f0,female> and i will tell you that what happened is through that shattering listening to the stories of eight year old girls who had their insides eviscerated
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 293.30 303.23 <o,f0,female> who had guns and bayonets and things shoved inside them so they had holes literally inside them where their pee and poop came out of them listening to the story of eighty year old women who were tied to
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 304.39 316.22 <o,f0,female> chains and circled and where groups of men would come and rape them periodically all in the name of economic exploitation to steal the minerals so the west can have it and profit from them my mind was so
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 317.34 325.29 <o,f0,female> but what happened for me is that that shattering actually emboldened me in a way i have never been
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 326.96 331.09 <o,f0,female> shattering that opening of my girl cell that kind of massive
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 333.43 342.82 <o,f0,female> breakthrough of my heart allowed me to become more courageous and braver and actually more clever than i had been in the past in my life and
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 343.23 356.30 <o,f0,female> i want to say that i think the powers that be know that empire building is actually that feelings get in the way of empire building feelings get in the way of the mass acquisition of the earth and excavating the earth and destroying things
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 356.55 365.35 <o,f0,female> i remember for example when my father who was very very violent used to beat me and he would actually say while he was beating me don 't you cry don't you dare cry
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 365.79 373.28 <o,f0,female> because my crying somehow exposed his brutality to him and even in the moment he didn't want to be reminded of what he was doing
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 373.92 386.51 <o,f0,female> i know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell and i want to say we've annihilated it in men as well as in women and i think in some ways we've been much harsher to men in the annihilation of their girl cell
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 389.32 397.16 <o,f0,female> up and i see this across the planet to be tough to be hardened to distance themselves from their tenderness
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 408.74 415.64 <o,f0,female> self and have their vulnerability and have their compassion and have their hearts that they become hardened and hurtful and violent
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 416.29 425.13 <o,f0,female> and i think we have taught men to be secure when they are insecure to pretend they know things when they don't know things or why would we be where we are to
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 435.68 442.36 <o,f0,female> ten men were in their little seats watching chick flicks and they were all alone and i thought this is the secret life of men
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 446.65 455.89 <o,f0,female> i've traveled as i said to many many countries and i've seen if we do what we do to the girl inside us then obviously
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 464.52 477.02 <o,f0,female> i've met girls with knife wounds and cigarette burns who are literally being treated like ash trays i've seen girls be treated like garbage cans i've seen girls who were beaten by their mothers and brothers and fathers and
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 477.55 490.70 <o,f0,female> i've seen girls starving themselves to death in america in institutions to look like some idealized version of themselves i've seen that we cut girls and we control them and we keep them illiterate or we make them feel bad about being too smart we silence them
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 490.96 500.52 <o,f0,female> we make them feel guilty for being smart we get them to behave to tone it down not to be too intense we sell them we kill them as embryos we enslave them we rape them
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 501.08 507.92 <o,f0,female> we are so accustomed to robbing girls of the subject of being the subjects of their lives that we have now actually
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 518.21 519.56 <o,f0,female> but i also want to talk about
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 519.67 532.09 <o,f0,female> the fact that if one in eight people on the planet are girls between the ages of ten to twenty four they are they key really in the developing world as well as in the whole world to the future of humanity
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 532.58 543.89 <o,f0,female> and if girls are in trouble because they face systematic disadvantages that keep them where society wants them to be including lack of access to healthcare education healthy foods labor force participation
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 544.27 551.83 <o,f0,female> the burden of all the household tasks usually falls on girls and younger siblings which ensures that they will never overcome these barriers
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 552.06 561.43 <o,f0,female> the state of girls the condition of girls will in my belief and that's the girl inside us and the girl in the world determine whether the species survives
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 561.85 570.37 <o,f0,female> and what i want to suggest is that having talked to girls because i just finished a new book called i am an emotional creature the secret life of girls around the world
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 570.68 583.80 <o,f0,female> i've been talking to girls for five years and one of the things that i've seen is true everywhere is that the verb that's been enforced on girl is the verb to please girls are trained to please i want to change the verb
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 584.27 591.31 <o,f0,female> i want us all to change the verb i want the verb to be educate or activate or engage or confront
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 591.46 599.05 <o,f0,female> or defy or create if we teach girls to change the verb we will actually enforce the girl inside us
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 599.40 612.82 <o,f0,female> and the girl inside them and i have to now share a few stories of girls i've seen across the planet who have engaged their girl who have taken on their girl in spite of all the circumstances around them
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 613.18 621.34 <o,f0,female> i know a fourteen year old girl in the netherlands for example who is demanding that she take a boat and go around the entire world by herself
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 622.36 629.27 <o,f0,female> a teenage girl who just recently went out and knew that she needed fifty six stars tattooed on the right side of her face
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 630.51 639.41 <o,f0,female> a girl julia butterfly hill who lived for a year in a tree because she wanted to protect the wild oaks there is a girl who i met
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 650.24 659.21 <o,f0,female> a burqa in afghanistan and went into the stadiums and documented the atrocities that were going on towards women underneath her burqa with a video
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 659.53 666.78 <o,f0,female> and that video became the video that went out all over the world after nine eleven to show what was going on in afghanistan
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 667.16 679.97 <o,f0,female> i want to talk about rachel corrie who was in her teens when she stood in front of an israeli tank to say end the occupation and she knew she risked death and she was literally gunned down and rolled over by that tank
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 698.85 707.40 <o,f0,female> the capacity for girls to overcome situations and to move on levels to me is mind blowing and there is a girl named dorcas
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 717.49 727.28 <o,f0,female> they kidnapped her they put her in a car and through her self defense she grabbed their adam 's apples she punched them in the eyes and she got herself free and out of the car
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 728.60 737.83 <o,f0,female> in kenya in august i went to visit one of the v day safe houses for girls a house we opened seven years ago with an amazing woman named agnes
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 739.03 749.18 <o,f0,female> agnes was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl she was female genitally mutilated and she made a decision as many women do across this planet that what was done to her
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 749.47 758.10 <o,f0,female> would not be enforced and done to other women and girls so for years agnes walked through the rift valley she taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 758.17 769.87 <o,f0,female> and what a mutilated vagina looked like and in that time she saved many girls and when we met her we asked her what we could do for her and she said well if you got me a jeep i could get around a lot faster so we got
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 782.03 788.69 <o,f0,female> in the masai land and it was a house where girls could run away they could save their clitoris they wouldn't be cut they could go to school
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 789.12 801.95 <o,f0,female> and in the years that agnes has had the house she has changed the situation there she has literally become deputy mayor she has changed the rules the whole community has bought in to what she's doing
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 802.37 810.87 <o,f0,female> when we were there she was doing a ritual where she reconciles girls who have run away with their families and there was a young girl named jaclyn
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 820.52 826.70 <o,f0,female> and jaclyn overheard her father talking to an old man about how he was about to sell her for the
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 827.50 836.32 <o,f0,female> and she knew that meant she would be cut she knew that meant she wouldn't go to school she knew that meant she wouldn't have a future she knew she would have to marry that old man and she was fourteen
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 836.64 846.32 <o,f0,female> so one afternoon she'd heard about the safe house jaclyn left her father 's house and she walked for two days two days through
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 847.47 859.94 <o,f0,female> she slept with the hyenas she hid at night she imagined her father killing her on one hand and mama agnes greeting her with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house and when she got to the house she was greeted and agnes took her in
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 860.30 868.69 <o,f0,female> and agnes loved her and agnes supported her for the year and she went to school and she found her voice and she found her identity and she found her heart and then
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 869.63 871.52 <o,f0,female> her time was ready when she had to go back
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 872.03 878.19 <o,f0,female> to talk to her father about the reconciliation after a year and i had the privilege of being in the hut
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 902.66 910.74 <o,f0,female> he threw his arms around her and broke down crying and he said you are beautiful you have grown into a gorgeous woman we will not cut
EveEnsler_2009I 1 EveEnsler_2009I 911.57 921.59 <o,f0,female> and i give you my word here and now that we will not cut your sisters either and what she said to him was you were willing to sell me for four cows
