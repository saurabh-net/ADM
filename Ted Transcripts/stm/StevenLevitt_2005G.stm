StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 12.80 23.76 <o,f0,male> a time there was a dread disease that afflicted children and in fact among all the diseases that existed in this land it was the worst it killed the most children
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 24.56 33.75 <o,f0,male> and along came a brilliant inventor a scientist who came up with a partial cure for that disease and it wasn't perfect many children still died
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 34.40 41.95 <o,f0,male> but it was certainly better than what they had before and one of the good things about this cure was that
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 42.38 51.55 <o,f0,male> it was free virtually free and was very easy to use but the worst thing about it was that you couldn't use it on the youngest children on infants and on one year olds
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 52.25 62.12 <o,f0,male> and so as a consequence a few years later another scientist perhaps maybe this scientist not quite as brilliant as the one who had preceded him but building on the invention of the first one
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 62.55 70.79 <o,f0,male> came up with a second cure and the beauty of the second cure for this disease was that it could be used on infants and
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 73.04 85.57 <o,f0,male> and the problem with this cure was it was very expensive and it was very complicated to use and although parents tried as hard as they could to use it properly almost all of them ended up using it wrong in the end
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 86.59 96.27 <o,f0,male> but what they did of course since it was so complicated and expensive they only used it on the zero year olds and the one year olds and they kept on using the existing cure that they had on the two year olds and
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 96.76 105.54 <o,f0,male> this went on for quite some time people were happy they had their two cures until a particular mother whose child had just turned two died of this disease
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 106.69 114.04 <o,f0,male> and she thought to herself my child just turned two and until the child turned two i had always used
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 114.64 122.34 <o,f0,male> this complicated expensive cure you know this treatment and then the child turned two and i started using the cheap and easy treatment
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 122.63 131.16 <o,f0,male> and i wonder and she wondered like all parents who lose children wonder if there isn't something that i could have done like keep on using that complicated expensive cure
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 131.66 140.15 <o,f0,male> and she told all the other people and she said how could it possibly be that something that's cheap and simple works as well as something that's complicated
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 140.54 149.02 <o,f0,male> expensive and the people thought you know you're right it probably is the wrong thing to do to switch and use the cheap and simple solution and the government
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 149.62 163.88 <o,f0,male> they heard her story and the other people and they said yeah you're right we should make a law we should outlaw this cheap and simple treatment and not let anybody use this on their children and the people were happy they were satisfied for many years this went along and everything was fine
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 164.54 174.88 <o,f0,male> but then along came a lowly economist who had children himself and he used the expensive and complicated treatment
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 176.45 186.49 <o,f0,male> but he knew about the cheap and simple one and he thought about it and the expensive one didn't seem that great to him so he thought i don't know anything about science but i do know something about data
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 186.94 194.96 <o,f0,male> so maybe i should go and look at the data and see whether this expensive and complicated treatment actually works any better than the cheap and simple one
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 195.43 209.89 <o,f0,male> and lo and behold when he went through the data he found that it didn't look like the expensive complicated solution was any better than the cheap one at least for the children who were two and older the cheap one still didn't work on the kids who were younger and so he went forth to the people
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 210.30 216.77 <o,f0,male> and he said i 've made this wonderful finding it looks as if we could just use the cheap and simple solution
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 217.06 225.18 <o,f0,male> and by doing so we could save ourselves three hundred million dollars a year and we could spend that on our children in other ways and the parents were very unhappy
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 226.07 236.50 <o,f0,male> and they said this is a terrible thing because how can the cheap and easy thing be as good as the hard thing and the government was very upset and in particular the people who made this expensive solution were very upset
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 236.93 247.51 <o,f0,male> because they thought how can we hope to compete with something that's essentially free we would lose all of our market and people were very angry and they called him horrible names and he decided that maybe he should
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 248.43 260.11 <o,f0,male> leave the country for a few days and seek out some more intelligent open minded people in a place called oxford and come and try and tell the story at that place and so anyway here i am
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 260.58 274.43 <o,f0,male> it's not a fairy tale it's a true story about the united states today and the disease i'm referring to is actually motor vehicle accidents for children and the free cure is adult seatbelts
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 275.14 283.88 <o,f0,male> and the expensive cure the three hundred million dollar a year cure is child car seats and what i'd like to talk to you about today is some of the evidence
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 284.20 293.52 <o,f0,male> why i believe this to be true that for children two years old and up there really is no real benefit proven benefit of car seats in spite of the
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 304.10 314.25 <o,f0,male> into seatbelts and then talk about why what is it that makes that true and then finally talk a little bit about a third way about another technology which is probably better than anything we have
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 321.61 328.77 <o,f0,male> ok so many times when you try to do research on data it records complicated stories it's hard to find in the data
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 340.88 347.52 <o,f0,male> they have information on all of the people so if you look at that data it's right up on the national highway transportation safety administration 's website
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 347.92 356.21 <o,f0,male> you can just look at the raw data and begin to get a sense of the limited amount of evidence that's in favor of car seats for children aged two and up
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 356.82 366.17 <o,f0,male> so here is the data here i have among two to six year olds anyone above six basically no one uses car seats so you can't compare twenty nine point three percent of the children
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 366.73 374.00 <o,f0,male> who are unrestrained in a crash in which at least one person dies themselves die if you put a child in a car seat
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 374.54 383.60 <o,f0,male> eighteen point two percent of the children die if they're wearing a lap and shoulder belt in this raw data nineteen point four percent die and interestingly wearing a lap only seatbelt
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 384.15 394.22 <o,f0,male> sixteen point seven percent die and actually the theory tells you that the lap only seatbelt 's got to be worse than the lap and shoulder belt and that just reminds you that when you deal with raw data there are hundreds of confounding variables that may
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 394.42 402.02 <o,f0,male> be getting in the way so what we do in the study is and this is just presenting the same information but turned into a
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 414.97 426.21 <o,f0,male> ok so the highest bar is what you're striving to beat so you can control for the basic things like how hard the crash was what seat the child was sitting in et cetera the age of the child
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 435.85 443.39 <o,f0,male> which are really controlling for everything you could possibly imagine about the crash fifty seventy five one hundred different characteristics of the crash
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 443.79 454.32 <o,f0,male> what you find is that the car seats and the lap and shoulder belts when it comes to saving lives fatalities look exactly identical and the standard error bands are relatively small around these estimates as well
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 454.89 468.95 <o,f0,male> and it's not just overall it's very robust to anything you want to look at one thing that's interesting if you look at frontal impact crashes when the car crashes the front hits into something indeed what you see is that the car seats look a little bit better
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 469.55 483.08 <o,f0,male> and i think this isn't just chance in order to have the car seat approved you need to pass certain federal standards all of which involve slamming your car into a direct frontal crash but when you look at other types of crashes like rear impact crashes
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 483.75 491.55 <o,f0,male> indeed the car seats don't perform as well and i think that's because they've been optimized to pass as we always expect people to do to optimize relative to bright line rules
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 491.92 500.10 <o,f0,male> about how effected the car will be and the other thing you might argue is well car seats have got a lot better over time and so if we look at recent crashes
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 500.95 511.90 <o,f0,male> the whole data set 's almost thirty years worth of data you won 't see it in the recent crashes the new car seats are far far better but indeed in recent crashes the lap and shoulder seatbelts actually are doing even better than
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 523.44 532.60 <o,f0,male> latches how could they possibly not work better than seatbelts because they are so expensive and complicated it's kind of an interesting logic i think that people use
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 533.15 541.37 <o,f0,male> other logic they say well the government wouldn't have told us we can't use them if they were much better but what's interesting is the government telling us to use them is not
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 553.66 567.58 <o,f0,male> you can only get so far i think in telling your story by using these abstract statistics and so i had some friends over to dinner and i was asking we had a cookout i was asking them what advice they might have for me about
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 583.17 595.37 <o,f0,male> none of them wanted to do our crash test because they said some explicitly some not so explicitly all of our business comes from car seat manufacturers we can't risk alienating them by testing seatbelts relative to car seats now eventually
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 596.93 605.56 <o,f0,male> under the conditions of anonymity they said they would be happy to do this test for us so anonymity and one thousand five hundred dollars per seat that we crashed
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 606.16 615.78 <o,f0,male> and so we went to buffalo new york and here is the precursor to it these are the crash test dummies waiting for their chance to take the center stage
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 616.09 624.29 <o,f0,male> and then here 's how the crash test works here they don't actually crash the entire car you know it's not worth ruining a whole car to do it so they just have these bench seats
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 658.33 666.48 <o,f0,male> so here this is the car seat now watch two things watch how the head goes forward and basically hits the knees and this is in the car seat and watch how the car seat flies around
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 667.60 675.31 <o,f0,male> in the rebound up in the air the car seat 's moving all over the place bear in mind there 're two things about this this is a car seat that was
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 696.76 706.86 <o,f0,male> to be an approved car seat on this crash in some metric of units which are not important and this crash would have been about a four hundred and fifty so this car seat was actually an above average car seat
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 707.07 715.04 <o,f0,male> from consumer reports and did quite well so the next one now this is the kid same crash who 's in the seatbelt
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 716.11 727.42 <o,f0,male> he hardly moves at all actually relative to the other child the funny thing is the cam work is terrible because they've only set it up to do the car seats and so they actually don't even have a way to move the camera so you can see the kid that's on the
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 728.22 734.96 <o,f0,male> anyway it turns out that those two crashes that actually the three year old did slightly worse so he gets about a five hundred
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 735.39 747.71 <o,f0,male> out of you know on this range relative to a four hundred and something but still if you just took that data from that crash to the federal government and said i have invented a new car seat i would like you to approve it for selling
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 748.28 756.04 <o,f0,male> then they would say this is a fantastic new car seat it works great it only got a five hundred it could have gotten as high up as a one thousand and this seatbelt would have passed with flying
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 769.66 781.93 <o,f0,male> you can see that it takes much longer with the car seat at rebound it takes a lot longer but there's just a lot less movement for child who 's in the seatbelt so i'll show you the six year old crashes as well the six year old 's in a car seat and
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 784.17 795.61 <o,f0,male> turns out that looks terrible but that's great that's like a four hundred ok so that kid would do fine in the crash nothing about that would have been problematic to the child at all and then here 's the six
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 796.36 806.16 <o,f0,male> in the seatbelt and in fact they get exactly within you know within one or two points of the same so really for the six year old the car seat did absolutely nothing
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 835.14 843.91 <o,f0,male> a very imperfect science of looking at the dummies than actually thirty years of data of what we've seen with children and with car seats
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 844.22 853.62 <o,f0,male> and so i think the answer to this puzzle is that there's a much better solution out there that's gotten nobody excited
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 863.14 874.47 <o,f0,male> say i just want to protect kids in the back seat i don't there's anyone in this room who 'd say well the right way to start would be let 's make a great seat belt for adults and then let 's make this really big contraption that you have to rig up to it
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 875.10 887.27 <o,f0,male> in this daisy chain i mean why not start who 's sitting in the back seat anyway except for kids but essentially do something like this which i don't know exactly how much it would cost to do but there's no reason i could see why this should be much more expensive than a regular car seat
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 898.20 909.08 <o,f0,male> expensive solution and it's got to work better than what we already have so the question is is there any hope for adoption of something like this which would presumably save a lot of lives
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 909.51 916.53 <o,f0,male> and i think the answer perhaps lies in a story the answer both to why has a car seat been so successful
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 917.35 931.40 <o,f0,male> and why this may someday be adopted or not lies in a story that my dad told me relating to when he was a doctor in the u s air force in england and this is a long time ago you were allowed to do things then you can't do today so my father would
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 932.14 939.33 <o,f0,male> have patients come in who he thought were not really sick and he had a big jar full of placebo pills
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 939.85 947.52 <o,f0,male> would give them and he'd say come back in a week if you still feel lousy ok and most of them would not come back but some of them would come back and when they came back
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 948.57 951.92 <o,f0,male> he still convinced they were not sick had another jar of pills
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 952.40 962.70 <o,f0,male> in this jar were huge horse pills they were almost impossible to swallow and these to me are the analogy for the car seats people would look at these
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 963.89 973.23 <o,f0,male> this thing is so big and so hard to swallow if this doesn't make me feel better you know what possibly could and it turned out that most people wouldn't come back because it worked
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 974.08 978.47 <o,f0,male> but every once in a while there was still a patient convinced that he
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 979.35 990.07 <o,f0,male> was sick and he'd come back and my dad had a third jar of pills and the jar of pills he had he said were the tiniest little pills he could find so small you could barely see them
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 990.47 1002.82 <o,f0,male> and he would say listen i know i gave you that huge pill that complicated hard to swallow pill before but now i've got one that's so potent that is really tiny and small and almost invisible it's almost like this thing here which you can't even see
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1003.43 1014.95 <o,f0,male> and it turned out that never in all the times my dad gave out this pill the really tiny pill did anyone ever come back still complaining of sickness so my dad always took that as evidence that this
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1016.50 1026.38 <o,f0,male> little teeny powerful pill had the ultimate placebo effect and in some sense if that's the right story i think integrated car seats you will see very quickly becoming something that everyone has
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1026.91 1041.46 <o,f0,male> the other possible conclusion is well maybe after coming to my father three times getting sent home with placebos he still felt sick he went and found another doctor and that's completely possible and if that's the case then i think we're stuck with conventional car seats for a long time to come thank you very much
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1045.54 1052.45 <o,f0,male> ask you when we wear seatbelts we don't necessarily wear them just to prevent loss of life it's also to prevent lots of serious injury
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1052.81 1063.41 <o,f0,male> your data looks at fatalities it doesn't look at serious injury is there any data to show that child seats are actually less effective or just as effective as seatbelts for serious injury because that would prove your case
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1064.05 1072.88 <o,f0,male> that's a great question in my data and in another data set i've looked at for new jersey crashes i find very small differences in injury
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1073.23 1081.91 <o,f0,male> so in this data it's a statistically insignificant difference in injury between car seats and lap and shoulder belts in the new jersey data which is different because it's not just
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1083.80 1094.08 <o,f0,male> all crashes in new jersey that are reported it turns out that there is a ten percent difference in injuries but generally they're minor injuries now what's interesting i should say this as a disclaimer there is medical literature
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1094.88 1102.76 <o,f0,male> that is very difficult to resolve with this other data which suggests that car seats are dramatically better and they use a completely different methodology
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1111.08 1118.94 <o,f0,male> and i really can't resolve yet and i'd like to work with these medical researchers to try to understand how there can be these differences which are
