JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 16.57 21.8 <o,f0,male> are music technology and making things
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 52.86 57.72 <o,f0,male> so let 's play a five hundred and fifty herz frequency and watch what happens
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 101.09 104.27 <o,f0,male> so every time we hit a resonant frequency we get a standing wave
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 104.59 107.81 <o,f0,male> and that emergent sine curve of fire so let 's turn that off
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 113.48 124.06 <o,f0,male> i also have with me a flame table it 's very similar to a rubens tube and it 's also used for visualizing the physical properties of sound such as eigenmodes so let 's fire it up and see what it does
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 133.81 146.97 <o,f0,male> while the table comes up to pressure let me note here that the sound is not traveling in perfect lines it 's actually traveling in all directions and the rubens tube 's a little like bisecting those waves with a line and the flame table 's a little like bisecting those waves with a plane
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 146.97 154.93 <o,f0,male> and it can show a little more subtle complexity which is why i like to use it to watch geoff farina play guitar
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 195.18 197.28 <o,f0,female> so it 's a delicate dance
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 197.34 200.78 <o,f0,female> if you watch closely
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 208.7 213.4 <o,f0,male> actually a lot of things are better with fire in my world but the fire 's just a foundation
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 213.4 228.55 <o,f0,male> it shows very well that eyes can hear and this is interesting to me because technology allows us to present sound to the eyes in ways that accentuate the strength of the eyes for seeing sound such as the removal of time so here i 'm using a rendering algorithm to paint
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 234.36 240.78 <o,f0,male> and the technique will also show the strengths of the visual cortex for pattern recognition so if i show you another song off this album
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 240.78 244.26 <o,f0,male> and another your eyes will easily pick out
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 244.26 253.19 <o,f0,male> the use of repetition by the band nirvana and in the frequency distribution the colors you can see the clean dirty clean sound that they are famous for
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 253.41 264.71 <o,f0,male> and here is the entire album as a single visual impression and i think this impression is pretty powerful at least it 's powerful enough that if i show you these four songs and i remind you that this is smells like teen spirit
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 264.71 277.85 <o,f0,male> you can probably correctly guess without listening to any music at all that the song a die hard nirvana fan would enjoy is this song i 'll stick around by the foo fighters whose lead singer is dave grohl who was the drummer in nirvana
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 277.85 284.45 <o,f0,male> the songs are a little similar but mostly i 'm just interested in the idea that someday maybe we 'll buy a song because we like the way it looks
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 289.86 292.6 <o,f0,male> davis skate park in austin texas
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 311.53 317.36 <o,f0,male> and voices occupy very unique frequencies in the skate park so if we were to render these sounds visually we might end up
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 317.36 335.51 <o,f0,male> with something like this this is all forty minutes of the recording and right away the algorithm tells us a lot more tricks are missed than are made and also a trick on the rails is a lot more likely to produce a cheer and if you look really closely we can tease out traffic patterns you see the skaters often trick in this direction
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 335.51 342.83 <o,f0,male> the obstacles are easier and in the middle of the recording the mics pick this up but later in the recording this kid shows up
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 342.95 360.93 <o,f0,male> and he starts using a line at the top of the park to do some very advanced tricks on something called the tall rail and it 's fascinating at this moment in time all the rest of the skaters turn their lines ninety degrees to stay out of his way you see there 's a subtle etiquette in the skate park and it 's led by key influencers and they tend to be the kids
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 382.25 394.01 <o,f0,male> so i wrote a steering algorithm it listens to the lecture and then it uses the amplitude of each word to move a point on the x axis and it uses the inflection of sentences to move a same point up and down on the y axis
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 394.01 411.18 <o,f0,male> and these trend lines you can see there 's more questions than answers in the laws of physics and when we reach the end of a sentence we place a star at that location so there 's a lot of sentences so a lot of stars and after rendering all of the audio this is what we get this is stephen hawking 's universe
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 416.97 429.48 <o,f0,male> all eight hours of the cambridge lecture series taken in as a single visual impression and i really like this image but a lot of people think it 's fake so i made a more interactive version and the way i did that
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 438.96 444.86 <o,f0,male> i can walk right into the lecture i 'm going to wave through the kinect here and take control and now i 'm going to reach out
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 446.11 452.04 <o,f0,male> and i 'm going to touch a star and when i do it will play the sentence that generated that star
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 469.88 486.34 <o,f0,male> let me close with a work in progress i think after thirty years the opportunity exists to create an enhanced version of closed captioning now we 've all seen a lot of tedtalks online so let 's watch one now with the sound turned off and the closed captioning turned on
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 487.17 494.87 <o,f0,male> there 's no closed captioning for the ted theme song and we 're missing it but if you 've watched enough of these you hear it in your mind 's ear and then applause starts
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 507.17 509.85 <o,f0,male> let 's watch this clip again
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 510.04 521.72 <o,f0,male> this time i 'm not going to talk at all there 's still going to be no audio but what i am going to do is i 'm going to render the sound visually in real time at the bottom of the screen so watch closely and see what your eyes can hear
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 543.31 550.3 <o,f0,male> this is fairly amazing to me even on the first view your eyes will successfully pick out patterns
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 550.3 560.38 <o,f0,male> but on repeated views your brain actually gets better at turning these patterns into information you can get the tone and the timbre and the pace of the speech things that you can 't get out of closed captioning
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 560.38 564.11 <o,f0,male> that famous scene in horror movies where someone is walking up
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 564.11 581.39 <o,f0,male> from behind is something you can see and i believe this information would be something that is useful at times when the audio is turned off or not heard at all and i speculate that deaf audiences might actually even be better at seeing sound than hearing audiences i don 't know it 's a theory right now actually it 's all just an idea
