DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 16.51 26.35 <o,f0,male> to make a confession at the outset here a little over twenty years ago i did something that i regret something that i'm not
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 37.33 43.91 <o,f0,male> late nineteen eighties in a moment of youthful indiscretion i went to law school
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 44.51 45.81 <o,f0,male> now
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 49.85 55.02 <o,f0,male> in america law is a professional degree you get your university degree then you go on to law school and when i got to law school
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 56.42 67.45 <o,f0,male> i didn't do very well to put it mildly i didn't do very well i in fact graduated in the part of my law school class that made the top ninety percent possible
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 71.75 74.81 <o,f0,male> thank you i never
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 75.35 79.48 <o,f0,male> law a day in my life i pretty much wasn't allowed to
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 82.57 94.31 <o,f0,male> but today against my better judgement against the advice of my own wife i want to try to dust off some of those legal skills what's left of those legal skills
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 94.79 109.53 <o,f0,male> i don't want to tell you a story i want to make a case i want to make a hard headed evidence based dare i say lawyerly case for rethinking how we run our businesses
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 132.04 141.35 <o,f0,male> i give you a candle some thumbtacks and some matches and i say to you your job is to attach the candle to the wall so the wax
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 141.69 149.69 <o,f0,male> doesn't drip onto the table now what would you do now many people begin trying to thumbtack the candle to the wall doesn't work
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 164.05 173.32 <o,f0,male> and eventually after five or ten minutes most people figure out the solution which you can see here the key to to overcome what's called functional
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 192.18 200.97 <o,f0,male> this shows the power of incentives here 's what he did he gathered his participants and he said i 'm going to time you how quickly you can solve this problem
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 201.26 213.99 <o,f0,male> to one group he said i'm going to time you to establish norms averages for how long it typically takes someone to solve this sort of problem to the second group he offered rewards he said if you're in the top
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 222.95 236.23 <o,f0,male> you get twenty dollars now this is several years ago adjusted for inflation it's a decent sum of money for a few minutes of work it's a nice motivator question how much faster did this group solve the problem
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 236.97 243.10 <o,f0,male> answer it took them on average three and a half minutes longer
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 243.74 252.75 <o,f0,male> three and a half minutes longer now this makes no sense right i mean i'm an american i believe in free markets that's not how it's supposed to work right
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 253.65 264.06 <o,f0,male> if you want people to perform better you reward them right bonuses commissions their own reality show incentivize them that's how business
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 264.62 274.33 <o,f0,male> but that's not happening here you've got an incentive designed to sharpen thinking and accelerate creativity and it does just the opposite
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 274.47 282.80 <o,f0,male> it dulls thinking and blocks creativity and what's interesting about this experiment is that it's not an aberration this has been replicated over
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 283.09 291.55 <o,f0,male> and over and over again for nearly forty years these contingent motivators if you do this then you get that
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 291.86 298.99 <o,f0,male> work in some circumstances but for a lot of tasks they actually either don't work or often they do harm
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 300.05 307.95 <o,f0,male> this is one of the most robust findings in social science and also one of the most ignored
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 308.56 315.83 <o,f0,male> i spent the last couple of years looking at the science of human motivation particularly the dynamics of extrinsic motivators and intrinsic motivators
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 316.31 324.64 <o,f0,male> and i'm telling you it's not even close if you look at the science there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does and
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 325.43 334.66 <o,f0,male> here is that our business operating system think of the set of assumptions and protocols beneath our businesses how we motivate people how we apply our human resources
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 335.97 344.64 <o,f0,male> it's built entirely around these extrinsic motivators around carrots and sticks that's actually fine for many kinds of twentieth century tasks
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 344.99 355.52 <o,f0,male> but for twenty one st century tasks that mechanistic reward and punishment approach doesn't work often doesn't work and often does harm let me show you what
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 356.08 363.00 <o,f0,male> so glucksberg did another experiment similar to this where he presented the problem in a slightly different way like this up here
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 364.60 370.58 <o,f0,male> attach the candle to the wall so the wax doesn't drip onto the table same deal you we're timing for norms you
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 372.17 374.41 <o,f0,male> what happened this time
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 374.65 378.93 <o,f0,male> this time the incentivized group kicked the other
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 380.99 387.46 <o,f0,female> why because when the tacks are out of the box it's pretty easy isn't it
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 391.21 399.75 <o,f0,male> if then rewards work really well for those sorts of tasks where there is a simple set of rules and a clear destination to go to
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 409.14 417.53 <o,f0,male> narrow focus where you just see the goal right there zoom straight ahead to it they work really well but for the real candle problem
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 418.07 429.03 <o,f0,male> you don't want to be looking like this the solution is not over here the solution is on the periphery you want to be looking around that reward actually narrows our focus and restricts our possibility let me tell you why this is so important
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 430.80 435.30 <o,f0,male> in western europe in many parts of asia in
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 435.55 445.44 <o,f0,male> north america in australia white collar workers are doing less of this kind of work and more of this kind of work that
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 446.52 456.51 <o,f0,male> rule based left brain work certain kinds of accounting certain kinds of financial analysis certain kinds of computer programing has become fairly easy to outsource fairly easy to automate
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 457.17 464.14 <o,f0,male> software can do it faster low cost providers around the world can do it cheaper so what really matters are the
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 464.61 473.42 <o,f0,male> more right brained creative conceptual kinds of abilities think about your own work think about your own work
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 474.27 482.52 <o,f0,male> are the problems that you face or even the problems we've been talking about here are those kinds of problems do they have a clear set of rules and a single solution
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 483.13 490.18 <o,f0,male> no the rules are mystifying the solution if it exists at all is surprising and not obvious
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 490.85 498.72 <o,f0,male> everybody in this room is dealing with their own version of the candle problem and for candle problems of
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 499.02 501.80 <o,f0,female> any kind in any field
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 502.38 509.04 <o,f0,male> those if then rewards the things around which we've built so many of our businesses
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 510.48 517.72 <o,f0,female> work now i mean it makes me crazy and this is not here 's the thing this is not a feeling
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 519.22 528.11 <o,f0,female> okay i'm a lawyer i don't believe in feelings this is not a philosophy i'm an american i don't believe in philosophy
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 530.90 532.88 <o,f0,female> this is a
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 533.81 536.79 <o,f0,male> or as we say in my hometown of washington d c a true
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 537.91 538.41 <o,f0,female> let me
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 544.57 553.38 <o,f0,male> give you an example of what i mean let me marshal the evidence here because i'm not telling you a story i'm making a case ladies and gentlemen of the jury some evidence dan ariely one of the great
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 566.30 579.16 <o,f0,male> them for performance three levels of rewards small reward medium reward large reward okay if you do really well you get the large reward on down what happened
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 579.66 588.24 <o,f0,male> as long as the task involved only mechanical skill bonuses worked as they would be expected the higher the pay the better the performance
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 589.42 597.57 <o,f0,male> but one the task called for even rudimentary cognitive skill a larger
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 600.66 611.33 <o,f0,male> then they said okay let 's see if there's any cultural bias here lets go to madurai india and test this standard of living is lower in madurai a reward that is modest in north american standards is more
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 611.88 617.82 <o,f0,male> there same deal a bunch of games three levels of rewards what happens
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 628.72 630.80 <o,f0,male> the worst of all
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 632.22 639.15 <o,f0,male> in eight of the nine tasks we examined across three experiments higher incentives led to worse performance
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 647.04 656.86 <o,f0,male> no these are economists from mit from carnegie mellon from the university of chicago and do you know who sponsored this research the federal reserve
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 657.08 661.03 <o,f0,male> bank of the united states that's the american experience let 's go
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 669.99 678.77 <o,f0,male> training ground for great economic thinkers like george soros and friedrich hayek and mick jagger last month
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 679.89 692.17 <o,f0,male> just last month economists at lse looked at fifty one studies of pay for performance plans inside of companies here 's what the economists there said we find that financial incentives can result in a negative
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 692.78 701.04 <o,f0,male> impact on overall performance there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 701.28 712.45 <o,f0,male> and what worries me as we stand here in the rubble of the economic collapse is that too many organizations are making their decisions their policies about talent and people
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 712.89 721.33 <o,f0,male> based on assumptions that are outdated unexamined and rooted more in folklore than in science
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 721.79 730.58 <o,f0,male> and if we really want to get out of this economic mess and if we really want high performance on those definitional tasks of the twenty one st century the solution is not
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 730.74 739.19 <o,f0,male> to do more of the wrong things to entice people with a sweeter carrot or threaten them with a sharper stick
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 739.69 746.34 <o,f0,male> we need a whole new approach and the good news about all of this is that the scientists who 've been studying motivation have given us this new approach
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 756.07 764.29 <o,f0,male> my mind that new operating system for our businesses revolves around three elements autonomy mastery and purpose
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 774.29 784.54 <o,f0,male> in the service of something larger than ourselves these are the building blocks of an entirely new operating system for our businesses i want to talk today only about autonomy
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 786.32 796.42 <o,f0,male> the twentieth century we came up with this idea of management management did not emanate from nature management is like it's not a tree it's a television set okay somebody invented
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 814.22 822.50 <o,f0,male> you don't see a lot of it but you see the first stirrings of something really interesting going on because what it means is paying people adequately and fairly absolutely
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 822.84 829.76 <o,f0,male> getting the issue of money off the table and then giving people lots of autonomy let me give you some examples how many of you have heard of the company
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 832.87 834.30 <o,f0,male> it looks like less than half
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 837.88 848.48 <o,f0,male> is an australian software company and they do something incredibly cool a few times a year they tell their engineers go for the next twenty four hours and work on anything you want
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 849.24 857.83 <o,f0,male> as long as it's not part of your regular job work on anything you want so that engineers use this time to come up with a cool patch for code come up with an elegant hack
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 857.97 865.81 <o,f0,male> then they present all of the stuff that they've developed to their teammates to the rest of the company in this wild and wooly all hands meeting
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 865.92 872.05 <o,f0,male> at the end of the day and then being australians everybody has a beer they call them fedex days
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 873.07 873.99 <o,f0,male> why
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 874.99 881.47 <o,f0,male> you have to deliver something overnight it's pretty it's not bad it's a huge trademark violation but it's pretty clever
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 883.95 886.97 <o,f0,male> that one day of intense autonomy has produced a whole array of software
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 899.85 908.78 <o,f0,male> they have autonomy over their time their task their team their technique okay radical amounts of autonomy and at google as many of you know
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 909.80 922.84 <o,f0,male> about half of the new products in a typical year are birthed during that twenty percent time things like gmail orkut google news let me give you an even more radical example of it something called the results only work environment
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 933.04 940.43 <o,f0,male> they show up when they want they don't have to be in the office at a certain time or any time they just have to get their work done
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 940.71 947.85 <o,f0,male> how they do it when they do it where they do it is totally up to them meetings in these kinds of environments
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 948.66 952.90 <o,f0,male> are optional what happens almost across the board
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 960.73 971.74 <o,f0,male> autonomy mastery and purpose these are the building blocks of a new way of doing things now some of you might look at this and say hmm that sounds nice but it's utopian and i say
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 973.75 974.76 <o,f0,male> i
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 993.38 1002.27 <o,f0,male> few years later another encyclopedia got started different model right do it for fun no one gets paid a cent or a euro or
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 1017.23 1024.68 <o,f0,male> ten years ago you could not have found a single sober economist anywhere on planet earth who would have predicted the
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 1026.07 1036.55 <o,f0,male> this is the titanic battle between these two approaches this is the ali frazier of motivation right this is the thrilla in manila alright intrinsic motivators versus extrinsic motivators
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 1037.13 1045.29 <o,f0,male> autonomy mastery and purpose versus carrot and sticks and who wins intrinsic motivation autonomy mastery and purpose in a knockout let me wrap up
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 1047.99 1052.63 <o,f0,male> a mismatch between what science knows and what business does and here is what science knows
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 1053.99 1061.93 <o,f0,male> rewards those motivators we think are a natural part of business do work but only in a surprisingly narrow band of circumstances two
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 1062.41 1069.69 <o,f0,male> those if then rewards often destroy creativity three the secret to high performance isn't rewards and punishments
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 1069.93 1077.05 <o,f0,male> but that unseen intrinsic drive the drive to do things for their own sake the drive to do things cause they matter and here 's the best part
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 1077.39 1086.88 <o,f0,male> here 's the best part we already know this the science confirms what we know in our hearts so if we repair this mismatch between what science knows and what business does
DanielPink_2009G 1 DanielPink_2009G 1103.25 1109.57 <o,f0,male> and maybe maybe maybe we can change the world i rest
