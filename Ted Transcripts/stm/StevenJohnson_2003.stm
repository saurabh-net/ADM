StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 12.60 19.03 <o,f0,male> i want to take you back basically to my home town and to a picture of my home town of the week that emergence came out
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 20.20 22.47 <o,f0,male> and it's a picture we've seen several times
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 27.46 33.87 <o,f0,male> basically emergence was published on nine eleven i live right there
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 34.49 47.85 <o,f0,male> in the west village so the plume was luckily blowing west away from us we had a two and a half day old baby in the house that was ours we hadn't taken
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 51.46 51.87 <o,f0,male> and
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 55.07 60.08 <o,f0,male> one of the thoughts that i had dealing with these two separate emergences of a book and a baby
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 60.81 70.79 <o,f0,male> and having this event happen so close that my first thought when i was still kind of in the apartment looking out at it all or walking out on the street and looking out on it just in front of our building was
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 71.07 79.21 <o,f0,male> that i'd made a terrible miscalculation in the book that i'd just written because so much of that book was a celebration of the power and
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 87.41 96.39 <o,f0,male> share ideas and share physical space together and it seemed to me looking at that that tower burning and then falling those towers burning and falling that in fact one of the lessons here was that density
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 96.71 104.86 <o,f0,male> kills and that of all the technologies that were exploited to make that carnage come into being
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 124.76 135.70 <o,f0,male> and so i started to think well you know density density i'm not sure if you know this was the right call and i kind of ruminated on that for a couple of days and then about two days later the
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 150.43 161.76 <o,f0,male> the bed bath and beyond which was located about twenty blocks away north and so i went out and obviously i'm physically a very strong person as you can tell so
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 163.16 171.57 <o,f0,male> about carrying this thing twenty blocks and i walked out and this really miraculous thing happened to me as i was walking north to buy this air filter
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 172.45 180.90 <o,f0,male> which was that the streets were completely alive with people there was an incredible it was you know a beautiful day as it was for about a week after
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 181.77 190.63 <o,f0,male> and the west village had never seemed more lively i walked up along hudson street where jane jacobs had lived and written her great book that so influenced what i was writing in emergence
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 191.35 200.73 <o,f0,male> past the white horse tavern that great old bar where dylan thomas drank himself to death and the bleecker street playground was filled with kids and all the people who lived in the neighborhood
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 200.96 205.62 <o,f0,male> who owned restaurants and bars in the neighborhood were all out there had them all open people were out there were no cars
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 206.07 216.01 <o,f0,male> seemed even better in some ways and it was a beautiful urban day and the incredible thing about it was that the city was working
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 222.31 235.41 <o,f0,male> there on those streets and i thought well this is the power of a city i mean the power of the city we talked about cities as being centralized in space but what makes them so strong most of the time is they're decentralized in function
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 235.71 245.65 <o,f0,male> they don't have a center executive branch that you can take out and cause the whole thing to fail if they did it probably was right there at ground zero i mean you know the emergency bunker was right there was destroyed by the
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 246.30 254.62 <o,f0,male> attacks and obviously the damage done to the building and the lives but nonetheless just twenty blocks north two days later the city had never looked more
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 266.02 271.29 <o,f0,male> was thriving so i took heart in seeing that so
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 272.32 284.79 <o,f0,male> i wanted to talk a little bit about the reasons why that works so well and how some of those reasons kind of map on to where the web is going right now the question that i found myself asking to people when i was talking about the book afterwards is
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 285.12 293.90 <o,f0,male> when you've talked about emergent behavior when you've talked about kind of collective intelligence the best way to get people to kind of wrap their heads around that is to ask who builds a neighborhood
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 294.51 305.72 <o,f0,male> who decides that soho should have this personality and that the latin quarter should have this personality well there are some kind of executive decisions but mostly the answer is everybody and nobody everybody contributes a little bit
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 306.39 314.21 <o,f0,male> no single person is really the ultimate kind of actor behind the personality of a neighborhood same thing to the question of who was keeping the streets alive
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 314.82 321.44 <o,f0,male> post nine eleven in my neighborhood well it was the whole city the whole system kind of working on it and everybody contributing a small little part
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 322.01 333.92 <o,f0,male> and this is increasingly what we're starting to see on the web in a bunch of interesting ways most of which weren't around actually except in very experimental things when i was writing emergence and when the book came out so it's been a very
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 345.85 350.11 <o,f0,male> looked like this this is not the future
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 350.61 361.75 <o,f0,male> king of england although it looks like it it's some guy it's a geocities homepage of some guy that i found online who 's interested if you look at the bottom in soccer and jesus and garth brooks and clint beckham my hometown those are his links
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 373.60 387.14 <o,f0,male> is you know there's no sentence that kind of conjures up that period better than that i think which is that you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of your dog and link to it and somebody reading the page has the power to click on that link or not click on that link
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 387.61 401.70 <o,f0,male> and you know i don't want to belittle that that in a sense to reference you know what jeff was talking about yesterday that was in a sense the kind of interface electricity that powered a lot of the explosion of interest in the web that you could put up a link and somebody could click on it and it could take you anywhere you wanted to go
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 402.54 409.92 <o,f0,male> but it's still a very one to one kind of relationship there's one person putting up the link and there's one another person on the other end trying to decide whether to click on it or not
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 410.89 421.70 <o,f0,male> the new model is much more like this and we've already seen a couple of references to this this is what happens when you search on steven johnson on google about two months ago
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 422.16 429.67 <o,f0,male> i had the great breakthrough one of my great you know kind of shining achievements which is that my website finally became a top result for steven johnson
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 432.42 436.42 <o,f0,male> some theoretical physicist at mit named steven johnson who has dropped
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 437.02 447.34 <o,f0,male> i'm happy to say and you know i mean i'll look at a couple of things like this but google is obviously the greatest technology ever invented for navel gazing
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 447.95 459.83 <o,f0,male> it's just that there's so many other people in your navel when you gaze because effectively what's happening here what's creating this page obviously and we all know this but it's worth just thinking about it is not some
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 460.00 473.67 <o,f0,male> person deciding that i am the number one answer for steven johnson but rather somehow the entire web of people putting up pages and deciding to link to my page or not link to it and google just sitting there and running the numbers
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 475.09 486.05 <o,f0,male> so there's this collective decision making that's going on this page is effectively collectively authored by the web and google is just helping us kind of to put the authorship in one kind of coherent place now they're more
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 498.80 508.57 <o,f0,male> looking in the blog world and the world of weblogs he 's analyzed basically all the weblogs out there that he 's tracking and he 's tracking how many other weblogs linked to those weblogs
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 508.96 515.87 <o,f0,male> and so you a have kind of an authority a weblog that has a lot of links to it is more authoritative than a weblog that has few links to it
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 530.69 539.01 <o,f0,male> so when i was talking in emergence i talked about the limitations of the one way linking architecture that basically you could link to somebody else but they wouldn't necessarily know that you were pointing to them
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 577.21 589.11 <o,f0,male> the right hand side of my page and they would change as the overall ecology of the web changes that little list there would change i wouldn't really be directly in control of it so it's much closer in a way to a data fungus in a sense wrapped around that page than
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 590.34 594.98 <o,f0,male> it is to a deliberate link that i've placed there now
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 595.11 603.76 <o,f0,male> what you're having here is basically a global brain that you're able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what it's thinking and there are all these interesting tools google does the
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 604.11 610.58 <o,f0,male> google zeitgeist which looks at search requests to test what's going on what people are interested in and they publish it with lots of
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 631.59 642.79 <o,f0,male> know already so the key thing in terms of these new tools that are kind of plumbing the depths of the global brain that are sending kind of trace dyes through that whole bloodstream the question is are you finding out something new
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 643.24 656.91 <o,f0,male> and one of the things that i experimented with is this thing called google share which is basically you take an abstract term and you search google for that term and then you search the results that you get back for somebody 's name
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 657.53 665.04 <o,f0,male> so basically the number of pages that mention this term that also mention this page the percentage of those pages is that person 's google share of that term
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 665.43 671.97 <o,f0,male> so you can do kind of interesting contests like for instance this is a google share of the ted conference so
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 685.84 691.70 <o,f0,male> but the interesting thing is you can broaden the search a little bit and it turns out actually that forty two percent is the mola mola fish i had no idea
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 697.35 709.56 <o,f0,male> i made that up because i just wanted to put up a slide of the mola mola fish i also did and i don't want to start a little fight in the next panel but i did a google share analysis of evolution and natural selection
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 732.91 743.14 <o,f0,male> gary bauer is not too far behind has slightly different theories about evolution and natural selection and right behind him is l ron hubbard so
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 745.33 750.04 <o,f0,male> you can see we're in the ascot which is always good and by the way chris that would 've been a really good panel
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 770.62 784.67 <o,f0,male> so these are words that suddenly start to appear out of nowhere so they're kind of you know memes that start taking off that didn't have a lot of historical precedent before so the first one is these are the bursty words around eighteen sixties slaves emancipation slavery rebellion kansas
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 795.75 798.77 <o,f0,male> eighty five right at the center of the reagan years
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 805.47 807.41 <o,f0,male> one way to interpret this which is to say that
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 821.68 835.80 <o,f0,male> of the country and shifting to a much more intimate much more folksy much more telegenic contracting all those verbs you know twenty years before it was still ask not what you can do but with reagan it 's that 's where there's nancy and i that kind of language
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 862.55 875.01 <o,f0,male> this is basically the distribution of links on the web to all these various different blogs it follows a power law so that there are a few extremely well linked to popular blogs
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 885.81 893.97 <o,f0,male> this was the ultimate kind of one man one modem democracy where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard and so the question is why is this happening
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 902.52 912.46 <o,f0,male> that people are working on within seconds of clay publishing this piece people started working on changing the underlying rules of the system so that a different shape would start appearing and basically
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 912.75 919.69 <o,f0,male> the shape appears largely because of a kind of a first mover advantage if you're the first site there everybody links to you if you're the second site there most people link to you
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 931.16 940.70 <o,f0,male> after he published his piece was something that basically just gave a new kind of priority to newcomers and he started looking at interesting newcomers that don't have a lot of links that suddenly get
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 941.20 949.66 <o,f0,male> a bunch of links in the last twenty four hours so in a sense bursty weblogs coming from new voices so he 's working on a tool right there that can actually
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 950.04 960.93 <o,f0,male> change the overall system and it creates a kind of planned emergence you're not totally in control but you're changing the underlying rules in interesting ways because you have an end result which is maybe a more democratic spread of
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 961.54 974.82 <o,f0,male> so the most amazing thing about this and i'll end on this note is most emergent systems most self organizing systems are not made up of component parts that are capable of looking at the overall pattern and changing their behavior based on whether they like the pattern or not
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 975.34 984.71 <o,f0,male> so the most wonderful thing i think about this whole debate about power laws and software that could change it is the fact that we're having the conversation i hope it continues here thanks a lot
