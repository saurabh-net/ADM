BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 16.52 24.62 <o,f0,male> napot pacak which as somebody here must surely know means what 's up guys in magyar that peculiar
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 24.84 33.42 <o,f0,male> non indo european language spoken by hungarians for which given the fact that cognitive diversity is at least as threatened as biodiversity on this planet
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 33.90 38.24 <o,f0,male> few would have imagined much of a future even a century or two ago but there it is
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 40.13 50.37 <o,f0,male> i said somebody here must surely know because despite the fact that there aren't that many hungarians to begin with and the further fact that so far as i know there's not a drop of hungarian blood
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 51.42 59.98 <o,f0,male> at every critical juncture of my life there has been a hungarian friend or mentor there beside me i even have dreams that take place in landscapes
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 61.05 66.97 <o,f0,male> as the landscapes of hungarian films especially the early movies of miklos jancso so
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 67.46 75.15 <o,f0,male> how do i explain this mysterious affinity maybe it's because my native state of south carolina
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 75.50 87.89 <o,f0,male> which is not much smaller than present day hungary once imagined a future for itself as an independent country and as a consequence of that presumption my hometown was burned to the ground by an invading army
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 88.14 98.80 <o,f0,male> an experience that has befallen many a hungarian town and village throughout its long and troubled history or maybe it's because when i was a teenager back in the fifties my uncle henry
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 99.15 110.26 <o,f0,male> having denounced the ku klux klan and having been bombed for his trouble and had crosses burned in his yard living under death threat took his wife and children to massachusetts for safety and went back to south carolina to
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 126.45 135.24 <o,f0,male> it seems to me that this hungarian presence in my life is difficult to account for but ultimately
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 135.55 144.62 <o,f0,male> i ascribe it to an admiration for people with a complex moral awareness with a heritage of guilt and defeat matched by defiance and bravado
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 144.84 152.82 <o,f0,male> it's not a typical mindset for most americans but it is perforce typical of virtually all hungarians so yo napot
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 154.49 166.43 <o,f0,male> i went back to south carolina after some fifteen years amid the alien corn at the tail end of the nineteen sixties with the reckless condescension of that era thinking i would save my people
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 167.13 173.81 <o,f0,male> never mind the fact that they were slow to acknowledge they needed saving i labored in that vineyard for a quarter century before
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 182.51 194.47 <o,f0,male> i knew nothing about wofford and even less about methodism but i was reassured on the first day that i taught at wofford college to find among the auditors in my classroom a ninety year old hungarian
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 204.32 216.93 <o,f0,male> he was a puckish widower whose wife and children were dead and whose grandchildren lived far away in appearance he resembled mahatma gandhi minus the loincloth plus orthopedic boots
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 225.37 233.12 <o,f0,male> he was ostracized as a child not because he was a jew his parents weren't very religious anyhow but because he had been born with two club feet
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 233.47 241.88 <o,f0,male> a condition which in those days required institutionalization and a succession of painful operations between the ages of one and eleven
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 242.44 254.34 <o,f0,male> he went to the commercial business high school as a young man in budapest and there he was as smart as he was modest and he enjoyed a considerable success and after graduation when he went into textile engineering
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 254.51 264.07 <o,f0,male> the success continued he built one plant after another he married and had two sons he had friends in high places who assured him that he was of great value to the economy
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 265.67 271.97 <o,f0,male> he had left instructions to have done he was summoned in the middle of the night by the night watchman at one of his plants
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 285.68 294.42 <o,f0,male> but why do you steal from me if you need money you have only to ask the night watchman seeing how things were going and waxing indignant said well we're going to call
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 302.46 311.40 <o,f0,male> well maybe he was too trusting because he stayed where he was long after the nazi anschluss in austria and even after the arrests and deportations began
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 311.57 320.12 <o,f0,male> in budapest he took the simple precaution of having cyanide capsules placed in lockets that could be worn about the necks of himself and his family
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 335.04 343.20 <o,f0,male> but none who entered that death house had ever come out alive and in a twist you would not believe in a steven spielberg film
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 343.65 351.34 <o,f0,male> the gauleiter who was overseeing this brutal beating was the very same thief who had stolen socks from mister teszler 's hosiery mill
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 352.30 355.36 <o,f0,male> it was a brutal beating and midway through
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 367.64 371.72 <o,f0,male> and whispered into mister teszler 's ear no do not take the capsule
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 372.27 384.23 <o,f0,male> help is on the way and then resumed the beating but help help was on the way and shortly afterward a car arrived from the swiss embassy they were spirited to safety they were reclassified as yugoslav citizens
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 384.55 392.64 <o,f0,male> and they managed to stay one step ahead of their pursuers for the duration of the war surviving burnings and bombings and at the end of the war arrest by the soviets
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 401.92 411.35 <o,f0,male> and then to the center of the textile industry in the american south which as chance would have it was spartanburg south carolina the location of wofford college and there
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 411.78 422.22 <o,f0,male> mister teszler began all over again and once again achieved immense success especially after he invented a process for manufacturing a new fabric called double knit
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 423.01 433.51 <o,f0,male> and then then in the late nineteen fifties in the aftermath of brown versus board of education when the klan was resurgent all over the south mister teszler said
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 434.05 436.34 <o,f0,male> i have heard this talk before
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 437.14 442.22 <o,f0,male> and he called his top assistant to him and asked where would you say in this region
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 456.20 468.45 <o,f0,male> he was told and shortly afterwards mister teszler received a visit from the white mayor of kings mountain now you should know that at that time the textile industry in the south was notoriously segregated
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 482.11 491.36 <o,f0,male> he also received a visit from the leader of the black community a minister who said mister teszler i sure hope you're going to hire some black workers for this new plant of yours he got the same answer
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 491.70 501.93 <o,f0,male> you bring the best workers you can find and if they are good enough i will hire them as it happens the black minister did his job better than the white mayor but that's neither here or there misterteszler hired sixteen
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 503.11 513.21 <o,f0,male> eight white eight black they were to be his seed group his future foremen he had installed the heavy equipment for his new process in an abandoned store in the vicinity of kings mountain
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 513.71 518.24 <o,f0,male> and for two months these sixteen men would live and work together mastering the new process
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 519.33 528.96 <o,f0,male> he gathered them together after an initial tour of the facility and asked if there were any questions there was hemming and hawing and shuffling of feet and then one of the white workers stepped forward and said well yeah
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 530.04 536.39 <o,f0,female> this place and there's only one place to sleep there's only one place to eat there's only one bathroom
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 538.92 541.21 <o,f0,female> is this plant going to be integrated or what
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 553.69 566.56 <o,f0,male> two months later when the main plant opened and hundreds of new workers white and black poured in to see the facility for the first time they were met by the sixteen foremen white and black standing shoulder to shoulder
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 567.47 575.75 <o,f0,male> the facility and were asked if there were any questions and inevitably the same question arose is this plant integrated or what one of the white foremen stepped
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 576.96 586.63 <o,f0,male> you are being paid twice the wages of any other workers in this industry in this region and this is how we do business do you have any other
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 587.31 594.69 <o,f0,male> and there were none in one fell swoop mister teszler had integrated the textile industry in that part of the south
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 594.84 601.91 <o,f0,male> it was an achievement worthy of mahatma gandhi conducted with the shrewdness of a lawyer and the idealism of a saint
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 603.52 605.56 <o,f0,male> his eighties mister teszler
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 605.81 618.49 <o,f0,male> having retired from the textile industry adopted wofford college auditing courses every semester and because he had a tendency to kiss anything that moved becoming affectionately known as opi which is
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 628.95 638.88 <o,f0,male> the faculty decided to honor itself by naming mister teszler professor of the college partly because at that point he had already taken all of the courses of the catalog but mainly
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 640.66 641.37 <o,f0,male> he was so
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 642.69 644.86 <o,f0,male> wiser than any one of us
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 645.51 653.09 <o,f0,male> to me it was immensely reassuring that the presiding spirit of this little methodist college in upstate south carolina
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 653.88 656.94 <o,f0,male> was a holocaust survivor from central europe
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 658.51 667.88 <o,f0,male> he was indeed but he also had a wonderful sense of humor and once for an interdisciplinary class i was screening the opening segment of ingmar bergman 's the seventh seal
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 668.03 678.25 <o,f0,male> as the medieval knight antonius blok returned from the wild goose chase of the crusades and arrived on the rocky shore of sweden only to find the specter of death waiting for him
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 678.98 688.60 <o,f0,male> mister teszler sat in the dark with his fellow students and as death opened his cloak to embrace the knight in a ghastly embrace i heard mister teszler 's
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 696.41 700.65 <o,f0,male> but it was music that was his greatest passion especially opera
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 701.30 714.35 <o,f0,male> and on the first occasion that i visited his house he gave me honor of deciding what piece of music we would listen to and i delighted him by rejecting cavalerria rusticana in favor of bela bartok 's bluebeard 's castle
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 714.91 727.69 <o,f0,male> i love bartok 's music as did mister teszler and he had virtually every recording of bartok 's music ever issued and it was at his house that i heard for the first time bartok 's third piano concerto and learned from mister teszler
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 728.10 736.60 <o,f0,male> that it had been composed in nearby asheville north carolina in the last year of the composer 's life he was dying of leukemia and he knew it
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 737.34 745.01 <o,f0,male> and he dedicated this concerto to his wife dita who was herself a concert pianist and into the slow second movement
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 745.41 755.83 <o,f0,male> marked adagio religioso he incorporated the sounds of birdsong that he heard outside his window in what he knew would be his last spring he was imagining a future
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 756.40 767.67 <o,f0,male> for her in which he would play no part and clearly clearly this composition is his final statement to to her it was first performed after his death
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 768.27 772.45 <o,f0,male> and through her to the world and just as clearly it is saying
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 777.42 779.03 <o,f0,male> whenever you hear this
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 781.71 791.46 <o,f0,male> it was only after mister teszler 's death that i learned that the marker on the grave of bela bartok in hartsdale new york was paid for by
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 795.96 800.37 <o,f0,male> not long before mister teszler a s own death at the age of ninety seven
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 800.94 808.97 <o,f0,male> he heard me hold forth on human iniquity i delivered a lecture in which i described history as on the whole a tidal wave of human suffering
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 816.24 816.42 <o,f0,male> you
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 818.18 821.05 <o,f0,male> human beings are fundamentally good
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 822.73 834.94 <o,f0,male> and i made a vow to myself then and there that if this man who had such cause to think otherwise had reached that conclusion i would not presume to differ until he released me from my vow and
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 835.84 838.35 <o,f0,male> now he 's dead so i'm stuck with my vow
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 839.41 840.10 <o,f0,male> yo napot
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 841.71 851.43 <o,f0,male> i thought my skein of hungarian mentors had come to an end but almost immediately i met francis robicsek a hungarian doctor
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 852.13 866.55 <o,f0,male> actually a heart surgeon in charlotte north carolina then in his late seventies who had been a pioneer in open heart surgery and tinkering away in his garage behind his house had invented many of the devices that are standard parts of those procedures
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 866.99 875.90 <o,f0,male> he 's also a prodigious art collector beginning as an intern in budapest by collecting sixteenth and seventeenth century dutch art and hungarian painting
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 876.28 882.55 <o,f0,male> and when he came to this country moving on to spanish colonial art russian icons and finally
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 882.89 895.48 <o,f0,male> mayan ceramics he 's the author of seven books six of them on mayan ceramics it was he who broke the mayan codex enabling scholars to relate the pictographs on mayan ceramics to the hieroglyphs of the mayan script
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 904.25 913.96 <o,f0,male> and doctor robicsek said with obvious pride now for the piece de resistance and he opened the door and we walked into a windowless twenty by twenty foot room
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 914.28 926.05 <o,f0,male> with shelves from floor to ceiling and crammed on every shelf his collection of mayan ceramics now i know absolutely nothing about mayan ceramics but i wanted to be as ingratiating as possible so i said but doctor
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 927.12 929.09 <o,f0,male> this is absolutely dazzling
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 929.57 937.31 <o,f0,male> yes he said that is what the louvre said they would not leave me alone until i let them have a piece but it was not a good one
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 938.32 947.29 <o,f0,male> well it occurred to me that i should invite doctor robicsek to lecture at wofford college on what else leonardo da vinci and further
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 947.58 956.04 <o,f0,male> i should invite him to meet my oldest trustee who had majored in french history at yale some seventy odd years before and at eighty nine
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 957.78 965.22 <o,f0,male> the world 's largest privately owned textile empire with an iron hand his name is roger milliken and
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 965.68 975.20 <o,f0,male> milliken agreed and doctor robicsek agreed and doctor robicsek visited and delivered the lecture and it was a dazzling success and afterwards we convened at the president 's house
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 975.40 988.34 <o,f0,male> with doctor robicsek on one hand mister milliken on the other and it was only at that moment as we were sitting down to dinner that i recognized the enormity of the risk i had created because to bring these two titans these two masters of the universe together
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 1000.63 1005.52 <o,f0,male> meal and then they got into a furious argument and what they were arguing about was this
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 1006.63 1010.23 <o,f0,male> whether the second harry potter movie was as good as the first
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 1029.38 1037.74 <o,f0,male> and doctor robicsek reeled back in his chair but quickly gathered his wits leaned forward and said well that is true but i'll bet you went to the movie with a grandchild
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 1038.71 1045.17 <o,f0,male> i did conceded mister milliken aha said doctor robicsek i went to the movie all by myself
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 1047.88 1057.94 <o,f0,male> and i realized in this moment of revelation that what these two men were revealing was the secret of their extraordinary success each in his own right
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 1058.43 1071.73 <o,f0,male> and it lay precisely in that insatiable curiosity that irrepressible desire to know no matter what the subject no matter what the cost even at a time when the keepers of the doomsday clock are willing to bet even
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 1085.67 1091.56 <o,f0,female> this is what i'm passionate about it is precisely this it is this
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 1094.71 1104.24 <o,f0,male> undaunted appetite for learning and experience no matter how risible no matter how esoteric no matter how seditious it might seem
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 1104.77 1112.86 <o,f0,male> this defines the imagined futures of our fellow hungarians robicsek and teszler and bartok
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 1113.63 1114.98 <o,f0,male> as it does my own
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 1115.53 1121.08 <o,f0,male> as it does i suspect that of everybody here to which i need only add
BenDunlap_2007 1 BenDunlap_2007 1125.67 1129.06 <o,f0,female> this is our task we know it will be hard
