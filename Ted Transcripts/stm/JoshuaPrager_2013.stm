JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 23.58 25.11 <o,f0,male> but who had changed my life
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 25.5 28.3 <o,f0,male> i didn 't have a phone number to call to say i was coming
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 28.75 33.72 <o,f0,male> i didn 't have an exact address but i knew his name abed
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 33.9 36.72 <o,f0,male> i knew that he lived in a town of fifteen thousand
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 43.36 49.32 <o,f0,male> he broke my neck and so on an overcast morning in january i headed north
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 49.77 66.85 <o,f0,male> off in a silver chevy to find a man and some peace the road dropped and i exited jerusalem i then rounded the very bend where his blue truck heavy with four tons of floor tiles had borne down with great speed onto the back left corner of the minibus where i sat
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 67.28 70.3 <o,f0,male> i was then nineteen years old
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 70.66 74.1 <o,f0,male> i 'd grown five inches and done some twenty thousand pushups
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 78.95 83.17 <o,f0,male> playing basketball with friends into the wee hours of a may morning
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 83.6 89.63 <o,f0,male> i palmed the ball in my large right hand and when that hand reached the rim i felt invincible
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 90.51 93.52 <o,f0,male> i was off in the bus to get the pizza i 'd won on the court
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 94.52 96.32 <o,f0,male> i didn 't see abed coming
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 96.75 106.99 <o,f0,male> from my seat i was looking up at a stone town on a hilltop bright in the noontime sun when from behind there was a great bang as loud and violent as a bomb
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 107.58 112.81 <o,f0,male> my head snapped back over my red seat my eardrum blew my shoes flew off
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 113.32 125.59 <o,f0,male> i flew too my head bobbing on broken bones and when i landed i was a quadriplegic over the coming months i learned to breathe on my own then to sit and to stand and to walk
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 125.95 128.37 <o,f0,male> but my body was now divided vertically
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 128.53 134.66 <o,f0,male> i was a hemiplegic and back home in new york i used a wheelchair for four years
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 140.14 144.97 <o,f0,male> there i rose from my chair for good i leaned on my cane and i looked
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 151.49 154.18 <o,f0,male> and when i saw this photograph
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 156.51 159.14 <o,f0,male> i didn 't see a bloody and unmoving body
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 159.59 163.16 <o,f0,male> i saw the healthy bulk of a left deltoid
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 163.3 165.43 <o,f0,male> and i mourned that it was lost
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 168.29 170.22 <o,f0,male> but was now impossible
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 175.66 179.79 <o,f0,male> it was then i read the testimony that abed gave the morning after the crash
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 184.09 186.97 <o,f0,male> reading his words i welled with anger
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 187.27 193.11 <o,f0,male> it was the first time i 'd felt anger toward this man and it came from magical thinking
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 193.38 195.6 <o,f0,male> on this xeroxed piece of paper
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 199.2 204.65 <o,f0,male> abed could still turn his wheel left so that i would see him whoosh by out my window
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 204.69 206.51 <o,f0,male> and i would remain whole
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 206.99 210.51 <o,f0,male> be careful abed look out slow down
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 211.29 213.04 <o,f0,male> but abed did not slow
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 213.74 216.92 <o,f0,male> and on that xeroxed piece of paper my neck again broke
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 216.97 219.59 <o,f0,male> and again i was left without anger
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 221.37 223.4 <o,f0,male> i decided to find abed
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 247.18 250.71 <o,f0,male> the quadriplegia and the catheters the insecurity and the loss
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 251.17 253.9 <o,f0,male> and when abed went on about how hurt he was in the crash
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 254.35 258.6 <o,f0,male> i didn 't say that i knew from the police report that he 'd escaped serious injury
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 259.17 261.98 <o,f0,male> i said i wanted to meet
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 262.67 265.18 <o,f0,male> abed said that i should call back in a few weeks
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 265.86 270.04 <o,f0,male> and when i did and a recording told me that his number was disconnected
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 277.76 279.62 <o,f0,male> i walked with my cane
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 284.33 286.36 <o,f0,male> i pitched overhand
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 286.62 296.29 <o,f0,male> in a weekly softball game that i started in central park and home in new york i became a journalist and an author typing hundreds of thousands of words with one finger
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 297.15 304.72 <o,f0,male> a friend pointed out to me that all of my big stories mirrored my own each centering on a life that had changed in an instant
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 314.44 316.87 <o,f0,male> i 'd been working through my lot after all
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 317.74 323.82 <o,f0,male> still abed was far from my mind when last year i returned to israel to write of the crash
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 324.34 327.16 <o,f0,male> and the book i then wrote half life
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 332.47 334.85 <o,f0,male> and finally i understood why
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 335.19 338.03 <o,f0,male> to hear this man say two words
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 343.6 348.02 <o,f0,male> and so i got a cop to confirm that abed still lived somewhere in his same town
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 348.36 355.02 <o,f0,male> and i was now driving to it with a potted yellow rose in the back seat when suddenly flowers seemed a ridiculous offering
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 355.75 358.58 <o,f0,male> but what to get the man who broke your fucking neck
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 375.28 376.82 <o,f0,male> abed would hug me
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 377.16 378.88 <o,f0,male> abed would spit at me
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 379.6 382.05 <o,f0,male> abed would say i 'm sorry
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 383.34 392.21 <o,f0,male> i then began to wonder as i had many times before how my life would have been different had this man not injured me had my genes been fed a different helping of experience
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 392.91 394.5 <o,f0,male> who was i
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 395.33 397.55 <o,f0,male> was i who i had been before the crash
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 397.73 401.32 <o,f0,male> before this road divided my life like the spine of an open book
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 402.01 403.89 <o,f0,male> was i what had been done to me
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 404.09 406.69 <o,f0,male> were all of us the results of things done to us
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 417.26 423.16 <o,f0,male> it seemed that we could be nothing more than genes and experience but how to tease out the one from the other
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 424.05 433.92 <o,f0,male> as yeats put that same universal question o body swayed to music o brightening glance how can we know the dancer from the dance
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 436.24 438.33 <o,f0,male> i 'd been driving for an hour
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 438.57 441.9 <o,f0,male> when i looked in my rearview mirror and saw my own brightening glance
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 442.26 456.51 <o,f0,male> the light my eyes had carried for as long as they had been blue the predispositions and impulses that had propelled me as a toddler to try and slip over a boat into a chicago lake that had propelled me as a teen to jump into wild cape cod bay after a hurricane
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 457.97 464.69 <o,f0,male> but i also saw in my reflection that had abed not injured me i would now in all likelihood be a doctor
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 476.32 483.55 <o,f0,male> the frequent furl of five fingers the chips in my teeth come from biting at all the many things a solitary hand cannot open
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 484.3 487.95 <o,f0,male> the dancer and the dance were hopelessly entwined
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 489.69 496.06 <o,f0,male> it was approaching eleven when i exited right toward afula and passed a large quarry and was soon in kfar kara
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 496.45 498.23 <o,f0,male> i felt a pang of nerves
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 498.87 500.94 <o,f0,male> but chopin was on the radio
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 500.95 507.15 <o,f0,male> seven beautiful mazurkas and i pulled into a lot by a gas station to listen and to calm
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 508.61 514.14 <o,f0,male> i 'd been told that in an arab town one need only mention the name of a local and it will be recognized
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 514.85 520.77 <o,f0,male> and i was mentioning abed and myself noting deliberately that i was here in peace to the people in this town
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 521.34 524.5 <o,f0,male> when i met mohamed outside a post office at noon
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 524.98 526.5 <o,f0,male> he listened to me
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 527.23 533.17 <o,f0,male> you know it was most often when speaking to people that i wondered where i ended and my disability began
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 534.07 536.58 <o,f0,male> for many people told me what they told no one else
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 543.63 548.71 <o,f0,male> she told me that best she could tell her tears had had something to do with my being happy and strong
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 556.01 560.98 <o,f0,male> but i was now me despite a limp and that i suppose was what now made me me
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 562.77 566.8 <o,f0,male> anyway mohamed told me what perhaps he would not have told another stranger
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 567.05 570.38 <o,f0,male> he led me to a house of cream stucco then drove off
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 571.09 573.76 <o,f0,male> and as i sat contemplating what to say
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 574.08 577.23 <o,f0,male> a woman approached in a black shawl and black robe
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 577.7 581.35 <o,f0,male> i stepped from my car and said shalom and identified myself
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 581.59 585.26 <o,f0,male> and she told me that her husband abed would be home from work in four hours
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 585.91 592.11 <o,f0,male> her hebrew was not good and she later confessed that she thought that i had come to install the internet
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 595.72 601.86 <o,f0,male> i drove off and returned at four thirty thankful to the minaret up the road that helped me find my way back
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 609.56 611.98 <o,f0,male> an average looking man of average size
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 629.63 633.8 <o,f0,male> and he told me i was a guest in his home and we sat beside one another on a fabric couch
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 634.59 641.21 <o,f0,male> it was then that abed resumed at once the tale of woe he had begun over the phone sixteen years before
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 642.63 645.23 <o,f0,male> he 'd just had surgery on his eyes he said
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 645.45 649.88 <o,f0,male> he had problems with his side and his legs too and oh he 'd lost his teeth in the crash
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 653.28 658.22 <o,f0,male> abed then rose and turned on the tv so that i wouldn 't be alone when he left the room
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 658.51 660.71 <o,f0,male> and returned with polaroids of the crash
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 660.82 662.46 <o,f0,male> and his old driver 's license
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 663.97 665.92 <o,f0,female> i was handsome he said
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 667.13 672.05 <o,f0,male> we looked down at his laminated mug abed had been less handsome than substantial
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 672.29 683.8 <o,f0,male> with thick black hair and a full face and a wide neck it was this youth who on may sixteen one thousand nine hundred and ninety had broken two necks including mine and bruised one brain and taken one life
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 685.13 697.57 <o,f0,male> twenty one years later he was now thinner than his wife his skin slack on his face and looking at abed looking at his young self i remembered looking at that photograph of my young self after the crash and recognized his longing
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 698.81 701.68 <o,f0,male> the crash changed both of our lives i said
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 705.8 710.37 <o,f0,male> and said that the crash was the fault of a bus driver in the left lane who did not let him pass
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 711.31 719.59 <o,f0,male> i did not want to recap the crash with abed i 'd hoped for something simpler to exchange a turkish dessert for two words and be on my way
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 720.58 724.99 <o,f0,male> and so i didn 't point out that in his own testimony the morning after the crash
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 733.95 737.76 <o,f0,male> and so i now went looking for remorse and threw truth under the bus
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 738.6 744.98 <o,f0,male> i understand i said that the crash was not your fault but does it make you sad that others suffered
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 746.45 749.05 <o,f0,male> abed spoke three quick words yes
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 757.19 760.29 <o,f0,male> before the crash and so god had ordained the crash
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 760.53 763.71 <o,f0,male> but now he said he was religious and god was pleased
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 767.49 772.84 <o,f0,male> news on the tv of a car wreck that hours before had killed three people up north
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 773.44 775.06 <o,f0,male> we looked up at the wreckage
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 775.81 777.73 <o,f0,male> strange i said
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 778.39 780.51 <o,f0,male> strange he agreed
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 781.63 784.32 <o,f0,male> i had the thought that there on route eight hundred and four
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 784.51 792.38 <o,f0,male> there were perpetrators and victims dyads bound by a crash some as had abed would forget the date some as had i would remember
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 796.91 802.14 <o,f0,male> it is a pity he said that the police in this country are not tough enough on bad drivers
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 804.09 805.7 <o,f0,female> i was baffled
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 807.07 809.23 <o,f0,male> abed had said something remarkable
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 813.49 817.11 <o,f0,male> was it evidence of guilt an assertion that he should have been put away longer
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 819.48 821.39 <o,f0,male> lost his truck license for a decade
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 826.9 829.79 <o,f0,male> i thought you had a few driving issues before the crash
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 830.6 833.92 <o,f0,male> well he said i once went sixty in a forty
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 834.69 838.17 <o,f0,male> and so twenty seven violations
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 838.4 846.71 <o,f0,male> driving through a red light driving at excessive speed driving on the wrong side of a barrier and finally riding his brakes down that hill reduced to one
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 847.36 853.91 <o,f0,male> and it was then i understood that no matter how stark the reality the human being fits it into a narrative that is palatable
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 854.3 857.76 <o,f0,male> the goat becomes the hero the perpetrator becomes the victim
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 857.94 862.26 <o,f0,male> it was then i understood that abed would never apologize
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 865.02 867.22 <o,f0,female> abed and i sat with our coffee
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 868.4 870.51 <o,f0,male> we 'd spent ninety minutes together
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 870.63 872.2 <o,f0,male> and he was now known to me
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 873.16 877.14 <o,f0,male> he was not a particularly bad man or a particularly good man
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 877.93 879.65 <o,f0,male> he was a limited man
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 882.93 887.66 <o,f0,male> with a nod to jewish custom he told me that i should live to be one hundred and twenty years old
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 888.22 896.3 <o,f0,male> but it was hard for me to relate to one who had so completely washed his hands of his own calamitous doing to one whose life was so unexamined
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 897.42 901.48 <o,f0,male> that he said he thought two people had died in the crash
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 908.59 912.12 <o,f0,male> i wished to tell him that were he to acknowledge my disability
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 919.64 922.99 <o,f0,male> people don 't know that they have lived through worse
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 932.26 937.67 <o,f0,male> i wished to tell him that what makes most of us who we are most of all
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 954.44 962.68 <o,f0,male> i wished to tell him that not only paralyzers and paralyzees must evolve reconcile to reality but we all must
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 962.99 966.55 <o,f0,male> the aging and the anxious and the divorced
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 966.56 969.36 <o,f0,male> and the balding and the bankrupt
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 983.83 987.02 <o,f0,male> but that this natural world still has many glories
JoshuaPrager_2013 1 JoshuaPrager_2013 988.23 990.22 <o,f0,male> i wished to tell him that in the end
