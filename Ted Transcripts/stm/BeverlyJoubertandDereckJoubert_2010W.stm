BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 18.34 24.59 <o,f0,female> about the african wilderness and protecting the african wilderness and so what we've done is we've focused on
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 26.53 28.62 <o,f0,female> and i know in the light of
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 33.29 33.76 <o,f0,female> one would
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 37.99 45.59 <o,f0,female> today we're here to share with you a message that we have learned from a very important and special character this
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 47.47 53.55 <o,f0,male> well our lives have basically been like a super long episode of csi something like twenty eight years
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 79.27 87.73 <o,f0,male> the same tree that we found her mother in and her grandmother and she took us on a journey and revealed something very special to us
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 89.76 97.93 <o,f0,male> eight days old and the minute we found this leopard we realized that we needed to move in and so we basically stayed with this leopard for the next four
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 101.12 113.69 <o,f0,male> getting to know her that individual personality of hers and really coming to know her now i'm destined to spend a lot of time with some unique
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 114.32 120.03 <o,f0,male> very very special individualistic and often seductive female characters
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 122.98 124.96 <o,f0,male> clearly one of them and
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 126.73 129.65 <o,f0,male> this little leopard legadema is another and she changed our lives
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 130.79 140.05 <o,f0,female> well we certainly did spend a lot of time with her in fact more time than even her mother did when her mother would go off hunting we would stay and film and early on
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 140.58 151.04 <o,f0,female> a lightning bolt hit a tree twenty paces away from us it was frightening and it showered us with leaves and a pungent smell and of course we were standing for
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 163.49 171.19 <o,f0,female> well we needn't have worried she came charging out of the thicket straight towards us sat next to us shivering
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 171.64 178.21 <o,f0,female> with her back towards dereck and looking out and actually from that day on she's been comfortable with us
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 179.03 183.58 <o,f0,female> so we felt that that day was the day that she really earned her name we called
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 185.12 186.65 <o,f0,female> which means light from the sky
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 187.66 197.36 <o,f0,male> now we've found these individualisms in all sorts of animals in particular in the cats this particular one is called eetwidomayloh he who greets with fire
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 197.66 207.90 <o,f0,male> and you can just see that about him you know that's his character but only by getting up close to these animals and spending time with them can we actually even reach out and dig out these personal characters that
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 208.88 217.44 <o,f0,female> but through our investigation we have to seek the wildest places in africa and right now this is in the okavango delta in botswana
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 218.04 225.21 <o,f0,female> yes it is swamp we live in the swamp in a tent but i must tell you everyday is exhilarating but also our hearts are in
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 237.15 249.78 <o,f0,male> now one of the big things of course everybody knows that cats hate water and so this was a real revelation for us and we could only find this by pushing ourselves by going where no sane person should go
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 271.96 273.73 <o,f0,female> around we don't always get
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 277.02 281.42 <o,f0,female> we seriously underestimated the depth we got deeper and deeper until it
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 294.39 299.24 <o,f0,female> we drowned our pride i must tell you which was really serious and we seized the
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 301.36 307.85 <o,f0,male> and of course one of the rules that we have in the vehicle is that he who drowns the vehicle gets to swim with the crocodiles
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 309.83 315.30 <o,f0,male> notice also that all of these images here are taken from the top angle by beverly the dry top angle
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 318.77 325.42 <o,f0,male> all the places we get stuck in really have great views and it wasn't a moment and these lions came back towards us and beverly was able to get a great
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 327.36 336.38 <o,f0,female> but we truly do spend day and night trying to capture unique footage and twenty years ago we did a film called eternal enemies
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 355.64 366.27 <o,f0,male> it was amazing because you can see that this lion is doing exactly what his name eetwidomayloh represents he 's focused on this hyena and he is going to get it
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 372.42 385.08 <o,f0,male> but that 's i think what this is all about is that these individuals have these personalities and characters but for us to get them not only do we push ourselves but we live by certain rules of engagement which mean we can't interfere
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 395.98 403.10 <o,f0,female> so as dereck says we have to work through extremes extreme temperatures push ourselves at night sleep deprivation
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 405.30 410.35 <o,f0,female> on the edge through a large part of the time for ten years we tried to
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 420.11 422.34 <o,f0,female> that it was a disturbing night for me
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 422.89 426.84 <o,f0,female> i had tears rolling down my cheeks i was shaking with anxiety
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 427.63 434.69 <o,f0,female> but i knew that to capture something that had never been seen before had never been documented and i do believe you should stay with us
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 437.11 443.89 <o,f0,male> the amazing thing about these moments and this is probably a highlight of our career is that you never know how it's going to end
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 450.79 460.09 <o,f0,male> many people believe in fact that death begins in the eyes not in the heart not in the lungs and that's when people give up hope or when any life form gives up
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 460.92 469.23 <o,f0,male> and you can see the start of it here this elephant against overwhelming odds simply gives up
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 482.24 483.24 <o,f0,male> but by the same token
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 488.98 493.52 <o,f0,male> so just when you think it's all over something else happens some spark gets into
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 493.92 505.34 <o,f0,male> some sort of will to fight that iron will that we all have that this elephant has that conservation has that big cats have everything has that will
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 505.73 510.46 <o,f0,male> to survive to fight to push through that mental barrier and to keep going
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 512.38 520.00 <o,f0,male> and for us in many ways this elephant has become a symbol of inspiration for us a symbol of that hope as we go forward in our
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 546.73 554.05 <o,f0,male> this is about couples working together and so i do need to say that within the vehicle we have quite strict territories beverly and
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 564.86 573.41 <o,f0,female> but when this little cub saw that i had vacated my seat and climbed to the back to get some camera gear she came in like a curious cat to come and
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 574.34 581.43 <o,f0,female> it was phenomenal and we felt grateful that she trusted us to that extent but at the same time we were concerned
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 581.67 589.16 <o,f0,female> that if she created this as a habit and jumped into somebody else's car it might not turn out the same way she might get shot for that
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 589.67 597.16 <o,f0,female> so we knew we had to react quickly and the only way we thought we could without scaring her
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 626.66 635.12 <o,f0,female> were excited i was like watching a graduation ceremony we felt like we were surrogate parents and of course we knew now that she was going to survive
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 635.61 645.01 <o,f0,female> but only when we saw the tiny baby baboon clinging to the mother 's fur did we realize that something very unique was taking place here with
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 652.99 656.17 <o,f0,female> the next couple of hours was very unique
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 657.97 663.51 <o,f0,female> it was absolutely amazing when she picked it up to safety protecting it from the hyena
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 666.09 668.82 <o,f0,female> over the next five hours she took care of it
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 669.43 673.44 <o,f0,female> we realized that we actually don't know everything and that
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 680.29 681.41 <o,f0,male> so she was a little bit
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 687.30 689.23 <o,f0,male> but in fact
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 690.73 694.78 <o,f0,male> what we were seeing here was interesting because she is a
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 695.66 706.16 <o,f0,male> wanting to play but she was also a predator needing to kill and yet conflicted in some way because she was also an emerging mother she had this maternal instinct
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 718.97 727.38 <o,f0,female> and of course through the night they lay together they ended up sleeping for hours but i have to tell you everybody always asks what happened to the baby baboon
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 729.16 732.22 <o,f0,female> die and we suspect it was from the freezing
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 734.13 746.92 <o,f0,male> so at this stage i guess we had very very firm ideas on what conservation meant we had to deal with these individual personalities we had to deal with them with respect and celebrate them
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 747.34 754.82 <o,f0,male> and so we with the national geographic formed the big cats initiative to march forward into conservation taking care of the big cats that we loved
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 755.22 766.24 <o,f0,male> and then had an opportunity to look back over the last fifty years to see how well we had all collectively been doing so when beverly and i were born there were four hundred and fifty thousand lions and today there are twenty
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 774.16 781.65 <o,f0,female> and then cheetahs have crashed all the way down to twelve thousand leopards have plummeted from seven hundred thousand down to
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 782.68 789.15 <o,f0,female> fifty thousand now in the extraordinary time that we have worked with legadema which is really over a five year period
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 789.80 798.58 <o,f0,female> ten thousand leopards were legally shot by safari hunters and that's not the only leopards that were being killed through that period
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 798.92 808.03 <o,f0,female> an immense amount of poaching as well and so possibly the same amount it's simply not sustainable we admire them and we fear them
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 810.45 811.84 <o,f0,female> we want to steal their power
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 815.60 826.40 <o,f0,female> it used to be the time where only kings wore a leopard skin but now throughout rituals and ceremonies traditional healers and ministers and of course looking at
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 828.33 835.90 <o,f0,female> that has been skinned it eerily reminds me of a human hand and that's ironic because their fate is in our hands
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 836.66 845.33 <o,f0,male> a burgeoning bone trade south africa just released some lion bones onto the market lion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same and so in
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 845.99 854.35 <o,f0,male> the lion bone industry is going to wipe out all the tigers so we have a real problem here no more so than the lions
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 854.72 866.84 <o,f0,male> the male lions so the twenty thousand lion figure you just saw is actually a red herring because there may be three or four thousand male lions and they all are actually infected with the same disease
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 872.20 877.18 <o,f0,male> because there's a sport there's an activity going on that we're all aware of that we
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 886.90 889.48 <o,f0,female> and you have to know that when a male lion is
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 895.10 902.63 <o,f0,female> into the area and takes over the pride and of course first of all kills all the cubs and possibly some of the females that
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 904.01 912.99 <o,f0,female> so we've estimated that between twenty to thirty lions are killed when one lion is hanging on a wall somewhere in a far off place
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 913.91 923.79 <o,f0,male> so what our investigations have shown is that these lions are essential they're essential to the habitat it they disappear whole ecosystems in africa disappear
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 924.30 935.40 <o,f0,male> an eighty billion dollar a year eco tourism revenue stream into africa so this is not just a concern about lions it's a concern about communities in africa as well
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 936.29 949.54 <o,f0,male> if they disappear all of that goes away but what i'm more concerned about in many ways is that as we de link ourselves from nature as we de link ourselves spiritually from these animals we
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 960.16 962.48 <o,f0,female> so you have to know looking into the eyes of
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 963.60 971.96 <o,f0,female> and leopards right now it is all about critical awareness and so what we are doing in february we're bringing out a film called the last
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 973.08 979.58 <o,f0,female> and the last lion is exactly what is happening right now that is the situation we're in the last
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 980.28 994.03 <o,f0,female> that is if we don't take action and do something these plains will be completely devoid of big cats and then in turn everything else will disappear and simply if we can't protect them we're going to have a job protecting ourselves as well
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 994.89 1003.66 <o,f0,male> and in fact that original thing that we spoke about and designed our lives by that conservation was all about respect and celebration
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1 BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W 1003.95 1013.94 <o,f0,male> is probably true that's really what it needs we need it we respect and celebrate each other as a man and a woman as a community and as part of this planet
