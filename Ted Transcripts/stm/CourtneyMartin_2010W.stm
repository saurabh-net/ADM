CourtneyMartin_2010W 1 CourtneyMartin_2010W 68.89 82.09 <o,f0,female> at this ripe old age of thirty i 've been thinking a lot about what it means to grow up in this horrible beautiful time and i 've decided for me it 's been a real journey and paradox

CourtneyMartin_2010W 1 CourtneyMartin_2010W 337.21 355.59 <o,f0,female> brings me to the second paradox sobering up about our smallness and maintaining faith in our greatness all at once many in my generation because of well intentioned parenting and self esteem education were socialized to believe that we were special little snowflakes

CourtneyMartin_2010W 1 CourtneyMartin_2010W 461.01 467.48 <o,f0,female> more creative and more resilient than that which brings me to my third paradox

CourtneyMartin_2010W 1 CourtneyMartin_2010W 528.39 542.84 <o,f0,female> i wrote about maricela guzman the daughter of mexican immigrants who joined the military so she could afford college she was actually sexually assaulted in boot camp and went on to co organize a group called the service women 's action network
CourtneyMartin_2010W 1 CourtneyMartin_2010W 543.09 561.11 <o,f0,female> what i learned from these people and others was that i couldn 't judge them based on their failure to meet their very lofty goals many of them are working in deeply intractable systems the military congress the education system etc but what they managed to do within those systems was be a humanizing force
