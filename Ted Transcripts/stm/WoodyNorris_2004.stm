WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 25.83 37.53 <o,f0,male> was working at the university of washington and i came up with an idea from reading a magazine article for a new kind of a phonograph tone arm now that was before cassette tapes cds dvds any of the cool stuff we've got now
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 38.27 40.48 <o,f0,male> and it was an arm that instead of
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 41.51 43.57 <o,f0,male> and pivoting as it went across the record
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 44.03 47.06 <o,f0,male> went straight a radial linear tracking tone arm
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 47.87 49.65 <o,f0,male> and it was the hardest invention i ever made
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 50.27 51.92 <o,f0,male> but it got me started and
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 52.38 58.01 <o,f0,male> i got really lucky after that and without giving you too much of a tirade i want to talk to you about an invention i brought with me today
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 61.33 64.79 <o,f0,male> no that's not true either golly i'm just totally losing it my forty fourth patent
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 65.32 65.68 <o,f0,male> about the
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 70.87 74.73 <o,f0,male> to play it for you in a couple minutes but i want to make an analogy before i do to
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 77.21 82.28 <o,f0,male> i usually show this hypersonic sound and people will say that's really cool but what's it good for
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 83.79 86.15 <o,f0,male> and i say what is the light bulb good for
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 86.82 88.59 <o,f0,male> sound light i'm going to draw the analogy
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 89.43 91.13 <o,f0,male> when edison invented the light bulb
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 95.29 97.28 <o,f0,male> came out of it in every direction
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 104.79 110.25 <o,f0,male> put lenses in front of it focus it a little bit better ultimately we figured out how to make things
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 111.69 116.50 <o,f0,male> lasers that were totally focused now think about where the world would be today
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 117.19 119.00 <o,f0,male> if we had the light bulb
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 122.46 126.77 <o,f0,male> if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 130.43 134.91 <o,f0,male> you turn on the loudspeaker and after almost eighty years of having those gadgets
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 135.93 144.45 <o,f0,male> the sound just kind of goes where it wants even when you're standing in front of a megaphone it's pretty much every direction a little bit of differential but not much
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 145.38 151.17 <o,f0,male> if the light bulb was the way the speaker is and you couldn't focus or sharpen the edges or define it
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 154.26 155.58 <o,f0,male> or movies in general
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 156.42 159.02 <o,f0,male> or computers or tv sets
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 159.85 166.51 <o,f0,male> or cds or dvds and just go down the list of what the importance is of being able to focus light
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 167.87 170.93 <o,f0,male> now after almost eighty years of having sound
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 171.96 176.53 <o,f0,male> i thought it was about time that we figure out a way to put sound where you want to
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 177.51 189.08 <o,f0,male> i have a couple of units that guy there was made for a demo i did yesterday early in the day for a big car maker in detroit who wants to put them in a car small version over your head so that you can actually get binaural sound in a car
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 190.82 193.25 <o,f0,male> what if i could aim sound the way i aim light
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 195.78 199.91 <o,f0,male> i got this waterfall i recorded in my back yard now you're not going to hear a thing
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 220.50 225.04 <o,f0,male> because i have some limited time i'll cut it off for a second and tell you about how it works and what it's good for
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 235.30 242.13 <o,f0,male> sony 's got an idea sony 's our biggest customers right now they tried this back in the sixties and were too smart and so they gave up but
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 242.62 243.18 <o,f0,male> they want to
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 249.84 257.94 <o,f0,male> and though i did not graduate from college doesn't mean i'm stupid because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today too many other smart people out there so
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 258.43 264.70 <o,f0,male> i just happened to get my education in a little different way i'm not at all against education i think it's wonderful i think
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 265.38 267.64 <o,f0,male> sometimes people when they get educated lose
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 268.39 271.99 <o,f0,male> they get so smart they're unwilling to look at things that they know better than
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 272.99 277.30 <o,f0,male> and we're living in a great time right now because almost everything 's being explored anew
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 278.52 283.18 <o,f0,male> i have this little slogan that i use a lot which is virtually nothing
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 283.92 286.77 <o,f0,male> and i mean this honestly has been invented yet
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 287.54 295.59 <o,f0,male> we're just starting we're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics and this is i hope a little piece of it
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 296.24 302.12 <o,f0,male> sony 's got this vision back to get myself on track that when you stand in the checkout line in the supermarket
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 303.33 310.75 <o,f0,male> new tv channel they know that when you watch tv at home because there are so many choices you can change channels miss their commercials
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 317.28 322.57 <o,f0,male> now they've tried this a couple years ago and it failed because the checker gets tired of hearing the same message every twenty minutes
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 323.30 332.33 <o,f0,male> and reaches out turns off the sound and you know if the sound isn't there the sale typically isn't made for instance like when you're on an airplane they show the movie you get to watch it for free
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 335.56 347.16 <o,f0,male> and so abc and sony have devised this new thing where when you step in the line in the supermarket initially it'll be safeways it is safeways they're trying this in three parts of the country right now
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 347.55 354.59 <o,f0,male> you'll be watching tv and hopefully they'll be sensitive that they don't want to offend you with just one more outlet but what's great about it
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 354.95 360.35 <o,f0,male> from the tests that have been done is if you don't want to hear it you take about one step to the side and you don't hear it
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 361.11 364.69 <o,f0,male> so we create silence as much as we create sound
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 366.45 375.36 <o,f0,male> talk to you nobody else hears it sit in bed two in the morning watch tv your spouse or someone is next to you asleep doesn't hear it doesn't wake up
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 375.86 381.35 <o,f0,male> we're also working on noise canceling things like snoring noise from automobiles
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 382.88 390.13 <o,f0,male> i have been really lucky with this technology all of a sudden as it is ready the world is ready to accept it
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 391.39 396.05 <o,f0,male> they have literally beat a path to our door we've been selling it since about last september october
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 396.70 404.76 <o,f0,male> and it's been immensely gratifying if you're interested in what it costs i'm not selling them today but this unit with the electronics and everything if you buy one is around a thousand bucks
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 405.50 412.80 <o,f0,male> we expect by this time next year it'll be hundreds a few hundred bucks to buy it it's not any more pricey than regular electronics
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 413.63 416.92 <o,f0,male> now when i played it for you you didn't hear the thunderous bass
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 418.11 428.52 <o,f0,male> this unit that i played goes from about two hundred hertz to above the range of hearing it's actually emitting ultrasound low level ultrasound that's about one hundred thousand vibrations per second
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 429.88 437.40 <o,f0,male> and the sound that you're hearing unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face is made out in front of it in the air
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 438.50 441.51 <o,f0,male> the air is not linear as we've always been taught
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 442.42 446.92 <o,f0,male> you turn up the volume just a little bit i'm talking about a little over eighty decibels
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 447.46 451.08 <o,f0,male> and all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 452.94 458.62 <o,f0,male> the speed of sound is not a constant it's fairly slow it changes with temperature
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 459.02 465.24 <o,f0,male> and with barometric pressure now imagine if you will without getting too technical i'm making a little sine wave here in the air
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 466.27 468.40 <o,f0,male> well if i turn up the amplitude too much
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 469.33 471.53 <o,f0,male> having an effect on the pressure
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 472.69 477.70 <o,f0,male> which means during the making of that sine wave the speed at which it is propagating is shifting
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 478.90 480.57 <o,f0,male> all of audio as we know it
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 481.48 484.96 <o,f0,male> is an attempt to be more and more perfectly linear
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 486.96 488.59 <o,f0,male> means higher quality sound
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 489.76 492.77 <o,f0,male> hypersonic sound is exactly the opposite
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 498.02 499.69 <o,f0,male> effect happens in the air
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 500.18 503.70 <o,f0,male> it's a corrupting effect of the sound the ultrasound in this case
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 505.55 508.66 <o,f0,male> but it's so predictable that you can produce very
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 509.73 518.71 <o,f0,male> precise audio out of that effect now the question is where's the sound made instead of being made on the face of the cone it's made at literally billions
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 519.22 522.71 <o,f0,male> of little independent points along this narrow column in the air
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 529.82 531.59 <o,f0,male> i said we can shorten the column
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 534.99 543.57 <o,f0,male> put it so that one ear hears one speaker the other ear hears the other that's true binaural sound when you listen to stereo on your home system
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 544.71 547.15 <o,f0,male> your both ears hear both speakers
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 547.60 550.92 <o,f0,male> turn on the left speaker sometime and notice you're hearing it also in your right ear
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 551.59 563.91 <o,f0,male> so the stage is more restricted the sound stage that's supposed to spread out in front of you because the sound is made in the air along this column it does not follow the inverse square law which says it drops off
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 564.58 571.41 <o,f0,male> about two thirds every time you double the distance six db every time you go from one meter for instance to two meters
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 572.51 579.28 <o,f0,male> that means you go to a rock concert or a symphony and the guy in the front row gets the same level as the guy in the back row now all of a sudden
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 592.92 594.18 <o,f0,male> a separate system in the back
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 597.30 598.65 <o,f0,male> i was seeing if you were listening
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 601.51 604.07 <o,f0,male> a stereo system in the front for mom and dad
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 605.33 611.40 <o,f0,male> and maybe there's a little dvd player in the back for the kids and the parents don't want to be bothered with that or their rap music or whatever
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 611.91 616.96 <o,f0,male> so again this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to is really starting to catch on
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 617.53 620.53 <o,f0,male> it also works for transmitting and communicating data
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 621.67 623.92 <o,f0,male> it also works five times better underwater
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 625.18 632.55 <o,f0,male> got the military have just deployed some of these into iraq where you can put fake troop movements quarter of a mile away on a hillside
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 635.91 639.89 <o,f0,male> or you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist some biblical verse
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 642.72 643.24 <o,f0,male> i'm
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 645.77 650.48 <o,f0,male> and they have these infrared devices that can look at their countenance
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 651.16 654.64 <o,f0,male> and see a fraction of a degree kelvin in temperature shift
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 655.35 657.59 <o,f0,male> from one hundred yards away when they play this thing
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 662.94 666.60 <o,f0,male> we make a version with this which puts out one hundred and fifty five decibels
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 667.33 668.56 <o,f0,male> pain is one hundred and twenty
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 669.62 676.71 <o,f0,male> so it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people and there can be a public beach just off to the side and they don't even know it's turned on
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 677.66 683.11 <o,f0,male> we sell those to the military presently for about seventy thousand dollars and they're buying them as fast as we can make them
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 683.65 684.70 <o,f0,male> we put it on a turret
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 686.78 688.65 <o,f0,male> so that when they shoot at you you're over
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 691.74 695.99 <o,f0,male> i have a bunch of other inventions i invented a plasma antenna to shift gears
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 697.01 704.00 <o,f0,male> looked up at the ceiling of my office one day i was working on a ground penetrating radar project and my physicist
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 704.76 708.22 <o,f0,male> ceo came in and said we have a real problem we're using very short wavelengths
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 709.09 710.65 <o,f0,male> got a problem with the antenna ringing
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 735.29 737.74 <o,f0,male> i just sold that for a million and a half dollars cash
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 738.62 742.49 <o,f0,male> i took it back to the pentagon after it got declassified when the patent issued
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 743.32 747.52 <o,f0,male> and told the people back there about it and they laughed and then i took them back a demo and they bought
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 749.89 759.17 <o,f0,male> any of you ever wore a jabber headphone the little cell headphones that's my invention i sold that for seven million dollars big mistake it just sold for eighty million dollars two years ago
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 761.05 764.53 <o,f0,male> i actually drew that up on a little crummy mac computer in my
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 765.00 771.37 <o,f0,male> attic at my house and one of the many designs which they have now is still the same design i drew way back when
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 771.92 775.77 <o,f0,male> so i've been really lucky as an inventor i'm the happiest guy you're ever going to meet
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 779.77 781.44 <o,f0,male> my dad died before
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 782.04 792.66 <o,f0,male> he realized anybody in the family would maybe hopefully make something out of themselves you've been a great audience i know i've jumped all over the place i usually figure out what my talk is when i get up in front of a group let me give you in the last minute
WoodyNorris_2004 1 WoodyNorris_2004 814.47 818.21 <o,f0,male> i've got a coke can opening that's right in your head that's really cool thank you once again
