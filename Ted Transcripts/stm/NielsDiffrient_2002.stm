NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 31.27 44.87 <o,f0,male> and was always flown by a guy who looked like cary grant he had high leather boots jodhpurs an old leather jacket
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 44.87 52.79 <o,f0,male> a wonderful helmet and those marvelous goggles and inevitably a white scarf
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 53.28 61.41 <o,f0,male> to flow in the wind he 'd always walk up to his airplane in a kind of
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 93.74 111.32 <o,f0,male> everything about flying in those years which was you have to stop and think for a moment was probably the most advanced technological thing going on at the time so as a youngster i tried to get close to this
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 111.32 123.41 <o,f0,male> by drawing airplanes constantly drawing airplanes it 's the way i got a part of this romance and of course in a way when i say romance
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 123.68 137.26 <o,f0,male> i mean in part the aesthetics of that whole situation i think the word is the holistic experience revolving around a product the product
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 137.58 149.41 <o,f0,male> was that airplane but it built a romance even the parts of the airplane had french names ze fuselage
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 164.79 170.4 <o,f0,male> fantasy airplanes i wanted to build airplanes so i built
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 170.53 179.84 <o,f0,male> model airplanes and i found that in doing the model airplanes the appearance drawings
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 180.16 192.31 <o,f0,male> were not enough you couldn 't transfer those to the model itself if you wanted it to fly you had to learn the discipline of flying
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 208.11 210.26 <o,f0,male> up without crashing
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 232.53 245.06 <o,f0,male> and in so doing i could produce a model that would fly stay in the air and it had once it was in the air some of this romance that i was in love with
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 245.06 262.67 <o,f0,male> well the act of drawing airplanes led me to when i had the opportunity to choose a course in school led me to sign up for aeronautical engineering and when i was sitting in classes
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 267.79 276.51 <o,f0,male> i had to learn mathematics and mechanics and all this sort of thing i 'd wile away my time drawing airplanes in the class
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 276.51 289.65 <o,f0,male> one day a young man looked over my shoulder he said you draw very well you should be in the art department and i said why and he said well for one thing there are more girls there
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 294.72 296.62 <o,f0,male> was temporarily shifted
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 306.03 325.63 <o,f0,male> design some architecture eventually hired myself out as a designer and for the following twenty five years living in italy living in america i doled out a piece of this romance to anybody who 'd pay for it
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 325.63 331.89 <o,f0,male> this sense this aesthetic feeling for the experience
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 331.89 333.66 <o,f0,male> revolving around
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 334.02 351.82 <o,f0,male> a designed object and it exists any of you who rode the automobiles was it yesterday at the track you know the romance revolving around those high performance cars
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 352 357.18 <o,f0,male> well in twenty five years i was mostly putting out
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 357.3 374.3 <o,f0,male> pieces of this romance and not getting a lot back in because design on call doesn 't always connect you with a circumstance in which you can produce things of this nature so after twenty five years i began to feel as though i was running dry
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 374.48 376.18 <o,f0,male> and i quit
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 376.21 378.49 <o,f0,male> and i started up
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 378.69 383.7 <o,f0,male> a very small operation went from forty people to one
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 383.87 402.66 <o,f0,male> in an effort to rediscover my innocence i wanted to get back where the romance was and i couldn 't choose airplanes because they had gotten sort of unromantic at that point even though i 'd done a lot of airplane work
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 407.86 423.13 <o,f0,male> and i chose chairs specifically because i knew something about them i 'd designed a lot of chairs over the years for tractors and trucks and submarines all kinds of things
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 423.16 426.58 <o,f0,male> but not office chairs so i started doing that
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 426.62 431.71 <o,f0,male> and i found that there were ways to duplicate
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 432.07 436.51 <o,f0,male> the same approach that i used to use on the airplane
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 436.61 443.27 <o,f0,male> only this time instead of the product being shaped by the wind it was shaped
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 456.9 475.66 <o,f0,male> with the body and what the body needs wants indicates it needs and that 's the way ultimately after some ups and downs i ended up designing the chair i 'm going to show you i should say one more thing when i was doing those
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 475.66 478.19 <o,f0,male> model airplanes
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 478.19 493.52 <o,f0,male> i did everything i conceived the kind of airplane i basically engineered it i built it and i flew it and that 's the way i work now
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 532.24 541.66 <o,f0,male> and i felt the one thing they don 't need is a chair that interferes with their main reason for sitting there
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 541.66 555.3 <o,f0,male> so i took the approach that the chair should do as much for them as humanly possible or as mechanistically possible so that they didn 't have to fuss with it
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 555.41 561.2 <o,f0,male> so my idea was that instead of sitting down and reaching for a lot of controls
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 561.25 570.4 <o,f0,male> that you would sit on the chair and it would automatically balance your weight against the force required to recline
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 570.42 573.37 <o,f0,male> now that may not mean a lot
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 573.42 579.94 <o,f0,male> to some of you but you know most good chairs do recline because it 's beneficial to open up this
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 579.94 586.18 <o,f0,male> joint between your legs and your upper body for better breathing and better flow
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 586.56 590.42 <o,f0,male> so that if you sit down on my chair
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 596.55 600.12 <o,f0,male> deals with your weight and
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 600.54 604.73 <o,f0,male> transfers the amount of force required to recline
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 605.16 609.84 <o,f0,male> in a way that you don 't have to look for something to adjust
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 610.75 614.27 <o,f0,male> i 'll tell you right up front this is a trade off
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 614.27 633.21 <o,f0,male> there are drawbacks to this one is you can 't accommodate everybody there are some very light people some extremely heavy people maybe people with a lot of bulk up top they begin to fall off the end of your chart
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 633.29 637.45 <o,f0,male> the compromise i felt was in my favor because most people
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 698.78 705.5 <o,f0,male> properly approached from the standpoint of how much of an aid they could be
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 705.5 715.18 <o,f0,male> to your work life but i felt it was too much to ask to have to adjust each individual armrest in order to get it where you wanted
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 715.18 727.15 <o,f0,male> so i spent a long time i said i worked eight or nine years on it and each of these things went along sort of in parallel but incrementally were a problem of their own
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 727.15 736.32 <o,f0,male> i worked a long time on figuring out how to move the arms over a much greater arc that is up and down
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 736.32 740.88 <o,f0,male> and make them a lot easier so that you didn 't have to
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 740.89 755.32 <o,f0,male> use a button and so after many trials many failures we came up with a very simple arrangement in which we could just move one arm or the other and they go up easily and stop where you want
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 756.75 765.91 <o,f0,male> you can put them down essentially out of the way no arms at all or you can pull them up where you want them and this was another thing that
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 765.93 770.8 <o,f0,male> i felt while not nearly as romantic as cary grant
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 771.04 775.82 <o,f0,male> nevertheless begins to grab a little bit of
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 775.83 781.98 <o,f0,male> aesthetic operation aesthetic performance into a product
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 786.85 792.53 <o,f0,male> reclining was a very important factor and the more you can recline
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 808.04 812.74 <o,f0,male> but you transfer weight off your tailbones
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 813.18 817.71 <o,f0,male> would everybody put their hand under their bottom and feel their tailbone
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 847.31 851.42 <o,f0,male> and that 's a lot of load just relieving your arms with armrests
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 851.42 867.19 <o,f0,male> takes twenty percent of that load off now that if your spine is not held in a good position will help bend your spine the wrong way and so on so to unload
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 867.2 874.46 <o,f0,male> great weight if that indeed exists
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 874.46 881.65 <o,f0,male> you can recline when you recline you take away a lot of that load off your bottom end and transfer it to your back
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 913.4 923.18 <o,f0,male> you have to use muscle force to hold your head there so that 's where a headrest comes in now headrest is a challenge because you want it to
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 933.37 936.63 <o,f0,male> i 've got five inches of adjustment here
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 955.62 966.5 <o,f0,male> and you need it in a different position when you 're upright then when you 're reclined so i knew that had to be solved and had to be automatic so if you watch this chair as i recline
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 991.77 1000.32 <o,f0,male> we stole the idea from bicycle seats and put gel in the cushions and in the armrests to absorb
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 1000.39 1002.11 <o,f0,male> point load
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 1016.87 1021.57 <o,f0,male> while you 're sitting in it you can adjust it down for the five footer
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 1021.98 1024.14 <o,f0,male> or you can adjust it
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 1024.14 1030.38 <o,f0,male> for the six foot six guy
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 1030.38 1032.79 <o,f0,male> all within the scope
