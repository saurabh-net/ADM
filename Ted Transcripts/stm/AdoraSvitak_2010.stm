AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 16.09 25.60 <o,f0,female> now i want to start with a question when was the last time you were called childish for kids like me being called childish can be a frequent occurrence
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 34.62 43.44 <o,f0,female> we are called childish which really bothers me after all take a look at these events imperialism and colonization
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 44.00 48.38 <o,f0,female> world wars george w bush ask yourself who 's responsible
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 50.73 51.65 <o,f0,female> what have kids
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 53.52 63.47 <o,f0,female> frank touched millions with her powerful account of the holocaust ruby bridges helped end segregation in the united states and most recently charlie simpson
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 63.86 73.94 <o,f0,female> to raise one hundred and twenty thousand pounds for haiti on his little bike so as you can see evidenced by such examples age has absolutely nothing to do with it
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 74.18 84.91 <o,f0,female> the traits the word childish addresses are seen so often in adults that we should abolish this age discriminatory word when it comes to criticizing behavior associated with irresponsibility
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 95.18 97.85 <o,f0,female> say that certain types of irrational thinking
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 98.56 108.64 <o,f0,female> exactly what the world needs maybe you've had grand plans before but stopped yourself thinking that's impossible or that costs too much or that won 't benefit me
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 109.04 118.75 <o,f0,female> for better or worse we kids aren't hampered as much when it comes to thinking about reasons why not to do things kids can be full of inspiring aspirations and hopeful thinking
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 119.02 128.15 <o,f0,female> like my wish that no one went hungry or that everything were free kind of utopia how many of you still dream like that and believe in the possibilities
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 140.96 150.52 <o,f0,female> on the other hand we kids still dream about perfection and that's a good thing because in order to make anything a reality you have to dream about it first
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 151.34 161.46 <o,f0,female> in many ways our audacity to imagine helps push the boundaries of possibility for instance the museum of glass in tacoma washington my home state yoohoo washington
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 197.01 203.73 <o,f0,female> our inherent wisdom doesn't have to be insiders knowledge kids already do a lot of learning from adults
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 212.76 221.74 <o,f0,female> teachers and students and i like this analogy it shouldn 't just be a teacher at the head of the classroom telling students do this do that the students should teach their teachers
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 222.32 231.27 <o,f0,female> learning between grown ups and kids should be reciprocal the reality unfortunately is a little different and it has a lot to do with trust or a lack of it
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 231.92 244.63 <o,f0,female> don't trust someone you place restrictions on them right if i doubt my older sister 's ability to pay back the ten percent interest i established on her last loan i'm going to withhold her ability to get more money from me until she pays it back
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 245.94 247.66 <o,f0,female> true story by the way
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 250.71 259.54 <o,f0,female> to have a prevalently restrictive attitude towards kids from every don 't do that don 't do this in the school handbook to restrictions on school internet use
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 260.23 269.37 <o,f0,female> as history points out regimes become oppressive when they're fearful about keeping control and although adults may not be quite at the level of totalitarian regimes
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 269.64 280.17 <o,f0,female> kids have no or very little say in making the rules when really the attitude should be reciprocal meaning that the adult population should learn and take into account the wishes of the younger population
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 280.71 290.72 <o,f0,female> now what's even worse than restriction is that adults often underestimate kids abilities we love challenges but when expectations are low trust me we will sink to them
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 317.20 325.47 <o,f0,female> to write from the age of four and when i was six my mom bought me my own laptop equipped with microsoft word thank you bill gates and thank you ma
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 325.89 332.04 <o,f0,female> i wrote over three hundred short stories on that little laptop and i wanted to get published
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 341.08 349.80 <o,f0,female> many publishers were not quite so encouraging one large children 's publisher ironically saying that they didn't work with children
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 369.00 383.06 <o,f0,female> and from there on it's gone to speaking at hundreds of schools keynoting to thousands of educators and finally today speaking to you i appreciate your attention today because to show that you truly care you listen but
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 394.12 404.73 <o,f0,female> just like you really the goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult but rather better adults than you have been which may be a little challenging considering your guys credentials
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 416.99 425.29 <o,f0,female> no matter your position of place in life it is imperative to create opportunities for children so that we can grow up to blow you away
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 438.79 444.82 <o,f0,female> because we are the leaders of tomorrow which means we're going to be taking care of you when you're old and senile no just kidding
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 446.71 454.52 <o,f0,female> really we are going to be the next generation the ones who will bring this world forward and in case you don't think that this really has meaning for you
AdoraSvitak_2010 1 AdoraSvitak_2010 462.71 471.42 <o,f0,female> now the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas kids need opportunities to lead and succeed
