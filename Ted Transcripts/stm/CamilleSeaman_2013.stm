CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 15.63 27.33 <o,f0,female> as a shinnecock indian i was raised to know this we are a small fishing tribe situated on the southeastern tip of long island near the town of southampton in new york
CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 27.65 30.27 <o,f0,female> when i was a little girl
CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 30.54 35.34 <o,f0,female> my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day
CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 35.34 38.02 <o,f0,female> there were no clouds in the sky
CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 39.07 41.95 <o,f0,female> and after a while i began to perspire
CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 42.83 45.22 <o,f0,female> and he pointed up to the sky
CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 56.08 59.43 <o,f0,female> that feeds the plants that feeds the animals
CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 61.26 69.06 <o,f0,female> in my continued exploration of subjects in nature that have the ability to illustrate the interconnection of all life
CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 69.19 75.13 <o,f0,female> i started storm chasing in two thousand and eight after my daughter said mom you should do that
CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 75.62 80.07 <o,f0,female> and so three days later driving very fast
CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 81.96 87.8 <o,f0,female> i found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super
CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 89.13 93.04 <o,f0,female> capable of producing grapefruit size hail
CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 93.37 99.26 <o,f0,female> and spectacular tornadoes although only two percent actually do
CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 101.82 104.48 <o,f0,female> these clouds can grow so big
CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 106.74 110.67 <o,f0,female> and reach up to sixty five thousand feet into the atmosphere
CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 111.26 116.42 <o,f0,female> they can grow so big blocking all daylight making it very dark and ominous standing under them
CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 118.69 121.88 <o,f0,female> storm chasing is a very tactile experience
CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 121.98 125.35 <o,f0,female> there 's a warm moist wind blowing at your back
CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 126.02 129.79 <o,f0,female> and the smell of the earth the wheat the grass
CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 130.62 132.15 <o,f0,female> the charged particles
CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 133.04 135.53 <o,f0,female> and then there are the colors in the clouds
CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 141.1 143.99 <o,f0,female> i 've learned to respect the lightning
CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 144.44 146.48 <o,f0,female> my hair used to be straight
CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 156.36 162.7 <o,f0,female> the way they swirl and spin and undulate with their lava lamp like mammatus clouds
CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 163.12 165.35 <o,f0,female> they become lovely monsters
CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 166.31 172.1 <o,f0,female> when i 'm photographing them i cannot help but remember my grandfather 's lesson
CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 172.74 186.8 <o,f0,female> as i stand under them i see not just a cloud but understand that what i have the privilege to witness is the same forces the same process in a small scale version that helped to create our galaxy
CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 187.05 188.69 <o,f0,female> our solar system
CamilleSeaman_2013 1 CamilleSeaman_2013 189 192.24 <o,f0,female> our sun and even this very planet
