DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 26.23 29.75 <o,f0,male> time may be a great healer but it ain't no beauty specialist
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 33.28 38.67 <o,f0,male> she said be good to your friends why without them you'd be a total stranger

DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 96.80 100.38 <o,f0,male> down below there was her grandson plowing the tobacco field with a mule
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 101.25 103.08 <o,f0,male> double outhouse over here on the side
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 104.18 106.21 <o,f0,male> sing this old song she didn't have a whole lot of energy so
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 121.56 122.21 <o,f0,male> in the ocean
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 124.43 125.12 <o,f0,male> the
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 149.32 151.62 <o,f0,male> around she'll make a living she'll cook blackjacks
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 185.01 194.37 <o,f0,male> this is ralph stanley when i was going to college at university of california at santa barbara in the college of creative studies taking majors in biology and art
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 205.30 210.46 <o,f0,male> came from africa along with the banjo it's called claw hammer style that he had learned from his mother and grandmother
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 214.45 223.89 <o,f0,male> he said well you can go back to clinch mountain where i'm from or asheville or mount airy north carolina some place that has a lot of music because a lot of old people still living that play that old style
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 224.71 230.18 <o,f0,male> so i went back that very summer i just fell in love with the culture and the people and
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 231.35 236.48 <o,f0,male> you know i came back to school i finished my degrees and told my parents i wanted to be a banjo player
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 238.04 239.51 <o,f0,male> you can imagine how excited they were
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 240.46 240.80 <o,f0,male> so i
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 358.55 366.95 <o,f0,male> those last few pictures were of ray hicks who just passed away last year he was one of the great american folk tale tellers the old jack tales that he had learned
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 370.61 379.12 <o,f0,male> it was really wonderful and he lived in that house that his great grandfather had built no running water no electricity a wonderful wonderful guy
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 379.79 386.15 <o,f0,male> and you can look at more pictures i've actually got a website that's got a bunch of photos that i've done of some of the other folks i didn't get a chance to show you
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 386.98 395.88 <o,f0,male> this instrument came up in those pictures it's called the mouth bow it is definitely the first stringed instrument ever in the world and still played in the southern mountains
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 437.11 437.51 <o,f0,male> the
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 458.96 460.48 <o,f0,male> when the yankees saw them
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 487.54 492.90 <o,f0,male> fifty four i guess it was we were driving in the car outside of gatesville texas where i grew up
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 493.85 506.10 <o,f0,male> early part of my life outside of gatesville we were coming back from the grocery store my mom was driving my brother and i were in the back seat we were really mad at my mom we looked out the window we were surrounded by thousands of acres of cotton fields
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 507.32 509.14 <o,f0,male> just been to the grocery store and my mom
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 511.03 517.22 <o,f0,male> the jar of ovaltine that had the coupon for the captain midnight decoder ring in it and buddy that made us
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 518.24 525.47 <o,f0,male> my mom didn't put up with much either and she was driving and she said you boys you think you can have anything you want you don't know how hard it is to earn money
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 525.66 533.21 <o,f0,male> your dad works so hard you think money grows on trees you've never worked a day in your lives you boys make me so mad you're going to get a job this summer she pulled the car
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 536.09 546.68 <o,f0,male> i stepped out of the car we were standing on the edge of thousands of acres of cotton there were about a hundred black folks out there picking my mom grabbed us by the shoulders she marched us out in the field she went up to
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 548.09 549.74 <o,f0,male> two little boys never worked
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 554.70 564.16 <o,f0,male> would you put them to work well that must have seemed like a funny idea to that foreman put these two middle class little white boys out in a cotton field in august in texas it's hot
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 564.69 573.03 <o,f0,male> so he gave us each a cotton sack about ten feet long about that big around and we started picking now cotton is soft but the outside of the plant is just full of
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 584.32 585.32 <o,f0,male> she wasn't going to
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 587.42 594.48 <o,f0,male> well the foreman could see he was in over his head i guess he kind of just snuck up behind us and he sang out in a
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 601.93 602.15 <o,f0,male> i
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 603.32 604.43 <o,f0,male> don't want it to leave
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 610.53 611.74 <o,f0,male> don't
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 613.99 615.89 <o,f0,male> all around as people started singing
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 618.29 625.01 <o,f0,male> good news good news chariot 's coming good news chariot 's coming good news
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 626.82 627.50 <o,f0,male> chariot 's
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 632.76 635.58 <o,f0,male> i had never heard anything like that in our whole lives it was
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 636.93 643.75 <o,f0,male> we sat there all day picking cotton without complaining without crying while they sang things like oh mary don't you weep don't
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 652.22 653.34 <o,f0,male> about a quarter of a bag
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 655.21 663.45 <o,f0,male> but the foreman was kind enough to give us each a check for a dollar but my mother would never let us cash it i'm fifty seven still have the check
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 664.07 667.63 <o,f0,male> now my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 676.10 679.11 <o,f0,male> i never ever wanted to work that hard again
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 686.92 694.49 <o,f0,male> but i also learned that some people in this world do have to work that hard every day and that was an eye opener and i also learned
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 694.71 702.52 <o,f0,male> that a great song can make hard work go a little easier and it also can bring the group together in a way that nothing else can
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 704.78 710.14 <o,f0,male> just a little eight year old boy that day when my mama put me out of the car in that hot texas cotton field i wasn't even
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 711.03 722.52 <o,f0,male> of music not even aware of it but that day in the cotton field out there picking when those people started singing i realized i was in the very heart of real music and that's where i've wanted to be
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 729.59 729.77 <o,f0,male> i
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 737.73 738.04 <o,f0,male> know
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 740.64 744.20 <o,f0,male> good news good news chariot 's coming good
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 768.76 768.98 <o,f0,male> a
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 787.52 791.83 <o,f0,male> a few years ago but i sort of remembered this story and i told it at a concert
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 792.50 793.70 <o,f0,male> my mom was in the audience
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 800.08 803.05 <o,f0,male> something i set that whole thing
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 839.68 850.44 <o,f0,male> is the steel guitar it's an american made instrument it was originally made by the dopyera brothers who later on made the dobro which is a wood bodied instrument with a metal cone for
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 851.68 861.07 <o,f0,male> the sound comes from it's usually played flat on your lap it was made to play hawaiian music back in the nineteen twenties before they had electric guitars trying to make a loud guitar
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 861.52 871.55 <o,f0,male> and then african american folks figured out you could take a broken bottle neck just like that a nice merlot works very well that wine we had yesterday would have been perfect
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 879.85 881.22 <o,f0,male> this instrument pretty much saved my
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 891.67 896.68 <o,f0,male> and it was the most it almost took me out it almost took me out of this world
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 897.20 903.04 <o,f0,male> and i think i learned a lot about what happiness was by going through such unbelievable grief
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 911.82 919.73 <o,f0,male> lists because i was ready to go i was ready to check out of this world and you know at the top of the list of course were jenny and my son zeb
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 920.07 927.40 <o,f0,male> my parents i didn't want to hurt them but then when i thought about it beyond that it was very simple things i didn't care about
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 928.05 936.79 <o,f0,male> had a radio show i have a radio show on public radio riverwalk i didn't care about that i didn't care about awards or money or anything nothing nothing
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 937.99 947.70 <o,f0,male> on the list it would be stuff like seeing the daffodils bloom in the spring the smell of new mown hay catching a wave and bodysurfing
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 963.40 965.16 <o,f0,male> neighbors just gave me one of these things
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 978.03 979.63 <o,f0,male> make that connection
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 980.72 981.37 <o,f0,male> this is
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1019.45 1019.82 <o,f0,male> that
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1021.47 1023.28 <o,f0,male> if you want to talk about it you know
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1029.94 1031.48 <o,f0,male> what i always do
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1057.50 1059.06 <o,f0,male> sometimes i think it's better
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1061.20 1062.50 <o,f0,male> your funky mood
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1079.98 1080.24 <o,f0,male> you
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1086.99 1088.21 <o,f0,male> but i got some medicine
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1162.28 1169.47 <o,f0,male> and we moved across the street from michael and john whitney they were about my age john went on and michael did too to become some of the inventors of
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1187.48 1195.24 <o,f0,male> and one of the engineers said some day you're going to be able to put this thing in your pocket i thought damn those are going to be some big pants
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1197.96 1199.07 <o,f0,male> so that christmas
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1202.30 1215.51 <o,f0,male> got time for this that christmas i got the mister wizard fun o rama chemistry set well i wanted to be an inventor just like my dad so did michael his great granddad had been eli whitney the inventor of the cotton gin so
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1216.24 1223.21 <o,f0,male> we looked in that this was a commercial chemistry set it had three chemicals we were really surprised to see sulfur potassium nitrate and
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1233.16 1236.68 <o,f0,male> well obviously the next thing to do was build a cannon
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1241.21 1251.35 <o,f0,male> of stuff and we put a pipe in the vice there and screwed a cap on the end of the pipe drilled a hole in the back of the pipe took some of our firecrackers pulled out the fuses tied them together put them in the back there
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1251.81 1257.20 <o,f0,male> and down in that hole and then stuffed some of our gunpowder down that pipe and put three ball bearings on the top
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1261.36 1265.89 <o,f0,male> we weren't stupid we put up a sheet of plywood about five feet in front of
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1266.91 1277.43 <o,f0,male> we stood back we lit that thing and they flew out of there they went through that plywood like it was paper through the garage two of them landed in the side door of his new citroen
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1281.17 1288.79 <o,f0,male> we tore everything down and buried it in his backyard that was pacific palisades it probably is still there back there
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1289.59 1298.28 <o,f0,male> well my brother heard that we had made gunpowder he and his buddies they were older and they were pretty mean they said they were going to beat us up if we didn't make some gunpowder for them
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1299.44 1304.51 <o,f0,male> we said well what are you going to do with it they said we're going to melt it down and make rocket fuel
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1307.80 1309.47 <o,f0,male> sure we'll make you a big
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1313.09 1324.01 <o,f0,male> so we made them a big batch and it was in my now we'd just moved here we'd just moved to california mom had redone the kitchen mom was gone that day we had a pie tin it became chris berquist 's job to do the melting down
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1337.10 1338.81 <o,f0,male> no hair no eyelashes no
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1339.89 1349.87 <o,f0,male> there were big welts all over my mom 's kitchen cabinet the air was the just full of black smoke she came home she took that chemistry set away and we never saw it again
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1351.22 1356.94 <o,f0,male> but we thought of it often because every time she'd cook tuna surprise it made tasted faintly of gunpowder
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1358.80 1363.51 <o,f0,male> so i like to invent things too and i think i'll close put my set with something i invented a good while back
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1376.92 1379.20 <o,f0,male> that time drum triggers were new
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1383.61 1388.17 <o,f0,male> and so i put them all together and sewed twelve of them in this suit
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1393.36 1396.70 <o,f0,male> i showed you some of the hambone rhythms yesterday i'm going to be doing some of the same ones
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1412.88 1415.92 <o,f0,male> now the drum triggers go out my tail here
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1418.32 1419.29 <o,f0,male> into the drum machine
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1420.44 1421.94 <o,f0,male> and they can make various
DavidHolt_2004 1 DavidHolt_2004 1424.55 1429.64 <o,f0,male> so let me put them all together and also i can change the sounds by stepping on this pedal right here and
