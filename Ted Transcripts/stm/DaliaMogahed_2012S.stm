DaliaMogahed_2012S 1 DaliaMogahed_2012S 16.86 21.57 <o,f0,female> today is about something maybe a couple of you have already heard about
DaliaMogahed_2012S 1 DaliaMogahed_2012S 36.18 39.46 <o,f0,female> from oval offices to central squares
DaliaMogahed_2012S 1 DaliaMogahed_2012S 40.18 42.72 <o,f0,female> from carefully guarded airwaves
DaliaMogahed_2012S 1 DaliaMogahed_2012S 42.82 44.38 <o,f0,female> to open source networks
DaliaMogahed_2012S 1 DaliaMogahed_2012S 46.52 52.3 <o,f0,female> but before tahrir was a global symbol of liberation there were representative surveys
DaliaMogahed_2012S 1 DaliaMogahed_2012S 52.31 54.98 <o,f0,female> already giving people a voice
DaliaMogahed_2012S 1 DaliaMogahed_2012S 73.42 78.33 <o,f0,female> my talk today draws on this research to reveal
DaliaMogahed_2012S 1 DaliaMogahed_2012S 81.33 83.05 <o,f0,female> and what they want now
DaliaMogahed_2012S 1 DaliaMogahed_2012S 109.76 114.25 <o,f0,female> but i 'm going to end by widening the lens to the entire region
DaliaMogahed_2012S 1 DaliaMogahed_2012S 114.62 119.55 <o,f0,female> to look at the mundane topics of arab views of religion and politics
DaliaMogahed_2012S 1 DaliaMogahed_2012S 120.26 122.2 <o,f0,female> and how this impacts women
DaliaMogahed_2012S 1 DaliaMogahed_2012S 122.9 125.43 <o,f0,female> revealing some surprises along the way
DaliaMogahed_2012S 1 DaliaMogahed_2012S 126.88 130.69 <o,f0,female> so after analyzing mounds of data
DaliaMogahed_2012S 1 DaliaMogahed_2012S 130.96 132.56 <o,f0,female> what we discovered was
DaliaMogahed_2012S 1 DaliaMogahed_2012S 133.23 136.27 <o,f0,female> unemployment and poverty alone
DaliaMogahed_2012S 1 DaliaMogahed_2012S 136.47 140.26 <o,f0,female> did not lead to the arab revolts of two thousand and eleven
DaliaMogahed_2012S 1 DaliaMogahed_2012S 140.72 145.8 <o,f0,female> if an act of desperation by a tunisian fruit vendor sparked these revolutions
DaliaMogahed_2012S 1 DaliaMogahed_2012S 145.98 153.45 <o,f0,female> it was the difference between what arabs experienced and what they expected that provided the fuel
DaliaMogahed_2012S 1 DaliaMogahed_2012S 153.96 157.69 <o,f0,female> to tell you what i mean consider this trend in egypt
DaliaMogahed_2012S 1 DaliaMogahed_2012S 157.81 160.56 <o,f0,female> on paper the country was doing great
DaliaMogahed_2012S 1 DaliaMogahed_2012S 160.99 167.44 <o,f0,female> in fact it attracted accolades from multinational organizations because of its economic growth
DaliaMogahed_2012S 1 DaliaMogahed_2012S 167.73 170.72 <o,f0,female> but under the surface was a very different reality
DaliaMogahed_2012S 1 DaliaMogahed_2012S 171.44 183.46 <o,f0,female> in two thousand and ten right before the revolution even though gdp per capita had been growing at five percent for several years egyptians had never felt worse about their lives
DaliaMogahed_2012S 1 DaliaMogahed_2012S 188.5 193.22 <o,f0,female> not surprisingly people feel better as their country gets richer
