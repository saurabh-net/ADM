RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 19 21.5 <o,f0,male> and he sits down and the teacher says
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 21.53 24.03 <o,f0,male> what does your father do
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 24.44 30.49 <o,f0,female> and little billy says my father plays the piano in an opium den
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 30.83 35.01 <o,f0,female> so the teacher rings up the parents and says very shocking story
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 35.05 41.96 <o,f0,female> from little billy today just heard that he claimed that you play the piano in an opium den
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 42.35 45.5 <o,f0,female> and the father says i 'm very sorry yes it 's true
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 45.5 49.82 <o,f0,male> i lied but how can i tell an eight year old boy
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 49.83 52.85 <o,f0,male> that his father is a politician
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 67.3 75.87 <o,f0,male> a snake a monkey and an iguana and through all of this i feel strongly
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 75.87 81.4 <o,f0,male> that something is going wrong four hundred years of maturing democracy
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 81.79 91.37 <o,f0,male> colleagues in parliament who seem to me as individuals reasonably impressive an increasingly educated energetic informed population
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 91.78 97.01 <o,f0,male> and yet a deep deep sense of disappointment
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 97.68 101.35 <o,f0,male> my colleagues in parliament include in my new intake
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 102.02 110.64 <o,f0,male> family doctors businesspeople professors distinguished economists historians writers
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 110.93 115.44 <o,f0,male> army officers ranging from colonels down to regimental sergeant majors
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 115.76 119.88 <o,f0,male> all of them however including myself as we walk underneath
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 119.98 127.48 <o,f0,male> those strange stone gargoyles just down the road feel that we 've become less than the sum of our parts
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 127.51 129.63 <o,f0,male> feel as though we have become
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 137.23 143.54 <o,f0,male> it 's a problem across the developing world and in middle income countries too in jamaica for example
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 165.27 171.29 <o,f0,male> a dismal depressing landscape of burnt and half abandoned buildings
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 192.15 197.23 <o,f0,male> ten years ago however the promise of democracy seemed to be extraordinary
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 197.63 205.72 <o,f0,male> george w bush stood up in his state of the union address in two thousand and three and said that democracy was the force
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 205.72 219.21 <o,f0,male> that would beat most of the ills of the world he said because democratic governments respect their own people and respect their neighbors freedom will bring peace
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 219.21 238.53 <o,f0,male> distinguished academics at the same time argued that democracies had this incredible range of side benefits they would bring prosperity security overcome sectarian violence ensure that states would never again harbor terrorists since then what 's happened
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 239.2 244.13 <o,f0,male> well what we 've seen is the creation in places like iraq and afghanistan
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 263.79 273.38 <o,f0,male> what we find in afghanistan is a judiciary that is weak and corrupt a very limited civil society which is largely ineffective
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 273.88 279.37 <o,f0,male> a media which is beginning to get onto its feet but a government that 's deeply unpopular
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 282.11 284.75 <o,f0,male> and security that is shocking
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 285.02 286.66 <o,f0,male> security that 's terrible
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 289.38 291.55 <o,f0,male> in lots of sub saharan africa
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 291.83 309.6 <o,f0,male> again you can see democracy and elections are compatible with corrupt governments with states that are unstable and dangerous and when i have conversations with people i remember having a conversation for example in iraq with a community that asked me
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 310.11 320.01 <o,f0,male> whether the riot we were seeing in front of us this was a huge mob ransacking a provincial council building was a sign of the new democracy
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 320.86 322.44 <o,f0,male> the same i felt
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 322.73 331.72 <o,f0,male> was true in almost every single one of the middle and developing countries that i went to and to some extent the same is true of us
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 332.1 337.5 <o,f0,male> well what is the answer to this is the answer to just give up on the idea of democracy
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 352.44 364.04 <o,f0,male> we were imposing anything other than a democratic system anything else would run contrary to our values it would run contrary to the wishes of the people on the ground it would run contrary to our interests
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 364.17 367.18 <o,f0,male> i remember in iraq for example
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 380.65 391.5 <o,f0,female> so in iraq in two thousand and three the decision was made let 's not have elections for two years let 's invest in voter education let 's invest in democratization
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 391.5 401.13 <o,f0,female> the result was that i found stuck outside my office a huge crowd of people this is actually a photograph taken in libya but i saw the same scene in iraq of people
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 401.13 406.46 <o,f0,female> standing outside screaming for the elections and when i went out and said
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 410.75 414.22 <o,f0,male> what is wrong with the people that we have chosen
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 414.22 425.25 <o,f0,female> there is a sunni sheikh there 's a shiite sheikh there 's the seven leaders of the seven major tribes there 's a christian there 's a sabian there are female representatives there 's every political
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 425.25 426.78 <o,f0,male> party in this council
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 426.85 430.5 <o,f0,male> what 's wrong with the people that we chose the answer came
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 430.63 436.92 <o,f0,male> the problem isn 't the people that you chose the problem is that you chose them
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 437.23 447.23 <o,f0,male> i have not met in afghanistan in even the most remote community anybody who does not want a say in who governs them
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 447.61 452.06 <o,f0,male> most remote community i have never met a villager who does not want a vote
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 452.38 465.19 <o,f0,male> so we need to acknowledge that despite the dubious statistics despite the fact that eighty four percent of people in britain feel politics is broken
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 465.31 474.71 <o,f0,male> despite the fact that when i was in iraq we did an opinion poll in two thousand and three and asked people what political systems they preferred and the answer came back that
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 474.85 478.15 <o,f0,male> seven percent wanted the united states
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 478.25 497.06 <o,f0,male> five percent wanted france three percent wanted britain and nearly forty percent wanted dubai which is after all not a democratic state at all but a relatively prosperous minor monarchy democracy is a thing of value for which we should be fighting
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 497.14 503.45 <o,f0,male> but in order to do so we need to get away from instrumental arguments we need to get away from saying
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 518.12 523.58 <o,f0,male> why should we get away from those arguments because they 're very dangerous if we set about saying for example
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 523.6 525.31 <o,f0,male> torture is wrong
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 525.65 529.63 <o,f0,male> because it doesn 't extract good information
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 529.63 546.08 <o,f0,male> or we say you need women 's rights because it stimulates economic growth by doubling the size of the work force you leave yourself open to the position where the government of north korea can turn around and say well actually we 're having a lot of success extracting good information with our torture at the moment
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 555.98 565.57 <o,f0,male> the point about democracy is not instrumental it 's not about the things that it brings the point about democracy is not that it delivers
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 566.27 569.53 <o,f0,male> legitimate effective prosperous
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 570.01 575.97 <o,f0,male> rule of law it 's not that it guarantees peace with itself or with its neighbors
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 576.02 589.13 <o,f0,male> the point about democracy is intrinsic democracy matters because it reflects an idea of equality and an idea of liberty it reflects an idea of dignity
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 589.13 599.32 <o,f0,male> the dignity of the individual the idea that each individual should have an equal vote an equal say in the formation of their government
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 600.13 604.05 <o,f0,male> but if we 're really to make democracy vigorous again
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 623.86 638.82 <o,f0,female> after i speak to you today i 'm going on a radio program called any questions and the thing you will have noticed about politicians on these kinds of radio programs is that they never ever say that they don 't know the answer to a question it doesn 't matter what it is
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 654.3 674.02 <o,f0,male> we need to stop that to stop pretending to be omniscient beings politicians also need to learn occasionally to say that certain things that voters want certain things that voters have been promised may be things that we cannot deliver
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 674.02 677 <o,f0,male> or perhaps that we feel we should not deliver
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 677.05 680.21 <o,f0,male> and the second thing we should do is understand
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 680.63 683.07 <o,f0,male> the genius of our societies
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 683.13 698.51 <o,f0,male> our societies have never been so educated have never been so energized have never been so healthy have never known so much cared so much or wanted to do so much and it is a genius of the local
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 699.2 711.43 <o,f0,male> one of the reasons why we 're moving away from banqueting halls such as the one in which we stand banqueting halls with extraordinary images on the ceiling of kings enthroned
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 711.95 729.4 <o,f0,male> the entire drama played out here on this space where the king of england had his head lopped off why we 've moved from spaces like this thrones like that towards the town hall is we 're moving more and more towards the energies of our people and we need to tap that
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 729.76 733.12 <o,f0,male> that can mean different things in different countries in britain
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 733.38 735.5 <o,f0,male> it could mean looking to the french
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 735.72 742.88 <o,f0,male> learning from the french getting directly elected mayors in place in a french commune system
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 761.54 764.07 <o,f0,male> but for any of these things to work
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 764.25 776.89 <o,f0,male> the honesty in language the local democracy it 's not just a question of what politicians do it 's a question of what the citizens do for politicians to be honest the public needs to allow them to be honest
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 776.89 791.17 <o,f0,male> and the media which mediates between the politicians and the public needs to allow those politicians to be honest if local democracy is to flourish it is about the active and informed engagement of every citizen
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 791.65 793.47 <o,f0,male> in other words
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 793.64 796.46 <o,f0,male> if democracy is to be rebuilt
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 797.2 800.2 <o,f0,male> is to become again vigorous and vibrant
RoryStewart_2012X 1 RoryStewart_2012X 800.43 802.61 <o,f0,male> it is necessary not just
