LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 16.86 26.04 <o,f0,female> after these incredible speeches and ideas that are being spread i am in the awkward position of being here to talk to you today about
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 27.04 41.14 <o,f0,female> television so most everyone watches tv we like it we like some parts of it here in america people actually love tv the average american watches tv for almost
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 41.27 43.17 <o,f0,female> five hours a day
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 50.17 62.1 <o,f0,female> but a lot of people don 't love it so much they in fact berate it they call it stupid and worse believe me my mother growing up she called it the idiot box
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 62.22 73.44 <o,f0,female> but my idea today is not to debate whether there 's such a thing as good tv or bad tv my idea today is to tell you that i believe television has a conscience
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 74.71 83.18 <o,f0,female> so why i believe that television has a conscience is that i actually believe that television directly reflects the moral
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 90.06 109.62 <o,f0,female> disseminate our entire value system so all these things are uniquely human and they all add up to our idea of conscience now today we 're not talking about good and bad tv we 're talking about popular tv we 're talking about top ten nielsen rated shows over the course of fifty years
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 109.62 126.24 <o,f0,female> how do these nielsen ratings reflect not just what you 've heard about which is the idea of our social collective unconscious but how do these top ten nielsen rated shows over fifty years reflect the idea of our social conscience
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 126.24 143.22 <o,f0,female> how does television evolve over time and what does this say about our society now speaking of evolution from basic biology you probably remember that the animal kingdom including humans have four basic primal instincts you have hunger you have sex
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 143.29 147.3 <o,f0,female> you have power and you have the urge for acquisitiveness
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 147.3 166.36 <o,f0,female> as humans what 's important to remember is that we 've developed we 've evolved over time to temper or tame these basic animal instincts we have the capacity to laugh and cry we feel awe we feel pity that is separate and apart from the animal kingdom
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 166.36 182.3 <o,f0,female> the other thing about human beings is that we love to be entertained we love to watch tv this is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom animals might love to play but they don 't love to watch
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 182.3 201.2 <o,f0,female> so i had an ambition to discover what could be understood from this uniquely human relationship between television programs and the human conscious why has television entertainment evolved the way it has i kind of think of it as this cartoon devil or angel sitting on our shoulders
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 201.2 208.63 <o,f0,female> is television literally functioning as our conscience tempting us and rewarding us at the same time
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 208.63 223.32 <o,f0,female> so to begin to answer these questions we did a research study we went back fifty years to the one thousand nine hundred and fifty nine one thousand nine hundred and sixty television season we surveyed the top twenty nielsen shows every year for fifty years a thousand shows
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 223.32 231.22 <o,f0,female> we talked to over three thousand individuals almost three thousand six hundred aged eighteen to seventy and we asked them how they felt
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 231.22 243.32 <o,f0,female> emotionally how did you feel watching every single one of these shows did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity did you feel outrage did you laugh what did this mean for you
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 243.32 248.31 <o,f0,female> so to our global ted audiences i want to say that this was a u s sample
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 248.31 263.8 <o,f0,female> but as you can see these emotional need states are truly universal and on a factual basis over eighty percent of the u s s most popular shows are exported around the world so i really hope our global audiences can relate
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 267.32 280.28 <o,f0,female> for inspiring me to even think about the idea of conscience and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis i thank legendary rabbi jack stern
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 280.28 288.98 <o,f0,female> and for the way in which i 'm going to present the data i want to thank ted community superstar hans rosling who you may have just seen
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 288.98 297.27 <o,f0,female> okay here we go so here you see from one thousand nine hundred and sixty to two thousand and ten the fifty years of our study
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 297.27 311.6 <o,f0,female> two things we 're going to start with the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state which for this purpose we defined inspiration as television shows that uplift me that make me feel much more positive about the world
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 319.64 328.17 <o,f0,female> as we start you see in one thousand nine hundred and sixty inspiration is holding steady that 's what we 're watching tv for moral ambiguity starts to climb
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 328.17 346.9 <o,f0,female> right at the end of the sixty s moral ambiguity is going up inspiration is kind of on the wane why the cuban missile crisis jfk is shot the civil rights movement race riots the vietnam war mlk is shot bobby kennedy is shot watergate look what
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 346.9 352.94 <o,f0,female> happens in one thousand nine hundred and seventy inspiration plummets moral ambiguity takes off they cross
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 352.94 369.94 <o,f0,female> but ronald reagan a telegenic president is in office it 's trying to recover but look it can 't aids iran contra the challenger disaster chernobyl moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television from one thousand nine hundred and ninety for the next twenty years
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 369.94 378.14 <o,f0,female> take a look at this this chart is going to document a very similar trend but in this case we have comfort the bubble in red
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 382.06 392.7 <o,f0,female> now this time on tv you have bonanza don 't forget you have gunsmoke you have andy griffith you have domestic shows all about comfort
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 409.52 427.7 <o,f0,female> but you literally have two establishment shows gunsmoke and gomer pyle in one thousand nine hundred and sixty nine are the number two and number three rated television shows what 's number one the socially irreverent hippie show rowan and martin 's laugh in they 're all living together right
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 446.2 450.41 <o,f0,female> this was the first show that allowed viewers to say my god
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 450.41 459.5 <o,f0,female> i can comment on how i feel about the vietnam war about the presidency through television that 's what we mean by a breakout show
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 491.43 493.26 <o,f0,female> seven of ten
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 493.35 499.67 <o,f0,female> shows ranked most highly for irreverence appeared on air during the vietnam war
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 499.81 511.22 <o,f0,female> five of the top ten during the nixon administration only one generation twenty years in and we discovered wow tv can do that
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 521.31 530.59 <o,f0,female> the digital folks did not invent disruptive archie bunker was shoved out of his easy chair along with the rest of us forty years ago
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 530.59 550.19 <o,f0,female> this is a quick chart here 's another attribute fantasy and imagination which are shows defined as takes me out of my everyday realm and makes me feel better that 's mapped against the red dot unemployment which is a simple bureau of labor department statistic you 'll see that every time
LaurenZalaznick_2010W 1 LaurenZalaznick_2010W 592.47 608.22 <o,f0,female> so here you are in my favorite chart because this is our last twenty years whether or not you 're in my business you have surely heard or read of the decline of the thing called the three camera sitcom and the rise
