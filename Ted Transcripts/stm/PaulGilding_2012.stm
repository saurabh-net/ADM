PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 22.98 26.13 <o,f0,male> this century
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 41.82 46.99 <o,f0,male> so much that our economy is now bigger than its host our planet
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 65.2 81.35 <o,f0,male> the eminent scientists of the global footprint network for example calculate that we need about one point five earths to sustain this economy in other words to keep operating at our current level we need fifty percent more earth than we 've got
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 84.46 91.5 <o,f0,male> in financial terms this would be like always spending fifty percent more than you earn going further into debt every year
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 91.87 97.48 <o,f0,male> but of course you can 't borrow natural resources so we 're burning through our capital
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 97.56 99.59 <o,f0,male> or stealing from the future
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 100.6 109.05 <o,f0,male> so when i say full i mean really full well past any margin for error well past any dispute about methodology
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 111.59 116.89 <o,f0,male> what this means is our economy is unsustainable i 'm not saying it 's not nice or pleasant
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 121.74 126.93 <o,f0,male> what i 'm saying is our approach is simply unsustainable in other words
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 135.13 145.63 <o,f0,male> economic growth because that 's what will stop economic growth it will stop because of the end of trade resources it will stop because of the growing demand
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 156.51 165.16 <o,f0,male> when we think about economic growth stopping we go that 's not possible because economic growth is so essential to our society that is is rarely questioned
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 173.61 186.15 <o,f0,male> understand the possibility of it not being around even though it has delivered many benefits it is based on a crazy idea the crazy idea being that we can have infinite growth on a finite planet
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 187.17 195.91 <o,f0,male> and i 'm here to tell you the emperor has no clothes that the crazy idea is just that it is crazy and with the earth full it 's game over
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 225.58 228.66 <o,f0,male> the problem is we 're just warming up this growth engine
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 229.53 232.37 <o,f0,male> we plan to take this highly stressed economy
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 245.92 249.26 <o,f0,male> china plans to be there in just twenty years
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 250.43 254.5 <o,f0,male> the only problem with this plan is that it 's not possible
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 293.73 306.98 <o,f0,male> so the idea that we can smoothly transition to a highly efficient solar powered knowledge based economy transformed by science and technology so that nine billion people can live in two thousand and fifty
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 307.6 311.42 <o,f0,male> a life of abundance and digital downloads is a delusion
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 312.94 318.2 <o,f0,male> it 's not that it 's not possible to feed clothe and house us all and have us live decent lives
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 318.79 326.47 <o,f0,male> it certainly is but the idea that we can gently grow there with a few minor hiccups is just wrong
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 332.69 336.9 <o,f0,male> see what happens when you operate a system past its limits
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 342.37 345.55 <o,f0,male> is that the system stops working and breaks down
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 346.48 348.76 <o,f0,male> and that 's what will happen to us
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 353.62 355.38 <o,f0,male> many of you will be thinking
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 356.1 360.21 <o,f0,male> but surely we can still stop this if it 's that bad we 'll react
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 360.87 366.41 <o,f0,male> let 's just think through that idea now we 've had fifty years of warnings
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 380.13 385.28 <o,f0,male> pretty much nothing to change course we 're not even slowing down
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 385.52 389.75 <o,f0,male> last year on climate for example we had the highest global emissions ever
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 409.51 411.06 <o,f0,male> and recognized
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 419.07 424.36 <o,f0,male> and that 's why the end of growth is the central issue and the event that we need to get ready for
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 424.72 430.78 <o,f0,male> so when does this transition begin when does this breakdown begin
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 459.62 465.42 <o,f0,male> in fact it 's the system in the painful process of breaking down our system
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 476.97 485.31 <o,f0,male> i could give you countless studies and evidence to prove this but i won 't because if you want to see it that evidence is all around you
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 485.89 488.19 <o,f0,male> i want to talk to you about fear
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 489.12 495.68 <o,f0,male> i want to do so because in my view the most important issue we face
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 496.65 500.13 <o,f0,male> is how we respond to this question
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 500.38 503.62 <o,f0,male> the crisis is now inevitable
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 508.32 510.39 <o,f0,male> of course we can 't know what will happen
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 510.64 515.47 <o,f0,male> the future is inherently uncertain but let 's just think through what the science is telling us
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 515.58 520.11 <o,f0,male> is likely to happen imagine our economy
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 521.34 529.51 <o,f0,male> when the carbon bubble bursts when the financial markets recognize that to have any hope of preventing the climate spiraling out of control
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 530.27 533.22 <o,f0,male> the oil and coal industries are finished
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 534.45 539.29 <o,f0,male> imagine china india and pakistan going to war as climate impacts
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 540.33 542.55 <o,f0,male> generate conflict over food and water
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 543.75 546.16 <o,f0,male> imagine the middle east without oil income
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 546.47 548.25 <o,f0,male> but with collapsing governments
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 549.03 555.4 <o,f0,male> imagine our highly tuned just in time food industry and our highly stressed agricultural system failing
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 559.98 570.15 <o,f0,male> imagine thirty percent unemployment in america as the global economy is gripped by fear and uncertainty now imagine what that means for you your family
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 570.62 577.5 <o,f0,male> your friends your personal financial security imagine what it means for your personal security
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 578.13 584.56 <o,f0,male> as a heavily armed civilian population gets angrier and angrier about why this was allowed to happen
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 586.39 592.98 <o,f0,male> imagine what you 'll tell your children when they ask you so in two thousand and twelve mom and dad what was it like
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 618.23 619.74 <o,f0,male> what were you thinking
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 622.11 623.65 <o,f0,male> so how do you feel
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 672.91 674.62 <o,f0,male> we should feel a bit of fear
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 677.05 679.64 <o,f0,male> we are in danger all of us
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 679.92 685.4 <o,f0,male> and we 've evolved to respond to danger with fear to motivate a powerful response
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 689.3 692.86 <o,f0,male> but this time it 's not a tiger at the cave mouth
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 693.24 696.77 <o,f0,male> you can 't see the danger at your door but if you look
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 696.89 699.6 <o,f0,male> you can see it at the door of your civilization
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 702.08 715.32 <o,f0,male> that 's why we need to feel our response now while the lights are still on because if we wait until the crisis takes hold we may panic and hide if we feel it now and think it through we will realize we have nothing to fear but fear itself
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 718.88 720.64 <o,f0,male> yes things will get ugly
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 720.79 733.12 <o,f0,male> and it will happen soon certainly in our lifetime but we are more than capable of getting through everything that 's coming you see those people that have faith that humans can solve any problem
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 734.35 736.3 <o,f0,male> that technology is limitless
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 742.22 744.45 <o,f0,male> is that it takes a good crisis to get us going
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 745.28 751.65 <o,f0,male> when we feel fear and we fear loss we are capable of quite extraordinary things think about
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 771.14 780.2 <o,f0,male> think about how an individual responds to a diagnosis of a life threatening illness and how lifestyle changes that previously were just too difficult
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 784.86 789.35 <o,f0,male> we are smart in fact we really are quite amazing but we do love a good crisis
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 789.46 791.9 <o,f0,male> and the good news this one 's a monster
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 798.01 807.66 <o,f0,male> but if we get it right it could be the beginning of civilization instead and how cool would it be to tell your grandchildren that you were part of that
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 820.09 821.76 <o,f0,male> in just a few decades
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 832.37 836.13 <o,f0,male> so named because of the level of mobilization and focus required
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 836.92 848.78 <o,f0,male> to my surprise eliminating net co two emissions from the economy in just twenty years is actually pretty easy and pretty cheap not very cheap but certainly less than the cost of a collapsing civilization
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 854.94 869.55 <o,f0,male> you can read the details but in summary we can transform our economy we can do it with proven technology we can do it at an affordable cost we can do it with existing political structures the only thing we need to change is how we think and how we feel
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 869.69 871.43 <o,f0,male> and this is where you come in
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 872.74 876.45 <o,f0,male> when we think about the future i paint of course we should feel a bit of fear
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 877.15 882.3 <o,f0,male> but fear can be paralyzing or motivating we need to accept the fear and then we need to act
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 891.79 900.71 <o,f0,male> we can do this i know the free market fundamentalists will tell you that more growth more stuff and nine billion people going shopping is the best we can do
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 900.71 902.31 <o,f0,male> they 're wrong
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 902.8 905.35 <o,f0,male> we can be more we can be much more
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 907.29 914.51 <o,f0,male> we have achieved remarkable things since working out how to grow food some ten thousand years ago we 've built a powerful foundation
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 914.58 917.54 <o,f0,male> of science knowledge and technology more than enough
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 928.73 933.77 <o,f0,male> we can choose this moment of crisis to ask and answer the big questions of society 's evolution
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 944.66 946.51 <o,f0,male> well it 's time to grow up
PaulGilding_2012 1 PaulGilding_2012 962.67 966.92 <o,f0,male> which is stronger and happier and plans on staying around
