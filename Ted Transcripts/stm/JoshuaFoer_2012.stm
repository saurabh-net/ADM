JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 47.61 60.06 <o,f0,male> i need you to actually see this they are pedaling really hard they 're sweaty they 're bouncing around a lot and they crash straight into the front door of your home
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 60.58 63.8 <o,f0,male> bicycles fly everywhere wheels roll past you

JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 83.83 91.31 <o,f0,male> cookie monster cookie monster is waving at you from his perch on top of a tan horse it 's a talking horse you can
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 100.8 102.91 <o,f0,male> walk past him into your living room

JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 114.75 116.99 <o,f0,male> and she 's singing hit me baby one more time
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 117.35 126.48 <o,f0,male> and then follow me into your kitchen in your kitchen the floor has been paved over with a yellow brick road and out of your oven

JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 132.9 136.02 <o,f0,male> hand in hand skipping straight towards you okay
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 152.41 153.97 <o,f0,male> as a science journalist
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 160.43 163.48 <o,f0,male> this was a bunch of guys and a few ladies
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 163.81 167.53 <o,f0,male> widely varying in both age and hygienic upkeep
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 184.19 195.15 <o,f0,male> they were competing to see who could memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards the fastest i was like this is unbelievable these people must be freaks of nature
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 195.37 196.95 <o,f0,male> and i started talking
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 196.98 205.63 <o,f0,male> to a few of the competitors this is a guy called ed cook who had come over from england where he had one of the best trained memories and i said to him ed
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 206.06 209.35 <o,f0,male> when did you realize that you were a savant
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 209.81 214.66 <o,f0,male> and ed was like i 'm not a savant in fact i have just an average memory
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 215.05 225.08 <o,f0,male> everybody who competes in this contest will tell you that they have just an average memory we 've all trained ourselves to perform these utterly miraculous
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 225.27 240.69 <o,f0,male> feats of memory using a set of ancient techniques techniques invented two thousand five hundred years ago in greece the same techniques that cicero had used to memorize his speeches that medieval scholars had used to memorize entire books
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 244.87 249.02 <o,f0,male> and we were standing outside the competition hall and ed
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 249.22 251.65 <o,f0,male> who is a wonderful brilliant
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 251.9 255.48 <o,f0,male> but somewhat eccentric english guy says to me
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 258.69 260.56 <o,f0,male> do you know britney spears
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 282.54 284.54 <o,f0,male> i 'm not britney spears
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 284.97 286.9 <o,f0,male> but maybe you could teach me
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 287.57 289.82 <o,f0,male> i mean you 've got to start somewhere right
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 289.82 309.4 <o,f0,male> and that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me i ended up spending the better part of the next year not only training my memory but also investigating it trying to understand how it works why it sometimes doesn 't work and what its potential might be i met a host of really interesting people
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 309.4 316.19 <o,f0,male> this is a guy called e p he 's an amnesic who had very possibly the very worst memory in the world
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 322.69 330.52 <o,f0,male> and he was this incredibly tragic figure but he was a window into the extent to which our memories make us who we are
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 331.11 332.9 <o,f0,male> the other end of the spectrum
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 333.24 338.75 <o,f0,male> i met this guy this is kim peek he was the basis for dustin hoffman 's character in the movie rain man
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 339.07 341.03 <o,f0,male> we spent an afternoon together
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 341.1 345.05 <o,f0,male> in the salt lake city public library memorizing phone books
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 362.63 365.06 <o,f0,male> and i learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 365.18 368.25 <o,f0,male> one of the really interesting things that i learned
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 368.39 370.34 <o,f0,male> is that once upon a time
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 370.71 373.21 <o,f0,male> this idea of having
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 373.21 376.71 <o,f0,male> trained disciplined cultivated memory
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 376.94 381.43 <o,f0,male> was not nearly so alien as it would seem to us to be today
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 386.47 390.52 <o,f0,male> in laboriously furnishing their minds
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 391.75 403.07 <o,f0,male> over the last few millenia we 've invented a series of technologies from the alphabet to the scroll to the codex the printing press photography the computer the smartphone
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 403.07 413.87 <o,f0,male> that have made it progressively easier and easier for us to externalize our memories for us to essentially outsource this fundamental human capacity
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 414.78 417.9 <o,f0,male> these technologies have made our modern world possible
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 425.05 427.6 <o,f0,male> having little need to remember anymore
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 427.74 429.86 <o,f0,male> it sometimes seems like we 've forgotten how
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 430.77 449.06 <o,f0,male> one of the last places on earth where you still find people passionate about this idea of a trained disciplined cultivated memory is at this totally singular memory contest it 's actually not that singular there are contests held all over the world and i was fascinated i wanted to know how do these guys do it
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 451.32 456.69 <o,f0,male> a few years back a group of researchers at university college london brought a bunch of memory champions into the lab
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 456.85 466.52 <o,f0,male> they wanted to know do these guys have brains that are somehow structurally anatomically different from the rest of ours the answer was no
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 482.73 491.72 <o,f0,male> when they put these guys in an fmri machine scanned their brains while they were memorizing numbers and people 's faces and pictures of snowflakes
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 492.02 498.07 <o,f0,male> they found that the memory champions were lighting up different parts of the brain than everyone else
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 512.8 516.6 <o,f0,male> the sport of competitive memorizing
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 517.05 518.99 <o,f0,male> is driven by a kind of arms race
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 519.26 535.67 <o,f0,male> where every year somebody comes up with a new way to remember more stuff more quickly and then the rest of the field has to play catchup this is my friend ben pridmore three time world memory champion on his desk in front of him are thirty six shuffled packs of playing cards
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 536.23 553.15 <o,f0,male> that he is about to try to memorize in one hour using a technique that he invented and he alone has mastered he used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of four thousand one hundred and forty random binary digits
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 553.24 555.01 <o,f0,male> in half an hour
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 565.53 574.23 <o,f0,male> everything all of the techniques that are being used ultimately come down to a concept that psychologists refer to as elaborative encoding
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 574.32 580.27 <o,f0,male> and it 's well illustrated by a nifty paradox known as the baker baker paradox which goes like this
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 596.5 599.54 <o,f0,male> and i come back to you at some point later on
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 599.74 604.98 <o,f0,male> and i say do you remember that word that i told you a while back do you remember what it was
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 605.37 611.59 <o,f0,male> the person who was told his name is baker is less likely to remember the same word
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 615.27 629.32 <o,f0,male> same word different amount of remembering that 's weird what 's going on here well the name baker doesn 't actually mean anything to you it is entirely untethered from all of the other memories
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 629.5 632.72 <o,f0,male> floating around in your skull but the common noun baker
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 633.18 635.78 <o,f0,male> we know bakers bakers wear funny white hats
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 636.14 650.17 <o,f0,male> bakers have flour on their hands bakers smell good when they come home from work maybe we even know a baker and when we first hear that word we start putting these associational hooks into it that make it easier to fish it back out at some later date
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 655.39 658.82 <o,f0,male> and the entire art of remembering stuff better in everyday life
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 663.07 664.88 <o,f0,male> into lower case b bakers
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 667.33 677.03 <o,f0,male> in context in significance in meaning and transform it in some way so that it becomes meaningful in the light of all the other things that you have
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 682.95 686.49 <o,f0,male> dates back two thousand five hundred years to ancient greece
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 688.9 691.58 <o,f0,male> the story behind its creation goes like this
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 697.04 702.2 <o,f0,male> he was actually the hired entertainment because back then if you wanted to throw a really slamming party
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 702.27 704.87 <o,f0,male> you didn 't hire a d j you hired a poet
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 705.24 710.49 <o,f0,male> and he stands up delivers his poem from memory walks out the door
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 710.79 712.36 <o,f0,male> and at the moment he does
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 712.88 715.09 <o,f0,male> the banquet hall collapses
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 720.83 727.03 <o,f0,male> it mangles the bodies beyond all recognition nobody can say who was inside
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 727.27 735.42 <o,f0,male> nobody can say where they were sitting the bodies can 't be properly buried it 's one tragedy compounding another
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 742.57 744.76 <o,f0,male> and has this realization
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 747.15 757.77 <o,f0,male> he can see where each of the guests at the banquet had been sitting and he takes the relatives by the hand and guides them each to their loved ones amid the wreckage
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 762.13 765.29 <o,f0,male> is something that i think we all kind of intuitively know
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 765.37 773.38 <o,f0,male> which is that as bad as we are at remembering names and phone numbers and word for word instructions from our colleagues
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 773.51 778.13 <o,f0,male> we have really exceptional visual and spatial memories
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 792.47 796.82 <o,f0,male> who is sitting on top of a talking tan horse
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 797.11 798.66 <o,f0,male> in your foyer right now
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 803.77 808.22 <o,f0,male> is to create this imagined edifice in your mind 's eye
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 808.36 826.29 <o,f0,male> and populate it with images of the things that you want to remember the crazier weirder more bizarre funnier raunchier stinkier the image is the more unforgettable it 's likely to be this is advice that goes back two thousand plus years to the earliest latin
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 826.29 828.75 <o,f0,male> memory treatises so how does this work
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 829.48 832.52 <o,f0,male> let 's say that you 've been invited
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 832.97 838.92 <o,f0,male> to ted center stage to give a speech and you want to do it from memory
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 839.06 842.41 <o,f0,male> and you want to do it the way that cicero
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 856.15 861.4 <o,f0,male> and you 'd come up with some sort of an absolutely crazy ridiculous unforgettable image
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 861.48 866.8 <o,f0,male> to remind you that the first thing you want to talk about is this totally bizarre contest
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 867.6 869.43 <o,f0,male> and then you 'd go inside your house
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 869.7 874.28 <o,f0,male> and you would see an image of cookie monster on top of mister ed
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 874.54 878.54 <o,f0,male> and that would remind you that you would want to then introduce your friend ed cook
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 878.99 884 <o,f0,male> and then you 'd see an image of britney spears to remind you of this funny anecdote you want to tell
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 884.22 885.79 <o,f0,male> and you go into your kitchen
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 885.87 894.16 <o,f0,male> and the fourth topic you were going to talk about was this strange journey that you went on for a year and you have some friends to help you remember that
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 922.17 924.82 <o,f0,male> that 's like in the first place of your memory palace
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 925.75 932.03 <o,f0,male> i thought this was just fascinating and i got really into it and i went to a few more of these memory contests
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 939.59 942.54 <o,f0,male> the problem was that a memory contest
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 942.74 946.77 <o,f0,male> is a pathologically boring event
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 953.77 964.88 <o,f0,male> i mean the most dramatic it gets is when somebody starts massaging their temples and i 'm a journalist i need something to write about i know that there 's this incredible stuff happening in these people 's minds but i don 't have access to
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 968.78 970.85 <o,f0,male> i needed to walk in their shoes a little bit
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 971.49 977.49 <o,f0,male> and so i started trying to spend fifteen or twenty minutes every morning before i sat down with my new york times
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 981.69 988.61 <o,f0,male> maybe it was names from an old yearbook that i bought at a flea market and i found that this was
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 1008.81 1016.84 <o,f0,male> and i got pretty into it this is me wearing my standard competitive memorizer 's training kit
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 1017.87 1023.11 <o,f0,male> it 's a pair of earmuffs and a set of safety goggles that have been masked over
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 1023.4 1030.82 <o,f0,male> except for two small pinholes because distraction is the competitive memorizer 's greatest enemy
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 1042.58 1045.77 <o,f0,male> it 'd make i thought maybe a nice epilogue to all my research
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 1050.31 1053.42 <o,f0,male> i won the contest
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 1053.5 1055.76 <o,f0,male> which really wasn 't supposed to happen
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 1064.55 1069.81 <o,f0,male> to memorize speeches and phone numbers and shopping lists
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 1070.49 1072.48 <o,f0,male> but it 's actually kind of beside the point
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 1081.79 1097.69 <o,f0,male> and you don 't have to be building memory palaces or memorizing packs of playing cards to benefit from a little bit of insight about how your mind works we often talk about people with great memories as though it were some sort of an innate gift but that is not the case
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 1098.59 1100.8 <o,f0,male> great memories are learned
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 1101.87 1118.6 <o,f0,male> at the most basic level we remember when we pay attention we remember when we are deeply engaged we remember when we are able to take a piece of information and experience and figure out why it is meaningful to us why it is significant why it 's colorful when we 're able
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 1118.6 1126.85 <o,f0,male> to transform it in some way that it makes sense in the light of all of the other things floating around in our minds when we 're able to transform bakers
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 1136.76 1144.87 <o,f0,male> they work because they make you work they force a kind of depth of processing a kind of mindfulness
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 1145.03 1151.23 <o,f0,male> that most of us don 't normally walk around exercising but there actually are no shortcuts
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 1155.15 1158.39 <o,f0,male> and i think if there 's one thing that i want to leave you with
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 1163.55 1167.66 <o,f0,male> couldn 't even remember that he had a memory problem left me with which is
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 1167.96 1170.33 <o,f0,male> the notion that our lives
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 1171.63 1173.42 <o,f0,male> are the sum of our memories
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 1191.48 1195.59 <o,f0,male> not paying attention to the human being across from us who is talking with us
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 1195.76 1199.34 <o,f0,male> by being so lazy that we 're not willing to process
JoshuaFoer_2012 1 JoshuaFoer_2012 1204.3 1207.77 <o,f0,male> that there are incredible memory capacities
