MayElKhalil_2013G 1 MayElKhalil_2013G 24.52 37.99 <o,f0,female> you know lebanon as a country has been once destroyed by a long and bloody civil war honestly i don 't know why they call it civil war when there is nothing civil about it
MayElKhalil_2013G 1 MayElKhalil_2013G 37.99 50.21 <o,f0,female> with syria to the north israel and palestine to the south and our government even up till this moment is still fragmented and unstable
MayElKhalil_2013G 1 MayElKhalil_2013G 50.21 56.27 <o,f0,female> for years the country has been divided between politics and religion
MayElKhalil_2013G 1 MayElKhalil_2013G 56.27 58.16 <o,f0,female> however
MayElKhalil_2013G 1 MayElKhalil_2013G 84.81 90.2 <o,f0,female> until one fateful morning and while training
MayElKhalil_2013G 1 MayElKhalil_2013G 90.2 94.03 <o,f0,female> i was hit by a bus
MayElKhalil_2013G 1 MayElKhalil_2013G 94.35 95.88 <o,f0,female> i nearly died
MayElKhalil_2013G 1 MayElKhalil_2013G 107.06 121.85 <o,f0,female> as soon as i came out of my coma i realized that i was no longer the same runner i used to be so i decided if i couldn 't run myself i wanted to make sure
MayElKhalil_2013G 1 MayElKhalil_2013G 122.01 134.45 <o,f0,female> that others could so out of my hospital bed i asked my husband to start taking notes and a few months later the marathon was born
MayElKhalil_2013G 1 MayElKhalil_2013G 142.37 154.69 <o,f0,female> but at that time even during my most vulnerable condition i needed to dream big i needed something to take me out of my pain an objective to look forward to
MayElKhalil_2013G 1 MayElKhalil_2013G 155.57 157.97 <o,f0,female> i didn 't want to pity myself
MayElKhalil_2013G 1 MayElKhalil_2013G 157.98 159.91 <o,f0,female> nor to be pitied
MayElKhalil_2013G 1 MayElKhalil_2013G 159.91 168.46 <o,f0,female> and i thought by organizing such a marathon i 'll be able to pay back to my community build bridges with the outside
MayElKhalil_2013G 1 MayElKhalil_2013G 184.62 200.75 <o,f0,female> how do you introduce the concept of running to a nation that is constantly at the brink of war how do you ask those who were once fighting and killing each other to come together and run next to each other
MayElKhalil_2013G 1 MayElKhalil_2013G 200.75 212.81 <o,f0,female> more than that how do you convince people to run a distance of twenty six point two miles at a time they were not even familiar with the word marathon
MayElKhalil_2013G 1 MayElKhalil_2013G 213.28 216.48 <o,f0,female> so we had to start from scratch for
MayElKhalil_2013G 1 MayElKhalil_2013G 233.77 237 <o,f0,female> people from mosques churches
MayElKhalil_2013G 1 MayElKhalil_2013G 252.61 269.99 <o,f0,female> and they shared their stories in return it was honesty and transparency that brought us together we spoke one common language to each other and that was from one human to another
MayElKhalil_2013G 1 MayElKhalil_2013G 269.99 282.83 <o,f0,female> once that trust was built everybody wanted to be part of the marathon to show the world the true colors of lebanon and the lebanese and their desire to live in peace
MayElKhalil_2013G 1 MayElKhalil_2013G 295.09 299.15 <o,f0,female> all determined and when the gunfire went off

MayElKhalil_2013G 1 MayElKhalil_2013G 392.51 402.47 <o,f0,female> overcome when the opposition party decided to shut down part of the city center we negotiated alternative routes
