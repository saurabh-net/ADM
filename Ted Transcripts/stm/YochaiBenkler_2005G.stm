YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 12.77 19.14 <o,f0,male> the problems of writing and working and looking at the internet is that it's very hard to separate fashion
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 29.40 41.19 <o,f0,male> james gordon bennett founded the first mass circulation newspaper in new york city and it cost about five hundred dollars to start it which was about the equivalent of ten thousand dollars of today
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 53.46 61.09 <o,f0,male> ten thousand two and a half million fifteen years that's the critical change that is being
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 62.53 72.81 <o,f0,male> by the net and that's what i want to talk about today and how that relates to the emergence of social production starting with newspapers what we saw was
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 73.28 80.92 <o,f0,male> high cost as an initial requirement for making information knowledge and culture
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 81.33 89.58 <o,f0,male> which led to a stark bifurcation between producers who had to be able to raise financial capital just like any other industrial
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 99.36 107.32 <o,f0,male> now the term information society information economy for a very long time has been used as the thing that comes after the industrial
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 108.22 120.27 <o,f0,male> revolution but in fact for purposes of understanding what's happening today that's wrong because for one hundred and fifty years we've had an information economy it's just been industrial
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 120.72 132.39 <o,f0,male> which means those who were producing had to have a way of raising money to pay those two and a half million dollars and later more for the telegraph and the radio transmitter and the television and eventually the mainframe
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 133.10 146.69 <o,f0,male> and that meant they were market based or they were government owned depending on what kind of system they were in and this characterized and anchored the way information and knowledge were produced for the next one hundred and fifty years
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 148.15 157.49 <o,f0,male> now let me tell you a different story around june two thousand and two the world of supercomputers had a bombshell
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 157.71 171.60 <o,f0,male> the japanese had for the first time created the fastest supercomputer the nec earth simulator taking the primary from the us and about two years later this by the way is measuring the trillion floating point operations per second that the computer 's capable of running
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 172.40 186.27 <o,f0,male> sigh of relief ibm gene blue has just edged ahead of the nec earth simulator all of this completely ignores the fact that throughout this period there's another supercomputer running in the world seti at home
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 186.72 197.80 <o,f0,male> four and a half million users around the world contributing their leftover computer cycles whenever their computer isn't working by running a screen saver and together
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 198.49 211.30 <o,f0,male> sharing their resources to create a massive supercomputer that nasa harnesses to analyze the data coming from radio telescopes what this
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 212.05 220.40 <o,f0,male> picture suggests to us is that we've got a radical change in the way information production and exchange is capitalized
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 228.57 235.57 <o,f0,male> happens is radically distributed each of us in these advanced economies has one of these
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 236.04 243.70 <o,f0,male> or something rather like it a computer they're not radically different from routers inside the middle of the network
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 244.31 252.64 <o,f0,male> and computation storage and communications capacity are in the hands of practically every connected person
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 253.45 265.69 <o,f0,male> and these are the basic physical capital means necessary for producing information knowledge and culture in the hands of something like six hundred million to a billion people around the planet
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 266.88 274.56 <o,f0,male> what this means is that for the first time since the industrial revolution the most important
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 275.06 282.20 <o,f0,male> means the most important components of the core economic activities remember we are in an information economy
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 282.84 289.98 <o,f0,male> of the most advanced economies and there more than anywhere else are in the hands of the population at large
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 299.81 311.70 <o,f0,male> and we've got human creativity human wisdom human experience the other major experience the other major input which unlike simple labor stand here turning this lever all day long
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 311.98 324.01 <o,f0,male> is not something that's the same or fungible among people any one of you who has taken someone else's job or tried to give yours to someone else no matter how detailed the manual you cannot transmit
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 324.62 332.50 <o,f0,male> what you know what you will intuit under a certain set of circumstances in that we're unique and each of us holds this critical
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 333.79 338.89 <o,f0,male> into production as we hold this machine what's the effect
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 340.48 349.65 <o,f0,male> this so the story that most people know is the story of free or open source software this is market share of apache web server
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 358.84 369.83 <o,f0,male> wow this is really important the web we need a much better web server one was a motley collection of volunteers who just decided you know we really need this we should write one and
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 370.98 382.40 <o,f0,male> what are we going to do with what well we're gonna share it and other people will be able to develop it the other was microsoft now if i told you that ten years later the motley crew of people who didn't control anything that they produced
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 394.68 407.88 <o,f0,male> right but in fact of course the story is it's the seventy percent including the major e commerce site seventy percent of a critical application on which web based communications and applications work
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 408.38 418.44 <o,f0,male> is produced in this form in direct competition with microsoft not in a side issue in a central strategic decision to try to capture a component of the
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 432.25 437.23 <o,f0,male> nasa at some point did an experiment where they took images of mars
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 437.88 445.65 <o,f0,male> that they were mapping and they said instead of having three or four fully trained phds doing this all the time let 's break it up into small components
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 446.05 455.42 <o,f0,male> put it up on the web and see if people using a very simple interface will actually spend five minutes here ten minutes there clicking after six months
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 455.99 463.60 <o,f0,male> eighty five thousand people used this to generate mapping at a faster rate than the images were coming in
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 463.97 472.66 <o,f0,male> which was quote practically indistinguishable from the markings of a fully trained phd once you showed it to a number of people and computed
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 474.83 480.93 <o,f0,male> average now if you have a little girl and she goes and writes to well not so little medium little
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 500.34 506.33 <o,f0,male> which is vastly better than what you'll find in the encyclopedia com which is barbie klaus
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 508.35 517.22 <o,f0,male> on the other hand if they go to wikipedia they'll find a genuine article and i won 't talk a lot about wikipedia because jimmy wales is here but
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 517.89 527.96 <o,f0,male> roughly equivalent to what you would find in the britannica differently written including the controversies over body image and commercialization the claims about
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 530.26 542.51 <o,f0,male> the way in which she's a good role model et cetera another portion is not only how content is produced but how relevance is produced the claim to fame of yahoo was we hire people to look originally not anymore
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 543.22 553.30 <o,f0,male> we hire people to look at websites and tell you if they're in the index they're good this on the other hand is what sixty thousand passionate volunteers produce
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 553.49 562.10 <o,f0,male> in the open directory project each one willing to spend an hour or two on something they really care about to say this is good
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 562.77 572.92 <o,f0,male> so this is the open directory project with sixty thousand volunteers each one spending a little bit of time as opposed to a few hundred fully paid employees no one owns it
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 573.26 583.29 <o,f0,male> no one owns the output it's free for anyone to use and it's the output of people acting out of social and psychological motivations to do something interesting
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 583.93 590.16 <o,f0,male> this is not only outside of businesses when you think of what is the critical innovation of google
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 590.56 599.30 <o,f0,male> the critical innovation is outsourcing the one most important thing the decision about what's relevant to the community of the web as
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 600.10 607.51 <o,f0,male> a whole doing whatever they want to do so page rank the critical innovation here is instead of
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 607.80 619.69 <o,f0,male> our engineers or our people saying which is the most relevant we're going to go out there and count what you people out there on the web for whatever reason vanity pleasure produced links
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 620.46 632.55 <o,f0,male> and tied to each other we're going to count those and count them up and again here you see barbie com but also very quickly adiosbarbie com the body image for every size a contested cultural object
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 632.94 646.21 <o,f0,male> which you won 't find anywhere soon on overture which is the classic market based mechanism whoever pays the most is highest on the list so all of that is in the creation of content of relevance basic human expression
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 646.71 657.68 <o,f0,male> but remember the computers were also physical just physical materials our pcs we share them together we also see this in wireless it used to be wireless was one person owned the license
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 658.42 670.73 <o,f0,male> they transmitted in an area and it had to be decided whether they would be licensed or based on property what we're seeing now is that computers and radios are becoming so sophisticated
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 671.17 681.38 <o,f0,male> that we're developing algorithms to let people own machines like wi fi devices and overlay them with a sharing protocol that would allow a community like this
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 681.68 692.88 <o,f0,male> to build its own wireless broadband network simply from the simple principle when i'm listening when i'm not using i can help you transfer your messages
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 693.36 707.78 <o,f0,male> and when you're not using you'll help me transfer yours and this is not an idealized version these are working models that at least in some places in the united states are being implemented at least for public security
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 724.09 732.57 <o,f0,male> it's got to be robust to attack including closing the main index injecting malicious files armed seizure of some major nodes
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 733.72 739.32 <o,f0,male> take years it would take millions but of course what i'm describing is p
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 741.22 754.46 <o,f0,male> we always think of it as stealing music but fundamentally it's a distributed data storage and retrieval system where people for very obvious reasons are willing to share their bandwidth and their storage to create something
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 754.99 765.98 <o,f0,male> so essentially what we're seeing is the emergence of a fourth transactional framework it used to be that there were two primary dimensions along which you could divide
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 783.66 791.56 <o,f0,male> it was too expensive to have decentralized social production to have decentralized action
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 792.09 802.63 <o,f0,male> in society that was not about society itself it was in fact economic but what we're seeing now is the emergence of this fourth system of social sharing and exchange
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 802.98 809.97 <o,f0,male> not that it's the first time that we do nice things to each other or for each other as social beings we do it all the time
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 811.02 818.41 <o,f0,male> it's that it's the first time that it's having major economic impact what characterizes them is decentralized
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 820.06 829.45 <o,f0,male> you don't have to ask permission as you do in a property based system may i do this it's open for anyone to create and innovate and share
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 829.66 837.10 <o,f0,male> if they want to by themselves or with others because property is one mechanism of coordination but it's not the only one
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 857.52 865.84 <o,f0,male> you don't increase the probability of being invited back and if dinner isn't entirely obvious think of sex
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 867.54 879.02 <o,f0,male> it also requires certain new organizational approaches and in particular what we've seen is task organization you have to hire people who know what they're doing you have to hire them to spend a lot of time
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 879.76 891.21 <o,f0,male> now take the same problem chunk it into little modules and motivations become trivial five minutes instead of watching tv five minutes i'll spend just because it's interesting just because it's fun
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 891.73 900.57 <o,f0,male> just because it gives me a certain sense of meaning or in places that are more involved like wikipedia gives me a certain set of social relations
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 901.67 909.71 <o,f0,male> so a new social phenomenon is emerging it's creating and it's most visible when we see it as a new form of competition
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 928.08 939.84 <o,f0,male> as you see a new set of social relations and behaviors emerging you have new opportunities some of them are toolmakers instead of building well behaved appliances
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 940.30 947.89 <o,f0,male> things that you know what they'll do in advance you begin to build more open tools there's a new set of values a new set of things people value
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 948.50 959.47 <o,f0,male> you build platforms for self expression and collaboration like wikipedia like the open directory project you're beginning to build platforms and you see that as a model
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 959.83 971.02 <o,f0,male> and you see surfers people who see this happening and in some sense build it into a supply chain which is a very curious one right you have a belief stuff will flow out of connected human beings
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 971.73 980.34 <o,f0,male> give me something i can use and i'm going to contract with someone i will deliver something based on what happens it's very scary that's what google does essentially
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 980.73 987.47 <o,f0,male> that's what ibm does in software services and they've done reasonably well so social production is a real fact not a
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 988.61 1001.53 <o,f0,male> it is the critical long term shift caused by the internet social relations and exchange become significantly more important than they ever were as an economic phenomenon
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 1001.78 1015.05 <o,f0,male> in some contexts it's even more efficient because of the quality of the information the ability to find the best person the lower transaction costs it's sustainable and growing fast but and this is the dark
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 1016.54 1024.22 <o,f0,male> it is threatened by in the same way that it threatens the incumbent industrial systems so next time you open the paper
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 1024.60 1032.97 <o,f0,male> and you see an intellectual property decision a telecoms decision it's not about something small and technical
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 1033.51 1042.41 <o,f0,male> it is about the future of the freedom to be as social beings with each other and the way information knowledge and culture
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 1042.75 1050.96 <o,f0,male> will be produced because it is in this context that we see a battle over how easy or hard it will be
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 1051.68 1058.28 <o,f0,male> for the industrial information economy to simply go on as it goes or for the new model of production
YochaiBenkler_2005G 1 YochaiBenkler_2005G 1058.90 1067.74 <o,f0,male> to begin to develop alongside that industrial model and change the way we begin to see the world and report what it is that we see thank you
