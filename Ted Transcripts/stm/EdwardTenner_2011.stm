EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 16.5 32.25 <o,f0,male> love unintended consequences but i 've really learned to appreciate them i 've learned that they 're really the essence of what makes for progress even when they seem to be terrible and i 'd like to review just how unintended consequences
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 32.25 39.71 <o,f0,male> play the part that they do let 's go to forty thousand years before the present
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 40.27 43.91 <o,f0,male> to the time of the cultural explosion
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 43.91 47.71 <o,f0,female> when music art
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 47.99 49.58 <o,f0,female> technology
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 49.58 66.1 <o,f0,male> so many of the things that we 're enjoying today so many of the things that are being demonstrated at ted were born and the anthropologist randall white has made a very interesting observation that if our ancestors forty thousand years ago
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 66.42 71.76 <o,f0,male> had been able to see what they had done
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 72.07 88.31 <o,f0,male> they wouldn 't have really understood it they were responding to immediate concerns they were making it possible for us to do what they do and yet they didn 't really understand how they did it now let 's advance
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 88.69 106.06 <o,f0,male> to ten thousand years before the present and this is when it really gets interesting what about the domestication of grains what about the origins of agriculture what would our ancestors ten thousand years ago have said if they really had technology assessment
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 106.42 110.2 <o,f0,male> and i could just imagine the committees reporting back to them
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 116.09 131.36 <o,f0,male> it was really bad news first of all worse nutrition maybe shorter life spans it was simply awful for women the skeletal remains from that period have shown that they were grinding grain morning noon and night
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 131.56 138.83 <o,f0,male> and politically it was awful it was the beginning of a much higher degree of inequality
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 138.92 147.15 <o,f0,male> among people if there had been rational technology assessment then i think they very well might have said let 's call the whole thing off
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 148.71 168.6 <o,f0,male> even now our choices are having unintended effects historically for example chopsticks according to one japanese anthropologist who wrote a dissertation about it at the university of michigan resulted in long term changes in the dentition in the teeth of the japanese public
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 168.76 175.07 <o,f0,male> and we are also changing our teeth right now there is evidence that the human mouth and teeth
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 180.31 195.03 <o,f0,male> but i think from the point of view of a neanderthal there would have been a lot of disapproval of the wimpish choppers that we now have so these things are kind of relative to where you or your ancestors happen to stand
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 195.03 204.91 <o,f0,male> in the ancient world there was a lot of respect for unintended consequences and there was a very healthy sense of caution reflected in the tree of knowledge
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 229.18 233.69 <o,f0,male> say this i will not treat this i cannot treat they were very conscious
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 233.69 238.92 <o,f0,male> so were the followers of hippocrates the hippocratic manuscripts also
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 239.16 244.15 <o,f0,male> repeatedly according to recent studies show how important it is not to do harm
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 244.33 262.72 <o,f0,male> more recently harvey cushing who really developed neurosurgery as we know it who changed it from a field of medicine that had a majority of deaths resulting from surgery to one in which there was a hopeful outlook he was very conscious
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 262.72 271.69 <o,f0,male> that he was not always going to do the right thing but he did his best and he kept meticulous records that let him transform that branch of medicine
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 272.64 284.18 <o,f0,male> now if we look forward a bit to the nineteenth century we find a new style of technology what we find is no longer simple tools
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 284.37 301.48 <o,f0,male> but systems we find more and more complex arrangements of machines that make it harder and harder to diagnose what 's going on and the first people who saw that were the telegraphers of the mid nineteenth century who were the original hackers
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 301.48 319.53 <o,f0,male> thomas edison would have been very very comfortable in the atmosphere of a software firm today and these hackers had a word for those mysterious bugs in telegraph systems that they called bugs that was the origin of the word bug
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 319.53 339.05 <o,f0,male> this consciousness though was a little slow to seep through the general population even people who were very very well informed samuel clemens mark twain was a big investor in the most complex machine of all times at least until one thousand nine hundred and eighteen registered with the u s patent office
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 339.05 342.55 <o,f0,male> that was the paige typesetter the paige typesetter
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 342.55 355.84 <o,f0,male> had eighteen thousand parts the patent had sixty four pages of text and two hundred and seventy one figures it was such a beautiful machine because it did everything
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 364.67 376.92 <o,f0,male> really was smitten by this machine unfortunately he was smitten in more ways than one because it made him bankrupt and he had to tour the world speaking to recoup his money
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 376.92 386.04 <o,f0,male> and this was an important thing about nineteenth century technology that all these relationships among parts could make the most brilliant idea
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 386.27 403.09 <o,f0,male> fall apart even when judged by the most expert people now there is something else though in the early twentieth century that made things even more complicated and that was that safety technology itself could be a source of danger the lesson of the titanic for a lot of the contemporaries
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 403.09 407.41 <o,f0,male> was that you must have enough lifeboats for everyone on the ship
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 407.44 409.64 <o,f0,male> and this was
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 409.81 428.9 <o,f0,male> the result of the tragic loss of lives of people who could not get into them however there was another case the eastland a ship that capsized in chicago harbor in one thousand nine hundred and fifteen and it killed eight hundred and forty one people that was fourteen more than the passenger toll of the titanic
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 429.63 439.54 <o,f0,male> the reason for it in part was the extra life boats that were added that made this already unstable ship even more unstable
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 440.34 454.58 <o,f0,male> and that again proves that when you 're talking about unintended consequences it 's not that easy to know the right lessons to draw it 's really a question of the system how the ship was loaded the ballast and many other things
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 455.12 472.72 <o,f0,male> so the twentieth century then saw how much more complex reality was but it also saw a positive side it saw that invention could actually benefit from emergencies it could benefit from tragedies
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 472.72 479.42 <o,f0,male> and my favorite example of that which is not really widely known as
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 520.43 523.88 <o,f0,male> to ten thousand gallon
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 537.01 553.98 <o,f0,male> solar radiation was demonstrated by studies of interference that was detected by the radar stations of great britain so there were benefits in calamities benefits to pure science as well as to applied science and medicine
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 554.37 556.03 <o,f0,female> now
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 556.03 561.8 <o,f0,male> when we come to the period after the second world war unintended consequences get even more interesting
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 562 572.88 <o,f0,male> and my favorite example of that occurred beginning in one thousand nine hundred and seventy six when it was discovered that the bacteria causing legionnaires disease
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 572.88 591.1 <o,f0,male> had always been present in natural waters but it was the precise temperature of the water in heating ventilating and air conditioning systems that raised the right temperature for the maximum reproduction of legionella bacillus
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 591.34 609.42 <o,f0,male> well technology to the rescue so chemists got to work and they developed a bactericide that became widely used in those systems but something else happened in the early one thousand nine hundred and eighty s and that was that there was a mysterious epidemic of failures of tape drives
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 609.48 616.52 <o,f0,male> all over the united states and ibm which made them just didn 't know
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 634.95 638.22 <o,f0,male> and these tin particles were deposited on the tape heads
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 638.22 640.17 <o,f0,male> and were crashing the tape heads
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 640.17 647.1 <o,f0,male> so they reformulated the bactericide but what 's interesting to me is that this was the first case
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 671.06 681.01 <o,f0,male> has been increasing only arithmetically so one of the characteristic problems of our time is how to close this gap between capabilities and foresight
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 681.68 694 <o,f0,male> one other very positive consequence of twentieth century technology though was the way in which other kinds of calamities could lead to positive advances
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 694 706.11 <o,f0,male> there are two historians of business at the university of maryland brent goldfarb and david kirsch who have done some extremely interesting work much of it still unpublished
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 724.55 729.18 <o,f0,male> and nobody knows just why this was so but one
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 729.91 735.79 <o,f0,male> story can reflect something of it it was the origin of the xerox copier which
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 735.98 739.48 <o,f0,male> celebrated its fiftieth anniversary last year
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 739.97 742.33 <o,f0,male> and chester carlson
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 742.33 748.53 <o,f0,female> the inventor was a patent attorney
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 777.44 795.77 <o,f0,male> dry photocopier that was commercially practical in one thousand nine hundred and sixty so we see that sometimes as a result of these dislocations as a result of people leaving their original intended career and going into something else where their creativity could make a difference
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 795.77 800.2 <o,f0,male> that depressions and all kinds of other unfortunate events
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 800.2 803.93 <o,f0,male> can have a paradoxically stimulating effect
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 806.2 814.4 <o,f0,male> what does this mean it means i think that we 're living in a time of unexpected possibilities think of the financial world for example
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 814.5 819.5 <o,f0,male> the mentor of warren buffett benjamin graham developed his system
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 839.7 850.49 <o,f0,male> when people learn from disasters now think of the large and small plagues that we have now bed bugs killer bees spam
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 873.61 887.89 <o,f0,male> so very often some kind of disaster sometimes the consequence for example of over cultivation of silk worms which was a problem in europe at the time can be the key to something much bigger so
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 887.89 899.75 <o,f0,male> this means that we need to take a different view of unintended consequences we need to take a really positive view we need to see what they can do for us we need to learn
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 899.83 905.36 <o,f0,male> from those figures that i mentioned we need to learn for example from dr cushing
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 905.82 915.89 <o,f0,male> who killed patients in the course of his early operations he had to have some errors he had to have some mistakes and he learned meticulously from his mistakes
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 915.89 928.71 <o,f0,male> and as a result when we say this isn 't brain surgery that pays tribute to how difficult it was for anyone to learn from their mistakes in a field of medicine that was considered
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 928.71 931.67 <o,f0,male> so discouraging in its prospects
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 931.8 941.5 <o,f0,male> and we can also remember how the pharmaceutical companies were willing to pool their knowledge to share their knowledge in the face of an emergency
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 941.94 947.55 <o,f0,male> which they hadn 't really been for years and years they might have been able to do it earlier
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 947.55 954.8 <o,f0,female> the message then for me about unintended consequences is chaos happens
EdwardTenner_2011 1 EdwardTenner_2011 956.08 959.13 <o,f0,female> let 's make better use of it thank you very much
