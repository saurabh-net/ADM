StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 23.31 25.02 <o,f0,male> about my own happiness
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 26 32.11 <o,f0,male> trying to see if i can actually train my mind in a particular way
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 38.85 40.36 <o,f0,male> overall well being
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 40.92 44.06 <o,f0,male> then this january my mother died
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 44.81 47.88 <o,f0,male> and pursuing a film like that just
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 48.24 51.8 <o,f0,male> seemed the last thing that was interesting to me
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 51.9 58.05 <o,f0,male> so in a very typical silly designer fashion after years worth of work
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 58.14 61.48 <o,f0,male> pretty much all i have to show for it are the titles for the film
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 118.15 121.75 <o,f0,male> over the sayan valley in indonesia
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 122.22 130.41 <o,f0,male> in that year what i did do a lot was look at all sorts of surveys looking at a lot of data on this subject
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 133.63 135.8 <o,f0,male> men and women report
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 135.8 151.52 <o,f0,male> very very similar levels of happiness this is a very quick overview of all the studies that i looked at that climate plays no role that if you live in the best climate in san diego in the united states or in the shittiest climate in buffalo new york
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 155.93 170.37 <o,f0,male> if you make more than fifty thousand bucks a year in the u s any salary increase you 're going to experience will have only a tiny tiny influence on your overall well being black people are just as happy as white people are
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 170.42 184.47 <o,f0,male> if you 're old or young it doesn 't really make a difference if you 're ugly or if you 're really really good looking it makes no difference whatsoever you will adapt to it and get used to it if you have manageable health problems
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 206.51 211.6 <o,f0,male> a fellow ted speaker jonathan haidt came up with this beautiful little analogy
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 211.6 229.46 <o,f0,male> between the conscious and the unconscious mind he says that the conscious mind is this tiny rider on this giant elephant the unconscious and the rider thinks that he can tell the elephant what to do but the elephant really has his own ideas
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 229.46 237.16 <o,f0,male> if i look at my own life i 'm born in one thousand nine hundred and sixty two in austria if i would have been born a hundred years earlier
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 237.25 253.39 <o,f0,male> the big decisions in my life would have been made for me meaning i would have stayed in the town that i was born in i would have very much likely entered the same profession that my dad did and i would have very much likely married a woman that my mom had selected
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 278.25 295.7 <o,f0,male> let our unconscious influence those decisions in ways that we are not quite aware of if you look at the statistics and you see that the guy called george when he decides on where he wants to live is it florida or north dakota
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 296.27 310.06 <o,f0,male> he goes and lives in georgia and if you look at a guy called dennis when he decides what to become is it a lawyer or does he want to become a doctor or a teacher best chance is that he wants to become a dentist
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 310.39 317.8 <o,f0,male> and if paula decides should she marry joe or jack somehow paul sounds the most interesting
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 317.88 336.31 <o,f0,male> and so even if we make those very important decisions for very silly reasons it remains statistically true that there are more georges living in georgia and there are more dennises becoming dentists and there are more paulas who are married to paul than statistically viable
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 342.9 345.61 <o,f0,male> american data and i thought well those silly
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 345.66 352.02 <o,f0,male> americans they get influenced by things that
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 356.7 360.16 <o,f0,male> then of course i looked at my mom and my dad
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 368.68 372.77 <o,f0,male> so i am looking still for a stephanie i 'll figure something out
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 374.3 382.07 <o,f0,male> if i make this whole thing a little bit more personal and see what makes me happy as a designer the easiest answer of course is
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 382.28 392.9 <o,f0,male> do more of the stuff that i like to do and much less of the stuff that i don 't like to do for which it would be helpful to know what it is that i actually do like to do
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 393.01 399.23 <o,f0,male> i 'm a big list maker so i came up with a list one of them is to think without pressure
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 399.51 409.89 <o,f0,male> this is a project we 're working on right now with a very healthy deadline it 's a book on culture and as you can see culture is rapidly drifting around
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 410.66 423.68 <o,f0,male> doing things like i 'm doing right now traveling to cannes the example i have here is a chair that came out of the year in bali clearly influenced by local manufacturing and culture
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 423.75 440.22 <o,f0,male> not being stuck behind a single computer screen all day long and be here and there quite consciously design projects that need an incredible amount of various techniques just basically to fight straightforward adaptation
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 440.61 453.82 <o,f0,male> being close to the content that 's the content really is close to my heart this is a bus or vehicle for a charity for an ngo that wants to double the education budget in the united states
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 453.86 459.07 <o,f0,male> carefully designed so by two inches it still clears highway overpasses
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 473.22 483.52 <o,f0,male> working on projects that actually have visible impacts like a book for a deceased german artist whose
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 501.15 511.84 <o,f0,male> and lately to be involved in projects where i know about fifty percent of the project technique wise and the other fifty percent would be new so in this case
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 511.84 517.65 <o,f0,male> it 's an outside projection for singapore on these giant times square like screens
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 517.94 522.21 <o,f0,male> and i of course knew stuff as a designer about typography
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 522.24 530.24 <o,f0,male> even though we worked with those animals not so successfully but i didn 't quite know all that much about movement or film
StefanSagmeister_2010S 1 StefanSagmeister_2010S 541.94 544.11 <o,f0,male> keeping a diary since i was twelve
