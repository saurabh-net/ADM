JulianTreasure_2010GU 1 JulianTreasure_2010GU 39.25 49.93 <o,f0,male> your ears can't hear that chord they can actually hear amazing things your ears can hear ten octaves incidentally we see just one octave your ears are always on you have no earlids they work even when you sleep
JulianTreasure_2010GU 1 JulianTreasure_2010GU 50.32 59.01 <o,f0,male> the smallest sound you can perceive moves your eardrum just four atomic diameters the loudest sound you can hear is a trillion times more powerful than that
JulianTreasure_2010GU 1 JulianTreasure_2010GU 60.33 62.67 <o,f0,male> made not for hearing but for listening
JulianTreasure_2010GU 1 JulianTreasure_2010GU 63.53 78.09 <o,f0,male> listening is an active skill whereas hearing is passive listening is something that we have to work at it's a relationship with sound and yet it's a skill that none of us are taught for example have you ever considered that there are listening positions places you can listen from here are two of them
JulianTreasure_2010GU 1 JulianTreasure_2010GU 79.25 88.12 <o,f0,male> reductive listening is listening for it reduces everything down to what's relevant and it discards everything that's not relevant men typically listen reductively

JulianTreasure_2010GU 1 JulianTreasure_2010GU 111.93 117.00 <o,f0,male> you get nothing else out of this talk practice expansive listening and you can transform your relationships
JulianTreasure_2010GU 1 JulianTreasure_2010GU 118.00 122.84 <o,f0,male> the trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear is noise surrounding us all the time
JulianTreasure_2010GU 1 JulianTreasure_2010GU 123.58 126.01 <o,f0,male> noise like this according to the european union
JulianTreasure_2010GU 1 JulianTreasure_2010GU 126.53 132.08 <o,f0,male> is reducing the health and the quality of life of twenty five percent of the population of europe
JulianTreasure_2010GU 1 JulianTreasure_2010GU 132.82 140.09 <o,f0,male> two percent of the population of europe that's sixteen million people are having their sleep devastated by noise like that
JulianTreasure_2010GU 1 JulianTreasure_2010GU 140.83 144.32 <o,f0,male> noise kills two hundred thousand people a year in europe
JulianTreasure_2010GU 1 JulianTreasure_2010GU 144.86 154.11 <o,f0,male> it's a really big problem now when you were little if you had noise and you didn't want to hear it you'd stick your fingers in your ears and hum these days you can do a similar thing it just looks a bit cooler it looks a bit like
JulianTreasure_2010GU 1 JulianTreasure_2010GU 154.37 166.79 <o,f0,male> this the trouble with widespread headphone use is it brings three really big health issues the first really big health issue is a word that murray schafer coined schizophonia it's a dislocation
JulianTreasure_2010GU 1 JulianTreasure_2010GU 167.23 169.32 <o,f0,male> between what you see and what you hear
JulianTreasure_2010GU 1 JulianTreasure_2010GU 170.21 177.99 <o,f0,male> so we're inviting into our lives the voices of people who are not present with us i think there's something deeply unhealthy about living all the time in
JulianTreasure_2010GU 1 JulianTreasure_2010GU 178.96 189.95 <o,f0,male> the second problem that comes with headphone abuse is compression we squash music to fit it into our pocket and there is a cost attached to this listen to this this is an uncompressed piece of music
JulianTreasure_2010GU 1 JulianTreasure_2010GU 195.54 198.93 <o,f0,male> and now the same piece of music with ninety eight percent of the data removed
JulianTreasure_2010GU 1 JulianTreasure_2010GU 202.64 210.41 <o,f0,male> i do hope that some of you at least can hear the difference between those two there is a cost of compression it makes you tired and irritable to have to make up
JulianTreasure_2010GU 1 JulianTreasure_2010GU 210.63 217.74 <o,f0,male> all of that data you're having to imagine it it's not good for you in the long run the third problem with headphones is this deafness
