MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 0 2.55 <o,f0,male> a
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 16.79 27.23 <o,f0,male> few weeks ago i had a chance to go to saudi arabia and the first thing i wanted to do as a muslim was go to mecca and visit the kaaba the holiest shrine of islam
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 27.35 45.37 <o,f0,male> and i did that i put on my ritualistic dress i went to the holy mosque i did my prayers i observed all the rituals and meanwhile besides all the spirituality there was one mundane detail in the kaaba that was pretty interesting for me there was no separation of sexes
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 64.36 79.29 <o,f0,male> which is strictly divided between the sexes in other words as men you are not simply supposed to be in the same physical space with women and i noticed this in a very funny way i left the kaaba to eat something in downtown mecca
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 79.33 83.23 <o,f0,male> i headed to the nearest burger king restaurant and i went there
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 83.32 93.41 <o,f0,male> i noticed that there was a male section which was carefully separated from the female section and i had to pay order and eat at the male section it 's funny i said to myself
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 93.52 111.36 <o,f0,male> you can mingle with the opposite sex at the holy kaaba but not at the burger king quite ironic ironic and it 's also i think quite telling because the kaaba and the rituals around it are relics from the earliest phase of islam that of prophet muhammad
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 111.36 115.34 <o,f0,male> and if there was a big emphasis at the time to separate men from women
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 115.34 132.07 <o,f0,male> the rituals around the kaaba could have been designed accordingly but apparently that was not an issue at the time so the rituals came that way this is also i think confirmed by the fact that the seclusion of women in creating a divided society is something that you also do not find in the koran
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 132.07 138.23 <o,f0,male> the very core of islam the divine core of islam that all muslims and equally myself believe
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 138.23 144.27 <o,f0,male> and i think it 's not an accident that you don 't find this idea in the very origin of islam
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 144.39 164.06 <o,f0,male> because many scholars who study the history of islamic thought muslim scholars or westerners think that actually the practice of dividing men and women physically came as a later development in islam as muslims adopted some preexisting cultures and traditions of the middle east seclusion of women was actually
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 164.16 170.88 <o,f0,male> a byzantine and persian practice and muslims adopted that and made that a part of their religion
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 175.46 183.18 <o,f0,male> what we call today islamic law and especially islamic culture and there are many islamic cultures actually the one in saudi arabia is much different from
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 183.36 202.75 <o,f0,male> where i come from in istanbul or turkey but still if you 're going to speak about a muslim culture this has a core the divine message which began the religion but then many traditions perceptions many practices were added on top of it and these were traditions of the middle east medieval traditions
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 224.61 238.94 <o,f0,male> who look at islamic culture and see some troubling aspects should not readily conclude that this is what islam ordains maybe it 's a middle eastern culture that became confused with islam there is a practice called female circumcision
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 238.94 245.03 <o,f0,male> it 's something terrible horrible it is basically an operation to deprive women of sexual pleasure
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 245.82 253.25 <o,f0,male> and westerners europeans or americans who didn 't know about this before faced this practice
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 253.34 257.25 <o,f0,male> within some of the muslim communities who migrated from north africa
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 257.34 260.71 <o,f0,male> and they 've thought oh what a horrible religion that is which
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 261.37 268.82 <o,f0,male> ordains something like that but actually when you look at female circumcision you see that it has nothing to do with islam it 's just a north african practice
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 269.03 278.12 <o,f0,male> which predates islam it was there for thousands of years and quite tellingly some muslims do practice that the muslims in north africa not in other places
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 278.27 288.56 <o,f0,male> but also the non muslim communities of north africa the animists even some christians and even a jewish tribe in north africa is known to practice female circumcision
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 288.56 297.44 <o,f0,male> so what might look like a problem within islamic faith might turn out to be a tradition that muslims have subscribed
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 315.03 326.43 <o,f0,male> we had a tragic case of an honor killing within turkey 's armenian community just a few months ago now these are things about general culture but i 'm also very much interested in political culture
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 326.6 335.6 <o,f0,male> and whether liberty and democracy is appreciated or whether there 's an authoritarian political culture in which the state is supposed to impose things on the citizens
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 335.6 344.37 <o,f0,male> and it is no secret that many islamic movements in the middle east tend to be authoritarian and some of the so called islamic regimes
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 344.37 356.05 <o,f0,male> such as saudi arabia iran and the worst case was the taliban in afghanistan they are pretty authoritarian no doubt about that for example in saudi arabia there is a phenomenon called the religious police
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 356.07 373.08 <o,f0,male> and the religious police imposes the supposed islamic way of life on every citizen by force like women are forced to cover their heads wear the hijab the islamic head cover now that is pretty authoritarian and that 's something i 'm very much critical of but
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 373.61 392.49 <o,f0,male> when i realized that the non muslim or the non islamic minded actors in the same geography sometimes behaved similarly i realized that the problem maybe lies in the political culture of the whole region not just islam let me give you an example in turkey where i come from which is a very hyper secular republic
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 392.71 395.18 <o,f0,male> until very recently we used to have
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 395.26 402.39 <o,f0,male> what i call secularism police which would guard the universities against veiled students
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 420.97 431.57 <o,f0,male> some muslims have been influenced by that but the secular minded people can be influenced by that maybe it 's a problem of the political culture and we have to think about how to change that political culture
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 431.57 441.93 <o,f0,male> now these are some of the questions i had in mind a few years ago when i sat down to write a book i said well i will make a research about how islam actually came
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 441.93 448.82 <o,f0,male> to be what it is today and what roads were taken and what roads could have been taken
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 448.82 453.04 <o,f0,male> the name of the book is islam without extremes a muslim case for liberty
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 453.04 455.47 <o,f0,male> and as the subtitle suggests
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 455.47 466.46 <o,f0,male> i looked at islamic tradition and the history of islamic thought from the perspective of individual liberty and i tried to find what are the strengths with regard to individual liberty and there are strengths in islamic tradition
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 466.46 480.12 <o,f0,male> islam actually as a monotheistic religion which defined man as a responsible agent by itself created the idea of the individual in the middle east and saved it from the communitarianism the collectivism of the tribe
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 480.19 485.65 <o,f0,male> you can derive many ideas from that but besides that i also saw problems within islamic tradition
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 485.65 501.28 <o,f0,male> but one thing was curious most of those problems turn out to be problems that emerged later not from the very divine core of islam the koran but from again traditions and mentalities or the interpretations of the koran that muslims made in the middle ages
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 501.28 506.17 <o,f0,male> the koran for example doesn 't condone stoning there is no punishment on apostasy
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 506.17 509.8 <o,f0,male> there is no punishment on personal things like drinking
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 509.8 512.89 <o,f0,male> these things which make islamic law
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 513.2 523.46 <o,f0,male> the troubling aspects of islamic law were later developed into later interpretations of islam which means that muslims can today look at those things and say well
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 523.88 541.65 <o,f0,male> the core of our religion is here to stay with us it 's our faith and we will be loyal to it but we can change how it was interpreted because it was interpreted according to the time and milieu in the middle ages now we are living in a different world with different values and different political systems that interpretation is quite possible and feasible
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 541.65 547.07 <o,f0,male> now if i were the only person thinking that way we would be in trouble
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 547.77 564.84 <o,f0,male> but that 's not the case at all actually from the nineteenth century on there 's a whole revisionist reformist whatever you call it tradition a trend in islamic thinking and these were intellectuals or statesmen
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 564.89 579.45 <o,f0,male> of the nineteenth century and later twentieth century which looked at europe basically and saw that europe has many things to admire like science and technology but not just that also democracy parliament the idea of representation the idea of equal citizenship
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 579.45 599.34 <o,f0,male> these muslim thinkers and intellectuals and statesmen of the nineteenth century looked at europe saw these things they said why don 't we have these things and they looked back at islamic tradition they saw that there are problematic aspects but they 're not the core of the religion so maybe they can be re understood and the koran can be reread in the modern world
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 599.34 604.12 <o,f0,male> that trend is generally called islamic modernism
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 604.29 617.02 <o,f0,male> and it was advanced by intellectuals and statesmen not just as an intellectual idea though but also as a political program and that 's why actually in the nineteenth century the ottoman empire which then covered the whole middle east
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 617.02 627.26 <o,f0,male> made very important reforms reforms like giving christians and jews an equal citizenship status accepting a constitution accepting a representative parliament
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 627.26 630.32 <o,f0,male> advancing the idea of freedom of religion
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 630.32 640.66 <o,f0,male> and that 's why the ottoman empire in its last decades turned into a proto democracy a constitutional monarchy and freedom was a very important political value at the time
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 640.66 654.49 <o,f0,male> similarly in the arab world there was what the great arab historian albert hourani defines as the liberal age he has a book arabic thought in the liberal age and the liberal age he defines as nineteenth century and early twentieth century
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 654.49 662.6 <o,f0,male> quite notably this was the dominant trend in the early twentieth century among islamic thinkers and statesmen and theologians
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 663.29 676.69 <o,f0,male> but there is a very curious pattern in the rest of the twentieth century because we see a sharp decline in this islamic modernist line and in place of that what happens is that islamism grows
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 676.99 695.06 <o,f0,male> as an ideology which is authoritarian which is quite strident which is quite anti western and which wants to shape society based on a utopian vision so islamism is the problematic idea that really created a lot of problems in the twentieth century islamic world
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 695.36 701.11 <o,f0,male> and even the very extreme forms of islamism led to terrorism in the name of islam
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 701.58 718.93 <o,f0,male> which is actually a practice that i think is against islam but some obviously extremists did not think that way but there is a curious question if islamic modernism was so popular in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries why did islamism become so popular in the rest of the twentieth century
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 718.93 738.19 <o,f0,male> and this is a question i think which needs to be discussed carefully and in my book i went into that question as well and actually you don 't need to be a rocket scientist to understand that you just look at the political history of the twentieth century and you see things have changed a lot the context has changed in the nineteenth century when muslims were looking at europe as an example
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 738.49 746.64 <o,f0,male> they were independent they were more self confident in the early twentieth century with the fall of the ottoman empire the whole middle east was colonized
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 747.04 749.07 <o,f0,male> and when you have colonization what do you have
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 749.14 757.63 <o,f0,male> you have anti colonization so europe is not just an example now to emulate it 's an enemy to fight and to resist
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 757.63 771.68 <o,f0,male> so there 's a very sharp decline in liberal ideas in the muslim world and what you see is more of a defensive rigid reactionary strain which led to arab socialism arab nationalism and ultimately to the islamist ideology
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 771.9 785.32 <o,f0,male> and when the colonial period ended what you had in place of that was generally secular dictators which say they 're a country but did not bring democracy to the country and established their own dictatorship
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 785.32 796.55 <o,f0,male> and i think the west at least some powers in the west particularly the united states made the mistake of supporting those secular dictators thinking that they were more helpful for their interests
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 796.55 816.24 <o,f0,male> but the fact that those dictators suppressed democracy in their country and suppressed islamic groups in their country actually made the islamists much more strident so in the twentieth century you had this vicious cycle in the arab world where you have a dictatorship suppressing its own people including the islamic pious and they 're reacting in reactionary ways
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 833.59 841.16 <o,f0,male> they did not share the same anti colonial hype that you can find in some other countries in the region secondly and most importantly
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 841.16 858.64 <o,f0,male> turkey became a democracy earlier than any of the countries we are talking about in one thousand nine hundred and fifty turkey had the first free and fair elections which ended the more autocratic secular regime which was the beginning of turkey and the pious muslims in turkey saw that they can change the political system by voting
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 858.64 865.36 <o,f0,male> and they realize that democracy is something that is compatible with islam compatible with their values and they 've been supportive of democracy
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 865.36 878.7 <o,f0,male> that 's an experience that not every other muslim nation in the middle east had until very recently secondly in the past two decades thanks to globalization thanks to the market economy thanks to the rise of a middle class
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 878.7 892.86 <o,f0,male> we in turkey see what i define as a rebirth of islamic modernism now there 's the more urban middle class pious muslims who again look at their tradition and see that there are some problems in the tradition
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 893.01 906.69 <o,f0,male> and they understand that they need to be changed and questioned and reformed and they look at europe and they see an example again to follow they see an example at least to take some inspiration from that 's why the e u process turkey 's effort to join the e u
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 906.8 910.5 <o,f0,male> has been supported inside turkey by the islamic pious
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 910.54 929.67 <o,f0,male> while some secular nations were against that well that process has been a little bit blurred by the fact that not all europeans are that welcoming but that 's another discussion but the pro e u sentiment in turkey in the past decade has become almost an islamic cause and supported by the islamic liberals and the secular liberals as well
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 949.91 963.45 <o,f0,male> for some of the islamic movements or some of the countries in the arab world you must have all seen the arab spring which began in tunis and in egypt and arab masses just revolted against their dictators
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 963.45 980.49 <o,f0,male> they were asking for democracy they were asking for freedom and they did not turn out to be the islamist boogyman that the dictators were always using to justify their regime they said that we want freedom we want democracy we are muslim believers but we want to be
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 980.49 997.68 <o,f0,male> living as free people in free societies of course this is a long road democracy is not an overnight achievement it 's a process but this is a promising era in the muslim world and i believe that the islamic modernism which began in the nineteenth century but which had a setback
MustafaAkyol_2011X 1 MustafaAkyol_2011X 997.9 1002.91 <o,f0,male> in the twentieth century because of the political troubles of the muslim world is having a rebirth
