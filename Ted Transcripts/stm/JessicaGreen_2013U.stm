JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 29.15 39.56 <o,f0,female> as we design these things we could be thinking about designing these invisible worlds and also thinking about how they interact with our personal ecosystems
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 39.56 57.44 <o,f0,female> our bodies are home to trillions of microbes and these creatures define who we are the microbes in your gut can influence your weight and your moods the microbes on your skin can help boost your immune system the microbes in your mouth can freshen your breath or not
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 57.44 68.03 <o,f0,female> and the key thing is that our personal ecosystems interact with ecosystems on everything we touch so for example when you touch a pencil microbial exchange happens
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 68.03 78.66 <o,f0,female> if we can design the invisible ecosystems in our surroundings this opens a path to influencing our health in unprecedented ways
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 78.68 92.88 <o,f0,female> i get asked all of the time from people is it possible to really design microbial ecosystems and i believe the answer is yes i think we 're doing it right now but we 're doing it unconsciously
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 92.88 106.7 <o,f0,female> i 'm going to share data with you from one aspect of my research focused on architecture that demonstrates how through both conscious and unconscious design we 're impacting these invisible worlds
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 106.7 125.54 <o,f0,female> this is the lillis business complex at the university of oregon and i worked with a team of architects and biologists to sample over three hundred rooms in this building we wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building and to do this we sampled dust
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 125.54 133.65 <o,f0,female> from the dust we pulled out bacterial cells broke them open and compared their gene sequences this means
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 151.76 162.41 <o,f0,female> so i 'm going to show you now first what we found in the offices and we 're going to look at the data through a visualization tool that i 've been working on in partnership with autodesk
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 162.41 165.89 <o,f0,female> the way that you look at this data is first
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 165.89 185.22 <o,f0,female> look around the outside of the circle you 'll see broad bacterial groups and if you look at the shape of this pink lobe it tells you something about the relative abundance of each group so at twelve o 'clock you 'll see that offices have a lot of alphaproteobacteria and at one o 'clock you 'll see that bacilli are relatively rare
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 185.22 196.12 <o,f0,female> let 's take a look at what 's going on in different space types in this building if you look inside the restrooms they all have really similar ecosystems
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 196.12 208.52 <o,f0,female> and if you were to look inside the classrooms those also have similar ecosystems but if you look across these space types you can see that they 're fundamentally different from one another
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 208.52 222.16 <o,f0,female> i like to think of bathrooms like a tropical rainforest i told tim if you could just see the microbes it 's kind of like being in costa rica kind of and i also like to think of offices as being a temperate grassland
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 222.16 226.73 <o,f0,female> this perspective is a really powerful one for designers
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 226.73 245.69 <o,f0,female> because you can bring on principles of ecology and a really important principle of ecology is dispersal the way organisms move around we know that microbes are dispersed around by people and by air so the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 245.69 253.74 <o,f0,female> mechanical engineers design air handling units to make sure that people are comfortable that the air flow and temperature is just right
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 253.74 260.9 <o,f0,female> they do this using principles of physics and chemistry but they could also be using biology
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 260.9 278.74 <o,f0,female> if you look at the microbes in one of the air handling units in this building you 'll see that they 're all very similar to one another and if you compare this to the microbes in a different air handling unit you 'll see that they 're fundamentally different
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 278.74 291.92 <o,f0,female> the rooms in this building are like islands in an archipelago and what that means is that mechanical engineers are like eco engineers and they have the ability to structure biomes in this building the way that they want to
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 294.55 306.48 <o,f0,female> facet of how microbes get around is by people and designers often cluster rooms together to facilitate interactions among people or the sharing of ideas like in labs and in offices
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 306.48 316.62 <o,f0,female> given that microbes travel around with people you might expect to see rooms that are close together have really similar biomes and that is exactly what we found
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 316.62 330.78 <o,f0,female> if you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another they have very similar ecosystems but if you go to an office that is a farther walking distance away the ecosystem is fundamentally different
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 330.78 343.37 <o,f0,female> and when i see the power that dispersal has on these biogeographic patterns it makes me think that it 's possible to tackle really challenging
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 343.37 353.22 <o,f0,female> problems like hospital acquired infections i believe this has got to be in part a building ecology problem
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 356.31 361.45 <o,f0,female> i am collaborating with charlie brown he 's an architect
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 361.45 377.88 <o,f0,female> and charlie is deeply concerned about global climate change he 's dedicated his life to sustainable design when he met me and realized that it was possible for him to study in a quantitative way how his design choices impacted
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 377.88 390.19 <o,f0,female> the ecology and biology of this building he got really excited because it added a new dimension to what he did he went from thinking just about energy to also starting to think about human health
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 390.19 402.83 <o,f0,female> he helped design some of the air handling systems in this building and the way it was ventilated so what i 'm first going to show you is air that we sampled outside of the building
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 402.83 410.89 <o,f0,female> what you 're looking at is a signature of bacterial communities in the outdoor air and how they vary over time
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 410.89 428.43 <o,f0,female> next i 'm going to show you what happened when we experimentally manipulated classrooms we blocked them off at night so that they got no ventilation a lot of buildings are operated this way probably where you work and companies do this to save money on their energy bill
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 428.43 435.38 <o,f0,female> what we found is that these rooms remained relatively stagnant until saturday when we opened the vents up again
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 447.36 458.04 <o,f0,female> contrast this to rooms that were designed using a sustainable passive design strategy where air came in from the outside through louvers
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 458.04 475.73 <o,f0,female> in these rooms the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well and when charlie saw this he got really excited he felt like he had made a good choice with the design process because it was both energy efficient and it washed away the building 's resident microbial landscape
