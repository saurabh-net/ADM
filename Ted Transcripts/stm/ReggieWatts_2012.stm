ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 52.79 63.96 <o,f0,male> that 's one of the things that i enjoy most about this convention it 's not so much as so little as to do with
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 63.96 67.3 <o,f0,male> what everything is
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 175.3 178.19 <o,f0,male> it
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 321.56 324.92 <o,f0,male> is that this simulation is a good one
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 325.28 332.31 <o,f0,male> it 's believable it 's tactile you can reach out things are solid you can move objects from one area to another
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 332.99 339.42 <o,f0,male> you can feel your body you can say i 'd like to go over to this location and you can move this mass of molecules through the air
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 340.2 342.38 <o,f0,male> over to another location at will
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 350.14 358.47 <o,f0,male> now with the allocation and the understanding of the lack of understanding we enter into a new era of science in which we feel
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 358.67 367.02 <o,f0,male> nothing more than so much so as to say that those within themselves comporary or non comporary
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 385.01 387.77 <o,f0,male> feel not as though it is a sphere we live on
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 410.89 413.51 <o,f0,male> it 's more important to realize
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 413.78 425.16 <o,f0,male> the negative space as music is only the division of space it is the space we are listening to divided as such which gives us the information comparison to something other
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 545.39 547.09 <o,f0,male> the
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 556.75 562.25 <o,f0,male> thank you
