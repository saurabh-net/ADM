WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 15.13 27.32 <o,f0,male> something doesn't mean it's not there my work is it's a reflection of myself what i wanted to do is to
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 29.19 36.98 <o,f0,male> show the world that the little things can be the biggest things
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 38.56 48.34 <o,f0,male> we all seem to think that you know if we look down on the ground there's nothing there and we use the word nothing
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 49.41 55.62 <o,f0,male> nothing doesn't exist because there is always something my mother told me that when i was a child
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 55.99 63.26 <o,f0,male> that i should always respect the little things what made me do this work i shall go into my story
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 70.25 72.78 <o,f0,male> this all started when i was age five
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 73.89 81.61 <o,f0,male> what made me do it at school i will admit this academically i couldn't express myself so i was
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 81.89 89.60 <o,f0,male> more or less classed as nothing my world was seen as less
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 90.35 103.19 <o,f0,male> so i decided i didn't really want to be a part of that world i thought i need to retreat into something else so when my mother used to take me to school
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 104.08 116.18 <o,f0,male> she thought i was at school and i used to do a u turn when her back was turned and run off and hide in the shed at the back of the garden now the one time i was in the shed and
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 117.38 127.55 <o,f0,male> my mother suspected something thinking i was at school my mother was like the woman in tom and jerry so you'd just see
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 133.76 137.45 <o,f0,male> so i was hiding in the shed like that and
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 142.68 150.18 <o,f0,male> and then i saw her legs and then she said grabbed me like that because my mother was quite big and she lifted me
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 153.15 163.29 <o,f0,male> school i told her i couldn't face it because the way the teacher was treating me ridiculing me and using me as an example of
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 165.68 175.77 <o,f0,male> at that age obviously i couldn't express it that way but i told her i didn't feel right and then she said you 're going back to school tomorrow and walked off and i didn't expect
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 175.93 183.87 <o,f0,male> that because i expected one of these but i didn't get it so i'm sitting there thinking
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 184.74 195.93 <o,f0,male> and as i looked down on the ground i noticed there was some ants running around and i went into this little fantasy world and i thought
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 199.06 207.53 <o,f0,male> looking for the queen ant or do they need somewhere to live so i thought perhaps if i made these ants some apartments
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 216.98 229.97 <o,f0,male> so i did and how i set about that i got some splinters of wood and i sliced the little splinters of wood with a broken shard of glass constructed this little apartment well it
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 231.18 237.18 <o,f0,male> little shanty shed when i'd finished but i thought perhaps the ant won 't know it'll probably move in and so
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 238.18 248.91 <o,f0,male> a bit crude at the time and i made all these little apartments and little merry go rounds seesaws and swings little ladders and i encouraged the ants to come round by putting sugar and things like that
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 249.74 251.43 <o,f0,male> and then i sat down and all the ants
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 252.40 256.98 <o,f0,male> came along and all i could hear was
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 274.77 275.02 <o,f0,male> this
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 283.88 285.58 <o,f0,male> i realized that
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 289.10 295.28 <o,f0,male> to life than just everything that we see around us that's
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 357.77 358.10 <o,f0,male> i says
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 363.70 367.45 <o,f0,male> and then he said but i don't believe that you can do
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 386.82 392.42 <o,f0,male> of glass which as you can see that's the actual frame of
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 409.20 409.38 <o,f0,male> i
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 438.26 440.30 <o,f0,male> i don't inhale my
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 459.56 460.63 <o,f0,male> of glass and i had to
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 543.06 543.46 <o,f0,male> my
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 563.70 566.36 <o,f0,male> and when i finished it i
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 650.36 651.51 <o,f0,male> and
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 660.15 660.49 <o,f0,male> things
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 674.20 678.67 <o,f0,male> to carve homer simpson like that in that position and
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 681.08 687.70 <o,f0,male> to make sure that there is room for bart's neck so after i've done the same thing then i have to
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 704.35 711.16 <o,f0,male> paint brush but i would never do it to a living fly because i've heard a fly
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 721.22 721.80 <o,f0,male> i would never
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 727.45 728.76 <o,f0,female> because
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 732.38 732.54 <o,f0,male> and
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 774.81 774.95 <o,f0,male> to
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 787.77 789.51 <o,f0,male> six to seven weeks
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 836.59 838.67 <o,f0,male> the whole thing it's made the
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 844.78 845.26 <o,f0,male> of a
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 863.28 863.50 <o,f0,male> i
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 889.30 891.33 <o,f0,female> and i cut it bent it round and
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 898.90 903.29 <o,f0,male> and the spider 's web is for the reins on the
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 929.17 931.53 <o,f0,male> a machine that one took me
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 1024.05 1024.43 <o,f0,male> the
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 1058.23 1058.60 <o,f0,female> so
WillardWigan_2009G 1 WillardWigan_2009G 1074.03 1074.30 <o,f0,male> the
