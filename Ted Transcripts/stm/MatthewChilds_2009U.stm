MatthewChilds_2009U 1 MatthewChilds_2009U 39.79 50.58 <o,f0,male> number two hesitation is bad this is a friction climb up in tuolumne meadows in the yosemite high country friction climbing doesn't have any sort of hard positive edges
MatthewChilds_2009U 1 MatthewChilds_2009U 51.28 58.94 <o,f0,male> you're climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock the most friction you have is when you first put your hand or your
MatthewChilds_2009U 1 MatthewChilds_2009U 60.28 67.39 <o,f0,male> on the rock and then from that point on you're basically falling so momentum is good don't stop
MatthewChilds_2009U 1 MatthewChilds_2009U 68.28 79.43 <o,f0,male> rule number three have a plan this is a climb called the naked edge in el dorado canyon outside of boulder this climber is on the last pitch of it he 's actually right about where i fell
MatthewChilds_2009U 1 MatthewChilds_2009U 86.61 99.31 <o,f0,male> often what happens is you're planning so hard for like how do i get through the hardest part how do i get through the hardest part and then what happens you get to the last pitch it's easy and you're completely flamed out don't do it
MatthewChilds_2009U 1 MatthewChilds_2009U 99.56 107.89 <o,f0,male> you have to plan ahead to get to the top but you also can't forget that each individual move you have to be able to complete this is a
MatthewChilds_2009U 1 MatthewChilds_2009U 108.25 116.54 <o,f0,male> climb called the dike route on peyrat dome up in the yosemite high country the interesting thing about this climb is it's not that hard
MatthewChilds_2009U 1 MatthewChilds_2009U 116.87 124.09 <o,f0,male> but if you're the leader on it at the hardest move you're looking at about one hundred foot fall onto some low angle slabs
MatthewChilds_2009U 1 MatthewChilds_2009U 124.32 132.25 <o,f0,male> so you've got to focus you don't want to stop in the middle like coleridge 's kubla kahn you've got to keep going
MatthewChilds_2009U 1 MatthewChilds_2009U 133.28 142.82 <o,f0,male> rule number five know how to rest it's amazing the best climbers are the ones that in the most extreme situations can get their bodies into some position
MatthewChilds_2009U 1 MatthewChilds_2009U 143.12 149.01 <o,f0,male> where they can rest regroup calm themselves focus and keep going
MatthewChilds_2009U 1 MatthewChilds_2009U 151.56 158.24 <o,f0,male> climb in the needles again in california fear really sucks because what it means is you're not focusing on what you're doing
MatthewChilds_2009U 1 MatthewChilds_2009U 175.37 185.05 <o,f0,male> sort of take it straight on and they follow the most obvious solution this is the devils tower in wyoming which is a columnar basalt formation
MatthewChilds_2009U 1 MatthewChilds_2009U 185.41 194.00 <o,f0,male> that most of you probably know from close encouters with this typically crack climbers would put their hands in and their toes in and just start climbing
MatthewChilds_2009U 1 MatthewChilds_2009U 194.40 201.62 <o,f0,male> the cracks are too small to get your toes into so the only way to climb is using your fingertips in the cracks
MatthewChilds_2009U 1 MatthewChilds_2009U 202.32 216.47 <o,f0,male> and using opposing pressure and forcing yourself up rule number eight strength doesn't always equal success in the thirty five years i've been a climbing guide and taught on indoor walls and stuff like that the most important thing i've learned
MatthewChilds_2009U 1 MatthewChilds_2009U 216.68 228.43 <o,f0,male> was guys will always try to do pull ups beginning guys it's like they thrash they thrash they get fifteen feet up and they can do about fifteen pull ups right and then they just flame out women
MatthewChilds_2009U 1 MatthewChilds_2009U 228.80 234.81 <o,f0,male> are much more in balance because they don't have that idea that they're going to be able to do one hundred pull ups
MatthewChilds_2009U 1 MatthewChilds_2009U 235.04 244.19 <o,f0,male> they think about how to get the weight over their feet because it's sort of natural they carry you all day long so balance is really critical and keeping your weight on your feet

MatthewChilds_2009U 1 MatthewChilds_2009U 253.38 259.98 <o,f0,male> about forty feet and cracked a rib once you get to that point where you know it's going to happen you need to start thinking about
MatthewChilds_2009U 1 MatthewChilds_2009U 260.27 268.05 <o,f0,male> how you're going to let go because that is the critical piece of not getting hurt how you're going to
MatthewChilds_2009U 1 MatthewChilds_2009U 269.61 276.43 <o,f0,male> fall on to the rope or if you're climbing without a rope fall to a place where you can actually control the fall
