DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 16.07 18.61 <o,f0,male> i 'm going to show you are
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 18.82 21.46 <o,f0,male> the astonishing molecular machines that
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 21.67 24.86 <o,f0,male> create the living fabric of your body now
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 25.09 41.77 <o,f0,male> molecules are really really tiny and by tiny i mean really they 're smaller than a wavelength of light so we have no way to directly observe them but through science we do have a fairly good idea of what 's going on down at the molecular scale
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 41.77 60.67 <o,f0,male> so what we can do is actually tell you about the molecules but we don 't really have a direct way of showing you the molecules one way around this is to draw pictures and this idea is actually nothing new scientists have always created pictures as part of their thinking and discovery process they draw pictures of what they 're observing with their eyes
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 60.67 65.24 <o,f0,male> through technology like telescopes and microscopes and also what they 're thinking about in their minds
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 65.63 74.87 <o,f0,male> i picked two well known examples because they 're very well known for expressing science through art and i start with galileo who used the world 's first telescope
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 74.87 88.19 <o,f0,male> to look at the moon and he transformed our understanding of the moon the perception in the seventeenth century was the moon was a perfect heavenly sphere but what galileo saw was a rocky barren world which he expressed through his watercolor painting
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 88.48 98.79 <o,f0,male> another scientist with very big ideas the superstar of biology is charles darwin and with this famous entry in his notebook he begins in the top left hand corner with i think
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 98.87 101.64 <o,f0,male> and then sketches out the first tree of life
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 101.69 113.27 <o,f0,male> which is his perception of how all the species all living things on earth are connected through evolutionary history the origin of species through natural selection and divergence from an ancestral population
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 131 149.65 <o,f0,male> and his pictures everything 's accurate and it 's all to scale and his work illuminated for me what the molecular world inside us is like so this is a transection through blood in the top left hand corner you 've got this yellow green area the yellow green area is the fluids of blood which is mostly water but it 's also antibodies sugars
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 149.65 157.71 <o,f0,male> hormones that kind of thing and the red region is a slice into a red blood cell and those red molecules are hemoglobin they are actually red that 's what gives blood its color
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 157.71 173.78 <o,f0,male> and hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge to soak up the oxygen in your lungs and then carry it to other parts of the body i was very much inspired by this image many years ago and i wondered whether we could use computer graphics to represent the molecular world what would it look like and that 's how i really began
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 173.95 181.2 <o,f0,male> so let 's begin this is dna in its classic double helix form and it 's from x ray crystallography so it 's an accurate model of dna
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 181.2 194.2 <o,f0,male> if we unwind the double helix and unzip the two strands you see these things that look like teeth those are the letters of genetic code the twenty five thousand genes you 've got written in your dna this is what they typically talk about the genetic code this is what they 're talking about
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 194.2 207.84 <o,f0,male> but i want to talk about a different aspect of dna science and that is the physical nature of dna it 's these two strands that run in opposite directions for reasons i can 't go into right now but they physically run in opposite directions which creates
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 207.86 213.89 <o,f0,male> a number of complications for your living cells as you 're about to see most particularly when dna is being copied
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 214.24 227.66 <o,f0,male> and so what i 'm about to show you is an accurate representation of the actual dna replication machine that 's occurring right now inside your body at least two thousand and two biology so dna 's entering the production line from the left hand side
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 227.81 240.04 <o,f0,male> and it hits this collection these miniature biochemical machines that are pulling apart the dna strand and making an exact copy so dna comes in and hits this blue doughnut shaped structure and it 's ripped apart into its two strands
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 240.5 252.56 <o,f0,male> one strand can be copied directly and you can see these things spooling off to the bottom there but things aren 't so simple for the other strand because it must be copied backwards so it 's thrown out repeatedly in these loops and copied one section at a time
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 252.76 263.1 <o,f0,male> creating two new dna molecules now you have billions of this machine right now working away inside you copying your dna with exquisite fidelity
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 273.51 276.01 <o,f0,male> this was work from a number of years ago thank you
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 278.12 296.57 <o,f0,male> this is work from a number of years ago but what i 'll show you next is updated science it 's updated technology so again we begin with dna and it 's jiggling and wiggling there because of the surrounding soup of molecules which i 've stripped away so you can see something dna is about two nanometers across which is really quite tiny but in each one of your cells each strand of dna is about
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 296.57 299.09 <o,f0,male> thirty to forty million nanometers long
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 299.35 306.9 <o,f0,male> so to keep the dna organized and regulate access to the genetic code it 's wrapped around these purple proteins or i 've labeled them purple here
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 306.94 316.71 <o,f0,male> it 's packaged up and bundled up all this field of view is a single strand of dna this huge package of dna is called a chromosome and we 'll come back to chromosomes in a minute
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 317.23 319.48 <o,f0,male> we 're pulling out we 're zooming out
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 319.6 326.59 <o,f0,male> out through a nuclear pore which is the gateway to this compartment that holds all the dna called the nucleus
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 326.74 329.02 <o,f0,male> all of this field of view is
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 354.12 356.43 <o,f0,male> when the cell feels it 's ready to go
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 356.63 370.76 <o,f0,male> it rips apart the chromosome one set of dna goes to one side the other side gets the other set of dna identical copies of dna and then the cell splits down the middle and again you have billions of cells undergoing this process right now inside of you
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 371.41 374.2 <o,f0,male> now we 're going to rewind and just focus on the chromosomes
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 374.31 376.53 <o,f0,male> and look at its structure and describe it
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 377.02 392.39 <o,f0,male> so again here we are at that equator moment the chromosomes line up and if we isolate just one chromosome we 're going to pull it out and have a look at its structure so this is one of the biggest molecular structures that you have at least as far as we 've discovered so far inside of us
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 393.11 407.28 <o,f0,male> so this is a single chromosome and you have two strands of dna in each chromosome one is bundled up into one sausage the other strand is bundled up into the other sausage these things that look like whiskers that are sticking out from either side are the dynamic scaffolding of the cell
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 417.13 421.89 <o,f0,male> it is obviously central to the movement of the chromosomes we have no idea
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 421.89 431.04 <o,f0,male> really as to how it 's achieving that movement we 've been studying this thing they call the kinetochore for over a hundred years with intense study and we 're still just beginning to discover what it 's all about
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 431.13 436.59 <o,f0,male> it is made up of about two hundred different types of proteins thousands of proteins in total
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 436.8 449.61 <o,f0,male> it is a signal broadcasting system it broadcasts through chemical signals telling the rest of the cell when it 's ready when it feels that everything is aligned and ready to go for the separation of the chromosomes
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 449.61 458.17 <o,f0,male> it is able to couple onto the growing and shrinking microtubules it 's involved with the growing of the microtubules and it 's able to transiently couple onto them
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 459.16 472.38 <o,f0,male> it 's also an attention sensing system it 's able to feel when the cell is ready when the chromosome is correctly positioned it 's turning green here because it feels that everything is just right and you 'll see there 's this one little last bit that 's still remaining red
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 472.62 475.55 <o,f0,male> and it 's walked away down the microtubules
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 476.96 487.43 <o,f0,male> that is the signal broadcasting system sending out the stop signal and it 's walked away i mean it 's that mechanical it 's molecular clockwork this is how you work at the molecular scale
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 487.66 503.31 <o,f0,male> so with a little bit of molecular eye candy we 've got kinesins which are the orange ones they 're little molecular courier molecules walking one way and here are the dynein they 're carrying that broadcasting system and they 've got their long legs so they can step around obstacles and so on so again this is all
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 503.31 508.31 <o,f0,male> derived accurately from the science the problem is we can 't show it to you any other way
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 508.31 514.45 <o,f0,male> exploring at the frontier of science at the frontier of human understanding is mind blowing
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 515.43 520.76 <o,f0,male> discovering this stuff is certainly a pleasurable incentive to work in science
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 521.02 523.37 <o,f0,male> but most medical researchers
