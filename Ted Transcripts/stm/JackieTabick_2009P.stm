JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 17.11 27.76 <o,f0,female> one of my favorite cartoon characters is snoopy i love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of life
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 28.37 35.85 <o,f0,female> so when i thought about compassion my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips where he 's lying there
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 36.21 45.57 <o,f0,female> and he says i really understand and i really appreciate how one should love one 's neighbor as one love 's oneself
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 47.65 58.38 <o,f0,female> is the people next door i can't stand them this in a way is one of the challenges of how to
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 59.18 67.10 <o,f0,female> a really good idea we all i think believe in compassion if you look at all the world religions all the main world religions
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 68.46 79.24 <o,f0,female> within them some teaching concerning compassion so in judaism we have from our torah that you should love you neighbor as you love yourself
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 79.75 89.11 <o,f0,female> and within jewish teachings the rabbinic teachings we have hillel who taught that you shouldn 't do to others what you don't like being done to yourself
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 89.73 96.83 <o,f0,female> and all the main religions have similar teachings and again within judaism we have
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 97.53 106.54 <o,f0,female> teaching about god who is called the compassionate one ha rachaman after all how could the world exist without god being compassionate
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 107.28 115.60 <o,f0,female> and we as taught within the torah that we are made in the image of god so we too have to be compassionate
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 116.34 130.56 <o,f0,female> but what does it mean how does it impact on our everyday life sometimes of course being compassionate can produce feelings within us that are very difficult to control
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 131.20 142.64 <o,f0,female> i know there are many times when i've gone and conducted a funeral or when i have been sitting with the bereaved or with people who are dying
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 143.36 150.96 <o,f0,female> and i am overwhelmed by the sadness by the
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 152.05 160.51 <o,f0,female> difficulty the challenge that is there for the family for the person and i'm touched so that tears come to my eyes
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 161.51 168.02 <o,f0,female> and yet if i just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings i wouldn't be doing my job
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 169.07 179.11 <o,f0,female> because i have to actually be there for them and make sure that rituals happen that practicalities are seen to
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 179.85 191.04 <o,f0,female> and yet on the other hand if i didn't feel this compassion then i feel that it would be time for me to hang up my robe and give up being
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 192.67 205.20 <o,f0,female> and these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world who can not be touched by compassion when we see the terrible
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 207.04 208.47 <o,f0,female> war
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 213.55 222.06 <o,f0,female> some people who say well you know there's just so much out there i can't do anything i not going to even begin to try
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 223.73 229.75 <o,f0,female> and there are some charity workers who call this compassion fatigue there are
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 230.93 238.48 <o,f0,female> who feel they can't confront compassion anymore and so they turn off the television and don't
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 242.05 245.02 <o,f0,female> in judaism though we tend to always say
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 245.98 254.43 <o,f0,female> has to be a middle way you have to of course be aware of the needs of others
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 264.10 271.69 <o,f0,female> of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tick
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 272.33 285.96 <o,f0,female> and of course you can't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more and there's a lovely rabbinic interpretation of the beginnings of creation which says that when god created the world
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 286.88 296.45 <o,f0,female> god thought that it would be best to create the world only with the divine attribute of justice
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 310.68 311.25 <o,f0,female> thought
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 320.70 330.99 <o,f0,female> in fact if the world was just filled with compassion there would be anarchy and chaos there has to be limits to all things
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 331.20 340.55 <o,f0,female> the rabbis describe this as being like a king who has a beautiful fragile glass
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 353.69 358.63 <o,f0,female> and so god put both these possibilities into the world
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 361.93 363.75 <o,f0,female> there is something more though that has to be
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 378.11 385.92 <o,f0,female> like snoopy we can't just lie there and think great thoughts about our neighbors we actually have to do something about
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 386.97 393.46 <o,f0,female> and so there is also within judaism this notion of love and kindness that becomes very important
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 396.23 404.06 <o,f0,female> all these three things then have to be melded together the idea of justice
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 404.73 417.56 <o,f0,female> which gives boundaries to our lives and gives us a feeling of what's right about life what's right about living what should we be doing social justice
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 418.46 427.96 <o,f0,female> has to be a willingness to do good deeds but not of course at the expense of our own sanity
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 428.07 434.70 <o,f0,female> you know there's no way that you can do anything for anyone if you overdo things and balancing them all in the middle
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 435.48 443.43 <o,f0,female> is this notion of compassion which has to be there if you like at our very roots
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 444.55 451.96 <o,f0,female> this idea of compassion comes to us because we're made in the image of god
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 452.40 461.46 <o,f0,female> who is ultimately the compassionate one what does this compassion entail it entails understanding the pain of the
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 463.14 468.30 <o,f0,female> but even more than that it means understanding
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 468.47 473.14 <o,f0,female> one 's connection to the whole of creation
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 473.49 479.69 <o,f0,female> that understanding that one is part of that creation that there is a unity that underlies
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 479.91 484.39 <o,f0,female> all that we see all that we hear all that we feel
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 485.88 488.64 <o,f0,female> i call that unity god
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 488.78 498.49 <o,f0,female> and that that unity is something that connects all of creation and of course in the modern world with the environmental movement we're becoming even more aware
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 499.32 512.93 <o,f0,female> the connectivity of things that something i do here actually does matter in africa that if i use too much of my carbon allowance it seems to be that we are causing
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 513.16 519.81 <o,f0,female> a great lack of rain in central and eastern africa
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 519.90 534.36 <o,f0,female> so there is a connectivity and i have to understand that as part of part of the creation as part of me being made in the image of god and i have to understand
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 535.21 542.40 <o,f0,female> that my needs sometimes have to be sublimated to other needs this eighteen minutes business
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 542.91 552.46 <o,f0,female> i find quite fascinating because in judaism the word the number eighteen in hebrew letters stands for life the word life
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 553.06 558.23 <o,f0,female> so in a sense the eighteen minutes is challenging me to say
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 559.94 570.51 <o,f0,female> is what's important in terms of compassion but something else as well actually eighteen minutes is important because at passover when we have to eat
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 573.91 582.75 <o,f0,female> what is the difference between dough that is made into bread and dough that is made into unleavened bread matzah and they say it's eighteen minutes
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 614.77 619.63 <o,f0,female> should revolve round us so we try and get rid of those and
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 622.52 629.40 <o,f0,female> try to get rid of the habits the emotions the ideas that enslave us that make
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 641.78 649.61 <o,f0,female> is a basis for having compassion for understanding our place in the world
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 651.21 661.49 <o,f0,female> now there is in judaism a gorgeous story of a rich man who sat in synagogue one day
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 662.92 674.42 <o,f0,female> many people do he was dozing off during the sermon and as he was dozing off they were reading from the book of leviticus in the torah
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 683.09 688.33 <o,f0,female> which they used to place into a special table in the temple in jerusalem
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 690.37 696.33 <o,f0,female> the man was asleep but he heard the words bread temple god and
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 702.58 703.10 <o,f0,female> and he
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 704.34 708.63 <o,f0,female> and after the sabbath he made twelve loaves of bread
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 719.08 727.36 <o,f0,female> torah then he went home the cleaner came into the synagogue
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 728.78 734.48 <o,f0,female> such trouble i've got children to feed my wife 's ill i've got no money what can i do
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 747.36 747.74 <o,f0,female> my
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 774.01 781.03 <o,f0,female> next week with raisins this went on for years every week the man would bring bread
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 795.96 802.83 <o,f0,female> and saw what was going on and he called the two of them to his office and he said you know this is what's happening
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 804.02 804.88 <o,f0,female> and the rich man
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 827.56 836.28 <o,f0,female> of course what you are doing he said to the rich man is answering god 's plea that we should be compassionate
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 837.02 843.78 <o,f0,female> and god he said to the poor man is answering your plea that people should be compassionate and
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 845.59 857.65 <o,f0,female> he looked at the rich man he held the rich man 's hands and said don 't you understand he said these are the hands of god
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 862.46 865.97 <o,f0,female> so that is the way
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 875.92 883.03 <o,f0,female> understanding that there is a connectivity that there is a unity in this world that i want to try and
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 884.11 893.41 <o,f0,female> that unity and that i can try and do that by understanding i hope trying to understand something of the pain of
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 903.15 913.14 <o,f0,female> that i have to understand that there are limits to my energy to the giving i can give i have to reevaluate them try and
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 913.65 920.44 <o,f0,female> separate out the material things and my emotions that may be enslaving me
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 921.31 928.48 <o,f0,female> so that i can see the world clearly and then i have to try to see
JackieTabick_2009P 1 JackieTabick_2009P 928.96 939.30 <o,f0,female> in what ways i can make these the hands of god and so try to bring compassion to life
