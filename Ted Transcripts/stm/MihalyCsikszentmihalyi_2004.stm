MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 13.55 15.16 <o,f0,male> grew up in europe and
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 16.13 19.34 <o,f0,male> world war ii caught me when i was between seven and
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 20.15 22.01 <o,f0,male> ten years old and
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 23.85 27.63 <o,f0,male> i realized how few of the grown ups that i
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 30.13 32.50 <o,f0,male> able to withstand the
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 34.84 41.49 <o,f0,male> tragedies that the war visited on them how few of them could
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 42.81 48.70 <o,f0,male> even resemble a normal contented satisfied happy life
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 49.37 49.90 <o,f0,male> once
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 52.01 53.90 <o,f0,male> job their home their
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 66.60 73.96 <o,f0,male> and i tried as a child as a teenager to read philosophy and to get involved in art and
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 76.30 78.12 <o,f0,male> religion and many other
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 79.44 86.35 <o,f0,male> ways that i could see as a possible answer to that question and finally i ended up
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 90.03 91.40 <o,f0,male> psychology by
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 91.98 93.75 <o,f0,male> chance actually i was at a
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 94.93 100.61 <o,f0,male> ski resort in switzerland without any money to actually enjoy myself because the
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 102.46 112.84 <o,f0,male> snow had melted and there was i didn't have money to go to a movie but i found that on the i read in the newspapers that there was to be
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 120.17 121.57 <o,f0,male> in the center of zurich
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 122.28 123.86 <o,f0,male> and it was
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 124.88 131.34 <o,f0,male> about flying saucers he was going to talk and i thought well since i can't go to the movies at least i will go
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 132.18 135.13 <o,f0,male> for free to listen to flying saucers
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 135.89 139.38 <o,f0,male> and the man who talked at that
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 140.97 142.57 <o,f0,male> evening lecture
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 143.57 156.02 <o,f0,male> was very interesting and it actually instead of talking about little green men he talked about how the psyche of the europeans had been traumatized by the war and now they're projecting
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 156.93 159.16 <o,f0,male> flying saucers into the sky kind of
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 161.13 168.69 <o,f0,male> he talked about how the mandalas of ancient hindu religion were kind of projected into the sky
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 169.33 176.28 <o,f0,male> as an attempt to regain some sense of order after the chaos of war
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 177.10 189.92 <o,f0,male> and this seemed very interesting to me and i started reading his books after that lecture and that was carl jung whose name or work i had no idea about
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 190.68 197.85 <o,f0,male> then i came to this country to study psychology and i started trying to understand
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 198.68 208.49 <o,f0,male> these roots of happiness this is a typical result that many people have presented and there are many variations on it but
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 218.99 228.26 <o,f0,male> their life is very happy and that hasn't changed at all whereas the personal income on a scale that has been held constant
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 229.23 234.25 <o,f0,male> for inflation has more than doubled almost tripled in that period
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 235.02 246.91 <o,f0,male> but you find essentially the same results namely that after a certain basic point which corresponds more or less to just a few one thousand dollars above the minimum
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 247.34 254.90 <o,f0,male> poverty level increases in material well being don't seem to affect how happy people are
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 255.67 262.61 <o,f0,male> and in fact you can find that the lack of basic resources material resources
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 265.86 270.09 <o,f0,male> the increase in material resources do not increase
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 271.42 275.07 <o,f0,male> so my research has been focused more
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 276.67 281.15 <o,f0,male> after finding out these things that actually
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 291.68 295.82 <o,f0,male> do we feel really happy and to
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 296.79 303.22 <o,f0,male> start that those studies about forty years ago i began to look at creative
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 303.69 309.06 <o,f0,male> people first artists and scientists and so forth trying to understand
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 310.38 313.11 <o,f0,male> what made them feel that
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 314.11 314.70 <o,f0,male> it was
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 320.43 328.74 <o,f0,male> doing things for which many of them didn't expect either fame or fortune but which made their life meaningful and
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 329.99 340.37 <o,f0,male> doing this was one of the leading composers of american music back in the seventies and the interview was forty pages long but
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 340.74 349.48 <o,f0,male> this little excerpt is a very good summary of what he was saying during the interview and it describes how he feels
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 350.17 363.93 <o,f0,male> when composing is going well and he says by describing it as an ecstatic state now ecstasy in greek meant simply to stand to the side of something and then it became
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 365.34 374.39 <o,f0,male> essentially an analogy for a mental state where you feel that you are not doing your ordinary everyday routines
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 375.14 380.48 <o,f0,male> so ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative reality
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 381.29 384.19 <o,f0,male> and it's interesting if you think about it how
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 384.95 392.42 <o,f0,male> when we think about the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement whether it's
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 393.39 396.83 <o,f0,male> china greece hindu civilization or
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 400.48 411.73 <o,f0,male> what we know about them is really about their ecstasies not about their everyday life we know the temples they built so where people could come to experience a different reality
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 412.29 417.44 <o,f0,male> we know about the circuses the arenas the theaters
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 418.32 425.77 <o,f0,male> these are the remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went to
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 426.96 429.83 <o,f0,male> experience life in a more concentrated
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 431.62 436.77 <o,f0,male> ordered form now this man doesn't need to go
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 437.10 446.95 <o,f0,male> to a place like this which is also this place this arena which is built like a greek amphitheatre is a place for ecstasy also
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 447.13 458.80 <o,f0,male> we are participating in a reality which is different from that of everyday life that we're used to but this man doesn't need to go to there he needs just a piece of paper
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 460.13 472.11 <o,f0,male> he can put down little marks and as he does that he can imagine sounds that had not existed before in that particular combination
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 475.33 484.58 <o,f0,male> once he gets to that point of beginning to create like jennifer did in her improvisation a new reality that is
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 485.58 488.98 <o,f0,male> moment of ecstasy he enters that different reality
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 489.86 496.47 <o,f0,male> now he says also that this is so intense an experience that it feels almost as if he didn't exist
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 513.07 525.31 <o,f0,male> in order to hear me and understand what i'm saying you need to process about sixty bits per second that's why you can't hear more than two people you can't understand more than two people talking to you
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 526.23 531.08 <o,f0,male> well when you are really involved in this
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 533.61 539.17 <o,f0,male> completely engaging process of creating something new as this man does
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 540.02 541.67 <o,f0,male> he doesn't have enough
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 542.36 549.42 <o,f0,male> attention left over to monitor how his body feels or his problems at home
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 549.83 552.80 <o,f0,male> he can't feel even that he 's hungry or tired
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 554.14 562.30 <o,f0,male> his body disappears his identity disappears from his consciousness because he doesn't have enough
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 562.82 569.15 <o,f0,male> attention like none of us do to really do well something that requires a lot of
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 571.01 576.37 <o,f0,male> and at the same time to feel that he exists so existence is temporarily suspended
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 577.80 582.57 <o,f0,male> and he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 588.17 601.63 <o,f0,male> i could look at my hand for two weeks and i wouldn't feel any awe or wonder because i can't compose so what is that telling you here but in other parts of the interview is that obviously this
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 606.54 609.97 <o,f0,male> process that he 's describing can only happen to someone who is
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 610.76 617.20 <o,f0,male> well trained and who has developed technique and it has become a kind of
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 623.58 626.51 <o,f0,male> with less than ten years of
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 637.13 638.55 <o,f0,male> to be able to
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 641.45 649.33 <o,f0,male> begin to change something in a way that it's better than what was there before now when that happens
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 650.61 659.47 <o,f0,male> the music just flows out and because all of these people i started interviewing this was an interview which is over thirty years old
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 661.97 673.21 <o,f0,male> so many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow that i called this type of experience the flow experience and it happens in different
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 674.67 676.26 <o,f0,male> a poet describes it
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 676.91 685.45 <o,f0,male> in this form this is by a student of mine who interviewed some of the leading writers and poets in the united states and it describes
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 685.71 697.32 <o,f0,male> the same effortless spontaneous feeling that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state this poet describes it as opening a door that floats up in the sky
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 697.72 707.00 <o,f0,male> very similar description to what albert einstein gave as to how he imagined the forces of relativity when he was
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 713.14 717.67 <o,f0,male> but it happens in other activities for instance this is another student of mine
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 718.35 720.49 <o,f0,male> susan jackson from australia who
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 721.66 725.94 <o,f0,male> work with some of the leading athletes in the world and
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 726.28 734.90 <o,f0,male> you see here in this description of an olympic skater the same essential description of the phenomenology of the inner state of the person
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 735.01 741.12 <o,f0,male> you don't think it goes automatically if you merge yourself with the music and so forth
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 741.52 748.52 <o,f0,male> it happens also actually in the most recent book i wrote called good business where i interviewed some of the ceos
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 749.00 760.80 <o,f0,male> who had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful and very ethical very socially responsible you see that these people define success as
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 761.47 774.48 <o,f0,male> something that helps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it and like all of these successful and responsible ceos say
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 775.53 776.40 <o,f0,male> you can't
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 776.90 778.80 <o,f0,male> have just one of these things to
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 779.29 780.49 <o,f0,male> be successful
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 782.42 784.10 <o,f0,male> if you want a meaningful
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 784.60 789.53 <o,f0,male> job and successful job anita roddick is another one of these ceos
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 790.09 802.68 <o,f0,male> we interviewed she is the founder of body shop the cosmetic kind of natural cosmetic king it's kind of a passion that comes from doing the best and having flow while you're working
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 803.29 808.72 <o,f0,male> this is an interesting little quote from masaru ibuka who was at that time
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 821.49 825.22 <o,f0,male> where engineers can feel the joy of technological innovation
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 825.91 828.51 <o,f0,male> be aware of their mission to society
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 828.99 840.34 <o,f0,male> and work to their heart 's content i couldn't improve on this as a good example of how flow enters the workplace now when we do studies
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 841.71 854.39 <o,f0,male> we have with other colleagues around the world done over eight thousand interviews of people from dominican monks to blind nuns to himalayan climbers
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 855.73 865.31 <o,f0,male> navajo shepherds who enjoy their work and regardless of the culture regardless of education or whatever there are these seven
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 866.99 879.46 <o,f0,male> conditions that seem to be there when a person is in flow there's this focus that once it becomes intense leads to a sense of ecstasy a sense of clarity
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 879.91 888.86 <o,f0,male> you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other you get immediate feedback you know that what you need to do is possible to do even though difficult
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 889.71 900.29 <o,f0,male> and sense of time disappears you forget yourself you feel part of something larger and once those conditions are present what you are doing becomes
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 901.95 909.71 <o,f0,male> doing for its own sake in our studies we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 910.17 921.59 <o,f0,male> and we can measure this very precisely actually because we give people electronic pagers that go off ten times a day and whenever they go off you say what you're doing how you feel
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 923.01 928.88 <o,f0,male> where you are what you're thinking about and two things that we measure is the amount of challenge people
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 937.78 949.25 <o,f0,male> average which is the center of the diagram that would be your mean level of challenge and skill which will be different from that of anybody else but you have a kind of a set point there
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 949.89 951.11 <o,f0,male> which would be in the middle
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 952.09 959.99 <o,f0,male> if we know what that set point is we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow and it will be when your challenges
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 961.38 967.41 <o,f0,male> skills are higher than average and you may be doing things very differently from other people
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 968.06 976.62 <o,f0,male> but for everyone that flow channel that area there will be when you are doing what you really like to do play the piano
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 977.78 979.86 <o,f0,male> probably be with your best friend
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 981.02 993.22 <o,f0,male> perhaps work if work is what provides flow for you and then the other areas become less and less positive arousal is still good because you are over
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 994.37 1002.64 <o,f0,male> your skills are not quite as high as they should be but you can move into flow fairly easily by just developing a little more skill
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1003.29 1010.25 <o,f0,male> so arousal is the area where most people learn from because that's where they're pushed beyond
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1010.69 1017.95 <o,f0,male> their comfort zone and that to enter going back to flow then they develop higher skills
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1018.77 1022.23 <o,f0,male> control is also a good place to be because
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1022.97 1027.89 <o,f0,male> there you feel comfortable but not very excited it's not very challenging any more
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1028.67 1033.18 <o,f0,male> and if you want to enter flow from control you have to increase the
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1034.08 1040.76 <o,f0,male> so those two are ideal and complementary areas from which flow is easy to go into
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1041.94 1053.94 <o,f0,male> the other combinations of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal relaxation is fine you still feel ok boredom begins to be very
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1055.19 1066.55 <o,f0,male> and apathy becomes very negative you don't feel that you're doing anything you don't use your skills there's no challenge unfortunately a lot of
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1075.80 1082.27 <o,f0,male> to that experience is watching television the next one is being in the bathroom sitting
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1083.06 1083.56 <o,f0,male> and
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1086.46 1096.91 <o,f0,male> even though sometimes watching television about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow but that's when you choose a program you really want to watch and you get
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1097.70 1106.65 <o,f0,male> feedback from it so the question we are trying to address and i'm way over time is how to put more and more
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1107.60 1114.40 <o,f0,male> everyday life in that flow channel and that is the kind of challenge that we're trying to
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1115.33 1124.37 <o,f0,male> understand and some of you obviously know how to do that spontaneously without any advice but unfortunately a lot of people don 't and that's what
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1 MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004 1125.92 1127.81 <o,f0,male> mandate is in a way to do
