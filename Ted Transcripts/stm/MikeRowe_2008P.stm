MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 16.97 27.30 <o,f0,male> the dirty jobs crew and i were called to a little town in colorado called craig it's only a couple dozen square miles it's in the rockies and the job in question was sheep rancher
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 27.60 35.03 <o,f0,male> my role on the show for those of you who haven't seen it it's pretty simple i'm an apprentice and i work with the people who actually do the jobs in question
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 48.65 55.83 <o,f0,male> we check in to a hotel and i realize the next day that castration is going to be an absolute part of this work so
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 56.45 64.36 <o,f0,male> normally i never do any research at all but this is a touchy subject and i work for the discovery channel and we want to
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 65.76 70.82 <o,f0,male> whatever it is we do and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 71.43 80.01 <o,f0,male> the animals so i called the humane society and i say look i'm going to be castrating some lambs can you tell me the deal and they're like yeah it's pretty straightforward they use a
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 80.82 88.96 <o,f0,male> band basically a rubber band like this only a little smaller this one was actually around the playing cards i got yesterday
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 91.13 93.73 <o,f0,male> it had a certain familiarity to it and i said well
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 94.75 102.78 <o,f0,male> what exactly is the process and they said the band is applied to the tail tightly and then another band is applied to the scrotum tightly
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 103.53 116.55 <o,f0,male> blood flow is slowly retarded a week later the parts in question fall off great got it ok i call the spca to confirm this they confirm it i also call peta just for fun and they don't like it but they confirm it ok that's basically
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 116.89 125.39 <o,f0,male> how you do it so the next day i go out and i'm given a horse and we go get the lambs and we take them to a pen that we built and we go about the business of
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 135.79 152.76 <o,f0,male> lamb goes on the post she opens it up alright great albert goes in i follow albert the crew is around i always watch the process done the first time before i try it being an apprentice you know you do that albert reaches in his pocket to pull out you know this black rubber band but what comes out instead is a knife
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 154.49 157.29 <o,f0,male> and i'm like that's not rubber at all you know
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 166.13 174.99 <o,f0,male> it was impressive in the space of about two seconds albert had the knife between the cartilage of the tail right next to the
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 175.87 185.13 <o,f0,male> the lamb and very quickly the tail was gone and in the bucket that i was holding a second later with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger he had the scrotum firmly
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 185.35 193.36 <o,f0,male> in his grasp and he pulled it toward him like so and he took the knife and he put it on the tip now you had think you know what's coming michael you
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 195.44 202.27 <o,f0,male> he snips it throws the tip over his shoulder and then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward and then his head
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 203.72 212.13 <o,f0,male> my view but what i hear is a slurping sound and a noise that sounds like velcro being yanked off a sticky wall and i am not even kidding
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 213.73 215.40 <o,f0,male> can we roll the video no i'm kidding we
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 218.26 220.62 <o,f0,male> i thought it best to talk in pictures so
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 221.29 234.99 <o,f0,male> i do something now i've never ever done on a dirty jobs shoot ever i say time out stop you guys know the show we use take one we don't do take two there's no writing there's no scripting there's no nonsense we don't fool around we don't rehearse
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 235.68 239.49 <o,f0,male> we shoot what we get i said stop this is nuts i mean
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 239.53 242.06 <o,f0,female> you know this is
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 243.74 253.54 <o,f0,male> we can't do this and albert 's like what and i'm like i don't know what just happened but there are testicles in this bucket and that's not how we do it and he said well that's how we do it and i said
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 254.04 260.49 <o,f0,male> why would you do it this way and before i even let him explain i said i want to do it the right way with the rubber bands
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 273.11 284.70 <o,f0,male> he goes to his box and he pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands melanie picks up another lamb puts it on the post band goes on the tail band goes on the scrotum lamb goes on the ground lamb takes two steps falls
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 285.98 288.19 <o,f0,male> gets up shakes a little
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 299.21 305.98 <o,f0,male> obvious distress and i'm looking at the lamb and i say albert how long when does he get up he 's like a day
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 307.76 316.96 <o,f0,male> day how long does it take them to fall off a week meanwhile the lamb that he had just did his little procedure on
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 317.28 326.38 <o,f0,male> you know he 's just prancing around bleeding stopped he 's you know nibbling on some grass frolicking and i was just so blown away
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 326.71 335.24 <o,f0,male> how wrong i was in that second and i was reminded how utterly wrong i am so much of the time
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 336.14 351.11 <o,f0,male> and i was especially reminded of what an ridiculously short straw i had that day because now i had to do what albert had just done and there are like one hundred of these lambs in the pen and suddenly this whole thing 's starting to feel like a german porno and i'm like
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 368.70 374.88 <o,f0,male> i do the testicles emerge they look like thumbs coming right at you and he says bite em
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 375.06 377.04 <o,f0,male> just bite em off
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 377.95 378.93 <o,f0,male> and i heard him
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 385.23 389.64 <o,f0,male> how did how did i get here how did you know i mean how did i get here
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 390.54 403.10 <o,f0,male> it's just it's one of those moments where the brain goes off on it's own and suddenly i'm standing there in the rockies and all i can think of is the aristotelian definition of a tragedy
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 403.43 411.30 <o,f0,male> you know aristotle says a tragedy is that moment when the hero comes face to face with his own identity
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 412.52 419.91 <o,f0,male> and i'm like what is this jacked up metaphor i don't like what i'm thinking right now and i can't get this thought out of my head and i can't get that vision out of my
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 421.20 431.93 <o,f0,male> so i did what i had to do i went in and i took them i took them like this and i yanked my face back and i'm standing there with
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 465.23 473.61 <o,f0,male> our network does it's what dirty jobs is and i'm up to my neck in anagnorises every single day great the other word
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 475.15 485.25 <o,f0,male> that's the moment in the great tragedies you know euripides and sophocles the moment where oedipus
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 485.69 493.20 <o,f0,male> has his moment where he suddenly realizes that hot chick he 's been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother ok that's
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 493.76 500.70 <o,f0,male> or peripeteia and this metaphor in my head i got anagnorisis and peripetia on my chin
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 502.86 513.58 <o,f0,male> i got to tell you it's such a great device though when you start to look for peripetia you find it everywhere i mean bruce willis in the sixth sense right spends the whole movie
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 525.13 531.77 <o,f0,male> oh i'm living in a computer program that's weird these discoveries that lead to sudden realizations
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 532.27 543.65 <o,f0,male> and i've been having them over two hundred dirty jobs i have them all the time but that one that one drilled something home in a way that i just wasn't prepared for and as i stood there
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 544.24 551.07 <o,f0,male> looking at the happy lamb that i had just defiled but it looked ok
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 551.63 560.02 <o,f0,male> looking at that poor other little thing that i'd done it the right way on and i just was struck by if i'm wrong about
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 561.91 569.93 <o,f0,male> i'm wrong so often in a literal way what other peripatetic misconceptions might i be able to comment upon because look
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 570.46 583.30 <o,f0,male> i'm not a social anthropologist but i have a friend who is and i talk to him and he says hey mike look i don't know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not but do you realize you've shot in
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 584.44 594.44 <o,f0,male> you've worked in mining you've worked in fishing you've worked in steel you've worked in every major industry you've had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys that
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 606.72 615.90 <o,f0,male> and if you have something to say about their thoughts collectively it might be time to think about it because dude you know four years
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 617.47 625.83 <o,f0,male> that's in my head testicles are on my chin thoughts are bouncing around and after that shoot dirty jobs
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 626.27 638.14 <o,f0,male> really didn't change in terms of what the show is but it changed for me personally and now when i talk about the show i no longer just tell the story you heard and one hundred and ninety like it
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 639.39 645.68 <o,f0,male> i do but i also start to talk about some of the other things i got wrong some of the other notions of work
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 646.15 653.89 <o,f0,male> that i've just been assuming are sacrosanct and they're not people with dirty jobs are happier than you think
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 654.04 668.09 <o,f0,male> as a group they're the happiest people i know and i don't want to start whistling look for the union label and all that happy worker crap i'm just telling you that these are balanced people who do unthinkable work roadkill picker uppers whistle while they work i swear to god i did it
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 668.89 678.16 <o,f0,male> they've got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life and i see it over and over and over again so i started to wonder what would happen
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 678.50 686.34 <o,f0,male> if we challenged some of these sacred cows follow your passion we've been talking about it here for the last thirty six hours
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 699.23 714.47 <o,f0,male> passion it's going to work out i can give you thirty examples right now bob combs the pig farmer in las vegas who collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos and feeds them them to his swine why because there's so much protein in the stuff we don't eat his pigs grow at twice the normal speed
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 714.68 729.22 <o,f0,male> and he is one rich pig farmer and he is good for the environment and he spends his days doing this incredible service and he smells like hell but god bless him he 's making a great living you ask him did you follow your passion here and he'd laugh at you the guy 's worth
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 729.58 737.90 <o,f0,male> he just got offered like sixty million dollars for his farm and turned it down outside of vegas he didn't follow his passion he stepped back and he watched where everybody was
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 738.92 751.01 <o,f0,male> and he went the other way and i hear that story over and over matt froind a dairy farmer in new canaan connecticut who woke up one day and realized the crap from his cows was worth more than their milk
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 751.26 759.66 <o,f0,male> if he could use it to make these biodegradable flower pots now he 's selling them to walmart follow his passion the
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 760.66 770.69 <o,f0,male> come on so i started to look at passion i started to look at efficiency versus effectiveness as tim talked about earlier that's a huge distinction
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 771.05 785.08 <o,f0,male> i started to look at teamwork and determination and basically all those platitudes they call successories that hang with that schmaltzy art in boardrooms around the world right now that stuff it's suddenly all been turned on its head
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 785.72 792.32 <o,f0,male> safety safety first is me going back to you know osha and peta and the humane society
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 792.96 800.28 <o,f0,male> what if osha got it wrong i mean this is heresy what i'm about to say but what if it's really safety third
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 803.21 817.39 <o,f0,male> i mean really what i mean to say is i value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that i'm working with but the ones who really get it done they're not out there talking about safety first
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 817.93 824.50 <o,f0,male> they know that other things come first the business of doing the work comes first the business of getting it done and
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 825.21 833.97 <o,f0,male> never forget up in the bering sea i was on a crab boat with the deadliest catch guys which i also work on in the first season we're about one hundred miles off the coast of russia
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 834.50 843.69 <o,f0,male> fifty foot seas big waves green water coming over the wheelhouse right most hazardous environment i'd ever seen and i was back with a guy lashing the pots down
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 843.96 850.03 <o,f0,male> so i'm forty feet off the deck which is like looking down at the top of your shoe you know and it's doing this in the ocean
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 866.41 876.31 <o,f0,male> but in that moment what he said next can't be repeated in the lower forty eight it can't be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site but he looked at me and he said son
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 876.59 887.00 <o,f0,male> he 's my age by the way he calls me son i love that he says son i'm a captain of a crab boat my responsibility is not to get you home alive my responsibility is to get you home rich
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 909.84 923.83 <o,f0,male> at length about the many little distinctions we made and the endless list of ways that i got it wrong but what it all comes down to is this i formed a theory and i'm going to share it now in my remaining two minutes and thirty seconds it goes like this
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 924.88 934.31 <o,f0,male> we've declared war on work as a society all of us it's a civil war it's a cold war really we didn't
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 935.22 942.36 <o,f0,male> set out to do it and we didn't twist our mustache in some machiavellian way but we've done it and we've waged this war
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 942.98 956.49 <o,f0,male> on at least four fronts certainly in hollywood the way we portray working people on tv it's laughable if there's a plumber he 's three hundred pounds and he 's got a giant buttcrack admit it you see him all the time that's what plumbers look like
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 957.65 967.17 <o,f0,male> we turn them into heroes or we turn them into punchlines that's what tv does we try hard on dirty jobs not to do that which is why i do the work and i don't cheat but
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 968.40 976.88 <o,f0,male> we've waged this war on madison avenue i mean so many of the commercials that come out there in the way of a message what's really being said
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 977.04 987.38 <o,f0,male> your life would be better if you could work a little less if you didn't have to work so hard if you could get home a little earlier if you could retire a little faster if you could punch out a little sooner it's all in there over and over again and again
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 988.27 1000.96 <o,f0,male> washington i can't even begin to talk about the deals and policies in place that affect the bottom line reality of the available jobs because i don't really know i just know that that's a front in this war and right here guys silicon valley
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 1001.50 1015.14 <o,f0,male> i mean how many people have an iphone on them right now how many people have their blackberries we're plugged in we're connected i would never suggest for a second that something bad has come out of the tech revolution good grief not to this crowd
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 1017.34 1028.13 <o,f0,male> but i would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time and nobody celebrates imitation the way dirty jobs guys
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 1028.89 1041.07 <o,f0,male> it has to be done your iphone without those people making the same interface the same circuitry the same board over and over all that that's what makes it equally as possible as the genius that goes
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 1041.88 1054.12 <o,f0,male> inside of it so we've got this new toolbox you know our tools today don't look like shovels and picks they look like the stuff we walk around with and so the collective
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 1056.03 1057.59 <o,f0,male> effect of all of that
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 1057.73 1070.63 <o,f0,male> has been this marginalization of lots and lots of jobs and i realized probably too late in this game i hope not because i don't know if i can do two hundred more of these things but we're going to do as many as we can
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 1071.06 1080.10 <o,f0,male> and to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with is that fact that i got it wrong about a lot of things not just the testicles on my chin
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 1080.41 1088.36 <o,f0,male> i got a lot wrong so we're thinking by we i mean me that
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 1089.90 1096.88 <o,f0,male> the thing to do is to talk about a pr campaign for work manual labor skilled labor
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 1106.14 1111.04 <o,f0,male> kind of you know kind of lost a little
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 1153.22 1153.60 <o,f0,male> so
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 1155.06 1165.51 <o,f0,male> if i were running for anything and i'm not i would simply say that the jobs we hope to make and the jobs we hope to create aren't going to stick unless they're jobs that people want
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 1166.09 1179.89 <o,f0,male> and i know the point of this conference is to celebrate things that are near and dear to us but i also know that clean and dirty aren't opposites they're two sides of the same coin just like innovation and imitation like risk and responsibility
MikeRowe_2008P 1 MikeRowe_2008P 1180.42 1191.21 <o,f0,male> like peripetia and anagnorisis like that poor little lamb who i hope isn't quivering anymore and like my time that's gone it's been great talking to you and get back
