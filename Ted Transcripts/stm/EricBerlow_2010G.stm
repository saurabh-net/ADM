EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 17.70 27.42 <o,f0,male> overwhelmed when you're faced with a complex problem well i hope to change that in less than three minutes so i hope to convince you that complex doesn't always equal complicated
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 28.05 36.54 <o,f0,male> so for me a well crafted baguette fresh out of the oven is complex but a curry onion green olive poppy cheese bread is complicated
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 37.47 49.80 <o,f0,male> i'm an ecologist and i study complexity i love complexity and i study that in the natural world the interconnectedness of species so here 's a food web or a map of feeding links between species that live in alpine lakes in the mountains of california
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 50.36 61.95 <o,f0,male> and this is what happens to that food web when it's stocked with non native fish that never lived there before all the grayed out species disappear some are actually on the brink of extinction and lakes with fish have more mosquitoes even though they eat them
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 73.46 82.31 <o,f0,male> first is the simple power of good visualization tools to help untangle complexity and just encourage you to ask questions you didn't think of before for example you could plot the
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 82.97 91.69 <o,f0,male> flow of carbon through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem or the interconnections of habitat patches for endangered species in yosemite national park
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 101.88 113.73 <o,f0,male> if you step back consider the entire system all the species all the links and from that place hone in on the sphere of influence that matters most and we're discovering with our research that's often very local to the node you care about within one or two degrees
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 114.42 127.71 <o,f0,male> so the more you step back embrace complexity the better chance you have of finding simple answers and it's often different than the simple answer that you started with so let 's switch gears and look at a really complex problem courtesy of the u s government
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 128.60 142.42 <o,f0,male> this is diagram of the u s counterinsurgency strategy in afghanistan it was front page of the new york times a couple months ago instantly ridiculed by the media for being so crazy complicated and the stated goal was to increase popular support for the afghan government
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 142.90 151.93 <o,f0,male> clearly a complex problem but is it complicated well when i saw this in the front page of the times i thought great finally something i can relate to i can sink my teeth into this
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 152.82 161.99 <o,f0,male> so let 's do it so here we go for the first time ever a world premiere view of this spaghetti diagram as an ordered network the circled node is the one we're trying to influence popular support for the government
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 171.21 180.99 <o,f0,male> most of those nodes are not actionable like the harshness of the terrain and a very small minority are military actions most are non violent and they fall into two broad categories
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 181.76 188.37 <o,f0,male> active engagement with ethnic rivalries and religious beliefs and fair transparent economic development and provisioning of services
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 188.90 198.01 <o,f0,male> i don't know about this but this is what i can decipher from this diagram in twenty four seconds when you see a diagram like this i don't want you to be afraid i want you to be excited i want you to be relieved
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 198.63 212.38 <o,f0,male> because simple answers may emerge we're discovering in nature that simplicity often lies on the other side of complexity so for any problem the more you can zoom out and embrace complexity the better chance you have of zooming in on the simple details that matter most thank you
