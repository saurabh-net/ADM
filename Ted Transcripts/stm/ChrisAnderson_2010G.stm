ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 29.89 36.75 <o,f0,male> and i'm also a little nervous about this there are nine billion humans coming our way
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 37.05 46.06 <o,f0,male> the most optimistic dreams can get dented by the prospect of people plundering the planet but recently
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 46.28 53.92 <o,f0,male> i've become intrigued by a different way of thinking of large human crowds because there are circumstances where they can do something really cool
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 54.32 65.58 <o,f0,male> it's a phenomenon that i think any organization or individual can tap into it certainly impacted the way we think about ted 's future and perhaps the world 's future overall
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 66.17 73.89 <o,f0,male> so let 's explore the story starts with just a single person a child behaving a little strangely this
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 81.94 87.50 <o,f0,male> how did he learn them and what drove him to spend the hundreds of hours of practice this must
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 97.10 99.21 <o,f0,male> so that was sent to me by this
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 110.56 117.60 <o,f0,male> in essence dancers were challenging each other online to get better incredible new dance skills were being invented
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 117.94 127.96 <o,f0,male> even the six year olds were joining in it felt like a revolution and so jon had a brilliant idea he went out to recruit the best of the best dancers off of youtube to
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 130.34 134.18 <o,f0,male> this dance troupe the league of extraordinary dancers the lxd
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 134.81 135.45 <o,f0,male> these kids were
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 136.71 139.18 <o,f0,male> they were so good that they got to play at the
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 140.56 144.49 <o,f0,male> and at ted here in february their passion and brilliance just took our breath away
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 147.67 150.02 <o,f0,male> this story of the evolution of
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 151.04 163.62 <o,f0,male> seems strangely familiar you know a while after tedtalks started taking off we noticed that speakers were starting to spend a lot more time in preparation it was resulting in incredible new talks like these two
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 164.35 172.38 <o,f0,male> months of preparation crammed into eighteen minutes raising the bar cruelly for the next generation of speakers with the effects that we've seen this week
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 172.90 182.91 <o,f0,male> it's not as if j j and jill actually ended their talks saying step your game up but they might as well have so in both of these cases you've got
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 183.46 193.52 <o,f0,male> these cycles of improvement apparently driven by people watching web video what is going on here well i think it's the latest iteration of a phenomenon we can call
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 194.20 206.88 <o,f0,male> crowd accelerated innovation and there are just three things you need for this thing to kick into gear you can think of them as three dials on a giant wheel you turn up the dials the wheel starts to
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 207.89 217.21 <o,f0,male> and the firs thing you need is a crowd a group of people who share a common interest the bigger the crowd the more potential innovators there are
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 226.41 238.29 <o,f0,male> the second thing you need is light you need clear open visibility of what the best people in that crowd are capable of because that is how you will learn how you will be empowered to participate and
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 241.98 248.49 <o,f0,male> hard work it's based on hundreds of hours of research of practice absent desire not going to happen now
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 248.99 256.35 <o,f0,male> here 's an example pre internet of this machine in action dancers at a street corner it's a crowd a small one
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 256.73 269.06 <o,f0,male> but they can all obviously see what each other can do and the desire part comes i guess from social status right best dancer walks tall gets the best date there's probably going to be some innovation happening here
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 269.54 276.92 <o,f0,male> but on the web all three dials are ratcheted right up the dance community is now global there's millions connected
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 277.42 284.52 <o,f0,male> and amazingly you can still see what the best can do because the crowd itself shines a light on them
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 286.21 294.36 <o,f0,male> directly through comments ratings email facebook twitter or indirectly through numbers of views
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 305.54 316.71 <o,f0,male> the desire element is really dialed way up i mean you might just be a kid with a webcam but if you can do something that goes viral
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 317.52 330.86 <o,f0,male> you get to be seen by the equivalent of sports stadiums crammed with people you get hundreds of strangers writing excitedly about you and even if it's not that eloquent and it's not it can still really make your day
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 331.95 340.23 <o,f0,male> so this possibility of a new type of global recognition i think is driving huge amounts of
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 341.49 351.58 <o,f0,male> and it's important to note that it's not just the stars who are benefiting because you can see the best everyone can learn also the system is self fueling it's the crowd
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 351.86 361.14 <o,f0,male> that shines the light and fuels the desire but the light and desire are a lethal one two combination that attract new people to the crowd so this is a model
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 362.05 372.05 <o,f0,male> any organization could use to try and nurture its own cycle of crowd accelerated innovation invite the crowd let in the light dial up the
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 383.36 395.43 <o,f0,male> it's by giving away what you think is your deepest secret that maybe millions of people are empowered to help improve it and very happily there's one class of people who really can't make use of this tool
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 395.87 405.87 <o,f0,male> the dark side of the web is allergic to the light i don't think we're going to see terrorists for example publishing their plans online and saying to the world please could you help us to actually make them work this time
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 407.33 415.02 <o,f0,male> you can publish your stuff online and if you can get that wheel to turn look out so
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 415.15 422.66 <o,f0,male> at ted we've become a little obsessed with this idea of openness in fact my colleague june cohen has taken to calling it radical openness
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 423.07 431.44 <o,f0,male> because it works for us each time we opened up our talks to the world and suddenly there are millions of people out there helping spread our speakers ideas
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 431.79 443.12 <o,f0,male> and thereby making it easier for us to recruit and motivate the next generation of speakers by opening up our translation program thousands of heroic volunteers some of them watching online right now and thank you
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 444.01 453.28 <o,f0,male> have translated our talks into more than seventy languages thereby tripling our viewership in non english speaking countries by giving away our tedx brand
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 453.76 463.83 <o,f0,male> we suddenly have a thousand plus live experiments in the art of spreading ideas and these organizers they're seeing each other they're learning from each other
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 473.14 478.83 <o,f0,male> it's really not news for me to tell you that innovation emerges out of groups you know we've heard that
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 479.11 487.63 <o,f0,male> this week this romantic notion of the lone genius with the eureka moment that changes the world is misleading even he said that and he would
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 489.85 498.82 <o,f0,male> a social species we spark off each other it's also not news to say that the internet has accelerated innovation
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 499.13 512.28 <o,f0,male> for the past fifteen years powerful communities have been connecting online sparking off each other if you take programmers you know the whole open source movement is a fantastic instance of crowd accelerated innovation
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 513.38 525.88 <o,f0,male> what's key here is the reason these groups have been able to connect is because their work output is of the type that can be easily shared digitally a picture a music file software
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 528.30 535.58 <o,f0,male> and that's why what i'm excited about and what i think is under reported is the significance of the rise of
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 536.26 549.60 <o,f0,male> online video this is the technology that's going to allow the rest of the world 's talents to be shared digitally thereby launching a whole new cycle of crowd accelerated innovation the first
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 549.95 557.20 <o,f0,male> few years of the web were pretty much video free for this reason video files are huge the web couldn't handle them but in the last ten years
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 565.66 575.88 <o,f0,male> cisco actually estimates that within four years more than ninety percent of the web 's data will be video if it's all puppies porn and piracy we're doomed
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 576.82 583.87 <o,f0,male> i don't think it will be video is high bandwidth for a reason it packs a huge amount of data
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 584.13 589.99 <o,f0,male> and our brains are uniquely wired to decode it here let me introduce you to sam haber
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 602.36 614.81 <o,f0,male> looking at video clips posted by strangers a world of possibility opens up for him suddenly he starts to emulate and then to innovate and a global community of unicyclists discover each other online inspire each other to greatness
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 615.24 623.42 <o,f0,male> and there are thousands of other examples of this happening of video driven evolution of skills ranging from the physical to the
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 624.04 631.71 <o,f0,male> and i have to tell you as a former publisher of hobbyist magazines i find this strangely beautiful i mean there's a lot of passion right here on this screen
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 633.21 640.70 <o,f0,male> but if rube goldberg machines and video poetry aren't quite your cup of tea how about this
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 642.09 648.85 <o,f0,male> jove is a website that was founded to encourage scientists to publish their peer reviewed research on video
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 670.84 682.78 <o,f0,male> if you can show instead of just describing that problem goes away so it's not far fetched to say that at some point online video is going to dramatically accelerate scientific advance
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 683.78 695.83 <o,f0,male> here 's another example that's close to our hearts at ted where video is sometimes more powerful than print the sharing of an idea why do people like watching
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 697.20 703.68 <o,f0,male> all those ideas are already out there in print it's actually faster to read than to view why would someone bother
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 704.68 716.09 <o,f0,male> well so there's some showing as well as telling but even leaving the screen out of it there's still a lot more being transferred than just words and in that non verbal portion there's some serious magic
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 716.84 724.24 <o,f0,male> somewhere hidden in the physical gestures the vocal cadence the facial expressions the eye contact
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 725.26 739.19 <o,f0,male> the passion the kind of awkward british body language the sense of how the audience are reacting there are hundreds of subconscious clues that go to how well you will understand and whether you're inspired
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 740.06 748.05 <o,f0,male> light if you like and desire incredibly all of this can be communicated on just a few square inches of a screen
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 765.63 775.75 <o,f0,male> this is the connective tissue of the human superorganism in action it's probably driven our culture for millennia five hundred years ago it ran into a competitor with a lethal advantage
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 790.08 798.85 <o,f0,male> but now in the blink of an eye the game has changed again it's not too much to say that what gutenberg did for writing
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 808.32 821.70 <o,f0,male> that just went global now this is big we may have to reinvent an ancient art form i mean today one person speaking can be seen by millions
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 822.64 831.17 <o,f0,male> shedding bright light on potent ideas creating intense desire for learning and to respond and in his case intense desire to
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 832.54 846.54 <o,f0,male> for the first time in human history talented students don't have to have their potential and their dreams written out of history by lousy teachers they can sit two feet in front of the world 's finest
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 847.34 858.58 <o,f0,male> now ted is just a small part of this i mean the world 's universities are opening up their curricula thousands of individuals and organizations are sharing their knowledge and data online
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 881.21 890.68 <o,f0,male> so we're dreaming of ways to make it easier for you the global ted community to respond to speakers to contribute your own ideas maybe even your own
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 892.30 900.18 <o,f0,male> and to help shine a light on the very best of what's out there because if we can bubble up the very best from a vastly larger pool this wheel
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 900.66 908.72 <o,f0,male> turns now is it possible to imagine a similar process to this happening to global education overall
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 909.62 920.86 <o,f0,male> have to be this painful top down process why not a self fueling cycle in which we all can participate it's the participation age right
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 921.78 933.24 <o,f0,male> schools can't be silos we can't stop learning at age twenty one what if in the coming crowd of nine billion what if that crowd
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 933.91 946.82 <o,f0,male> could learn enough to be net contributors instead of net plunderers that changes everything right i mean that would take more teachers than we've ever had but the good news is they are out there
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 960.88 961.07 <o,f0,male> teacher
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 963.55 965.33 <o,f0,male> teacher
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 967.34 979.23 <o,f0,male> part of the crowd that may be about to launch the biggest learning cycle in human history a cycle capable of carrying all of us to a smarter wiser more beautiful place
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 983.18 991.33 <o,f0,male> of kids in a village in pakistan near where i grew up within five years each of these kids is going to have access to a cellphone capable of full on web video
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 994.51 1006.55 <o,f0,male> it crazy to think that this girl in the back at the right in fifteen years might be sharing the idea that keeps the world beautiful for your grandchildren it's not crazy it's actually happening right now
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 1008.33 1012.40 <o,f0,male> a good friend of ted who just happens to live in africa 's biggest shantytown
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 1025.96 1033.11 <o,f0,male> into a garden the same spot it was a crime spot where people were being robbed they used the same trash to form
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 1035.92 1042.18 <o,f0,male> the same trash site is feeding more than thirty families we have our own film school
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 1045.46 1049.95 <o,f0,male> to record edit and reporting to their own channel kibera tv
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 1052.73 1059.58 <o,f0,male> the sacks to grow vegetables and also able to save on the cost of living change happens when we see things
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 1061.40 1072.63 <o,f0,male> today i see kibera in a different way my message to tedglobal and the entire world is kibera is a hotbed of innovation and
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 1083.81 1092.37 <o,f0,male> chris has always been an inspiring guy what's new and it's huge is that for the first time we get to see him
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 1092.89 1099.81 <o,f0,male> and he can see us right now chris and kevin and dennis and dickson and their friends are watching us
ChrisAnderson_2010G 1 ChrisAnderson_2010G 1099.96 1107.66 <o,f0,male> in nairobi right now guys we've learned from you today thank you and thank you
