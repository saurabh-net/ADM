MallikaSarabhai_2009I 1 MallikaSarabhai_2009I 529.45 542.22 <o,f0,female> i think it's safe to say that all of us here are deeply concerned about the escalating violence in our daily lives while universities are trying to devise courses in conflict resolution and governments are trying to stop skirmishes at
MallikaSarabhai_2009I 1 MallikaSarabhai_2009I 543.63 554.53 <o,f0,female> we are surrounded by violence whether it's road rage or whether it's domestic violence whether it's a teacher beating up a student and killing her because she hasn't done her homework it's
MallikaSarabhai_2009I 1 MallikaSarabhai_2009I 555.67 566.32 <o,f0,female> so why are we not doing something to actually attend that problem on a day to day basis what are we doing to try and make children and young people realize that violence is something that we
MallikaSarabhai_2009I 1 MallikaSarabhai_2009I 567.26 580.27 <o,f0,female> in that we can stop and that there are other ways of actually taking violence taking anger taking frustrations into different things that do not harm other people well here is one such way
MallikaSarabhai_2009I 1 MallikaSarabhai_2009I 583.89 586.45 <o,f0,female> you are peaceful people
MallikaSarabhai_2009I 1 MallikaSarabhai_2009I 594.08 594.66 <o,f0,female> were
MallikaSarabhai_2009I 1 MallikaSarabhai_2009I 615.91 616.79 <o,f0,female> gene
MallikaSarabhai_2009I 1 MallikaSarabhai_2009I 624.18 626.13 <o,f0,female> and
MallikaSarabhai_2009I 1 MallikaSarabhai_2009I 631.90 635.02 <o,f0,female> you
MallikaSarabhai_2009I 1 MallikaSarabhai_2009I 663.79 664.04 <o,f0,female> that

MallikaSarabhai_2009I 1 MallikaSarabhai_2009I 793.14 799.22 <o,f0,female> so why is it that if we think that we all agree that we need a better world
MallikaSarabhai_2009I 1 MallikaSarabhai_2009I 799.44 809.21 <o,f0,female> we need a more just world why is it that we are not using the one language that has consistently showed us that we can break down barriers that we can reach people

MallikaSarabhai_2009I 1 MallikaSarabhai_2009I 847.86 857.72 <o,f0,female> we need to break down our vision of what planners are of what the correct way of a path is and to say all these years of
