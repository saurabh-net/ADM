EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 52.64 68.37 <o,f0,female> i was one of the three scientists on this expedition that took place last summer off japan i 'm the short one the other two are dr tsunemi kubodera and dr steve o 'shea i owe my participation in this now historic event to ted
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 68.62 86.29 <o,f0,female> in two thousand and ten there was a ted event called mission blue held aboard the lindblad explorer in the galapagos as part of the fulfillment of sylvia earle 's ted wish i spoke about a new way of exploring the ocean one that focuses on attracting animals instead of scaring them away
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 100.92 112.25 <o,f0,female> it was mike that got me invited to the squid summit a gathering of squid experts at the discovery channel that summer during shark week
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 131.81 141.83 <o,f0,female> using these platforms and my impression that i saw more animals working from the submersible than i did with either of the remote operated vehicles
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 141.83 151.15 <o,f0,female> but that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view but i also felt like i saw more animals working with the tiburon than the ventana two vehicles with the same field of view
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 239.81 250.24 <o,f0,female> of the optical lure which we called the electronic jellyfish or e jelly because it was designed to imitate the bioluminescent display
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 250.24 262.22 <o,f0,female> of the common deep sea jellyfish atolla now this pinwheel of light that the atolla produces is known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and is a form of defense
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 262.22 265.98 <o,f0,female> the reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure is
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 265.98 275.92 <o,f0,female> not because giant squid eat jellyfish but it 's because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light when it 's being chewed on by a predator and
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 276.02 291.06 <o,f0,female> its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of a larger predator that will attack its attacker and thereby afford it an opportunity for escape it 's a scream for help a last ditch attempt for escape and a common form of defense
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 291.06 297.64 <o,f0,female> in the deep sea the approach worked whereas all previous expeditions
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 297.64 302 <o,f0,female> had failed to garner a single video glimpse of the giant we managed
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 302.42 305.3 <o,f0,female> and the first triggered wild excitement
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 387.47 389.71 <o,f0,female> that brought the giant in
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 389.91 406.68 <o,f0,female> now what you 're seeing is the intensified camera 's view under red light and that 's all dr kubodera could see when the giant comes in here and then he got so excited he turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 406.68 414.41 <o,f0,female> and the giant didn 't run away so he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible bringing a creature of legend
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 414.62 429.21 <o,f0,female> from the misty history into high resolution video it was absolutely breathtaking and had this animal had its feeding tentacles intact and fully extended it would have been as tall as a two story
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 436.86 454.73 <o,f0,female> we 've only explored about five percent of our ocean there are great discoveries yet to be made down there fantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution and possibly bioactive compounds that could benefit us in ways that we can 't even yet imagine
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 455.28 458.46 <o,f0,female> yet we have spent only a tiny fraction
