JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 12.51 20.95 <o,f0,male> i coined my own definition of success in nineteen hundred and thirty four when i was teaching at a high school in south bend indiana being a little bit
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 28.97 37.05 <o,f0,male> expected their youngsters to get an a or a b they thought a c was all right for the neighbors children because the neighbors children are all average
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 37.62 50.17 <o,f0,male> but they weren't satisfied when their own would make the teacher feel that they had failed or the youngster had failed and that's not right the good lord in his infinite wisdom didn't create us all equal as far as intelligence is concerned any more than we're equal for
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 52.25 63.47 <o,f0,male> not everybody could earn an a or a b and i didn't like that way of judging it i did know know how the alumni of various schools back in the thirties judged coaches and athletic teams
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 63.85 72.45 <o,f0,male> you won them all you were considered to be reasonably successful not completely because i found out we had a number of years
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 74.75 80.20 <o,f0,male> but it seemed that we didn't win each individual game by the margin that some of our alumni had predicted and
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 91.44 94.37 <o,f0,male> but that was true back in the thirties so i understood that
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 95.14 108.86 <o,f0,male> but i didn't like it and i didn't agree with it and i wanted to come up with something that i hoped could make me a better teacher and give the youngsters under my supervision whether it be in athletics or in the english classroom something to which to aspire other than just a higher mark
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 109.24 118.37 <o,f0,male> in the classroom or more points in some athletic contest i thought about that for quite a spell and i wanted to come up with my own definition i thought that might help
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 119.03 126.75 <o,f0,male> and i knew how mister webster defined it as the accumulation of material possessions or the attainment of a position of power or prestige or something
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 127.23 134.40 <o,f0,male> of that sort worthy accomplishments perhaps but in my opinion not necessarily indicative of success so i wanted to come up with something
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 139.08 148.46 <o,f0,male> southern indiana and dad tried to teach me and my brothers that you should never try to be better than someone else i'm sure at the time he did that i didn't it
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 149.16 159.74 <o,f0,male> well somewhere i guess in the hidden recesses of my mind it popped out years later never try to be better than someone else always learn from others never cease trying to be the best you can be that's under your
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 170.74 180.59 <o,f0,male> simple verse that said at god 's footstool to confess a poor soul knelt and bowed his head i failed he cried the master said thou didst thy best
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 180.96 191.13 <o,f0,male> that is success from those things and one other perhaps i coined my own definition of success which is peace of mind attained only through self satisfaction in knowing
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 191.23 199.65 <o,f0,male> you made the effort to do the best of which you're capable i believe that's true if you make the effort to to the best of which you're capable try and improve the situation
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 200.00 211.26 <o,f0,male> that exists for you i think that's success and i don't think others can judge that i think it's like character and reputation your reputation is what you are perceived to be your character is what you really are and i think
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 212.37 220.77 <o,f0,male> much more important than what you are perceived to be you'd hope they'd both be good but they won 't necessarily be the same well
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 221.04 228.02 <o,f0,male> that was my idea that i was going to try to get across to the youngsters i ran across other things i love to teach and it was mentioned
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 229.19 236.43 <o,f0,male> the previous speaker that i enjoy poetry and i dabble in it a bit and love it there are some things that helped me i think
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 236.93 246.99 <o,f0,male> be better than i would have been i know i'm not what i ought to be not what i should be but i think i'm better than i would have been if i hadn't run across certain things one was just a little verse that said
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 248.86 249.55 <o,f0,male> no
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 250.48 257.36 <o,f0,male> written word no spoken plea can teach our youth what they should be nor all the books on all the shelves
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 257.98 259.71 <o,f0,male> what the teachers are themselves
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 260.04 266.20 <o,f0,male> that made an impression on me in the nineteen thirties and i tried to use that
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 266.68 273.77 <o,f0,male> more or less in my teaching whether it be in sports or whether it be in the english classroom i
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 285.66 294.42 <o,f0,male> our farm home and dad would read poetry to us so i always liked it and about the same time i ran across this one verse i ran across another one someone
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 295.67 307.95 <o,f0,male> lady teacher why she taught and she after some time she said she wanted to think about that then she came up and said they ask me why i teach and i reply where could i find such splendid company
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 308.66 319.76 <o,f0,male> a statesman strong unbiased wise another daniel webster silver tongued a doctor sits beside him whose quick steady hand may mend a bone or stem the life blood 's flow
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 320.38 328.93 <o,f0,male> and there a builder upward rise the arch of a church he builds wherein that minister may speak the word of god and lead a stumbling soul to touch the christ and all about
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 329.48 337.65 <o,f0,male> gathering of teachers farmers merchants laborers those who work and vote and build and plan and pray into a great tomorrow and i may say
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 338.00 346.44 <o,f0,male> i may not see the church or hear the word or eat the food their hands may grow but yet again i may and later i may say i knew him once
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 346.62 356.29 <o,f0,male> and he was weak or strong or bold or proud or gay i knew him once but then he was a boy they ask me why i teach and i reply where could i find such splendid company
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 356.83 365.49 <o,f0,male> and i believe the teaching profession it's true you have so many youngsters and i've got to think of my youngsters at ucla thirty some attorneys eleven
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 366.33 374.44 <o,f0,male> dentists and doctors many many teachers and other professions and that gives you a great deal of
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 374.70 383.82 <o,f0,male> pleasure to see them go on i always tried to make the youngsters feel that they're there to get an education number one basketball was second because it was paying their way
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 384.05 394.99 <o,f0,male> and they do need a little time for social activities but you let social activities take a little precedence over the other two and you're not going to have any very long so that was the ideas that i tried
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 395.83 396.76 <o,f0,male> to get across
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 397.74 411.05 <o,f0,male> to the youngsters under my supervision i had three rules pretty much that i stuck with practically all the time i'd learned these prior to coming to ucla and i decided they were very important one was never be late never be late
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 413.17 422.88 <o,f0,male> later on i said certain things i had players if we're leaving for somewhere had to be neat and clean there was a time when i made them
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 424.82 437.17 <o,f0,male> jackets and shirts and ties then i saw our chancellor coming to school in denims and turtlenecks and i thought not right for me to keep this other so i let them just they had to be neat and clean
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 437.70 447.67 <o,f0,male> i had one of my greatest players that you probably heard of bill walton he came to catch the bus we were leaving for somewhere to play and we wasn't clean and neat so
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 448.14 455.23 <o,f0,male> i wouldn't let him go he couldn't get on the bus he had to go home and get cleaned up to get to the airport so i
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 455.42 465.98 <o,f0,male> was a stickler for that i believed in that i belive in time very important i believe you should be on time but i felt at practice for example we start on time we close on time the youngsters didn't have to
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 475.52 487.54 <o,f0,male> the profession most of them are young you know and probably newly married and i tell them don 't run practices late because you'll go home in a bad mood and that's not good for a young married man to go home
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 495.12 499.13 <o,f0,male> so i did believe on time i believe starting on time and i believe closing on time
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 499.97 512.72 <o,f0,male> and another one i had was not one word of profanity one word of profanity and you are out of here for the day if i see it in a game you're going to come out and sit on the bench the third one was never criticize a
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 513.70 522.84 <o,f0,male> i didn't want that i used to tell them i was paid to do that that's my job i'm paid to do it pitifully poor but i am paid to do it not like the coaches today for gracious sakes no
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 524.29 531.55 <o,f0,male> a little different than it was in my day those were three things that i stuck with pretty closely all the time and
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 532.57 539.99 <o,f0,male> those actually came from my dad that's what he tried to teach me and my brothers one time i came up with
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 540.85 547.41 <o,f0,male> pyramid eventually that i don't have the time to go on that but that helped me i think become a better teacher
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 548.95 558.62 <o,f0,male> something like this i had blocks in the pyramid and the cornerstones being industriousness and enthusiasm working hard and enjoying what you're doing coming up to the apex
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 568.72 576.01 <o,f0,male> you have to have patience to we want things to happen we talk about our youth being impatient a lot and they are
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 591.34 599.48 <o,f0,male> not just give it word service believe that things will work out as they should providing we do what we should i think our tendency is to hope
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 599.83 609.87 <o,f0,male> that things will turn out the way we want them to much of the time but we don't do the things that are necessary to make those things become reality
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 610.45 617.86 <o,f0,male> i worked on this for some fourteen years and i think it helped me become a better teacher but it all revolved around that original definition
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 618.27 630.58 <o,f0,male> of success you know a number of years ago there was a major league baseball umpire by the name of george moriarty he spelled moriarty with only one i i'd never seen that before but he did
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 631.18 643.19 <o,f0,male> big league baseball players they're very perceptive about those things and they noticed he had only one i in his name you'd be surprised how many also told him that that was one more than he had in his head
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 646.49 657.31 <o,f0,male> but he wrote something that i think he did while i tried to do in this pyramid he called it the road ahead or the road behind sometimes i think the fates must grin as we denounce them and insist the only reason we
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 661.57 672.12 <o,f0,male> the ancient claim we win or lose within ourselves the shining trophies on our shelves can never win tomorrow 's game you and i know deeper down there's always a chance to win the crown but when we fail to give our best
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 672.36 678.48 <o,f0,male> we simply haven't met the test of giving all and saving none until the game is really won of showing what is meant by
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 690.92 702.02 <o,f0,male> not afraid to fall if bravely we have given all for who can ask more of a man than giving all within his span giving all it seems to me is not so far from victory
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 721.24 730.71 <o,f0,male> best of your ability and no one can do more than that i tried to get across too that my opponents don't tell you you never heard me mention winning
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 731.26 738.14 <o,f0,male> never mention winning my idea is that you can lose when you outscore somebody in a game
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 738.66 748.02 <o,f0,male> and you can win when you're outscored i've felt that way on certain occasions at various times and i just wanted them to be able to hold their head
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 749.00 761.45 <o,f0,male> after a game i used to say that when a game is over and you see somebody that didn't know the outcome i hope they couldn't tell by your actions whether you outscored an opponent or the opponent outscored you
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 763.62 777.07 <o,f0,male> that's what really matters if you make effort to do the best you can regularly the results will be about what they should be not necessary to what you would want them to be but they will be about what they should and only you will know whether you can do that
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 777.35 785.55 <o,f0,male> and that's what i wanted from them more than anything else and as time went by and i learned more about other things i think it worked a little better
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 786.10 794.84 <o,f0,male> as far as the results but i wanted the score of a game to be the byproduct of these other things and not the end itself i believe it was
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 798.74 808.94 <o,f0,male> one great philosopher said no no cervantes cervantes said the journey is better than the end and i like that
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 809.52 813.43 <o,f0,male> i think that is it's getting there sometimes when you get there there's almost
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 828.63 831.10 <o,f0,male> a decent job during the week
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 833.36 842.14 <o,f0,male> it's getting the players to get that self satisfaction in knowing that they'd made the effort to do the best of which they are capable
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 845.17 850.94 <o,f0,male> sometimes i'm asked who was the best player i had or the best teams i can never answer that
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 857.72 865.25 <o,f0,male> about that and they said suppose that you in some way could could make the perfect player what would you want
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 878.08 889.73 <o,f0,male> that defense usually wins championships and would work hard on defense but i'd want one that would play offense too i'd want him to be unselfish and look for the pass first and not shoot all the time
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 902.41 907.29 <o,f0,male> i wanted them to be able to shoot from the outside i wanted them to be good inside too
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 911.55 915.13 <o,f0,male> rebound well at both ends too and why not just take someone like
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 915.70 918.12 <o,f0,male> keith wilkes and let it go at that he had
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 919.33 921.31 <o,f0,male> not the only one but he was one that i
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 921.88 929.57 <o,f0,male> in that particular category because i think he made the effort to become the best i mention in my book they call me
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 931.28 937.89 <o,f0,male> two players that gave me great satisfaction that came as close as i think anyone i ever had to reach their full potential one was was conrad burke
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 938.20 946.41 <o,f0,male> and one was doug mcintosh when i saw them as freshmen on our freshmen team we didn't have freshmen couldn't play varsity when i taught and
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 955.28 963.21 <o,f0,male> our varsity must be pretty miserable if he 's good enough to make it and you know one of them was a starting player for
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 965.03 972.56 <o,f0,male> the other was his next year he played thirty two minutes in a national championship game did a tremendous job for us and the next year
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 973.52 981.35 <o,f0,male> a starting player on the national championship team and here i thought he'd never play a minute when he was so those are the things that give you
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 982.28 995.10 <o,f0,male> great joy and great satisfaction to see one neither one of those youngsters could shoot very well but they had outstanding shooting percentages because they didn't force it and neither one could jump very well
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 995.72 999.67 <o,f0,male> but they get kept good position and so they did well rebounding they remembered that
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 1000.84 1008.27 <o,f0,male> every shot that is taken they assumed would be missed i've had too many that stand around and wait to see if it's missed then they go and it's too late somebody else is in there ahead of
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 1010.35 1023.16 <o,f0,male> they weren't very quick but they played good position kept in good balance and so they played pretty good defense for us so they had qualities that they came close to as close to reaching possibly their full potential
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 1023.63 1031.37 <o,f0,male> as any players i ever had so i consider them to be as successful as lewis alcindor or bill walton
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 1037.24 1044.66 <o,f0,male> players have i rambled enough i was told that when he makes his appearance i was supposed to shut up
