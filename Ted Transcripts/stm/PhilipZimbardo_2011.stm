PhilipZimbardo_2011 1 PhilipZimbardo_2011 17.87 27.21 <o,f0,female> the demise of guys guys are flaming out academically they 're wiping out socially with girls and sexually with women other than that there 's not much of a problem
PhilipZimbardo_2011 1 PhilipZimbardo_2011 28.29 32.28 <o,f0,female> so what 's the data so the data on dropping out is amazing
PhilipZimbardo_2011 1 PhilipZimbardo_2011 51.73 64.26 <o,f0,female> two thirds of all students in special ed remedial programs are guys and as you all know boys are five times more likely than girls to be labeled as having attention deficit disorder and therefore we drug them with ritalin
PhilipZimbardo_2011 1 PhilipZimbardo_2011 64.26 80.89 <o,f0,female> what 's the evidence of wiping out first it 's a new fear of intimacy intimacy means physical emotional connection with somebody else and especially with somebody of the opposite sex who gives off ambiguous contradictory phosphorescent signals
PhilipZimbardo_2011 1 PhilipZimbardo_2011 92.39 105.72 <o,f0,female> and this is two kinds it 's a social awkwardness the old shyness was a fear of rejection it 's a social awkwardness like you 're a stranger in a foreign land they don 't know what to say they don 't know what to do especially one on one with the opposite sex
PhilipZimbardo_2011 1 PhilipZimbardo_2011 105.81 114.83 <o,f0,female> they don 't know the language of face contact the non verbal and verbal set of rules that enable you to comfortably talk to somebody else listen to somebody else
PhilipZimbardo_2011 1 PhilipZimbardo_2011 130.41 143.09 <o,f0,female> physical company and there 's actually a cortical arousal we 're looking at because guys have been with guys in teams in clubs in gangs in fraternities especially in the military and then in pubs
PhilipZimbardo_2011 1 PhilipZimbardo_2011 143.09 161.68 <o,f0,female> and this peaks at super bowl sunday when guys would rather be in a bar with strangers watching a totally overdressed aaron rodgers of the green bay packers rather than jennifer lopez totally naked in the bedroom the problem is they now prefer the asynchronistic internet world to the spontaneous interaction in social relationships
PhilipZimbardo_2011 1 PhilipZimbardo_2011 179.12 184.7 <o,f0,female> drugs you want more of the same different so you need the novelty in order for the arousal to be sustained
PhilipZimbardo_2011 1 PhilipZimbardo_2011 184.7 187.3 <o,f0,female> and the problem is the industry is supplying it
PhilipZimbardo_2011 1 PhilipZimbardo_2011 221.26 233.66 <o,f0,female> so the effect very quickly is it 's a new kind of arousal boys brains are being digitally rewired in a totally new way for change novelty excitement and constant arousal that means they 're totally out of sync in traditional classes
PhilipZimbardo_2011 1 PhilipZimbardo_2011 233.66 245.57 <o,f0,female> which are analog static interactively passive they 're also totally out of sync in romantic relationships which build gradually and subtly so what 's the solution it 's not my job i 'm here to alarm it 's your job
