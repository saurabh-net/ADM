NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 16.94 26.86 <o,f0,male> two thousand and ten the justice league of america will be teaming up with the ninety nine icons like batman superman wonder woman and their colleagues
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 27.14 35.37 <o,f0,male> will be teaming up with icons jabbar noora jami and their colleagues it's a story of intercultural intersections
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 35.95 43.21 <o,f0,male> and what better group to have this conversation than those that grew out of fighting fascism in their respective histories
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 46.28 52.17 <o,f0,male> as fascism took over europe in the nineteen thirties an unlikely reaction came out of north america as
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 54.10 63.06 <o,f0,male> got changed and swastikas were created out of crucifixes batman and superman were created by jewish young men in the united states and canada also going back to the bible
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 63.67 73.34 <o,f0,male> consider this like the prophets all the superheroes are missing parents superman 's parents die on krypton before the age of one
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 82.30 95.82 <o,f0,male> and all of them just like the prophets who get their message from god through gabriel get their message from above peter parker is in a library in manhattan when the spider descents from above and gives him his message through a bite
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 114.85 118.26 <o,f0,male> and you hear the voice of his father jor el saying to earth i have sent to you my
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 125.32 135.81 <o,f0,male> these are clearly biblical archetypes and the thinking behind that was to create positive globally resonating storylines that could be tied to the same things that other people were pulling mean messages
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 152.82 164.27 <o,f0,male> the koran things like generosity and mercy and foresight and wisdom and dozens of others that no two people in the world would disagree about it doesn't matter what your religion is even if you're an atheist you don't raise your kid telling him you know make sure you lie three times a day
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 173.51 182.10 <o,f0,male> all the books from bait al hikma library the most famous library in its day were thrown in the tigris river and the tigris changes color with ink it's a story passed on generation after generation
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 182.40 191.38 <o,f0,male> i rewrote that story and in my version the librarians find out that this is going to happen and here 's a side note if you want a comic book to do well make the librarians the hero it always works well
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 196.20 196.71 <o,f0,female> so
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 196.98 205.22 <o,f0,male> the librarians find out and they get together a special solution a chemical solution called king 's water that when mixed with ninety nine stones would be able to save all that culture and history in the books
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 205.48 217.34 <o,f0,male> but the mongols get there first the books and the solution get thrown in the tigris river some librarians escape and over the course of days and weeks they dip the stones into the tigris and suck up that collective wisdom that we all think is lost to civilization
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 237.65 242.65 <o,f0,male> so thirty three of the stones are smuggled onto the nina the pinta and the santa maria and are spread in the new world
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 253.84 263.02 <o,f0,male> now it's very easy to assume that those books because they were from a library called al hikma were muslim books but that's not the case because the caliph that built that library his name was al ma 'mun he was
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 264.42 277.52 <o,f0,male> he had told his advisers get me all the scholars to translate any book they can get their hands on to into arabic and i will pay them its weight in gold after a while his advisers complained they said your highness the scholars are cheating they're writing in big handwriting to take more
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 279.40 287.16 <o,f0,male> to which he said let them be because what they're giving us is worth a lot more than what we're paying them so the idea of an open architecture an open knowledge is not new to my neck of the desert
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 288.70 299.63 <o,f0,male> the concept centers on something called the noor stones noor is arabic for light so these ninety nine stones a few kind of rules in the game number one you don't choose the stone the stone chooses you there's a king arthur element to the storyline
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 300.19 314.14 <o,f0,male> okay number two all of the ninety nine when they first get their stone or their power abuse it they use it for self interest and there's a very strong message in there that when you start abusing your stone you get taken advantage of by people who will exploit your powers
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 314.56 322.83 <o,f0,male> okay number three the ninety nine stones all have within them a mechanism that self updates now there are two groups that exist within the muslim world
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 331.86 345.35 <o,f0,male> then there's a group that believes the koran is a living breathing document and i captured that idea within these stones that self update now the main bad guy rughal does not want these stones to update so he 's trying to get them to stop updating he can't use the stones
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 345.67 357.82 <o,f0,male> but he can stop them and by stopping them he has more of a fascist agenda where he gets some of the ninety nine to work for him they're all wearing cookie cutter same color uniforms they're not allowed to individually express who they are and what they are and he controls them from the top down
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 366.84 379.55 <o,f0,male> dress and the last point about the ninety nine noor stones is this so the ninety nine work in teams of three why three a couple of reasons number one we have a thing within islam that you don't leave a boy and a girl alone together because the third person is temptation or the devil
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 392.92 404.72 <o,f0,male> play the game and so this is the way i dealt with it they work of teams of three two boys and a girl two girls and a boy three boys three girls no problem and the swiss psychoanalyst carl jung also spoke about the importance of the number three in all cultures so i figure i'm covered well
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 406.70 412.66 <o,f0,male> i got accused in a few blogs that i was actually sent by the pope to preach the trinity and catholicism in the middle east so you
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 415.48 429.53 <o,f0,male> you believe who you want i gave you my version of the story so here 's some of the characters that we have mujiba from malaysia her main power is she's able to answer any question she's the trivial pursuit queen if you want but when she first gets her power she starts going on game shows and making money
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 430.45 435.77 <o,f0,male> we have jabbar from saudi who starts breaking things when he has the power now mumita was a fun one to name mumita is the destroyer
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 436.17 447.39 <o,f0,male> so the ninety nine attributes of allah have the yin and the yang there's the powerful the hegemonous the strong and there's also the kind the generous i'm like are all the girls going to be kind and merciful and the guys all strong i'm like you know what i've met a few girls who were destroyers in my lifetime so
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 477.06 488.98 <o,f0,male> so i promised my investors this would not be another made in fifth world country production this was going to be superman or it wasn't worth my time or their money so from day one the people involved in the project bottom left is fabian nicieza writer for x men and power rangers
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 489.33 498.03 <o,f0,male> next to him dan panosian one of the character creators for the modern day x men top writer stuart moore a writer for iron man next to him is john mccrea who was an inker for spiderman
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 498.31 505.48 <o,f0,male> and we entered western consciousness with a tagline next ramadan the world will have new heroes back in two thousand and five
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 506.33 519.12 <o,f0,male> now i went to dubai to an arab thought foundation conference and i was waiting by the coffee for the right journalist didn't have a product but had energy and i found somebody from the new york times and i cornered him and i pitched him and i think i scared him
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 521.99 530.77 <o,f0,male> because he basically promised me we had no product but he said we 'll give you a paragraph in the arts section if you'll just go away so i said great so i called him up a few
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 530.99 537.83 <o,f0,male> weeks afterward i said hi hesa and he said hi i said happy new year he said thank you we had a baby i said congratulations like i care
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 538.12 538.83 <o,f0,male> right
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 540.42 549.74 <o,f0,male> the article coming out he said naif islam and cartoon that's not timely you know maybe next week next month next year but you know it'll come out
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 550.73 558.70 <o,f0,male> so a few days after that what happens what happens is the world erupts in the danish cartoon controversy i became timely
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 610.13 619.75 <o,f0,male> a theme park through a license in kuwait a year and a half ago called the ninety nine village theme park three hundred thousand sq ft twenty rides all with our characters a couple back to school licenses in spain and turkey
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 642.35 650.85 <o,f0,male> the characters jabbar the one with the muscles and noora the one that can use light are actually wearing the cookie cutter fascist gray uniform because they're being manipulated they don't know
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 667.53 669.82 <o,f0,female> i can't see where to grab hold i need more
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 673.38 674.60 <o,f0,female> what's happening
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 676.97 682.05 <o,f0,male> there must be something we can do i won 't send any more commandos in until i know it's safe
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 697.16 699.00 <o,f0,female> even if you don't believe in yourself right now
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 699.43 702.10 <o,f0,female> i believe in you you are noora the
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 709.78 710.70 <o,f0,female> what about the rest of us
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 754.40 755.41 <o,f0,female> stay away from
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 768.09 769.53 <o,f0,female> that man is not your friend
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 770.80 772.09 <o,f0,female> he gave me access
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 772.53 773.36 <o,f0,female> you want to reboot the
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 786.42 795.29 <o,f0,male> the ninety nine is technology it's entertainment it's design but that's only half the story as the father of five sons
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 795.39 801.60 <o,f0,male> i worry about who they're going to be using as role models i worry because all around me even within my extended family i see religion being
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 804.14 811.47 <o,f0,male> as a psychologist i worry for the world in general but worry about the perception of how people see themselves in my part of the world
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 826.03 832.22 <o,f0,male> by you hero that just breaks you in so many ways i left bellevue went to business school and started this
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 853.29 858.41 <o,f0,male> ban valentine 's day red was made illegal any boys and girls caught flirting would get married off immediately
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 859.20 867.96 <o,f0,male> the second one was about a woman complaining because three minivans with six bearded men pulled up and started interrogating her on the spot for talking to a man who wasn't related to her and i asked the students
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 868.53 876.87 <o,f0,male> thought these incidents took place the first one they said saudi arabia there was no debate the second one they were actually split between saudi and afghanistan
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 905.64 913.07 <o,f0,male> us and this is dangerous it's dangerous when a group self identifies itself as extreme
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 914.14 920.63 <o,f0,male> is one of my sons rayan who 's a scooby doo addict you can tell by the glasses there he actually called me a meddling kid the other day
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 923.85 937.47 <o,f0,male> but i borrow a lesson that i learned from him last summer when we were in our home in new york he was out in the yard playing in his playhouse and i was in my office working and he came in baba i want you to come with me i want my toy yes rayan just go away he left his scooby doo in his house i said go away i'm working i'm busy
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 941.41 948.57 <o,f0,male> on the floor at three and a half and he looked at me and he said baba i want you to come with me to my office in my house i have work to do
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 954.90 957.59 <o,f0,male> the situation and brought himself down to my level
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 960.77 975.29 <o,f0,male> and with the ninety nine that is what we aim to do you know i think that there's a big parallel between bending the crucifix out of shape and creating swastikas and when i see pictures like this of parents or uncles who think it's cute to have a little child holding
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 975.78 983.08 <o,f0,male> a koran and having a suicide bomber belt around them to protest something the hope is by linking enough positive things
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 983.64 990.01 <o,f0,male> to the koran that one day we can move this child from being proud in the way they're proud there
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 992.28 992.92 <o,f0,male> to that
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 997.15 1001.57 <o,f0,male> i think i think the ninety nine can and will achieve its mission
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1021.41 1027.13 <o,f0,male> or so we thought until a woman came rushing across the campus and dropped her bag on the floor pointed up to the sign and said who 's falafel
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1032.01 1032.87 <o,f0,male> true story
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1035.63 1039.15 <o,f0,male> she was actually coming out of an amnesty international meeting
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1041.56 1052.31 <o,f0,male> c comics announced the cover of our upcoming crossover on that cover you see batman superman and a fully clothed wonder woman with our saudi member of the ninety nine our emirati member and our libyan
NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1 NaifAlMutawa_2010G 1073.42 1083.44 <o,f0,male> and where religion can be twisted and purposely made where it's not supposed to be by others in a world like that they'll always be a job for superman and the ninety nine thank you very much
