KiranBirSethi_2009I 1 KiranBirSethi_2009I 32.49 40.12 <o,f0,female> but for me what was contagious about all of them was that they were infected by something i call the i can bug
KiranBirSethi_2009I 1 KiranBirSethi_2009I 40.88 53.98 <o,f0,female> the question is why only them in a country of a billion people and some why so few is it luck is it chance can we all not systematically and consciously get infected
KiranBirSethi_2009I 1 KiranBirSethi_2009I 60.61 68.60 <o,f0,female> when as a student of the design college i encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas challenged me and had lots of cups of
KiranBirSethi_2009I 1 KiranBirSethi_2009I 69.63 78.81 <o,f0,female> and i was struck by just how wonderful it felt and how contagious that feeling was i also realized i should have got infected when i was seven
KiranBirSethi_2009I 1 KiranBirSethi_2009I 79.33 90.52 <o,f0,female> so when i started riverside school ten years ago it became a lab a lab to prototype and refine a design process that could consciously infect the mind with the i can bug
KiranBirSethi_2009I 1 KiranBirSethi_2009I 90.92 103.36 <o,f0,female> and i uncovered that if learning is embedded in real world context that if you blur the boundaries between school and life then children go through a journey of aware where they can see the change
KiranBirSethi_2009I 1 KiranBirSethi_2009I 105.11 111.68 <o,f0,female> be changed and then empower lead the change and that directly increased
KiranBirSethi_2009I 1 KiranBirSethi_2009I 132.15 141.90 <o,f0,female> to experience what it means to be a child laborer it transformed them what you will see is their journey and then their utter conviction that they could go out and change the world

KiranBirSethi_2009I 1 KiranBirSethi_2009I 189.46 200.20 <o,f0,female> but we had parents who said okay making our children good human beings is all very well but what about math and science and english show us the grades and we did the data was conclusive
KiranBirSethi_2009I 1 KiranBirSethi_2009I 200.54 212.02 <o,f0,female> when children are empowered not only do they do good they do well in fact very well as you can see in this national benchmarking assessment taken by over two thousand schools in india
KiranBirSethi_2009I 1 KiranBirSethi_2009I 221.57 228.21 <o,f0,female> so on august fifteenth independence day two thousand and seven the children of riverside set out to infect
