JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 35.46 48.41 <o,f0,female> so bpa mimics the body 's own hormones and causes neurological and reproductive problems and it 's everywhere a recent study found bpa in ninety three percent of people six and older
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 67.87 69.46 <o,f0,female> don 't become a cannibal
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 70.31 81.63 <o,f0,female> second we are both responsible for and the victims of our own pollution and third our bodies are filters and storehouses for environmental toxins
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 82.06 89.39 <o,f0,female> so what happens to all these toxins when we die the short answer is they return to the environment in one way or another
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 89.44 106.67 <o,f0,female> continuing the cycle of toxicity but our current funeral practices make the situation much worse if you 're cremated all those toxins i mentioned are released into the atmosphere and this includes five thousand pounds of mercury from our dental fillings alone every year
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 107.34 119.52 <o,f0,female> and in a traditional american funeral a dead body is covered with fillers and cosmetics to make it look alive it 's then pumped with toxic formaldehyde to slow decomposition
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 124.52 133.57 <o,f0,female> so by trying to preserve our dead bodies we deny death poison the living and further harm the
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 134.2 137.45 <o,f0,female> green or natural burials which don 't use embalming
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 143.05 160.12 <o,f0,female> i think there 's a better solution i 'm an artist so i 'd like to offer a modest proposal at the intersection of art science and culture the infinity burial project an alternative burial system that uses mushrooms to decompose and clean toxins in bodies
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 160.67 175.24 <o,f0,female> the infinity burial project began a few years ago with a fantasy to create the infinity mushroom a new hybrid mushroom that would decompose bodies clean the toxins and deliver nutrients to plant roots leaving clean compost
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 175.47 180.06 <o,f0,female> but i learned it 's nearly impossible to create a new hybrid mushroom
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 180.08 189.62 <o,f0,female> i also learned that some of our tastiest mushrooms can clean environmental toxins in soil so i thought maybe i could train an army of
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 190.14 193.5 <o,f0,female> toxin cleaning edible mushrooms to eat my body
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 193.74 202.35 <o,f0,female> so today i 'm collecting what i shed or slough off my hair skin and nails and i 'm feeding these to edible mushrooms
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 212.99 218.91 <o,f0,female> so when i die the infinity mushrooms will recognize my body and be able to eat it
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 228.53 241.81 <o,f0,female> is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to have with our food we want to eat not be eaten by our food but as i watch the mushrooms grow and digest my body i imagine the
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 245.42 248.17 <o,f0,female> and the relationship between my body and the
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 257.51 262.52 <o,f0,female> it 's a step towards accepting the fact that someday i will die and decay
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 263.22 266.7 <o,f0,female> it 's also a step towards taking responsibility for my
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 280.12 291.88 <o,f0,female> the infinity mushroom is a subset of decompiculture i 'm calling body decompiculture and toxin remediation the cultivation of organisms that decompose and clean toxins in bodies
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 291.88 299.78 <o,f0,female> and now about these ninja pajamas once it 's completed i plan to integrate the infinity mushrooms into a number of objects
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 299.95 304.91 <o,f0,female> first a burial suit infused with mushroom spores the mushroom death suit
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 308.58 310.19 <o,f0,female> the second prototype of this
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 316.75 323.31 <o,f0,female> the dendritic pattern you see mimics the growth of mushroom mycelia which are the equivalent of plant roots
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 326.4 344.13 <o,f0,female> a cocktail of capsules that contain infinity mushroom spores and other elements that speed decomposition and toxin remediation these capsules are embedded in a nutrient rich jelly a kind of second skin which dissolves quickly and becomes baby food for the growing mushrooms
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 344.6 356.77 <o,f0,female> so i plan to finish the mushroom and decompiculture kit in the next year or two and then i 'd like to begin testing them first with expired meat from the market and then with human subjects
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 357.05 363.37 <o,f0,female> and believe it or not a few people have offered to donate their bodies to the project to be eaten by mushrooms
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 367.76 376.95 <o,f0,female> i 've learned from talking to these folks is that we share a common desire to understand and accept death and to minimize the impact of our death on
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 382.12 396.83 <o,f0,female> so i formed the decompiculture society a group of people called decompinauts who actively explore their postmortem options seek death acceptance and cultivate decomposing organisms like the infinity mushroom
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 410.52 419.46 <o,f0,female> accepting death means accepting that we are physical beings who are intimately connected to the environment as the research on environmental toxins confirms
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 426.78 432.12 <o,f0,female> we see that the survival of our species depends on the survival of the planet
JaeRhimLee_2011G 1 JaeRhimLee_2011G 432.74 437.58 <o,f0,female> i believe this is the beginning of true environmental responsibility thank you
