GeverTulley_2009 1 GeverTulley_2009 13.86 19.20 <o,f0,male> this is the exact moment that i started creating something called tinkering school
GeverTulley_2009 1 GeverTulley_2009 29.78 35.61 <o,f0,male> and be trusted trusted not to hurt themselves and trusted not to hurt others
GeverTulley_2009 1 GeverTulley_2009 46.83 53.94 <o,f0,male> when the kids arrive they're confronted with lots of stuff wood and nails and rope and
GeverTulley_2009 1 GeverTulley_2009 55.46 58.20 <o,f0,male> and lots of tools real tools
GeverTulley_2009 1 GeverTulley_2009 60.65 74.07 <o,f0,male> it's a six day immersive experience for the kids and within that context we can offer the kids time something that seems in short supply in their over scheduled lives
GeverTulley_2009 1 GeverTulley_2009 75.84 77.04 <o,f0,male> our goal
GeverTulley_2009 1 GeverTulley_2009 77.40 89.11 <o,f0,male> is to ensure that they leave with a better sense of how to make things than when they arrived and the deep internal realization that you can figure things out by fooling around
GeverTulley_2009 1 GeverTulley_2009 90.83 94.82 <o,f0,male> nothing ever turns out as planned ever
GeverTulley_2009 1 GeverTulley_2009 98.10 101.98 <o,f0,male> and the kids soon learn that all projects go awry
GeverTulley_2009 1 GeverTulley_2009 104.30 111.13 <o,f0,male> and become at ease with the idea that every step in a project is a step closer to sweet success

GeverTulley_2009 1 GeverTulley_2009 116.65 125.92 <o,f0,male> we start from doodles and sketches and sometimes we make real plans and sometimes we just start building
GeverTulley_2009 1 GeverTulley_2009 127.25 136.56 <o,f0,male> building is at the heart of the experience hands on deeply immersed and fully committed to the problem at hand
GeverTulley_2009 1 GeverTulley_2009 146.84 157.65 <o,f0,male> is in the doing and failures are celebrated and analyzed problems become puzzles and obstacles disappear
GeverTulley_2009 1 GeverTulley_2009 158.86 167.84 <o,f0,male> when faced with particularly difficult setbacks or complexities a really interesting behavior emerges decoration
GeverTulley_2009 1 GeverTulley_2009 176.90 178.11 <o,f0,male> from these interludes come
GeverTulley_2009 1 GeverTulley_2009 179.05 185.76 <o,f0,male> deep insights and amazing new approaches to solving the problems that had them frustrated just moments before
GeverTulley_2009 1 GeverTulley_2009 188.08 190.12 <o,f0,male> all materials
GeverTulley_2009 1 GeverTulley_2009 190.93 198.27 <o,f0,male> are available for use even those mundane hateful plastic grocery bags
GeverTulley_2009 1 GeverTulley_2009 198.54 205.77 <o,f0,male> can become a bridge stronger than anyone imagined and the things that they build
GeverTulley_2009 1 GeverTulley_2009 207.63 209.46 <o,f0,male> even themselves
