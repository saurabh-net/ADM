AlisaMiller_2008 1 AlisaMiller_2008 16.79 19.87 <o,f0,female> the news shape the way we see the world
AlisaMiller_2008 1 AlisaMiller_2008 20.21 25.64 <o,f0,female> here 's the world based on the way it looks based on landmass
AlisaMiller_2008 1 AlisaMiller_2008 27.17 31.58 <o,f0,female> and here 's how news shapes what americans see
AlisaMiller_2008 1 AlisaMiller_2008 57.01 62.87 <o,f0,female> now this was a month when north korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities
AlisaMiller_2008 1 AlisaMiller_2008 63.44 72.51 <o,f0,female> there was massive flooding in indonesia and in paris the ipcc released its study confirming man 's impact
AlisaMiller_2008 1 AlisaMiller_2008 72.51 74.09 <o,f0,female> on global warming
AlisaMiller_2008 1 AlisaMiller_2008 74.92 79.42 <o,f0,female> the u s accounted for seventy nine percent of total news coverage
AlisaMiller_2008 1 AlisaMiller_2008 79.81 84.9 <o,f0,female> and when we take out the u s and look at the remaining twenty one percent
AlisaMiller_2008 1 AlisaMiller_2008 85.15 89.73 <o,f0,female> we see a lot of iraq that 's that big green thing there
AlisaMiller_2008 1 AlisaMiller_2008 96.21 99.6 <o,f0,female> reached just one percent
AlisaMiller_2008 1 AlisaMiller_2008 99.95 102.77 <o,f0,female> when we analyzed all the news stories
AlisaMiller_2008 1 AlisaMiller_2008 102.84 107.98 <o,f0,female> and removed just one story here 's how the world looked
AlisaMiller_2008 1 AlisaMiller_2008 123.04 128.26 <o,f0,female> and the cycle continues as we all know britney has loomed pretty large lately
AlisaMiller_2008 1 AlisaMiller_2008 128.57 131.57 <o,f0,female> so why don 't we hear more about the world
AlisaMiller_2008 1 AlisaMiller_2008 131.73 138.28 <o,f0,female> one reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half
AlisaMiller_2008 1 AlisaMiller_2008 152.01 158.68 <o,f0,female> india or south america places that are home to more than two billion people
AlisaMiller_2008 1 AlisaMiller_2008 161.07 164.31 <o,f0,female> the reality is that covering britney
AlisaMiller_2008 1 AlisaMiller_2008 172.02 174.96 <o,f0,female> local tv news looms large
AlisaMiller_2008 1 AlisaMiller_2008 175.15 180.37 <o,f0,female> and unfortunately only dedicates twelve percent of its coverage to international news
AlisaMiller_2008 1 AlisaMiller_2008 183.39 197.73 <o,f0,female> the most popular news sites don 't do much better last year pew and the colombia j school analyzed the fourteen thousand stories that appeared on google news front page and they in fact covered the same twenty four news events
AlisaMiller_2008 1 AlisaMiller_2008 211.53 222.35 <o,f0,female> so if you put it all together this could help explain why today 's college graduates as well as less educated americans know less about the world than their counterparts did twenty years ago
AlisaMiller_2008 1 AlisaMiller_2008 222.46 226.74 <o,f0,female> and if you think it 's simply because we are not interested
AlisaMiller_2008 1 AlisaMiller_2008 239.18 240.98 <o,f0,female> the real question
AlisaMiller_2008 1 AlisaMiller_2008 241.86 244.43 <o,f0,female> is this distorted worldview
AlisaMiller_2008 1 AlisaMiller_2008 244.61 249.55 <o,f0,female> what we want for americans in our increasingly interconnected world
AlisaMiller_2008 1 AlisaMiller_2008 250.93 254.54 <o,f0,female> i know we can do better and can we afford not to
AlisaMiller_2008 1 AlisaMiller_2008 254.6 256.37 <o,f0,female> thank you
