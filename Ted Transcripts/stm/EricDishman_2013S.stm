EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 21.84 26.68 <o,f0,female> and the need and the hope for us to reinvent our health care system around the world
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 26.68 39.94 <o,f0,female> twenty four years ago i had a sophomore in college i had a series of fainting spells no alcohol was involved and i ended up in student health and they ran some labwork and came back right away and said kidney problems
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 39.94 56.57 <o,f0,female> and before i knew it i was involved and thrown into this six months of tests and trials and tribulations with six doctors across two hospitals in this clash of medical titans to figure out which one of them was right about what was wrong with me
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 56.57 63.69 <o,f0,female> and i 'm sitting in a waiting room some time later for an ultrasound and all six of these doctors actually show up in the room at once and i 'm
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 63.69 82.85 <o,f0,female> like uh oh this is bad news and their diagnosis was this they said you have two rare kidney diseases that are going to actually destroy your kidneys eventually you have cancer like cells in your immune system that we need to start treatment right away and you 'll never be eligible for a kidney transplant and you 're not likely to live more than two or three years
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 83.52 102.66 <o,f0,female> now with the gravity of this doomsday diagnosis it just sucked me in immediately as if i began preparing myself as a patient to die according to the schedule that they had just given to me until i met a patient named verna in a waiting room who became a dear friend and she grabbed me one day and took me off to the medical library
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 102.66 105.11 <o,f0,female> and did a bunch of research on these diagnoses and these
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 105.11 116.02 <o,f0,female> diseases and said eric these people who get this are normally in their seventy s and eighty s they don 't know anything about you wake up take control of your health and get on with your life
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 116.02 117.8 <o,f0,female> and i did
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 117.8 134.95 <o,f0,female> now these people making these proclamations to me were not bad people in fact these professionals were miracle workers but they 're working in a flawed expensive system that 's set up the wrong way it 's dependent on hospitals and clinics for our every care need it 's dependent on specialists who just look at parts of us
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 134.95 140.42 <o,f0,female> it 's dependent on guesswork of diagnoses and drug cocktails and so something either works or you
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 140.42 149.41 <o,f0,female> die and it 's dependent on passive patients who just take it and don 't ask any questions
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 149.41 164.23 <o,f0,female> now the problem with this model is that it 's unsustainable globally it 's unaffordable globally we need to invent what i call a personal health system so what does this personal health system look like and what new technologies and roles
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 165.93 179.69 <o,f0,female> now i 'm going to start by actually sharing with you a new friend of mine libby somebody i 've become quite attached to over the last six months this is libby or actually this is an ultrasound image of libby this is the kidney transplant i was never supposed to have
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 179.69 197.42 <o,f0,female> now this is an image that we shot a couple of weeks ago for today and you 'll notice on the edge of this image there 's some dark spots there which was really concerning to me so we 're going to actually do a live exam to sort of see how libby 's doing this is not a wardrobe malfunction i have to take my belt off here don 't you in the front row worry or anything
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 232.16 244.86 <o,f0,male> so let me just make sure hey dr batiuk can you hear me okay and actually can you see libby thomas batuik hi there eric you look busy how are you eric dishman i 'm good i 'm just taking my clothes off in front of a few hundred people it 's wonderful
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 245.29 254.45 <o,f0,male> so i just wanted to see is this the image you need to get and i know you want to look and see if those spots are still there
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 263.2 265.28 <o,f0,male> okay
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 268.72 271.41 <o,f0,male> okay freeze that image that 's a good one for me
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 298.86 315.78 <o,f0,male> most of the time it doesn 't create any kind of mischief but it does warrant looking at so i 'm happy we 've got an opportunity to look at it today make sure that it 's not growing it 's not creating any problems based on the other images we have i 'm really happy how it looks today
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 337.42 351 <o,f0,female> now there 's really three pillars of this personal health i want to talk to you about now and it 's care anywhere care networking and care customization and you just saw a little bit of the first two with my interaction with dr batiuk so let 's start with care anywhere
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 351 358.03 <o,f0,female> humans invented the idea of hospitals and clinics in the one thousand seven hundred and eighty s it is time to update our thinking
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 358.03 371.35 <o,f0,female> we have got to untether clinicians and patients from the notion of traveling to a special bricks and mortar place for all of our care because these places are often the wrong tool and the most expensive tool for the job
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 371.35 388.6 <o,f0,female> and these are sometimes unsafe places to send our sickest patients especially in an era of superbugs and hospital acquired infections and many countries are going to go brickless from the start because they 're never going to be able to afford the mega medicalplexes that a lot of the rest of the world has built
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 388.6 395.69 <o,f0,female> now i personally learned that hospitals can be a very dangerous place at a young age this was me in third grade
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 395.69 413.02 <o,f0,female> i broke my elbow very seriously had to have surgery worried that they were going to actually lose the arm recovering from the surgery in the hospital i get bedsores those bedsores become infected and they give me an antibiotic which i end up being allergic to and now my whole body breaks out and now all of those become infected
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 420.62 433.81 <o,f0,female> the future of personal health that i 'm talking about says care must occur at home as the default model not in a hospital or clinic you have to earn your way into those places by being sick enough to use that tool for the job
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 433.81 441.95 <o,f0,female> now the smartphones that we 're already carrying can clearly have diagnostic devices like ultrasounds plugged into them and a whole array of others today
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 441.95 456.02 <o,f0,female> and as sensing is built into these we 'll be able to do vital signs monitor and behavioral monitoring like we 've never had before many of us will have implantables that will actually look real time at what 's going on with our blood chemistry and in our proteins right now
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 456.02 474.78 <o,f0,female> now the software is also getting smarter right think about a coach an agent online that 's going to help me do safe self care that same interaction that we just did with the ultrasound will likely have real time image processing and the device will say up down left right ah eric that 's the perfect spot to send that image off to your doctor
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 474.78 487.3 <o,f0,female> now if we 've got all these networked devices that are helping us to do care anywhere it stands to reason that we also need a team to be able to interact with all of that stuff and that leads to the second pillar i want to talk about care networking
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 487.3 498.54 <o,f0,female> we have got to go beyond this paradigm of isolated specialists doing parts care to multidisciplinary teams doing person care
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 498.54 510.74 <o,f0,female> uncoordinated care today is expensive at best and it is deadly at worst eighty percent of medical errors are actually caused by communication and coordination problems amongst medical team members
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 530.69 537.97 <o,f0,female> three different specialists had prescribed three different versions of the same drug to me i did not have a heart problem
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 537.97 552.8 <o,f0,female> i had an overdose problem i had a care coordination problem and this happens to millions of people every year i want to use technology that we 're all working on and making happen to make health care a coordinated team sport
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 552.8 569.42 <o,f0,female> now this is the most frightening thing to me out of all the care i 've had in hospitals and clinics around the world the first time i 've ever had a true team based care experience was at legacy good sam these last six months for me to go get this and this is a picture of my graduation team from legacy
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 569.42 586.42 <o,f0,female> there 's a couple of the folks here you 'll recognize dr batiuk we just talked to him here 's jenny one of the nurses allison who helped manage the transplant list and a dozen other people who aren 't pictured a pharmacist a psychologist a nutritionist even a financial counselor lisa who helped us deal with all the insurance hassles
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 586.42 604.76 <o,f0,female> i wept the day i graduated i should have been happy because i was so well that i could go back to my normal doctors but i wept because i was so actually connected to this team and here 's the most important part the other people in this picture are me and my wife ashley legacy trained us on how to do care for me at home
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 604.76 609.38 <o,f0,female> so that they could offload the hospitals and clinics that 's the only way that the model works
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 609.38 626.16 <o,f0,female> my team is actually working in china on one of these self care models for a project we called age friendly cities we 're trying to help build a social network that can help track and train the care of seniors caring for themselves as well as the care provided by their family members or volunteer community health workers
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 626.16 635.62 <o,f0,female> as well as have an exchange network online where for example i can donate three hours of care a day to your mom if somebody else can help me with transportation to meals and we exchange
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 637.52 652.67 <o,f0,female> the most important point i want to make to you about this is the sacred and somewhat over romanticized doctor patient one on one is a relic of the past the future of health care is smart teams and you 'd better be on that team for yourself
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 652.67 661.23 <o,f0,female> now the last thing that i want to talk to you about is care customization because if you 've got care anywhere and you 've got care networking those are going to go
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 673.6 692.78 <o,f0,female> and those are important things don 't get me wrong these population studies that we 've done have created tons of miracle drugs that have saved millions of lives but the problem is that health care is treating us as averages not unique individuals because at the end of the day the patient is not the same thing as the population who are studied
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 692.78 695.01 <o,f0,female> that 's what 's leading to the guesswork
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 695.01 708.38 <o,f0,female> the technologies that are coming high performance computing analytics big data that everyone 's talking about will allow us to build predictive models for each of us as individual patients and the magic here is experiment
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 708.38 715.21 <o,f0,female> on my avatar in software not my body in suffering
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 715.21 734.31 <o,f0,female> now i 've had two examples i want to quickly share with you of this kind of care customization on my own journey the first was quite simple i finally realized some years ago that all my medical teams were optimizing my treatment for longevity it 's like a badge of honor to see how long they can get the patient to live i was optimizing my life for quality of life and quality of life for me
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 734.31 736.96 <o,f0,female> means time in snow
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 736.96 746.49 <o,f0,female> so on my chart i forced them to put patient goal low doses of drugs over longer periods of time side effects friendly to skiing
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 746.49 753.99 <o,f0,female> and i think that 's why i achieved longevity i think that time in snow therapy was as important as the pharmaceuticals that i had
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 753.99 769.77 <o,f0,female> now the second example of customization and by the way you can 't customize care if you don 't know your own goals so health care can 't know those until you know your own health care goals but the second example i want to give you is i happened to be an early guinea pig and i got very lucky to have my whole genome sequenced now it took about
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 769.77 777.68 <o,f0,female> two weeks of processing on intel 's highest end servers to make this happen and another six months of human and computing labor to make sense of all of that
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 777.68 788.97 <o,f0,female> data and at the end of all of that they said yes those diagnoses of that clash of medical titans all of those years ago were wrong and we have a better path forward
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 788.97 797.22 <o,f0,female> the future that intel 's working on now is to figure out how to make that computing for personalized medicine go from months and weeks to even hours
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 797.22 807.95 <o,f0,female> and make this kind of tool available not just in the mainframes of tier one research hospitals around the world but in the mainstream every patient every clinic with access to whole genome sequencing
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 807.95 817.58 <o,f0,female> and i tell you this kind of care customization for everything from your goals to your genetics will be the most game changing transformation that we witness in health care during our lifetime
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 817.58 831 <o,f0,female> so these three pillars of personal health care anywhere care networking care customization are happening in pieces now but this vision will completely fail if we don 't step up as caregivers
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 831 845.43 <o,f0,female> and as patients to take on new roles it 's what my friend verna said wake up and take control of your health because at the end of the day these technologies are simply about people caring for other people and ourselves in some powerful new ways
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 845.71 854.52 <o,f0,female> and it 's in that spirit that i want to introduce you to one last friend very quickly tracey gamley stepped up to give me the impossible kidney
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 875.36 879.11 <o,f0,female> so tracey just tell us a little bit quickly about what the donor experience was like
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 910.94 922.04 <o,f0,female> all of the ted stages are often about celebrating innovation and celebrating new technologies and i 've done that here today and i 've seen amazing things coming from ted speakers i mean my gosh
EricDishman_2013S 1 EricDishman_2013S 922.04 941.56 <o,f0,female> artificial kidneys even printable kidneys that are coming but until such time that these amazing technologies are available to all of us and even when they are it 's up to us to care for and even save one another i hope you will go out and make personal health happen for yourselves and for everyone thanks so much
