JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 120.59 139.82 <o,f0,female> this idea is so pervasive that games are a waste of time that we will come to regret that i hear it literally everywhere i go for example true story just a few weeks ago this cab driver upon finding out that a friend and i were in town for a game developer 's conference turned around and said and i quote

JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 233.7 242.54 <o,f0,female> but when i hear these top five regrets of the dying i can 't help but hear five deep human cravings that games actually help us fulfill for example
JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 242.54 253.99 <o,f0,female> i wish i hadn 't worked so hard for many people this means i wish i 'd spent more time with my family with my kids when they were growing up well we know that playing games together has tremendous family benefits
JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 254 264.42 <o,f0,female> a recent study from brigham young university school of family life reported that parents who spend more time playing video games with their kids have much stronger real life relationships with them
JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 276.85 294.73 <o,f0,female> a recent study from university of michigan showed that these games are incredibly powerful relationship management tools they help us stay connected with people in our social network that we would otherwise grow distant from if we weren 't playing games together
JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 295.05 310.1 <o,f0,female> i wish i 'd let myself be happier well here i can 't help but think of the groundbreaking clinical trials recently conducted at east carolina university that showed that online games can outperform pharmaceuticals for treating clinical anxiety and depression
JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 310.1 319.17 <o,f0,female> just thirty minutes of online game play a day was enough to create dramatic boosts in mood and long term increases in happiness
JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 320.85 335.93 <o,f0,female> i 'd had the courage to express my true self well avatars are a way to express our true selves our most heroic idealized version of who we might become you can see that in this alter ego portrait by robbie cooper of a gamer with his
JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 336.13 343.81 <o,f0,female> and stanford university has been doing research for five years now to document how playing a game with an idealized avatar
JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 344.14 352.38 <o,f0,female> changes how we think and act in real life making us more courageous more ambitious more committed to our goals
JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 353.56 364.19 <o,f0,female> i wish i 'd led a life true to my dreams and not what others expected of me are games doing this yet i 'm not sure so i 've left a question mark a super mario question mark and we 're going to come back to this one
JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 378.64 383.35 <o,f0,female> but recently i did spend three months in bed
JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 389.95 401.69 <o,f0,female> it started two years ago when i hit my head and got a concussion now the concussion didn 't heal properly and after thirty days i was left with symptoms like nonstop headaches nausea vertigo memory loss mental fog
JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 401.69 418.35 <o,f0,female> my doctor told me that in order to heal my brain i had to rest it so i had to avoid everything that triggered my symptoms for me that meant no reading no writing no video games no work or email no running no alcohol no caffeine in other words and i think you see where this is going no reason to live
JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 428.64 433.73 <o,f0,female> and it happened to me my brain started telling me
JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 438.16 442.77 <o,f0,female> it said the pain will never end
JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 442.77 446.74 <o,f0,female> and these voices became so persistent and so persuasive
JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 446.74 452.9 <o,f0,female> that i started to legitimately fear for my life which
JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 452.9 458.31 <o,f0,female> is the time that i said to myself after thirty four days and i will never forget this
JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 458.35 461.74 <o,f0,female> i said i am either going to kill myself
JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 483.48 496.97 <o,f0,female> so i created a role playing recovery game called jane the concussion slayer now this became my new secret identity and the first thing i did as a slayer was call my twin sister i have an identical twin sister named kelly and tell her
JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 497.08 501.7 <o,f0,female> i 'm playing a game to heal my brain and i want you to play with me
JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 521.26 531.4 <o,f0,female> we also collected and activated power ups this was anything i could do on even my worst day to feel just a little bit good just a little bit productive
JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 531.4 544.51 <o,f0,female> things like cuddling my dog for ten minutes or getting out of bed and walking around the block just once now the game was that simple adopt a secret identity recruit your allies battle the bad guys activate
JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 552.81 571.5 <o,f0,female> went away it just vanished it felt like a miracle now it wasn 't a miracle cure for the headaches or the cognitive symptoms that lasted for more than a year and it was the hardest year of my life by far but even when i still had the symptoms even while i was still in pain i stopped suffering
JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 605.04 624.18 <o,f0,female> and i could tell from their messages and their videos that the game was helping them in the same ways that it helped me they talked about feeling stronger and braver they talked about feeling better understood by their friends and family and they even talked about feeling happier even though they were in pain
JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 624.18 630.35 <o,f0,female> even though they were tackling the toughest challenge of their lives now at the time i 'm thinking to myself
JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 647.73 652.96 <o,f0,female> some people get stronger and happier after a traumatic event
JaneMcGonigal_2012G 1 JaneMcGonigal_2012G 652.96 665.33 <o,f0,female> and that 's what was happening to us the game was helping us experience what scientists call post traumatic growth which is not something we usually hear about we usually hear about post traumatic stress disorder
