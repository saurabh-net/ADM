TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 21.54 26.3 <o,f0,female> now shivdutt was visiting the local land registry office in uttar pradesh
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 26.44 30.93 <o,f0,female> and he discovered that official records were listing him as dead
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 31.02 34.27 <o,f0,female> his land was no longer registered in his name
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 34.46 39.3 <o,f0,female> his brothers chandrabhan and phoolchand were also listed as dead
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 40.02 51.1 <o,f0,female> family members had bribed officials to interrupt the hereditary transfer of land by having the brothers declared dead allowing them to inherit their father 's share of the ancestral farmland
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 51.84 56.51 <o,f0,female> because of this all three brothers and their families had to vacate their home
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 58.25 66.07 <o,f0,female> according to the yadav family the local court has been scheduling a case review since two thousand and one but a judge has never appeared
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 66.88 73.08 <o,f0,female> there are several instances in uttar pradesh of people dying before their case is given a proper review
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 74.03 78.98 <o,f0,female> shivdutt 's father 's death and a want for his property led to this corruption
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 79.02 86.63 <o,f0,female> he was laid to rest in the ganges river where the dead are cremated along the banks of the river or tied to heavy stones and sunk in the water
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 88.14 99.38 <o,f0,female> photographing these brothers was a disorienting exchange because on paper they don 't exist and a photograph is so often used as an evidence of life yet these men remain dead
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 99.64 111.37 <o,f0,female> this quandary led to the title of the project which considers in many ways that we are all the living dead and that we in some ways represent ghosts of the past and the future
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 113.41 120.95 <o,f0,female> so this story is the first of eighteen chapters in my new body of work titled a living man declared dead and other chapters
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 120.98 129.02 <o,f0,female> and for this work i traveled around the world over a four year period researching and recording bloodlines and their related stories
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 129.67 137.96 <o,f0,female> i was interested in ideas surrounding fate and whether our fate is determined by blood chance or circumstance
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 139.74 149.97 <o,f0,female> the subjects i documented ranged from feuding families in brazil to victims of genocide in bosnia to the first woman to hijack an airplane and the living dead in india
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 150.74 162.46 <o,f0,female> in each chapter you can see the external forces of governance power and territory or religion colliding with the internal forces of psychological and physical inheritance
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 163.27 179.82 <o,f0,female> each work that i make is comprised of three segments on the left are one or more portrait panels in which i systematically order the members of a given bloodline this is followed by a text panel it 's designed in scroll form in which i construct the narrative at stake
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 181.02 199.77 <o,f0,female> and then on the right is what i refer to as a footnote panel it 's a space that 's more intuitive in which i present fragments of the story beginnings of other stories photographic evidence and it 's meant to kind of reflect how we engage with histories or stories on the internet in a less linear form so it 's more disordered
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 199.77 205.76 <o,f0,female> and this disorder is in direct contrast to the unalterable order of a bloodline
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 207.69 225.1 <o,f0,female> in my past projects i 've often worked in serial form documenting things that have the appearance of being comprehensive through a determined title and a determined presentation but in fact are fairly abstract in this project i wanted to work in the opposite direction and find an absolute
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 230.15 247.32 <o,f0,female> this led me to blood a bloodline is determined and ordered but the project centers on the collision of order and disorder the order of blood butting up against the disorder represented in the often chaotic and violent stories that are the subjects of my chapters
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 247.78 252.07 <o,f0,female> in chapter two i photograph the descendants of arthur ruppin
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 252.2 262.29 <o,f0,female> he was sent in one thousand nine hundred and seven to palestine by the zionist organization to look at areas for jewish settlement and acquire land for jewish settlement
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 263.49 271.39 <o,f0,female> he oversaw land acquisition on behalf of the palestine land development company whose work led to the establishment of a jewish state
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 272.56 282.16 <o,f0,female> through my research at the zionist archives in jerusalem i wanted to look at the early paperwork of the establishment of the jewish state and i found these maps which you see here
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 282.16 299.13 <o,f0,female> and these are studies commissioned by the zionist organization for alternative areas for jewish settlement in this i was interested in the consequences of geography and imagining how the world would be different if israel were in uganda which is what these maps demonstrate
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 332.67 336.87 <o,f0,female> but sometimes when his female patients can 't afford his services
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 355.27 360.41 <o,f0,female> two of his wives were brought to him suffering from infertility and he cured them
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 361.31 364.94 <o,f0,female> three for evil spirits one for an asthmatic
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 364.95 372.64 <o,f0,female> condition and severe chest pain and two wives ondijo claims he took for love paying their families a total of sixteen cows
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 372.76 377.76 <o,f0,female> one wife deserted him and another passed away during treatment for evil spirits
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 378.17 388.07 <o,f0,female> polygamy is widely practiced in kenya it 's common among a privileged class capable of paying numerous dowries and keeping multiple homes
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 388.07 398.61 <o,f0,female> instances of prominent social and political figures in polygamous relationships has led to the perception of polygamy as a symbol of wealth status and power
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 399.55 405.76 <o,f0,female> you may notice in several of the chapters that i photographed there are empty portraits
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 405.76 414.02 <o,f0,female> these empty portraits represent individuals living individuals who couldn 't be present and the reasons for their absence are given in my text panel
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 414.02 431.7 <o,f0,female> they include dengue fever imprisonment army service women not allowed to be photographed for religious and cultural reasons and in this particular chapter it 's children whose mothers wouldn 't allow them to travel to the photographic shoot for fear that their fathers would kidnap them during it
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 434.23 444.34 <o,f0,female> twenty four european rabbits were brought to australia in one thousand eight hundred and fifty nine by a british settler for sporting purposes for hunting and within
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 444.35 458.35 <o,f0,female> years that population of twenty four had exploded to half a billion the european rabbit has no natural predators in australia and it competes with native wildlife and damages native plants and degrades the land
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 459.07 467.15 <o,f0,female> since the one thousand nine hundred and fifty s australia has been introducing lethal diseases into the wild rabbit population to control growth
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 467.64 483.37 <o,f0,female> these rabbits were bred at a government facility biosecurity queensland where they bred three bloodlines of rabbits and have infected them with a lethal disease and are monitoring their progress to see if it will effectively kill them so they 're testing its virulence
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 483.37 489.42 <o,f0,female> during the course of this trial all of the rabbits died except for a few which were euthanized
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 490.49 495.13 <o,f0,female> haigh 's chocolate in collaboration with the foundation for rabbit
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 503.16 516.75 <o,f0,female> now this was done to counter the annual celebration of rabbits and presumably make the public more comfortable with the killing of rabbits and promote an animal that 's native to australia and actually an animal that is threatened by the european rabbit
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 518.73 531.12 <o,f0,female> in chapter seven i focus on the effects of a genocidal act on one bloodline so over a two day period six individuals from this bloodline were killed in the srebrenica massacre
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 531.12 543.83 <o,f0,female> this is the only work in which i visually represent the dead but i only represent those that were killed in the srebrenica massacre which is recorded as the largest mass murder in europe since the second world war
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 545 551.07 <o,f0,female> and during this massacre eight thousand bosnian muslim men and boys were systematically executed
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 552.06 560.79 <o,f0,female> so when you look at a detail of this work you can see the man on the upper left is the father of the woman sitting next to him her name is zumra
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 560.79 573.46 <o,f0,female> she is followed by her four children all of whom were killed in the srebrenica massacre following those four children is zumra 's younger sister who is then followed by her children who were killed as well
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 574.12 584.66 <o,f0,female> during the time i was in bosnia the mortal remains of zumra 's eldest son were exhumed from a mass grave and i was therefore able to photograph the fully assembled remains
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 584.66 597.49 <o,f0,female> however the other individuals are represented by these blue slides which show tooth and bone samples that were matched to dna evidence collected from family members to prove they were the identities of those individuals
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 607.28 613.6 <o,f0,female> these are personal effects dug up from a mass grave that are awaiting identification from family members
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 625.35 637.75 <o,f0,female> this is video footage used at the milosevic trial which from top to bottom shows a serbian scorpion unit being blessed by an orthodox priest before rounding up the boys and men and killing them
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 640.95 654.34 <o,f0,female> chapter fifteen is more of a performance piece i solicited china 's state council information office in two thousand and nine to select a multi generational bloodline to represent china for this project
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 654.52 667.47 <o,f0,female> they chose a large family from beijing for its size and they declined to give me any further reasoning for their choice this is one of the rare situations where i have no empty portraits everyone showed up
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 667.68 673.27 <o,f0,female> you can also see the evolution of the one child only policy as it travels through the bloodline
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 673.83 689.57 <o,f0,female> previously known as the department of foreign propaganda the state council information office is responsible for all of china 's external publicity operations it controls all foreign media and image production outside of china
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 689.57 706.58 <o,f0,female> from foreign media working within china it also monitors the internet and instructs local media on how to handle any potentially controversial issues including tibet ethnic minorities human rights religion democracy movements and terrorism
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 707.73 718.01 <o,f0,female> for the footnote panel in this work this office instructed me to photograph their central television tower in beijing and i also photographed the gift bag they gave me when i left
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 722.13 737.89 <o,f0,female> these are the descendants of hans frank who was hitler 's personal legal advisor and governor general of occupied poland now this bloodline includes numerous empty portraits highlighting a complex relationship to one 's family history
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 738.82 751.81 <o,f0,female> the reasons for these absences include people who declined participation there 's also parents who participated who wouldn 't let their children participate because they thought they were too young to decide for themselves
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 751.81 760.76 <o,f0,female> another section of the family presented their clothing as opposed to their physical presence because they didn 't want to be identified with the past that i was highlighting
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 760.76 769.78 <o,f0,female> and finally another individual sat for me from behind and later rescinded his participation so i had to pixelate him out so he 's unrecognizable
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 772.6 779.31 <o,f0,female> in the footnote panel that accompanies this work i photographed an official adolph hitler postage stamp
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 779.31 792.88 <o,f0,female> and an imitation of that stamp produced by british intelligence with hans frank 's image on it it was released in poland to create friction between frank and hitler so that hitler would imagine frank was trying to usurp his power
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 794.76 805.08 <o,f0,female> again talking about fate i was interested in the stories and fate of particular works of art these paintings were taken by hans frank during the time of the third reich
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 805.74 819.64 <o,f0,female> and i 'm interested in the impact of their absence and presence through time they are leonardo da vinci 's lady with an ermine rembrandt 's landscape with good samaritan and raphael 's portrait of a youth which has never been found
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 821.76 828.58 <o,f0,female> chapter twelve highlights people being born into a battle that is not of their making but becomes their own
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 828.58 833.34 <o,f0,female> so this is the ferraz family and the novaes family
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 833.34 852.31 <o,f0,female> and they are in an active blood feud this feud has been going on since one thousand nine hundred and ninety one in northeast brazil in pernambuco and it involved the deaths of twenty members of the families and forty others associated with the feud including hired hit men innocent bystanders and friends
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 861.71 864.76 <o,f0,female> two decades and includes decapitation
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 864.79 878 <o,f0,female> and the death of two mayors installed into a protective wall surrounding the suburban home of louis novaes who 's the head of the novaes family are these turret holes which were used for shooting and looking
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 879.1 892.75 <o,f0,female> brazil 's northeast state of pernambuco is one of the nation 's most violent regions it 's rooted in a principle of retributive justice or an eye for an eye so retaliatory killings have led to several deaths in the area
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 903.35 908.13 <o,f0,female> again in the future i 'm interested in these ideas of repetition
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 909.02 916.11 <o,f0,female> so after i returned home i received word that one member of the family had been shot thirty times in the face
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 918.58 934.94 <o,f0,female> chapter seventeen is an exploration of the absence of a bloodline and the absence of a history children at this ukrainian orphanage are between the ages of six and sixteen this piece is ordered by age because it can 't be ordered by blood
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 935.02 940.21 <o,f0,female> in a twelve month period when i was at the orphanage only one child had been adopted
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 941.34 947.24 <o,f0,female> children have to leave the orphanage at age sixteen despite the fact that there 's often nowhere for them to go
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 948.66 963.68 <o,f0,female> it 's commonly reported in ukraine that children when leaving the orphanage are targeted for human trafficking child pornography and prostitution many have to turn to criminal activity for their survival and high rates of suicide are recorded
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 965.65 976.36 <o,f0,female> this is a boys bedroom there 's an insufficient supply of beds at the orphanage and not enough warm clothing children bathe infrequently because the hot water isn 't turned on until october
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 977.37 993.15 <o,f0,female> this is a girls bedroom and the director listed the orphanage 's most urgent needs as an industrial size washing machine and dryer four vacuum cleaners two computers a video projector a copy machine winter shoes and a dentist 's drill
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 993.76 1005.91 <o,f0,female> this photograph which i took at the orphanage of one of the classrooms shows a sign which i had translated when i got home and it reads those who do not know their past are not worthy of their future
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 1007.31 1018.11 <o,f0,female> there are many more chapters in this project this is just an abridged rendering of over a thousand images and this mass pile of images and stories forms an archive
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 1018.47 1030.29 <o,f0,female> and within this accumulation of images and texts i 'm struggling to find patterns and imagine that the narratives that surround the lives we lead are just as coded as blood itself
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 1031.47 1042.28 <o,f0,female> but archives exist because there 's something that can 't necessarily be articulated something is said in the gaps between all the information that 's collected
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 1042.31 1056.47 <o,f0,female> and there 's this relentless persistence of birth and death and an unending collection of stories in between it 's almost machine like the way people are born and people die and the stories keep coming and coming
TarynSimon_2011S 1 TarynSimon_2011S 1057.47 1068.73 <o,f0,female> and in this i 'm considering is this actual accumulation leading to some sort of evolution or are we on repeat over and over again
