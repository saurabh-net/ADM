PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 199.57 201.95 <o,f0,male> the internet has changed the world it has
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 202.63 208.90 <o,f0,male> the music industry it has changed the way we consume music for those of you old enough to remember we used to have to go to the store

PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 250.01 251.16 <o,f0,male> in short technology the
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 253.10 253.55 <o,f0,male> our
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 279.67 280.51 <o,f0,male> not like it
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 283.73 286.10 <o,f0,male> even changed our relationship to god
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 294.27 302.66 <o,f0,male> now i shouldn 't get into this religion and political cartoons as you may have heard make a difficult couple ever since that day
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 303.30 313.29 <o,f0,male> two thousand and five when a bunch of cartoonists in denmark drew cartoons that had repercussions all over the world demonstrations fatwa they provoked violence people died in the violence
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 314.48 318.20 <o,f0,male> this was so sickening people died because of cartoons
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 345.79 353.59 <o,f0,male> and then of course they were used by extremists and politicians on the other side they wanted to stir up controversy you know the story
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 356.01 358.73 <o,f0,male> we know that cartoons can be used as weapons
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 365.15 366.43 <o,f0,male> and here we are now
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 367.87 379.54 <o,f0,male> in the united nations half of the world is pushing to penalize the offense to religion they call it the defamation of religion while the other half of the world is fighting back in defense of freedom of speech
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 380.95 383.92 <o,f0,male> the clash of civilizations is here and cartoons are
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 386.95 388.45 <o,f0,male> this got me thinking
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 410.58 419.88 <o,f0,male> now talk of a divided place the country was cut in two you had a rebellion in the north the government in the south the capital abidjan and in the middle the french
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 420.87 422.94 <o,f0,male> this looks like a giant hamburger you don't want to be
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 424.45 424.67 <o,f0,female> in the
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 427.11 429.08 <o,f0,male> i was there to report on that story
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 431.10 440.20 <o,f0,male> in cartoons i've been doing this for the last fifteen years it's my side job if you want so you see the style is different this is more serious than maybe
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 441.64 453.27 <o,f0,male> i went to places like gaza during the war in two thousand and nine so this is really journalism in cartoons you'll hear more and more about it this is the future of journalism i think
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 455.58 461.63 <o,f0,male> and of course i went to see the rebels in the north those were poor guys fighting for their rights there was an
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 465.68 474.49 <o,f0,male> i went to see the dozo the dozo they are the traditional hunters of west africa people fear them they help the rebellion
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 475.42 477.81 <o,f0,male> they are believed to have magical powers they can disappear
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 482.14 483.64 <o,f0,male> i went to see a dozo chief
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 484.06 494.59 <o,f0,male> he told me about his magical powers he said i can chop your head off right away and bring you back to life i said well maybe we don't have time for this
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 495.49 496.02 <o,f0,male> right now
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 497.38 498.30 <o,f0,male> another time
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 500.40 503.41 <o,f0,male> back in abidjan i was given a chance
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 504.14 506.55 <o,f0,male> to lead a workshop with local cartoonists there
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 506.81 512.95 <o,f0,male> and i thought yes in a context like this cartoons can really be used as weapons against the other side
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 515.30 521.61 <o,f0,male> the press in ivory coast was bitterly divided it was compared to the media in rwanda before the genocide
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 521.99 530.95 <o,f0,male> so imagine and what can a cartoonist do sometimes editors would tell their cartoonists to draw what they wanted to see and the guy has to feed his family right
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 535.31 538.95 <o,f0,male> pretty simple we brought together cartoonists from all sides
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 539.58 548.82 <o,f0,male> in ivory coast we took them away from their newspaper for three days and i asked them to do a project together tackling the issues
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 551.42 558.86 <o,f0,male> in cartoons yes in cartoons show the positive power of cartoons it's a great tool of communication for bad or for good
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 559.97 563.32 <o,f0,male> and cartoons can cross boundaries as you have seen
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 564.27 567.83 <o,f0,male> is a good way i think to address serious issues
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 569.34 580.31 <o,f0,male> i'm very proud of what they did i mean they didn't agree with each other that was not the point and i didn't ask them to do nice cartoons the first day they were even shouting at each other but they came up with a book looking back
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 583.43 585.26 <o,f0,male> of political crisis in ivory coast
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 586.33 591.34 <o,f0,male> so the idea was there and i've been doing projects like this in two thousand and nine in lebanon
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 591.91 603.63 <o,f0,male> this year in kenya back in january in lebanon it was not a book the idea was to have the same principal a divided country take cartoonists from all sides and let them do something together
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 605.16 613.01 <o,f0,male> so in lebanon we enrolled the newspaper editors and we got them to publish eight cartoonists from all sides all together
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 613.17 620.69 <o,f0,male> on the same page addressing the issue affecting lebanon like religion in politics and everyday life and it worked
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 621.34 627.78 <o,f0,male> for three days almost all the newspapers of beirut published all those cartoonists together anti government
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 628.96 631.85 <o,f0,male> pro government christian
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 633.98 636.34 <o,f0,male> muslim of course english speaking
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 637.96 639.15 <o,f0,male> so this was a great project
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 640.55 641.54 <o,f0,male> in kenya what we did
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 662.48 667.91 <o,f0,male> as you have seen in contexts of repression or division again what can a cartoonist do
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 668.54 670.68 <o,f0,male> he has to keep his job
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 672.42 675.30 <o,f0,male> well i believe that in any context anywhere
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 677.68 681.89 <o,f0,male> at least not to do a cartoon that will feed hatred
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 682.21 685.16 <o,f0,male> and that's the message i try to convey to them
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 686.58 689.91 <o,f0,male> all always have the choice in the end not to do the
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 692.35 695.99 <o,f0,male> but we need to support these critical
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 697.85 700.99 <o,f0,male> responsible voices in africa in lebanon
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 701.63 703.00 <o,f0,male> in your local newspaper
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 724.28 727.05 <o,f0,male> for dictators all over the world
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 729.47 730.24 <o,f0,male> the good news
PatrickChappatte_2010G 1 PatrickChappatte_2010G 735.43 736.72 <o,f0,male> and activists shut up
