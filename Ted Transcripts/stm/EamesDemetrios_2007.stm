EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 44.59 49.10 <o,f0,male> the others i'm going to show you but we're going to first enter through the door of the big top
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 69.57 77.61 <o,f0,male> about this though is that you know why am i showing it is it because charles and ray made this film this is actually a training film for a clown college that they had they also
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 77.94 86.23 <o,f0,male> a clown act when the future of furniture was not nearly as auspicious as it turned out to be there is a picture of charles so let 's watch the next clip
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 91.91 93.01 <o,f0,male> this is the land
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 93.99 98.38 <o,f0,male> it has many contrasts it is rough and it is
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 99.94 101.93 <o,f0,male> places it is cold in some
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 118.50 123.05 <o,f0,male> much rain falls on some areas and not enough on others
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 125.36 127.02 <o,f0,male> but people live on this land
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 130.30 133.86 <o,f0,male> they are drawn together into towns and cities
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 134.99 136.61 <o,f0,male> here is something of the way they live
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 138.19 150.53 <o,f0,male> this is a film that was hardly ever seen in the united states it was on seven screens and it was two hundred feet across and it was at the hight of the cold war the nixon krushchev kitchen debate happened about fifty feet from where this was shown
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 150.96 165.01 <o,f0,male> and yet how did it start you know commonality the first line in charles narration was the same stars that shine down on russia shine down on the united states from the sky our cities look much the same it was that human connection that charles and ray always found in everything
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 174.93 186.38 <o,f0,male> about so that was just a little snip but the thing about charles and ray is that they were always modeling stuff they were always trying things out i think one of the things i am passionate about my grandparents work i'm passionate about my work
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 187.37 200.57 <o,f0,male> on top of all that i'm passionate about a holistic vision of design where design is a life skill not a professional skill and you know those of us with kids often want our kids to take music i'm no exception but it's not about them becoming
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 201.24 211.15 <o,f0,male> or tracy chapman it's about getting that music thing going through their heads and their thinking design is the same way design has to become that same way and this is a model that they did of that seven screen presentation
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 212.26 220.70 <o,f0,male> checking it out there so now we're going to go through that door of furniture this is an unusual installation of airport seating so what we're going to see is some of the icons of eames furniture
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 221.16 228.19 <o,f0,male> and the thing about their furniture is that they said the role of the designer was essentially that of a good host anticipating the needs of the guest
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 228.52 238.26 <o,f0,male> so those are cool images but these are ones i think are really cool these are all the prototypes these are the mistakes although i don't think mistakes is the right word in design it's just the things you try out to kind of make it
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 239.16 248.65 <o,f0,male> work better and you know some of them would probably be terrible chairs some of them are kind of cool looking it's like hey why didn't they try that it was that hands on iterative process which is so much like
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 265.48 276.50 <o,f0,male> the media when people say design they actually mean style and i'm really here to talk about design but you know the object is just a pivot it's a pivot between a process and a system and
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 286.33 286.64 <o,f0,male> and
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 309.52 322.30 <o,f0,male> it's early version had an x base that's what the collectors like charles and ray liked this one because it was better it worked better h base much more practical this is something called a splint and i was very touched by dean kamen 's
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 323.06 329.22 <o,f0,male> work for the military or for the soldiers because charles and ray designed a molded plywood splint this is it
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 329.56 337.69 <o,f0,male> and they'd been working on furniture before but doing these splints they learned a lot about the manufacturing process which was incredibly important to them
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 348.19 356.23 <o,f0,male> to show you too much because i want you to really get a broth of ideas and images this is a house that charles and ray designed my sister is chasing someone else it's not me
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 356.70 363.74 <o,f0,male> although i endorse heartily the fact that he stole her diary it's not me and then this is a film on the lower left that charles and ray made
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 364.44 366.14 <o,f0,male> now look at that plastic chair
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 376.33 387.30 <o,f0,male> they didn't obsess about style for it's own sake they didn't say our style is curves let 's make the house curvy they didn't say our style is grids let 's make the chair griddy they focused on the need they tried to solve the design
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 402.76 410.29 <o,f0,male> here 's a film we've been hearing things about the powers of ten is a film they made if we watch the next clip
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 411.24 420.18 <o,f0,male> the first version of powers of ten upper left the familiar one on the lower right the eames film tops lower left
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 422.79 428.06 <o,f0,female> charles designed for a church which in turn belongs to a local group of galaxies these
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 428.22 436.82 <o,f0,female> form part of a grouping system much as the stars do they are so many and so varied that from this distance they appear like the stars from
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 439.18 445.53 <o,f0,male> seen that film and what's so great about this whole conference is that everybody has been talking about scale everybody here is coming at it from a different way
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 446.26 454.65 <o,f0,male> one example e o wilson once told me that when he looked at ants he loved them of course and he wanted to learn more about them he consciously looked at them from the standpoint of scale
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 468.88 479.21 <o,f0,male> i think in our family we were very lucky because we learned about design backwards design was not something other it was part of the business of life in general it was part of the quality of life and
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 480.01 489.43 <o,f0,male> is some family pictures and you can see why i'm down on style with a haircut like that but anyway i remember the cut grapefruit that we would have at the eames house when i was a kid
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 489.93 496.36 <o,f0,male> so we're going to watch another film this is a film the one called toys you can see me i have the same haircut in the
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 497.42 506.77 <o,f0,male> upper right corner upper left is a film they did on toy trains lower right is a solar do nothing toy lower left is
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 524.86 530.78 <o,f0,male> and these ideas that train up there being about the honest use of materials is totally the same as the honest use of materials
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 536.26 542.35 <o,f0,male> and now i'm going to test you this is a letter that my grandfather sent to my mom when she was five years old so can you read it
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 544.26 545.24 <o,f0,male> lucia angel
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 554.93 557.61 <o,f0,male> also good that the leather crafter 's guild is here
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 558.90 561.09 <o,f0,male> what is he doing row rowed
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 563.68 563.94 <o,f0,male> a
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 566.51 568.49 <o,f0,male> dawn very good also rode on one
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 569.47 570.01 <o,f0,male> you
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 585.86 592.67 <o,f0,male> citizen kane rose rosebud ed no bud d s right at buddy 's
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 608.78 617.48 <o,f0,male> and it's all part of the you know they used to say take your pleasure seriously these are some images from a project of mine that's called kymaerica it's sort of
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 641.79 649.47 <o,f0,male> and so we had spelling bees in paris illinois your word is n carolina y
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 674.86 675.73 <o,f0,male> things could have happened
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 684.67 691.50 <o,f0,male> all sorts of cool things and you're kind of trapped in the texture of kymaerica the tahatchabe the great road building culture
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 691.98 702.26 <o,f0,male> a guy named nobu naga the so called japanese columbus but now i'm going to return you to the real world and this is cranbrook i've got a real treat for you which is the first film that charles ever made
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 702.89 705.45 <o,f0,male> so let 's watch that nobody 's ever seen it
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 741.93 748.04 <o,f0,male> this wholistic vision of design was with them from the beginning it wasn't like oh we made some chairs and got successful now we're going to do some movies
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 748.40 756.71 <o,f0,male> was always part of how they looked at the world and that's what's really powerful and i think that all of us in this room as you move design forward it's not about just doing
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 770.30 777.99 <o,f0,male> in india those without and the lowest in caste eat very often particularly in southern india they eat off of
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 780.24 783.72 <o,f0,male> and those a little bit up the scale
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 784.47 792.04 <o,f0,male> off of a sort of a low fired ceramic dish and a little bit higher why they have a glaze on
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 792.47 799.37 <o,f0,male> thing they call a thali if you're up the scale a little bit more why a brass thali and then
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 800.14 811.39 <o,f0,male> things get to be a little questionable there are things like silver plated thalis and there is solid silver thalis and i suppose some nut has had a gold thali that
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 811.48 820.74 <o,f0,female> he 's eaten off of but you can go beyond that and the guys that have not only means but a certain
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 821.05 829.11 <o,f0,female> amount of knowledge and understanding go to the next step and they eat off a banana leaf
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 830.85 838.89 <o,f0,female> i think that in these times when we fall back and regroup that somehow or other the
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 839.76 848.89 <o,f0,female> banana leaf parable sort of got to get working there because i'm not prepared to say that the banana leaf that one
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 849.65 855.79 <o,f0,male> of is the same as the other eats off of but it is that
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 856.21 859.84 <o,f0,female> process that has happened within the man that changes the
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 867.96 874.98 <o,f0,male> beyond the age of information is the age of choices and i really think that's where we are and it's kind of cool for me to be part of a
EamesDemetrios_2007 1 EamesDemetrios_2007 890.40 900.14 <o,f0,male> is not just for designers anymore it's a process it's not style all that great thinking needs to really get about solving pretty key problems i really thank you for your time
