JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 12.66 30.61 <o,f0,male> 'm going to share with you a paradigm shifting perspective on the issues of gender violence sexual assault domestic violence relationship abuse sexual harassment sexual abuse of children that whole range of issues that i 'll refer to in shorthand as gender violence issues they 've been seen as women 's issues that some good men help out with
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 30.61 41.84 <o,f0,male> but i have a problem with that frame and i don 't accept it i don 't see these as women 's issues that some good men help out with in fact i 'm going to argue that these are men 's issues first and foremost applause now obviously
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 52.5 65.08 <o,f0,male> the first is that it gives men an excuse not to pay attention right a lot of men hear the term women 's issues and we tend to tune it out and we think hey i 'm a guy that 's for the girls or that 's for the women and a lot of men literally don 't get beyond the first sentence
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 65.08 79.4 <o,f0,male> as a result it 's almost like a chip in our brain is activated and the neural pathways take our attention in a different direction when we hear the term women 's issues this is also true by the way of the word gender because a lot of people hear the word gender and they think it means women
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 79.4 88.24 <o,f0,male> so they think that gender issues is synonymous with women 's issues there 's some confusion about the term gender and actually let me illustrate that confusion by way of analogy
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 88.24 93.9 <o,f0,male> so let 's talk for a moment about race in the u s when we hear the word race a lot of people think that means african american
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 100.08 104.7 <o,f0,male> a lot of people when they hear the word sexual orientation think it means gay lesbian
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 104.7 121.47 <o,f0,male> bisexual and a lot of people when they hear the word gender think it means women in each case the dominant group doesn 't get paid attention to right as if white people don 't have some sort of racial identity or belong to some racial category or construct as if heterosexual people don 't have a sexual orientation
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 121.47 123.77 <o,f0,male> as if men don 't have a gender
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 123.77 138.32 <o,f0,male> this is one of the ways that dominant systems maintain and reproduce themselves which is to say the dominant group is rarely challenged to even think about its dominance because that 's one of the key characteristics of power and privilege the ability to go unexamined lacking introspection
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 138.32 155.11 <o,f0,male> in fact being rendered invisible in large measure in the discourse about issues that are primarily about us and this is amazing how this works in domestic and sexual violence how men have been largely erased from so much of the conversation about a subject that is centrally about men
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 155.11 159.09 <o,f0,male> and i 'm going to illustrate what i 'm talking about by using the old tech i 'm
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 176.19 192.14 <o,f0,male> conspires to keep our attention off of men this is about domestic violence in particular but you can plug in other analogues this comes from the work of the feminist linguist julia penelope it starts with a very basic english sentence john beat
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 202.98 208.4 <o,f0,female> mary was beaten by john
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 209.32 218.37 <o,f0,male> and now a whole lot has happened in one sentence we 've gone from john beat mary to mary was beaten by john we 've shifted our focus in one sentence from john
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 218.58 228.52 <o,f0,male> to mary and you can see john is very close to the end of the sentence well close to dropping off the map of our psychic plain the third sentence john is dropped and we have mary
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 228.52 242.72 <o,f0,male> was beaten and now it 's all about mary we 're not even thinking about john it 's totally focused on mary over the past generation the term we 've used synonymous with beaten is battered so we have mary was battered
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 242.72 253.68 <o,f0,male> and the final sentence in this sequence flowing from the others is mary is a battered woman so now mary 's very identity mary is a battered
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 253.68 257.56 <o,f0,female> woman
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 257.56 272.53 <o,f0,male> is what was done to her by john in the first instance but we 've demonstrated that john has long ago left the conversation now those of us who work in the domestic and sexual violence field know that victim blaming is pervasive in this realm which is to say blaming the person to whom something was done rather than the person who did it
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 272.53 283.08 <o,f0,male> and we say things like why do these women go out with these men why are they attracted to these men why do they keep going back what was she wearing at that party what a stupid thing to do why was she drinking with that group of guys in that hotel room
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 311.74 316.8 <o,f0,male> not about mary they 're about john the questions include things like why does john beat mary
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 316.8 329.81 <o,f0,male> why is domestic violence still a big problem in the united states and all over the world what 's going on why do so many men abuse physically emotionally verbally and other ways the women and girls and the men and boys that they claim to love what 's going on with men
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 330.41 341.03 <o,f0,male> why do so many adult men sexually abuse little girls and little boys why is that a common problem in our society and all over the world today why do we hear over and over again about new
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 341.03 354.87 <o,f0,male> scandals erupting in major institutions like the catholic church or the penn state football program or the boy scouts of america on and on and on and then local communities all over the country and all over the world right we hear about it all the time the sexual abuse of children
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 355.09 365.02 <o,f0,male> what 's going on with men why do so many men rape women in our society and around the world why do so many men rape other men what is going on with men and then what
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 365.02 383.94 <o,f0,male> is the role of the various institutions in our society that are helping to produce abusive men at pandemic rates because this isn 't about individual perpetrators that 's a naive way to understanding what is a much deeper and more systematic social problem you know the perpetrators aren 't these monsters who crawl out of the swamp and come into town and do their nasty
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 383.94 386.2 <o,f0,male> business and then retreat into the darkness
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 386.2 388.53 <o,f0,male> that 's a very naive notion right
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 388.53 399.8 <o,f0,male> perpetrators are much more normal than that and everyday than that so the question is what are we doing here in our society and in the world what are the roles of various institutions in helping to produce
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 399.8 411.52 <o,f0,male> abusive men what 's the role of religious belief systems the sports culture the pornography culture the family structure economics and how that intersects and race and ethnicity and how that intersects how does all this work
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 411.52 430.68 <o,f0,male> and then once we start making those kinds of connections and asking those important and big questions then we can talk about how we can be transformative in other words how can we do something differently how can we change the practices how can we change the socialization of boys and the definitions of manhood that lead to these current outcomes these are the kind of questions
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 493.29 499.43 <o,f0,male> that sometimes women can 't say or better yet we can be heard saying some things that women often can 't be heard saying
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 499.43 511.18 <o,f0,male> now i appreciate that that 's a problem it 's sexism but it 's the truth and so one of the things that i say to men and my colleagues and i always say this is we need more men who have the courage and the strength to start standing up and saying some of this stuff
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 511.18 528.59 <o,f0,male> and standing with women and not against them and pretending that somehow this is a battle between the sexes and other kinds of nonsense we live in the world together and by the way one of the things that really bothers me about some of the rhetoric against feminists and others who have built the battered women 's and rape crisis movements around the world
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 528.59 536.76 <o,f0,male> is that somehow like i said that they 're anti male what about all the boys who are profoundly affected in a negative way by what some adult man is doing against their mother
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 536.76 538.76 <o,f0,male> themselves their sisters
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 538.76 558.55 <o,f0,male> what about all those boys what about all the young men and boys who have been traumatized by adult men 's violence you know what the same system that produces men who abuse women produces men who abuse other men and if we want to talk about male victims let 's talk about male victims most male victims of violence are the victims of other men 's violence so that 's something that both women and men have in common
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 558.55 578.23 <o,f0,male> we are both victims of men 's violence so we have it in our direct self interest not to mention the fact that most men that i know have women and girls that we care deeply about in our families and our friendship circles and every other way so there 's so many reasons why we need men to speak out it seems obvious saying it out loud doesn 't it now
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 578.53 593.22 <o,f0,male> the nature of the work that i do and my colleagues do in the sports culture and the u s military in schools we pioneered this approach called the bystander approach to gender violence prevention and i just want to give you the highlights of the bystander approach because it 's a big
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 602.82 611.31 <o,f0,male> women as perpetrators men as victims or any combination in there i 'm using the gender binary i know there 's more than men and women there 's more than male and female
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 611.31 624.72 <o,f0,male> and there are women who are perpetrators and of course there are men who are victims there 's a whole spectrum but instead of seeing it in the binary fashion we focus on all of us as what we call bystanders and a bystander is defined as anybody who is not
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 624.95 627.69 <o,f0,male> a perpetrator or a victim in a given situation
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 627.69 632.94 <o,f0,male> so in other words friends teammates colleagues coworkers family members those of us who are
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 632.94 647.96 <o,f0,male> not directly involved in a dyad of abuse but we are embedded in social family work school and other peer culture relationships with people who might be in that situation what do we do how do we speak up how do we challenge our friends how do we support our friends but how do we not
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 647.96 656.42 <o,f0,male> remain silent in the face of abuse now when it comes to men and male culture the goal is to get men who are not abusive to challenge men who are
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 656.42 670.04 <o,f0,male> and when i say abusive i don 't mean just men who are beating women we 're not just saying a man whose friend is abusing his girlfriend needs to stop the guy at the moment of attack that 's a naive way of creating a
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 670.29 687.5 <o,f0,male> social change it 's along a continuum we 're trying to get men to interrupt each other so for example if you 're a guy and you 're in a group of guys playing poker talking hanging out no women present and another guy says something sexist or degrading or harassing about women
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 687.5 704.41 <o,f0,male> instead of laughing along or pretending you didn 't hear it we need men to say hey that 's not funny you know that could be my sister you 're talking about and could you joke about something else or could you talk about something else i don 't appreciate that kind of talk just like if you 're a white person and another white person makes a racist comment you 'd hope i hope
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 704.56 712.54 <o,f0,male> that white people would interrupt that racist enactment by a fellow white person just like with heterosexism if you 're a heterosexual person and you
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 727.24 739.09 <o,f0,male> to interrupt that process and to speak up and to create a peer culture climate where the abusive behavior will be seen as unacceptable not just because it 's illegal but because it 's wrong and unacceptable in the peer culture
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 749.51 753.36 <o,f0,male> will lose status as a result of it guess what we 'll see a radical
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 753.36 759.57 <o,f0,male> diminution of the abuse because the typical perpetrator is not sick and twisted he 's a normal guy in every other way
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 759.57 761.71 <o,f0,male> isn 't he now
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 761.71 767.35 <o,f0,male> among the many great things that martin luther king said in his short life was in the end what will hurt the most
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 767.35 782.22 <o,f0,male> is not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends in the end what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends there 's been an awful lot of silence in male culture about this ongoing tragedy of men 's violence against women and children hasn 't there
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 789.34 792.38 <o,f0,male> now it 's easier said than done
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 792.59 800.27 <o,f0,male> because i 'm saying it now but i 'm telling you it 's not easy in male culture for guys to challenge each other which is one of the reasons why
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 800.27 815.61 <o,f0,male> part of the paradigm shift that has to happen is not just understanding these issues as men 's issues but they 're also leadership issues for men because ultimately the responsibility for taking a stand on these issues should not fall on the shoulders of little boys or teenage boys in high school or
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 826.86 833.33 <o,f0,male> he or she is being a leader really right but on a big scale we need more adult men with
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 833.33 841.41 <o,f0,male> power to start prioritizing these issues and we haven 't seen that yet have we now i was at a dinner a number of years ago
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 841.61 847.74 <o,f0,male> and i work extensively with the u s military all the services and i was at this dinner and this woman said to me
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 847.74 854.98 <o,f0,male> i think she thought she was a little clever she said so how long have you been doing sensitivity training with the marines
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 854.98 865.74 <o,f0,male> and i said with all due respect i don 't do sensitivity training with the marines i run a leadership program in the marine corps now i know it 's a bit pompous my response but
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 865.74 878.83 <o,f0,male> it 's an important distinction because i don 't believe that what we need is sensitivity training we need leadership training because for example when a professional coach or a manager of a baseball team or a football team and i work extensively in that realm as well
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 878.83 883.72 <o,f0,male> makes a sexist comment makes a homophobic statement makes a racist comment
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 894.69 904.5 <o,f0,male> my argument is he doesn 't need sensitivity training he needs leadership training because he 's being a bad leader because in a society with gender diversity and sexual diversity
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 928.84 932.83 <o,f0,male> we know so much about how to prevent domestic and sexual violence right
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 932.83 946.43 <o,f0,male> there 's no excuse for a college or university to not have domestic and sexual violence prevention training mandated for all student athletes coaches administrators as part of their educational process we know enough to know that we can easily do that
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 946.43 965.21 <o,f0,male> but you know what 's missing the leadership but it 's not the leadership of student athletes it 's the leadership of the athletic director the president of the university the people in charge who make decisions about resources and who make decisions about priorities in the institutional settings that 's a failure in most cases of men 's leadership look at penn state penn state
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 965.21 976.96 <o,f0,male> is the mother of all teachable moments for the bystander approach you had so many situations in that realm where men in powerful positions failed to act to protect children in this case boys
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 976.96 986.89 <o,f0,male> it 's unbelievable really but when you get into it you realize there are pressures on men there are constraints within peer cultures on men which is why we need to encourage men
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 987.1 1002.37 <o,f0,male> to break through those pressures and one of the ways to do that is to say there 's an awful lot of men who care deeply about these issues i know this i work with men and i 've been working with tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of men for many many decades now it 's scary when you think about it how many years but
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 1002.37 1007.6 <o,f0,male> there 's so many men who care deeply about these issues but caring deeply is not enough
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 1007.61 1011.99 <o,f0,male> we need more men with the guts with the courage with the strength
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 1011.99 1019.88 <o,f0,male> with the moral integrity to break our complicit silence and challenge each other and stand with women and not against them
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 1019.88 1037.56 <o,f0,male> by the way we owe it to women there 's no question about it but we also owe it to our sons we also owe it to young men who are growing up all over the world in situations where they didn 't make the choice to be a man in a culture that tells them that manhood is a certain way they didn 't make the choice we that have a choice
JacksonKatz_2012X 1 JacksonKatz_2012X 1037.6 1052.67 <o,f0,male> have an opportunity and a responsibility to them as well i hope that going forward men and women working together can begin the change and the transformation that will happen so that future generations won 't have the level of tragedy that we deal with on a daily basis i know we can do it
