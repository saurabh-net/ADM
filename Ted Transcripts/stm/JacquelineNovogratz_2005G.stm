JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 35.07 43.35 <o,f0,female> one day in ninth grade when i was standing with a number of the football players and my body had clearly changed and matt mussolina who was
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 44.29 55.51 <o,f0,female> undeniably my nemesis in high school said in a booming voice that we no longer had to go far away to go on ski trips but we could all ski on mount novogratz and
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 56.28 67.79 <o,f0,female> so humiliated and mortified that i immediately ran home to my mother and chastised her for ever letting me wear the hideous sweater we drove to the goodwill and we threw the sweater away somewhat ceremoniously
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 68.19 76.80 <o,f0,female> my idea being that i would never have to think about the sweater nor see it ever again fast forward eleven years later i'm a twenty five year old kid

JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 90.50 98.22 <o,f0,female> and i'm thinking no this is not possible but so curious i run up to the child of course scaring the living bejesus out of him
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 106.79 120.76 <o,f0,female> and continues to serve as a metaphor to me about the level of connectedness that we all have on this earth we so often don't realize what our action and our inaction does to people we think we will never see and never
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 121.60 131.23 <o,f0,female> i also tell it because it tells a larger contextual story of what aid is and can be that this traveled into the goodwill in virginia
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 131.67 145.83 <o,f0,female> and moved its way into the larger industry which at that point was giving millions of tons of secondhand clothing to africa and asia which was a very good thing providing low cost clothing and at the same time certainly in rwanda it destroyed the local retailing industry
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 146.27 155.59 <o,f0,female> not to say that it shouldn 't have but that we have to get better at answering the questions that need to be considered when we think about consequences and responses
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 164.09 173.26 <o,f0,female> unwed mothers we were called the bad news bears and our notion was we were going to corner the snack food business in kigali which was not hard because there were no snacks before us
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 173.68 184.87 <o,f0,female> and because we had a good business model we actually did it and i watched these women transform on a micro level but at the same time i started a micro finance bank and tomorrow iqbal quadir is going to talk about grameen which is

JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 246.43 258.52 <o,f0,female> the banking institution lasted in fact it became the largest rehabilitation lender in the country the bakery was completely wiped out but the lessons for me were that accountability counts
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 259.08 267.61 <o,f0,female> got to build things with people on the ground using business models where as steven levitt would say the incentives matter understand however complex we
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 268.73 277.41 <o,f0,female> incentives matter so when chris raised to me how wonderful everything that was happening in the world that we were seeing a shift in zeitgeist

JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 307.95 316.11 <o,f0,female> as the victory as more than chapter one as our moral absolution and in fact what we need to do is see that as chapter one
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 323.65 332.00 <o,f0,female> and if you remember one thing from what i want to talk about today it's that the only way to end poverty to make it history is to build

JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 398.35 409.99 <o,f0,female> where we typically work there's people making between one and three dollars a day who are these people they are farmers and factory workers they're working in government offices they're drivers they
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 425.42 432.40 <o,f0,female> the poor also are willing to make and do make smart decisions if you give them that opportunity so two examples
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 432.86 441.70 <o,f0,female> one is in india where there are two hundred and forty million farmers most of whom make less than two dollars a day where we work in aurangabad the land is extraordinarily parched
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 442.22 456.54 <o,f0,female> you see people on average making sixty cents to a dollar this guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named ami tabar what he did was see what was happening in israel larger approaches and figure out how to do a drip irrigation which is a way
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 457.21 466.20 <o,f0,female> of bringing water directly to the plant stock but previously it's only been created for large scale farms so ami tabar took this and modularized it down to
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 468.37 474.23 <o,f0,female> a couple of principles build small make it infinitely expandable and affordable to the poor

JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 506.96 517.91 <o,f0,female> i truly believe you can't talk about poverty today without talking about malaria bed nets and i again give jeffrey sachs of harvard huge kudos for bringing to the world this notion
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 518.46 531.30 <o,f0,female> of his rage for five dollars you can save a life malaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year three hundred to five hundred million cases are reported it's estimated that africa loses about thirteen billion dollars a year to the disease
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 540.35 553.23 <o,f0,female> the question though is not why can't we the question is how can we help africans do this for themselves a lot of hurdles one production is too low two price is too high three
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 553.85 567.84 <o,f0,female> this is a good road in right near where our factory is located distribution is a nightmare but not impossible we started by making a three hundred and fifty thousand dollar loan to the largest traditional bed net manufacturer in africa so that they could

JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 596.22 607.62 <o,f0,female> so the production side is working on the distribution side though as a world we have a lot of work to do right now ninety five percent of these nets are being bought by the u n and then given primarily to people
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 614.80 625.65 <o,f0,female> people their women and so i want you to meet jacqueline my namesake twenty one years old if she were born anywhere else but tanzania i'm telling you she could run wall street she runs two of the lines
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 645.36 655.66 <o,f0,female> and find a way for the women themselves to go out and sell these nets to others she quickly started calculating what she herself could make and signed up we
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 677.26 683.67 <o,f0,female> not coming in with our own notions because she didn't even talk about malaria until the very end first she talked about comfort status beauty
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 684.11 692.74 <o,f0,female> these nets she said you put them on the floor bugs leave your house children can sleep through the night the house looks beautiful you hang them in the window and we've started making curtains
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 693.34 700.24 <o,f0,female> and not only is it beautiful but people can see status that you care about your children only then did she talk about saving your
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 700.93 708.88 <o,f0,female> children 's lives a lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sell goods and services to the poor
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 709.98 717.87 <o,f0,female> i want to end just by saying that there's enormous opportunity to make poverty history to do it right
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 718.05 727.79 <o,f0,female> we have to build business models that matter that are scaleable and that work with africans indians people all over the developing world who fit in this category
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 728.21 740.79 <o,f0,female> to do it themselves because at the end of the day it's about engagement it's about understanding that people really don't want handouts that they want to make their own decisions they want to solve their own problems and that by engaging with them
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 741.26 751.76 <o,f0,female> not only do we create much more dignity for them but for us as well and so i urge all of you to think next time as to how to engage with this notion
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2005G 752.52 765.91 <o,f0,female> and this opportunity that we all have to make poverty history by really becoming part of the process and moving away from an us and them world and realizing that it's about all of us and the kind of world that we together want to live in and share thank you
