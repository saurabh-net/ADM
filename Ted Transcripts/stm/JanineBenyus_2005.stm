JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 15.42 22.59 <o,f0,female> it is a thrill to be here at a conference that's devoted to inspired by nature you can imagine
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 24.02 31.80 <o,f0,female> and i'm also thrilled to be in the foreplay section did you notice this section is foreplay because i get to talk about
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 33.03 51.63 <o,f0,female> critters which is the western grebe you haven't lived until you've seen these guys do their courtship dance i was on bowman lake in glacier national park which is a long skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it and my partner and i have a rowing shell and so we were rowing
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 52.85 60.74 <o,f0,female> and one of these western grebes came along and what they do for their courtship dance is they go together the two of them
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 61.15 70.71 <o,f0,female> the two mates and they begin to run underwater they paddle faster and faster and faster until they're going so fast that they literally lift up
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 71.09 75.27 <o,f0,female> out of the water and they're standing upright sort of paddling the top of the water
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 77.24 87.61 <o,f0,female> and one of these grebes came along while we were rowing and so we're in a skull and we're moving really really quickly and this grebe i think sort of
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 88.53 99.00 <o,f0,female> mistaked us for a prospect and started to run along the water next to us in a courtship dance for
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 99.94 107.57 <o,f0,female> miles it would stop and then start and then stop and then start now that is foreplay
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 112.03 117.32 <o,f0,female> i almost i came this close to changing species at that moment
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 132.89 140.54 <o,f0,female> and in design what's happened since the book came out the book was mainly about research in biomimicry and what's happened since then
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 161.54 175.41 <o,f0,female> the champion adapters in the natural world who might inspire us so this is a picture from a galapagos trip that we took with some wastewater treatment engineers they purify wastewater and some of them were very resistant actually to being there
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 176.05 183.56 <o,f0,female> they said to us at first was you know we already do biomimicry we use bacteria to clean our water
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 194.01 202.84 <o,f0,female> an organism to do your wastewater treatment is an old old technology called domestication this is
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 216.10 226.56 <o,f0,female> big problems give me a design challenge sustainability speed bump that's keeping you from being sustainable and they said scaling which is the build up of minerals inside of pipes
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 227.32 236.91 <o,f0,female> and they said you know what happens is mineral just like at your house mineral builds up and then the aperture closes and we have to flush the pipes with toxins or we have to dig them up
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 237.84 249.21 <o,f0,female> so if we had some way to stop this scaling and so i picked up some shells on the beach and i asked them what is scaling what's inside your pipes and they said calcium carbonate
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 250.21 254.37 <o,f0,female> and i said that's what this is this is calcium carbonate
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 264.46 271.83 <o,f0,female> ok to create a shell so the same sort of a process without the proteins is happening on the inside of their pipes they didn't know
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 272.33 285.01 <o,f0,female> this is not for lack of information it's a lack of integration you know it's a silo people in silos they didn't know that the same thing was happening so one of them thought about it and said
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 285.94 297.63 <o,f0,female> well if this is just crystallization that happens automatically out of seawater self assembly then why aren't shells infinite in size what stops the
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 298.65 302.33 <o,f0,female> why don't they just keep on going and i said well in the same way
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 302.85 310.62 <o,f0,female> that they let go of pro that they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization and then they all sort of leaned in
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 323.08 330.04 <o,f0,female> that protein that stop protein and it's an environmentally friendly way to stop scaling in pipes
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 330.60 337.83 <o,f0,female> that changed everything from then on you could not get these engineers back in the boat
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 338.83 349.27 <o,f0,female> first day they would take a hike and it was click click click click five minutes later they were back in the boat we're done you know i've seen that island after this
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 371.09 378.91 <o,f0,female> about the natural world is one thing learning from the natural world that's the switch that's the profound switch
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 379.88 389.49 <o,f0,female> they realized was that the answers to their questions are everywhere they just needed to change the lenses with which they saw the world three point eight billion
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 390.14 397.53 <o,f0,female> years of field testing ten to thirty craig venter will probably tell you i think there's a lot more than thirty million well adapted
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 413.98 422.17 <o,f0,female> so it's the conscious emulation of life 's genius it's not slavishly mimicking although al is trying to get the hairdo going
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 422.55 429.12 <o,f0,female> it's not a slavish mimicry it's taking the design principles the genius of the natural world
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 429.78 443.53 <o,f0,female> and learning something from it now in a group with so many it people i do have to mention that one i'm not going to talk about and that is that your field is one that has learned an enormous amount from living things on the software side
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 444.02 451.80 <o,f0,female> so there's computers that protect themselves like an immune system and we're learning from gene regulation and biological development
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 452.17 458.88 <o,f0,female> we're learning from neural nets genetic algorithms evolutionary computing that's on the software
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 460.62 464.01 <o,f0,female> what's interesting to me is that we haven't looked at this
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 464.58 472.55 <o,f0,female> as much i mean these machines are really not very high tech in my estimation in the sense that
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 481.14 490.19 <o,f0,female> is not at all up to snuff in terms of what life would call a success so what can we learn about making not just computers but everything
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 492.04 497.58 <o,f0,female> the plane you came in cars the seats that you're sitting on how do we redesign
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 499.11 502.24 <o,f0,female> the world that we make the human made world
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 512.99 514.35 <o,f0,female> me are key
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 515.15 516.59 <o,f0,female> how does life make things
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 517.20 528.79 <o,f0,female> this is the opposite this is how we make things it's called heat beat and treat that's what material scientists call it and it's carving things down from the top with ninety six percent waste left over
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 548.58 552.16 <o,f0,female> its shape is what gives it the function of being able to
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 561.66 566.82 <o,f0,female> in other words structure it gives it information by adding information to matter
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 574.53 576.11 <o,f0,female> and thirdly how does life
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 577.32 580.53 <o,f0,female> make things disappear into systems because life
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 581.61 584.22 <o,f0,female> doesn't really deal in things
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 585.28 590.62 <o,f0,female> things in the natural world divorced from their systems
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 594.17 595.40 <o,f0,female> i'm reading more and more now
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 603.84 613.72 <o,f0,female> at the same time i'm listening to a lot of businesses and finding what their sort of grand challenges are the two groups are not talking to each other at all
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 624.87 627.29 <o,f0,female> try to go through twelve really quickly
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 627.53 629.78 <o,f0,female> ok one that's exciting to me is self assembly
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 630.89 638.46 <o,f0,female> heard about this in terms of nanotechnology back to that shell the shell is a self assembling material
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 638.70 647.20 <o,f0,female> on the lower left there is a picture of mother of pearl forming out of sea water it's a layered structure that's mineral and then polymer
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 647.97 652.41 <o,f0,female> and it makes it very very tough it's twice as tough as our high tech ceramics
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 652.99 658.24 <o,f0,female> but what's really interesting unlike our ceramics that are in kilns it happens in sea water
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 661.92 676.29 <o,f0,female> ok people are starting this is sandia national labs a guy named jeff brinker has found a way to have a self assembling coding process imagine being able to make ceramics at room temperature
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 676.80 679.82 <o,f0,female> by simply dipping something into a liquid
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 685.09 692.49 <o,f0,female> the molecules in the liquid together so that they jigsaw together in the same way as this crystallization works
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 699.45 707.53 <o,f0,female> precursors to a pv cell to a solar cell onto a roof and having it self assemble into a layered structure that harvests light
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 708.55 711.04 <o,f0,female> here 's an interesting one for the it world
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 711.96 713.30 <o,f0,female> bio silicon
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 713.97 727.70 <o,f0,female> this is a diatom which is made of silicates and so silicon which we make right now it's part of our carcinogenic problem in the manufacture of our chips this is a bio mineralization process that's now being mimicked
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 735.93 742.32 <o,f0,female> imagine being able to and again it's a templated process and it solidifies out of a liquid
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 757.18 769.10 <o,f0,female> the people at lucent technologies have found have no distortion whatsoever it's one of the most distortion free lenses we know of and there's many of them all over its entire body what's interesting again
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 769.46 773.20 <o,f0,female> is that it self assembles a woman named joanna aizenberg at lucent
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 774.44 782.01 <o,f0,female> now learning to do this in a low temperature process to create these sort of lenses she's also looking at fiber optics
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 782.53 791.50 <o,f0,female> that's a sea sponge that has a fiber optic down at the very base of it there's fiber optics that work better than ours actually to move light
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 791.95 800.13 <o,f0,female> but you can tie them in a knot they're incredibly flexible here 's another big idea co two as a feedstock
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 801.01 813.26 <o,f0,female> guy named geoff coates at cornell said to himself you know plants do not see co two as the biggest poison of our time we see it that way plants are busy making long chains of starches and glucose
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 815.52 826.24 <o,f0,female> out of co two he 's found a way he 's found a catalyst and he 's found a way to take co two and make it into polycarbonates biodegradable plastics out of co two how plant like
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 826.74 840.99 <o,f0,female> solar transformations the most exciting one there are people who are mimicking the energy harvesting device inside of purple bacterium the people at asu even more interesting lately in the last couple of weeks people have seen that
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 851.92 862.27 <o,f0,female> in a fuel cell in the anode of a fuel cell and in a reversible fuel cell in our fuel cells we do it with platinum life does it with a very very common
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 864.15 870.00 <o,f0,female> a team has now just been able to mimic that hydrogen juggling
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 872.27 879.18 <o,f0,female> that's very exciting for fuel cells to be able to do that without platinum power of shape here 's a
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 880.16 887.51 <o,f0,female> we've seen that the fins of this whale have tubercles on them and those little bumps actually increase
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 889.83 895.19 <o,f0,female> in for instance the edge of an airplane increase efficiency by about thirty two percent
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 906.62 915.39 <o,f0,female> light comes through it bounces back off the layers it's called thin film interference imagine being able to self assemble products with the last few layers
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 927.16 936.48 <o,f0,female> with just water that's what a leaf does see that up close picture it's a ball of water and those are dirt particles and that's an up close picture of a lotus leaf
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 936.87 945.60 <o,f0,female> there's a company making a product called lotusan which mimics when the building facade paint dries it mimics
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 945.69 949.61 <o,f0,female> the bumps in a self cleaning leaf and rainwater cleans the
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 955.80 958.29 <o,f0,female> our big grand challenge quenching
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 959.28 968.77 <o,f0,female> here are two organisms that pull water the one on the left is the namibian beetle pulling water out of fog the one on the right is a pill bug pulls water out of
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 969.95 972.17 <o,f0,female> does not drink fresh water
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 972.61 976.23 <o,f0,female> pulling water out of monterey fog and out of
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 977.47 981.66 <o,f0,female> the sweaty air in atlanta before it gets into a building
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 982.04 988.20 <o,f0,female> key technologies separation technologies are going to be extremely important what if we were to say
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 988.33 989.77 <o,f0,female> no more hard rock mining
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 991.98 995.42 <o,f0,female> what if we were to separate out metals
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 996.45 1001.25 <o,f0,female> from waste streams small amounts of metals in water that's what microbes do
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1024.92 1027.68 <o,f0,female> and the silk being formed from a spider isn't that beautiful
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1035.09 1036.01 <o,f0,female> 's recipe book
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1038.98 1042.32 <o,f0,female> because life uses only a subset
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1047.67 1049.29 <o,f0,female> even the toxic ones
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1049.39 1054.36 <o,f0,female> to figure out the elegant recipes that would take the small subset
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1054.44 1056.87 <o,f0,female> of the periodic table and create
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1060.97 1062.53 <o,f0,female> the task of green chemistry
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1063.11 1064.39 <o,f0,female> timed degradation
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1065.21 1069.77 <o,f0,female> packaging that is good until you don't want it to be good any more and dissolves on cue
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1070.59 1072.92 <o,f0,female> that's a mussel you can find in the waters out here
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1073.57 1078.74 <o,f0,female> threads holding it to a rock are timed at exactly two years they begin to dissolve
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1082.94 1083.91 <o,f0,female> that little guy over there
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1090.69 1094.62 <o,f0,female> around the world not getting to patients and the reason is that
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1095.60 1101.69 <o,f0,female> the refrigeration somehow gets broken what's called the cold chain gets broken a guy named bruce rosner
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1107.69 1109.42 <o,f0,female> stays alive for
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1109.76 1115.57 <o,f0,female> and months and months and is able to regenerate itself and he found a way to dry out vaccines
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1116.20 1121.68 <o,f0,female> encase them in the same sort of sugar capsules as the tardigrade has within its cells
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1132.68 1139.01 <o,f0,female> from organisms this is a session about water learning about organisms that can do without water
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1142.82 1145.16 <o,f0,female> and lasts and lasts without refrigeration
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1146.89 1147.94 <o,f0,female> not going to get to twelve
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1150.65 1155.71 <o,f0,female> but what i am going to do is tell you that the most important thing besides all of these adaptations
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1156.18 1158.19 <o,f0,female> is the fact that these organisms
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1159.10 1160.81 <o,f0,female> have figured out a way
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1161.46 1163.66 <o,f0,female> to do the amazing things they do
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1164.25 1166.60 <o,f0,female> while taking care of the place
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1167.32 1169.50 <o,f0,female> going to take care of their offspring
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1171.76 1174.17 <o,f0,female> when they're involved in foreplay
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1178.35 1180.10 <o,f0,female> having their genetic material
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1186.40 1191.12 <o,f0,female> and that means finding a way to do what they do without destroying the place that'll take care
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1197.84 1200.70 <o,f0,female> there are millions and millions of geniuses
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1222.69 1223.55 <o,f0,male> talk about
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1238.26 1245.45 <o,f0,female> this thing ok great ok so that's the healing one sensing and responding
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1245.70 1258.09 <o,f0,female> feedback is a huge thing this is a locust there can be eighty million of them in a square kilometer and yet they don't collide with one another and yet we have three point six million car collisions a year
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1263.31 1269.74 <o,f0,female> there's a person at newcastle who has figured out that it's a very large neuron and she's actually
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1282.09 1291.73 <o,f0,female> that means you know net fertility farming we should be growing fertility and oh yes we get food too because we have to grow
JanineBenyus_2005 1 JanineBenyus_2005 1306.30 1315.81 <o,f0,female> has done the opposite so farming based on how a prairie builds soil ranching based on how a native ungulate herd
