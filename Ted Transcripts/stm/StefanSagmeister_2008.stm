StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 13.24 22.10 <o,f0,male> about four years ago talking about the relationship of design and happiness at the very end of it
StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 22.58 23.96 <o,f0,male> i showed a list
StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 24.88 25.80 <o,f0,male> under that title
StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 29.52 30.81 <o,f0,male> very few things
StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 31.34 34.60 <o,f0,male> in addition since but
StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 36.38 46.99 <o,f0,male> made a whole number of them into projects since these are inflatable monkeys in every city in scotland everybody always
StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 63.92 66.01 <o,f0,male> become a drag later on
StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 68.54 68.96 <o,f0,male> doing
StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 69.93 83.13 <o,f0,male> changing media this is a projection that can see the viewer as the viewer walks by you can't help but actually ripping that spider web apart
StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 92.06 105.60 <o,f0,male> i would never have the money to actually pay for the installment or pay for all the billboards or the production of these so there's always a client attached to them
StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 106.71 113.16 <o,f0,male> sixty five thousand coat hangers in a street that's lined with fashion stores
StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 115.82 117.20 <o,f0,male> worrying solves nothing
StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 119.41 129.39 <o,f0,male> money does not make me happy appeared first as double page spreads in a magazine the printer lost the file didn't tell us
StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 129.84 140.21 <o,f0,male> when the magazine actually when i got the subscription it was twelve following pages it said money does does make me happy and a friend of mine in austria was so
StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 140.68 146.25 <o,f0,male> felt so sorry for me that he talked the largest casino owner
StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 146.73 158.04 <o,f0,male> in linz into letting us wrap his building so this is the big pedestrian zone in linz and it just says money and if you look down the side street it says does not make me happy
StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 161.18 168.03 <o,f0,male> we had a show just came down last week in new york we steamed up the windows permanently
StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 168.35 177.96 <o,f0,male> and every hour we had a different designer come in and write these things that they've learned into the steam in the window everybody participated milton glaser
StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 188.90 197.05 <o,f0,male> little spot that we filmed there that's to be displayed on the large jumbotrons in singapore
StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 199.99 207.51 <o,f0,male> and of course one that's dear to my heart because all of these sentiments some banal some a bit more profound
StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 208.16 210.17 <o,f0,male> all originally had come out of my
StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 223.81 226.76 <o,f0,male> and i do go often into the diary and check
StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 232.32 233.62 <o,f0,male> for a long enough time
StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 235.94 236.85 <o,f0,male> something about it
StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 239.94 242.46 <o,f0,male> very last one is a
StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 245.01 253.97 <o,f0,male> this is our roof in new york the roof of the studio this is newsprint plus stencils that lie on the newsprint we let that
StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 254.51 262.52 <o,f0,male> around in the sun as you all know newsprint yellows significantly in the sun after a week we took the stencils and the leaves off shipped
StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 264.80 277.19 <o,f0,male> to a very sunny spot so on day one the billboard said complaining is silly either act or forget three days later it faded and a week later no more complaining anywhere
StefanSagmeister_2008 1 StefanSagmeister_2008 278.30 279.24 <o,f0,male> thank you so much
