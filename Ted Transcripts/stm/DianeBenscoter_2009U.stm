DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 18.62 21.42 <o,f0,female> my journey to coming here today
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 27.27 35.30 <o,f0,female> i was seventeen and going on a peace walk what i didn't know though was most of those people standing there with me were moonies
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 36.79 37.13 <o,f0,female> and
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 40.53 42.81 <o,f0,female> a week i had come to believe
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 43.69 51.65 <o,f0,female> that the second coming of christ had occurred that it was sun myung moon and that i had been specially chosen and prepared by god
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 54.65 58.39 <o,f0,female> now as cool as that sounds my family was not that thrilled with this
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 60.60 69.69 <o,f0,female> and they tried everything they could to get me out of there there was an underground railroad of sorts that was going on during those years maybe some of you remember it they were called deprogrammers
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 70.77 74.16 <o,f0,female> and after about
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 74.97 82.90 <o,f0,female> five long years my family had me deprogrammed and i then became a deprogrammer
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 83.51 91.77 <o,f0,female> i started going out on cases and after about five years of doing i was arrested for kidnapping
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 93.55 102.69 <o,f0,female> most of the cases i went out on were called involuntary what happened was that the family had to get their loved ones some safe place somehow
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 103.03 109.17 <o,f0,female> and so they took them to some safe place and we would come in and talk to them usually for about a week
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 110.09 121.15 <o,f0,female> and so after happened i decided it was a good time to turn my back on this work and about twenty years went by
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 134.14 137.62 <o,f0,female> and so i decided to write a book a memoir about this decade of my life
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 139.96 141.27 <o,f0,female> and toward the end of writing that
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 141.40 144.98 <o,f0,female> book there was a documentary that came out it was on jonestown
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 145.84 147.43 <o,f0,female> and it had a chilling effect
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 150.74 157.47 <o,f0,female> these are the dead in jonestown about nine hundred people died that day most of them taking their own lives
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 159.10 164.97 <o,f0,female> women gave poison to their babies and watched foam come from their mouths as they died
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 167.45 175.47 <o,f0,female> the top picture is a group of moonies that have been blessed by their messiah their mates were chosen for them
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 180.49 182.31 <o,f0,female> this is the leg of a suicide bomber
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 184.35 187.90 <o,f0,female> the thing i had to admit to myself with great repulsion
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 190.13 195.59 <o,f0,female> was that i get it i understand how this could happen i understand
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 196.23 209.42 <o,f0,female> how someone 's brain how someone 's mind can come to the place where it makes sense in fact it would be wrong when your brain is working like that not to try to save the world through genocide
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 211.91 221.43 <o,f0,female> and so what is this how does this work and how i've come to view what happened to me is a viral memetic infection
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 221.82 230.69 <o,f0,female> for those of you who aren't familiar with memetics a meme has been defined as an idea that replicates in the human brian and moves from brain to brain like a virus
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 232.26 236.03 <o,f0,female> much like a virus the way a virus works is
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 237.27 242.96 <o,f0,female> it can infect and do the most damage to someone who has a compromised immune system
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 248.57 251.88 <o,f0,female> and i was pretty lost in my world i was really idealistic
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 253.57 266.60 <o,f0,female> these easy ideas to complex questions are very appealing when you are emotionally vulnerable what happens is that circular logic takes over moon is one with
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 281.36 284.12 <o,f0,female> fix all this it becomes impenetrable
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 285.62 287.69 <o,f0,female> the most dangerous part of this
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 288.71 291.26 <o,f0,female> is that is creates us and them
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 292.11 295.37 <o,f0,female> right and wrong good and evil
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 297.61 300.72 <o,f0,female> and it makes anything possible
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 301.91 304.25 <o,f0,female> makes anything rationalizable
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 308.60 312.46 <o,f0,female> and the thing is though if you looked at my brain
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 312.97 321.73 <o,f0,female> during those years in the moonies neuroscience is expanding exponentially as ray kurzweil said yesterday science is expanding we're beginning to look inside the brain
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 322.27 334.88 <o,f0,female> and so if you looked at my brain or any brain that's infected with a viral memetic infection like this and compared it to anyone in this room or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis i am convinced it would look very very different
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 336.41 340.56 <o,f0,female> and that strange as it may sound gives me hope
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 341.92 347.88 <o,f0,female> the reason that gives me hope is that the first thing is to admit that we have a problem
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 349.18 355.49 <o,f0,female> but it's a human problem it's a scientific problem if you will it happens in the human brain there is no evil force out there to get us
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 356.41 362.55 <o,f0,female> and so this is something that through research and education i believe that we can solve
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 363.40 364.75 <o,f0,female> and so
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 367.92 370.16 <o,f0,female> is to realize
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 371.69 375.08 <o,f0,female> that we can do this together and that there is no us and them
DianeBenscoter_2009U 1 DianeBenscoter_2009U 376.03 377.10 <o,f2,female> thank you very much
