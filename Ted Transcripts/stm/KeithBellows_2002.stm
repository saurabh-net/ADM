KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 19.61 22.98 <o,f0,male> this is arguably the back end of the design of animals
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 26.85 31.24 <o,f0,male> the reason i put this up here is because when i was in africa last year
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 31.94 40.30 <o,f0,male> my wife and i were driving around we had this wonderful guide who showed us something that surprised both of us and it was very revealing in terms of the
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 48.01 57.67 <o,f0,male> to spread the word of christianity to teach english to the natives and they brought blackboards and chalk and i'd like you to imagine that that's a blackboard and i just used some chalk on there
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 58.38 65.39 <o,f0,male> and they brought quite a bit of this stuff but over the years the blackboards were fine but they ran out of chalk and
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 66.00 75.03 <o,f0,male> this is a real crisis for them and that's where the hyena comes in the hyena is probably the most perfectly designed scavenging animal
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 75.44 85.18 <o,f0,male> in the world it strip mines carcasses and it has amazing teeth because it enables the hyena to essentially eat bones now
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 85.70 94.91 <o,f0,male> the end product of that action is up on the board here and what the missionaries would do is they'd walk around
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 95.54 101.04 <o,f0,male> and they'd pick up hyena shit and the incredible thing about hyena shit is it makes great chalk
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 102.28 105.18 <o,f0,male> now that's not what i'm here to talk about but it is
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 118.51 120.04 <o,f0,male> had an amazing experience with a camel
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 128.52 130.26 <o,f0,male> we were in the desert in wadi rum
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 130.98 134.04 <o,f0,male> in a small jeep there were four of us two bedouin drivers
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 138.46 145.73 <o,f0,male> hundred and five degrees one water bottle and we were driving in what they told us was their very very best
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 147.59 154.12 <o,f0,male> didn't look like it to me and as we started to go through the desert the jeep broke down
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 165.24 174.92 <o,f0,male> desert and eventually our worst nightmare happened they flooded the engine and they said ah no problem we just get out and walk
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 180.49 182.93 <o,f0,male> walk we'll find some camels
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 204.63 212.13 <o,f0,male> and they started slashing away at the back of the camels and they started galloping and if you've ever been on a camel it is a very very uncomfortable ride
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 212.90 219.35 <o,f0,male> there's also one other aspect about these camels about every ten steps they lean back and try to take a chunk out of your leg
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 220.95 227.85 <o,f0,male> so we kept on going and this camel kept on trying to take a chunk out of my leg and eventually three miles later we arrived at
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 228.40 237.18 <o,f0,male> where a jeep was supposed to meet us and the camels come down again like elevators we sort of clumsily get off and they obviously try to take another chunk out of my leg
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 237.60 245.81 <o,f0,male> and i've developed a very wonderful relationship with this creature by this point and i've realized that this is a mean son of a bitch
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 246.24 253.20 <o,f0,male> and much meaner by the way than the bedouin who greeted me and tried to sell me one of his twenty six daughters to take back to the states
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 254.85 260.89 <o,f0,male> so as we talked richard and i i said you know maybe i should bring a camel i think the camel is the best designed animal in the world
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 269.26 272.43 <o,f0,male> i went to the washington zoo richard said
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 272.82 287.11 <o,f0,male> i want you to get up close and personal with this camel i want you to inspect its mouth look at its teeth go underneath it go above it go around it pull its tail up take a look in there i want you to get as close to that camel as you possibly can
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 287.63 290.32 <o,f0,male> so i got a national geographic film crew
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 294.01 300.61 <o,f0,male> i took one look at this camel it is a two thousand pound creature who is in
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 303.98 315.83 <o,f0,male> if you've ever seen a two thousand pound camel in a rut it is a scary scary thing to behold and if richard thought i was getting in the ring with that camel someone was smoking bedouin high
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 317.89 326.92 <o,f0,male> so we got as close to it as possible and i'm going to share this chris if you want to roll this film and then i'm going to show you a little bit more about the design of camels
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 429.90 430.98 <o,f0,male> when
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 433.64 435.42 <o,f0,male> a
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 453.90 454.36 <o,f0,male> are
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 481.49 482.18 <o,f0,male> the
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 499.08 500.61 <o,f0,male> the
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 508.13 508.80 <o,f0,male> and
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 574.16 574.66 <o,f0,male> you
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 599.43 600.09 <o,f0,male> but
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 648.59 654.12 <o,f0,male> what i didn't show you was you got that swinging thing going well
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 654.77 668.07 <o,f0,male> and you're glad i didn't show you this one of the other things about the camel 's beautiful design is that its penis points backwards that way the camel can dip its tail in the stream and just whacker the entire
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 668.51 676.90 <o,f0,male> area around him and that's how he really marks his territory now what you also didn't see was that and you may have noticed in the pen beside him
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 677.77 688.68 <o,f0,male> and by the way the camel 's name is suki in the pen beside him is jasmine jasmine has been his mater for some time but on this particular occasion it was very very clear that
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 689.32 696.09 <o,f0,male> as horny as suki was jasmine was having none of it and so we started thinking well
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 706.24 714.21 <o,f0,male> this animal truly is a sort of the suv of the of the sand the ship of the desert it's so vital to
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 717.03 725.19 <o,f0,male> the inhabitants of the areas in which the camel is found largely mongolia and sahara that there are one hundred and sixty words in arabic to describe
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 725.55 733.34 <o,f0,male> the camel and if this is a creature that was designed by committee it's certainly been no like no committee i've ever been on so
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 734.76 739.58 <o,f0,male> here 's what suki would do in search of a mate
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 918.75 926.73 <o,f0,male> you with one last thought which is probably the most important thing to take away humans the animal
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 928.03 935.16 <o,f0,male> are pretty lucky creatures because by and large we really don't have to adapt to our environment
KeithBellows_2002 1 KeithBellows_2002 935.67 944.89 <o,f0,male> we adapt our environment to us and we've seen that repeatedly through this conference not just this year but in past years but this creature that you've just seen
