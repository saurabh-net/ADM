IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 16.63 25.36 <o,f0,female> a thing about sleeping i don't sleep that much and i've come to this thing about like not sleeping much as being a great virtue after years of kind of battling it as being a terrible
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 33.49 49.07 <o,f0,female> i think that like my creativity is greatly motivated by this kind of insomnia i lie awake i think thoughts i walk aimlessly sometimes i used to walk more at night i walk during the day and i follow people who i think look interesting
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 51.19 61.51 <o,f0,female> and sometimes actually once it was on page six in the post that i was cruising this guy like sort of whatever but i was actually just following because he had these really great shoes on
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 69.11 82.43 <o,f0,female> i think a lot of my design ideas come from mistakes and tricks of the eye because i feel like you know there are so many images out there so many clothes out there
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 83.09 88.17 <o,f0,female> and the only ones that look interesting to me are the ones that look slightly mistaken of course
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 89.29 101.69 <o,f0,female> or very very surprising and often i'm driving in a taxi and i see a hole in a shirt or something that looks very interesting or pretty or functional in some way that i'd never seen happen before
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 102.02 111.10 <o,f0,female> and so i'd make the car stop and i'd get out of the car and walk and see that in fact there wasn't a hole but it was trick of my eye it was a shadow you know
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 111.44 123.40 <o,f0,female> or if there was a hole i'd think like oh damn there was actually someone thought of that thought already someone made that mistake already so i can't do it anymore i don't know where inspiration comes from it does not come
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 124.43 135.05 <o,f0,female> for me from research i don't get necessarily inspired by research as a matter of fact one of the most fun things i've ever ever done in my whole life was this christmas season at the guggenheim
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 135.34 142.01 <o,f0,female> in new york i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful band from juilliard and i did like you know the narrator and i read it
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 142.41 154.69 <o,f0,female> and i saw this really smart critic who i love this woman joan acocella who 's a friend of mine and she came backstage and she said oh you know isaac did you know that talking about stalinism and talking about you know like the thirties in russia
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 165.21 174.24 <o,f0,female> so i don't really know that i don't really actually i do my own kind of research you know if i'm commissioned to do the costumes for an eighteenth century opera or something like
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 175.16 183.60 <o,f0,female> i will do a lot of research because it's interesting not because it's because what i'm supposed to do i'm very very very inspired by movies the
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 184.24 193.94 <o,f0,female> of movies and the way light makes the colors light from behind the projection or light from the projection makes the colors look so impossible
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 194.43 202.77 <o,f0,female> and anyway roll this little clip i'll just show you i sit up at night and i watch movies and i watch women in movies a lot
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 203.11 209.95 <o,f0,female> and i think about you know their roles and about you have to like watch what your daughters look at
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 210.81 219.11 <o,f0,female> because i look at the way women are portrayed all the time whether they're kind of glorified in this way or whether they're kind of you know
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 219.76 227.65 <o,f0,female> ironically glorified or whether they 're you know sort of denigrated or ironically denigrated
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 228.21 231.23 <o,f0,female> i go back to color all the time color is something
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 232.68 239.37 <o,f0,female> motivates me a lot it's rarely color that i find in nature
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 240.21 253.15 <o,f0,female> although you know juxtaposed next to artificial color natural color is so beautiful so that's what i do i study color a lot but for the most part i think
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 254.07 266.36 <o,f0,female> like how can i ever make anything that is as beautiful as that image of natalie wood how can i ever make anything as beautiful as greta garbo i mean that's just not possible you know
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 267.83 275.51 <o,f0,female> and so that's what makes me lie awake at night i guess you know i want to show you i'm also like a big i
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 276.67 285.95 <o,f0,female> go to astrologers and tarot card readers often and that's another thing that motivates me a lot people say oh do that and astrologer tells me to do something so i do
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 287.55 288.83 <o,f0,female> when i was about
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 313.75 323.75 <o,f0,female> had this really interesting tarot reading a long time ago the last card he pulled which was representing my destiny was this guy on like a straw boater with a cane and you know sort of spats and this
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 323.88 332.67 <o,f0,female> you know a minstrel singer right i want to show you this clip because i do this kind of crazy thing where i do a cabaret act so actually check this out
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 339.82 347.29 <o,f0,female> the name of the show is based on this story that i have to tell you about my mother it's sort of an excerpt from a quote of
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 347.67 355.04 <o,f0,female> i was dating this guy right and this has to do with being happy i swear i was dating this guy and
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 356.46 364.83 <o,f0,female> it was going on for about a year right and we were getting serious so we decided to invite them all to dinner our parents and we you know sort of introduced them to each other my mother was sort of
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 366.20 368.24 <o,f0,female> very sensitive to his mother who it seemed
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 368.35 376.75 <o,f0,female> was a little bit skeptical about whole alternative lifestyle thing you know homosexuality right so my mother was a little offended she turned to her and she said
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 377.21 384.07 <o,f0,female> are you kidding they have the greatest life together they eat out they see shows they eat out they see shows

IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 407.58 411.68 <o,f0,female> it feels i don't know how to put this i feel as
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 412.80 420.99 <o,f0,female> little comfort as possible is a good thing you know and at least you know in my case because
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 421.23 430.95 <o,f0,female> if i just do one thing all the time i don't know i get very very bored i bore very easily and you know
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 434.33 442.79 <o,f0,female> say that i do everything well i just say that i do a lot of things that's all and i kind of try not to look back
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 443.08 452.68 <o,f0,female> you know except i guess that's what staying up every night is about like looking back and thinking what a fool you made of yourself you know but i guess that's okay right
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 453.95 463.14 <o,f0,female> because if you do many things you get to feel lousy about everything and not just one you know you don't master feeling lousy about one thing yeah exactly

IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 496.26 503.70 <o,f0,female> don't know where it comes from i started making puppets when i was a kid maybe that's where the whole inspiration thing started from puppets right

IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 537.22 549.66 <o,f0,female> i must say this whole thing about being slightly bored all the time that is what i think that is a very important thing for a fashion designer you always have to be slightly bored with everything and if you're not you have to pretend to be slightly
IsaacMizrahi_2008 1 IsaacMizrahi_2008 553.09 561.78 <o,f0,female> but i am really a little bored with everything i always say to my partner marissa gardini who books everything she books everything and she makes everything happen and she makes all the deals
