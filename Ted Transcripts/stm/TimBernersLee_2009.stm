TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 19.17 23.43 <o,f0,male> time flies it's actually almost twenty years ago when i
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 23.94 28.98 <o,f0,male> to reframe the way we use information the way we work together i invented the world wide web
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 30.42 35.48 <o,f0,male> now twenty years on at ted i want to ask your help in a new
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 37.72 38.28 <o,f0,male> so
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 53.79 59.48 <o,f0,male> said i could do it on the side as a sort of a play project kick the tires of a new computer we'd got
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 60.03 62.42 <o,f0,male> and so he gave me the time to code it up
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 63.26 76.49 <o,f0,male> so i basically roughed out what html should look like hypertext protocol http the idea of urls these names for things which started with http i wrote the code
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 76.85 89.91 <o,f0,male> and put it out there why did i do it well it was basically frustration i was frustrated i was working as a software engineer in this huge very exciting lab lots of people coming from all over the world
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 91.03 98.71 <o,f0,male> all sorts of different computers with them they had all sorts of different data formats all sorts all kinds of documentation systems so that
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 99.25 109.23 <o,f0,male> in all that diversity if i wanted to figure out how to build something out of a bit of this and a bit of this everything i looked into i had to connect to some new machine i had to
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 110.11 116.44 <o,f0,male> some new program i would find the information i wanted in some new data format
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 118.11 122.12 <o,f0,male> was just very frustrating the frustration was all this unlocked potential
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 122.46 129.62 <o,f0,male> in fact on all these discs there were documents so if you just imagined them all being part of some big
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 130.35 137.19 <o,f0,male> virtual documentation system in the sky say on the internet then life would be so much easier
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 137.67 149.08 <o,f0,male> well once you've had an idea like that it kind of gets under your skin and even if people don't read your memo actually he did it was found after he died his copy he had written vague but exciting in pencil in the corner
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 162.19 172.69 <o,f0,male> so things like click didn't have the same meaning i can show somebody a piece of hypertext a page which has got links and we click on the link and bing there'll be another hypertext page
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 173.26 181.95 <o,f0,male> not impressive you know we've seen that we've got things on hypertext on cd romiss what was difficult was to get them to imagine so
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 198.08 212.14 <o,f0,male> that is what has made it most fun that has been the most exciting thing not the technology not the things people have done with it but actually the community the spirit of all these people getting together sending emails that's what it was like then do you know what it's funny but
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 212.65 221.15 <o,f0,male> now it's kind of like that again i asked everybody more or less to put their documents i said could you put your documents on this web thing and
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 222.22 229.51 <o,f0,male> did thanks it's been a blast hasn't it i mean it has been quite interesting because we've found out that the things that happen with the web
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 229.76 240.43 <o,f0,male> really sort of blow us away they're much more than we'd originally imagined when we put together the initial website that we started off with now i want you to put your data on the web
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 240.93 248.43 <o,f0,male> turns out that there is still huge unlocked potential there is still a huge frustration that people have because
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 269.23 276.71 <o,f0,male> of the great yes a lot of people have seen it one of the great ted talks hans put up this presentation in which he showed
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 276.88 286.12 <o,f0,male> for various different countries in various different colors he showed income levels on one axis and he showed infant mortality and he shot this thing animated through time
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 286.57 293.93 <o,f0,male> so he'd taken this data and made a presentation which just shattered a lot of myths that people had about
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 294.44 305.20 <o,f0,male> the economics in the developing world he put up a slide a little bit like this it had underground all the data ok data is brown and boxy and boring and that's how we think of it
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 306.36 315.89 <o,f0,male> data you can't naturally use by itself but in fact data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives and it happen because somebody takes that data and does something with it in this case
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 316.88 330.58 <o,f0,male> put the data together he had found it from all kinds of united nations websites and things he had put it together combined it into something more interesting than the original pieces and then he'd put it into this
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 335.23 343.12 <o,f0,male> and produces this wonderful presentation and hans made a point of saying look it's really important to have a lot of
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 343.42 350.70 <o,f0,male> data and i was happy to see that at the party last night that he was still saying very forcibly it 's really important to have a lot of data
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 351.32 359.77 <o,f0,male> so i want us now to think about not just two pieces of data being connected or six like he did but i want to think about a world where everybody
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 382.67 393.77 <o,f0,male> them for people we're using them for places we're using them for your products we're using them for events all kinds of conceptual things they have names now that start with http second rule
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 395.01 407.73 <o,f0,male> if i take one of these http names and i look it up and i do the web thing with it and i fetch the data using the http protocol from the web i will get back some data in a standard format which is kind of useful data that somebody might like to
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 409.48 418.16 <o,f0,male> know about that thing about that event who 's at the event whatever it is about that person where they were born things like that so the second rule is i get important information back
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 418.53 431.88 <o,f0,male> third rule is that when i get back that information it's not just got somebody 's height and weight and when they were born it's got relationships data is relationships interestingly data is relationships this
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 442.39 448.43 <o,f0,male> one of those names that starts http so i can go ahead and look that thing up so i look up a person i can look up
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 448.97 460.69 <o,f0,male> the city where they were born i can look up the region it's in and the town it's in and the population of it and so on so i can browse this stuff so that's it really that is linked data
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 461.33 468.75 <o,f0,male> i wrote an article entitled linked data a couple of years ago and soon after that things started to happen
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 469.35 478.14 <o,f0,male> the idea of linked data is that we get lots and lots and lots of these boxes that hans had and we get lots and lots and lots of things sprouting it's not just
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 478.46 487.86 <o,f0,male> a whole lot of other plants it's not just a root supplying a plant but for each of those plants whatever it is a presentation an analysis somebody 's looking for patterns in the data
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 488.60 496.64 <o,f0,male> get to look at all the data and they get it connected together and the really important thing about data is the more things you have to connect together the more powerful it is
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 497.80 507.22 <o,f0,male> linked data the meme went out there and pretty soon chris bizer at the freie universitat in berlin who was one of the first people to put interesting things up
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 507.39 515.23 <o,f0,male> he noticed that wikipedia you know wikipedia the online encyclopedia with lots and lots of interesting documents in it well in those documents
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 515.59 528.33 <o,f0,male> there are little squares little boxes and in most information boxes there's data so he wrote a program to take the data extract it from wikipedia and put it into a blob of linked data on the web which
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 530.96 537.60 <o,f0,male> is represented by the blue blob in the middle of this slide and if you actually go and look up berlin you'll find that there are other blobs of data
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 546.14 552.97 <o,f0,male> and the exciting thing is it's starting to grow this is just the grassroots stuff again ok let 's think about data for
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 554.79 567.87 <o,f0,male> comes in fact in lots and lots of different forms think of the diversity of the web it's a really important thing that the web allows you to put all kinds of data up there so it is with data i could talk about all kinds of data we could talk about government data enterprise data is really
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 577.52 588.57 <o,f0,male> all kinds of stuff i'm just going to mention a few of them so that you get the idea of the diversity of it so that you also see how much unlocked potential let 's start with government data
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 590.86 600.98 <o,f0,male> speech that he american government data would be available on the internet in accessible formats and i hope that they will put it up as linked data
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 601.58 609.67 <o,f0,male> that's important why is it important not just for transparency yeah transparency in government is important but that data this is the data from all the government departments think about
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 610.33 618.46 <o,f0,male> how much of that data is about how life is lived in america it's actual useful it's got value i can use it in my company i could use it as a kid to do my homework
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 618.76 631.02 <o,f0,male> so we're talking about making the world run better by making this data available in fact if you're responsible if you know about some data in a government department often you find that these
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 641.13 648.82 <o,f0,male> i'd like to suggest that rather yes make a beautiful website who am i to say don't make a beautiful website make a beautiful website
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 650.30 660.85 <o,f0,male> give us the unadulterated data we want the data we want unadulterated data ok we have to ask for raw data now and i'm going to ask you to practice that
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 671.57 680.28 <o,f0,male> that it's important because you have no idea the number of excuses people come up with to hang onto their data and not give it to you even though you've paid for it
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 680.41 688.22 <o,f0,male> as a taxpayer and it's not just america it's all over the world and it's not just governments of course it's enterprises as well so i'm just going to mention a few other
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 688.65 700.29 <o,f0,male> thoughts on data here we are at ted and all the time we are very conscious of the huge challenges that human society has right now curing cancer
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 712.17 724.04 <o,f0,male> they try to communicate those over the web but a lot of the state of knowledge of the human race at the moment is on databases often sitting in their computers and actually currently not
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 736.55 745.48 <o,f0,male> because they had their genomics data in one database in one building and they had their protein data in another now they are sticking it
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 746.86 758.29 <o,f0,male> data and now they can ask the sort of question that you probably wouldn't ask i wouldn't ask they would what proteins are involved in signal transduction and also related to pyramidal neurons well you take that mouthful and you put it into
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 770.72 779.02 <o,f0,male> thirty two hits each of which is a protein which has those properties and you can look at the power of being able to ask those questions as a scientist
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 797.71 801.18 <o,f0,male> i go on like this you'll think that all the data comes from huge institutions
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 802.40 805.73 <o,f0,male> has nothing to do with you but that's not true in fact
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 806.74 814.81 <o,f0,male> data is about our lives you just you log on to your social networking site your favorite one you say this is my friend bing relationship data
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 815.33 824.29 <o,f0,male> you say this photograph it's about it depicts this person bing that's data data data data every time you do things on the social networking site the social networking site
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 824.52 832.04 <o,f0,male> is taking data and using it re purposing it and using it to make other people 's lives more interesting on the site but
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 854.05 861.41 <o,f0,male> came down here i looked it up on openstreetmap the openstreetmap 's a map but it's also a wiki zoom in and that square thing is a theater which we're in right now
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 861.54 868.72 <o,f0,male> the terrace theater it didn't have a name on it so i could go into edit mode i could select the theater i could add down at the bottom the name
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 869.09 877.84 <o,f0,male> and i could save it back and now if you go back to the openstreetmap org and you find this place you will find that the terrace theater has got a name i did that
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 882.21 894.85 <o,f0,male> if i that street map is all about everybody doing their bit and it creates an incredible resource because everybody else does theirs and that is what linked data is all about it's about
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 896.99 905.04 <o,f0,male> doing their bit to produce a little bit and it all connecting that's how linked data works you do your bit
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 907.06 913.37 <o,f0,male> does theirs you may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there but you know
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 915.40 923.02 <o,f0,male> and we've practiced that so linked data it's huge i've only told you a very small number of things
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 923.39 932.13 <o,f0,male> there are data in every aspect of our lives every aspect of work and pleasure and it's not just about the number of places where data comes
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 932.71 942.10 <o,f0,male> it's about connecting it together and when you connect data together you get power in a way that doesn't happen just with the web with documents you get this really huge
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 943.02 944.67 <o,f0,male> power out of it so
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 960.61 974.99 <o,f0,male> do it because they're the sort of person who just does things which would be good if everybody else did them ok so it's called linked data i want you to make it i want you to demand it and i think it's an idea worth spreading thanks
