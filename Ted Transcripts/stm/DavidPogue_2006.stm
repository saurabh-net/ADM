DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 18.92 21.18 <o,f0,male> hello voicemail my old friend
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 23.10 25.11 <o,f0,male> called for tech support again
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 26.98 35.82 <o,f0,female> i ignored my boss warning i called on a monday morning now it's evening and my dinner
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 42.83 46.24 <o,f0,male> the sounds of silence i
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 48.13 52.86 <o,f0,male> don't think you understand i think your phone lines are
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 55.00 57.44 <o,f0,female> i punched every touch tone i was told
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 59.23 60.44 <o,f0,female> eighteen hours on
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 61.60 62.34 <o,f0,female> it's not enough
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 70.55 70.98 <o,f0,male> now the
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 79.31 80.93 <o,f0,male> wreaking vengeance on you
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 90.81 91.01 <o,f0,female> and
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 96.13 100.29 <o,f0,male> but you get me and you listen to
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 120.33 132.40 <o,f0,female> be sent the coolest hottest slickest new gadgets every week it'll arrive at your door you get to try them out play with them evaluate them until the novelty wears out before you have to send them back and you'll get paid for it
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 132.91 139.43 <o,f0,female> you can think about it if you want so i've always been a technology nut and i absolutely love it
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 139.94 147.55 <o,f0,female> the job though came with one small downside and that is they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 148.38 158.77 <o,f0,female> and what i've noticed is first of all you get an incredible amount of email if you ever are feeling lonely get a new york times column because you will get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 159.57 169.94 <o,f0,female> and the email i'm getting a lot today is about frustration people are feeling like things ok i just had an alarm come up on my screen lucky you can't see it
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 180.67 189.15 <o,f0,female> help there's not enough thought put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use one time i wrote a column about my efforts to reach dell technical support
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 189.46 196.46 <o,f0,female> and within twelve hours there were seven hundred messages from readers on the feedback boards on the times website
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 196.93 206.87 <o,f0,female> from users saying me too and here 's my tale of woe i call it software rage and man let me tell you whoever figures out how to make money off of this
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 209.77 210.96 <o,f0,female> that get up there
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 212.80 227.02 <o,f0,female> ok so why is the problem accelerating and part of the problem is ironically because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use i'll show you what i mean this is what the computer interface used to look like dos
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 227.84 235.91 <o,f0,female> over the years it's gotten easier to use this is the original mac operating system reagan was president madonna was still brunette
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 236.73 245.82 <o,f0,female> the entire operating system this is the good part the entire operating system fit in two hundred and eleven k you couldn't put the mac os ten logo in two hundred
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 248.18 257.39 <o,f0,female> so the irony is that as these things became easier to use a less technical broader audience were coming into contact with this equipment for the first time
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 258.10 265.52 <o,f0,female> i once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the apple call center for a day the guy had a duplicate
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 265.86 273.52 <o,f0,female> headset for me to listen to and the calls that you know how they say your call may be recorded for quality assurance
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 274.73 275.36 <o,f0,female> your call may be
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 276.43 280.75 <o,f0,female> so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a cd
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 281.70 286.38 <o,f0,female> which they do and i have a copy
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 287.04 290.55 <o,f0,female> it's in your gift bag no no with your voices on
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 291.76 301.12 <o,f0,female> so some of the stories are just so classic and yet so understandable a woman called apple to complain that her mouse was squeaking making a squeaking noise
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 301.51 310.22 <o,f0,female> the technician said well ma 'am what do you mean your mouse is squeaking she says all i can tell you is that it squeaks louder the faster i move it across the screen
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 312.75 319.79 <o,f0,female> and the technician 's like ma 'am you've got the mouse up against the screen she goes well the message said click here to continue
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 323.38 327.75 <o,f0,female> well if you like that one how much time have we got another one
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 328.52 336.77 <o,f0,female> called this is absolutely true his computer had crashed and he told the technician he couldn't restart it no matter how many times he typed eleven
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 338.52 343.12 <o,f0,female> why are you typing eleven he said the message says error type eleven
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 350.14 354.38 <o,f0,female> we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 355.95 368.33 <o,f0,female> but why is the technical overload crisis the complexity crisis accelerating now in the hardware world it's because we the consumers want everything to be smaller smaller smaller so the gadgets are getting tinier and tinier
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 368.61 382.45 <o,f0,female> but our fingers are essentially staying the same size so it gets more and more of a challenge software is subject to another primal force the mandate to release more and more versions when you buy a piece of software it's not like buying a vase or a candy bar where you own it
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 382.66 395.95 <o,f0,female> it's more like joining a club where you pay dues every year and every year they say we 've added more features and we'll sell it to you for ninety nine dollars i know one guy who 's spent four thousand dollars just on photoshop over the years
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 396.49 409.78 <o,f0,female> and software companies make thirty five percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades i call it the software upgrade paradox which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times you eventually ruin it i mean
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 434.00 443.66 <o,f0,female> nodding in acknowledgment because it died it tanked no one ever bought it i call this the sport utility principle people like to surround themselves with unnecessary
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 444.70 451.97 <o,f0,female> right they don't need the database and the website but they're like well i'll upgrade because i might you know i might need that someday
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 452.35 459.95 <o,f0,female> so the problem is as you add more features where are they going to go where are you going to stick them you only have so many design tools
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 460.08 467.60 <o,f0,female> you can do buttons you can do sliders pop up menus sub menus but if you're not careful about how you choose you wind up with
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 467.86 468.88 <o,f0,female> this
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 471.92 474.15 <o,f0,female> is not a joke un retouched photo of
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 475.17 480.33 <o,f0,female> the copy that you have with all the toolbars open you've obviously never opened all
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 481.67 484.04 <o,f0,female> but all you have to type in is
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 484.96 485.84 <o,f0,female> teeny window
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 489.18 494.83 <o,f0,female> and we've arrived at the age of interface matrices where there are so many features and options you have to do
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 495.63 506.62 <o,f0,female> you know a vertical and a horizontal you guys all complained about how microsoft word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically the off switch is in there somewhere
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 507.05 521.14 <o,f0,female> i'm telling you it's there part of the art of designing a simple good interface is knowing when to use which one of these features so here is the log off dialog box for windows two thousand there are only four choices
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 521.59 535.28 <o,f0,female> so why are they in a pop up menu it's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices they could have put them all out in view here 's apple 's take on the exact same dialog box
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 537.90 538.58 <o,f0,female> i designed the
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 540.66 549.28 <o,f0,female> already we can see that apple and microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design microsoft 's approach to simplicity
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 549.59 563.61 <o,f0,female> tends to be let 's break it down let 's just make it more steps there are these wizards everywhere and you know there's a new version of windows coming out this fall if they continue at this pace there's absolutely no telling where they might wind up
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 580.55 583.08 <o,f0,female> the drop down menu choose the first letter you want
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 589.10 591.48 <o,f0,female> what is the answer how do you pack in all
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 592.11 601.22 <o,f0,female> in a simple intelligent way i believe in consistency when possible real world equivalents trashcan folder when possible label things mostly
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 601.53 610.87 <o,f0,female> but i beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all which is intelligence now what do i mean by that i'm going to give you some examples
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 617.25 628.95 <o,f0,female> you're supposed to put in your address and you're supposed to choose which country you're from okay there are two hundred countries in the world we like to think of the internet as a global village i'm sorry it's not one yet it's mainly like the united states europe and
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 629.64 632.00 <o,f0,female> so why is united states in the
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 634.12 641.73 <o,f0,female> have to scroll like seven screens full to get to it now it would be inconsistent to put united states first but it would be intelligent
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 642.43 650.14 <o,f0,female> this one 's been touched on before but why in god 's name do you shut down a windows pc by clicking a button called start
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 656.30 668.16 <o,f0,female> one of mine you have a printer most of the time you want to print one copy of your document in page order on that printer so why in god 's name do you see this every time you
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 673.27 675.36 <o,f0,female> and one of the buttons at the bottom you'll notice is not
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 685.21 696.59 <o,f0,female> i'm not saying that apple is the only company who has embraced the cult of simplicity palm is also especially in the old days wonderful about this i actually got to speak to palm when they were flying high in the
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 704.54 711.87 <o,f0,female> what he goes well jeff hawkins the ceo says if any task on the palm pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 712.10 721.20 <o,f0,female> it's too long and it has to be redesigned so i'm the tap counter so i'm going to show you an example of a company that does not have a tap counter
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 722.60 729.21 <o,f0,female> this is microsoft word ok when you want to create a new blank document in word it could happen
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 734.74 742.17 <o,f0,female> you go up to the file menu and you choose new now what happens when you choose new do you get a new blank document
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 742.66 744.01 <o,f0,female> you do not
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 746.78 753.59 <o,f0,female> a task bar appears and somewhere in those links by the way not at the top somewhere in those links
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 763.62 765.30 <o,f0,male> yes i do
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 770.72 771.41 <o,f0,female> song
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 773.78 775.42 <o,f0,female> a geek forever
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 776.13 778.33 <o,f0,female> and i wrote the very first dos
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 780.51 785.96 <o,f0,male> i put my software and ibm together i got profit and
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 790.13 793.80 <o,f0,male> i write the code that makes the whole world
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 803.78 804.53 <o,f0,male> you buy the
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 809.52 811.02 <o,f0,female> every software company
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 811.84 813.21 <o,f0,female> doing microsoft
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 815.58 817.35 <o,f0,female> good idea
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 818.67 819.81 <o,f0,female> even windows
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 822.14 822.50 <o,f0,female> on the
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 838.19 840.73 <o,f0,male> we've entered planet domination
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 842.85 843.76 <o,f0,male> have no choice
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 849.62 850.09 <o,f0,male> and i
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 864.76 873.02 <o,f0,female> are really two microsofts there's the old one responsible for windows and office they're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh but they can
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 882.60 890.01 <o,f0,female> good simple interface designs i liked the media center pc i liked the microsoft spot watch the wireless watch
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 907.65 919.63 <o,f0,female> the signs might indicate that the complexity crunch is only going to get worse so is there any hope the screens are getting smaller people are illuminating putting manuals in the boxes the things are coming out at a faster pace
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 932.01 936.68 <o,f0,female> but i'm like where have i seen this before i had just seen the movie evita
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 940.28 944.78 <o,f0,female> with madonna and i'm like you know what i've got to do one about steve jobs
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 946.99 949.35 <o,f0,female> it won 't be easy you'll think i'm
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 951.51 953.08 <o,f0,female> when i try to explain why
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 954.11 955.84 <o,f0,female> after telling the press apple 's
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 960.38 965.68 <o,f0,male> see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage with only a
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 969.05 970.79 <o,f0,female> you try rhyming with garage
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 977.79 982.54 <o,f0,male> is i never left you i know the ropes now know what
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 983.25 986.78 <o,f0,male> are i made a fortune over at
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 991.57 992.13 <o,f0,male> and
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 996.66 1002.16 <o,f0,male> in any weather it's just that these days they're gucci leather
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 1014.66 1021.82 <o,f0,female> had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty and the truth is for years i was a little depressed because
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 1038.54 1046.60 <o,f0,female> it turns out i was wrong right because the ipod came out and it violated every bit of common wisdom other products cost less other products
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 1046.80 1054.98 <o,f0,female> had more features they had voice recorders and fm transmitters the other products were backed by microsoft with an open standard not apple 's propriety standard
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 1055.28 1062.42 <o,f0,female> but the ipod won this is the one they wanted the lesson was simplicity sells and there are signs that the industry is getting the message
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 1062.81 1072.47 <o,f0,female> a little company that's done very well with simplicity and elegance the sonos thing it's catching on i've got just a couple of examples physically a really cool elegant thinking
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 1072.62 1081.33 <o,f0,female> coming along lately when you have a digital camera how do you get the pictures back to your computer well you either haul around a usb cable
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 1081.53 1089.53 <o,f0,female> or you buy a card reader and haul that around either one you're going to lose what i do is i take out the memory card and i fold it in half
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 1091.06 1097.36 <o,f0,female> revealing usb contacts i just stick it in the computer offload the pictures put it right back in the camera i never have
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 1097.61 1100.32 <o,f0,female> lose anything here 's another example
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 1109.85 1118.71 <o,f0,female> and i'm sure every one of you have done this at some point in your lives or one of your children you walk along and i'm about to pull this onto the floor i don't care it's
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 1121.17 1123.95 <o,f0,female> it's magnetic it doesn't pull the laptop onto the floor
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 1128.22 1129.83 <o,f0,female> in my very last example
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 1131.26 1137.73 <o,f0,female> i do a lot of my work using speech recognition software and you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous okay
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 1146.21 1147.91 <o,f0,female> and it's not just what i dictate
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 1162.89 1174.79 <o,f0,female> this is not an ideal situation because it's getting the echo from the hall and stuff but the point is i can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word and having it write out a much longer thing so if somebody sends me a fan letter i'll say
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 1185.88 1190.97 <o,f0,female> conversely if somebody sends me hate mail which happens daily i say
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 1191.98 1193.36 <o,f0,female> off
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 1205.80 1208.60 <o,f0,female> so that's my dirty little secret don't tell anyone
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 1209.63 1222.69 <o,f0,female> so the point is this a really interesting story this is version eight of the software and do you know what they put in version eight no new features it's never happened before in software the company put no new features they just said we 'll make
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 1223.46 1231.68 <o,f0,female> work right right because for years people had bought this software tried it out ninety five percent accuracy was all they got which means one in twenty words is wrong
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 1239.33 1248.99 <o,f0,female> and so that's what they did this cult of doing things right is starting to spread so my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology remember if it doesn't work
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 1249.56 1258.78 <o,f0,female> not necessarily you ok it could be the design of the thing you're using be aware in life of good design and bad design and if you're among the people who create the stuff
DavidPogue_2006 1 DavidPogue_2006 1259.71 1273.18 <o,f0,female> easy is hard pre sweat the details for your audience count the taps remember the hard part is not deciding what features to add it's deciding what to leave out and best of all your motivation is simplicity sells
