CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 76.04 84.61 <o,f0,male> but finally i got myself involved around seventeen to twenty years i became

CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 136.41 145.23 <o,f0,male> when i finished i went to ituri forest for my internship it's where i really getting passion with what i'm doing right
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 146.24 156.56 <o,f0,male> now i'm standing in front of you doing botany and wildlife conservation that time the ituri forest was created as a forest reserve
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 159.15 168.20 <o,f0,male> and also plants and the training center there was built around the scientific congolese staff and
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 171.42 184.20 <o,f0,male> so the okapi faunal reserve protects number i think that is the largest number of elephant we have right now in protected area in congo it has also chimpanzees and it
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 185.98 194.56 <o,f0,male> okapi faunal reserve because of this beautiful creature that is a forest giraffe i think you guys know it quite well here we have
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 196.16 202.02 <o,f0,male> giraffe but through evolutions we have this forest giraffe that
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 204.15 218.32 <o,f0,male> it has also some beautiful primates thirteen species highest diversity we can find in one single area in africa and it has the ituri forest itself about one thousand
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 233.59 241.01 <o,f0,male> teaching assistant at my university because i accomplished with honor but i didn't like the
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 242.79 249.97 <o,f0,male> i got was very poor and i wanted to be from to a training center and a research center with the end of
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 260.57 263.65 <o,f0,male> was completely difficult to do and to achieve
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 264.84 272.76 <o,f0,male> when kabila started his movement to liberate congo so mobutu soldiers started
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 273.52 281.30 <o,f0,male> moving and retreated so they started fleeing from the east to the west and the okapi faunal reserve is
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 282.74 295.96 <o,f0,male> so there was a road from goma somewhere here and coming like this so they might go through pass through okapi faunal reserve congo has five of
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 297.42 305.22 <o,f0,male> sites of protected area and okapi faunal reserve is one of them so soldier was fleeing in the okapi faunal reserve
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 306.21 312.53 <o,f0,male> way they looted everything torture wars oh my god you can't believe
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 313.25 323.46 <o,f0,male> every person was looking his way where to go we don't know and it was for us young the first time really we hear the language of
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 333.87 341.88 <o,f0,male> what was happening they were killing people they were doing whatever they want because they have power who have been doing that
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 342.63 356.09 <o,f0,male> young children child soldiers you can't ask him how old he is because he has guns but i was from the west working in the east i even that time was not speaking
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 357.26 367.73 <o,f0,male> and when they came they looted everything you can't speak lingala because lingala was from mobutu and everyone speaking lingala is soldier and i was from the same area
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 368.52 375.52 <o,f0,male> my friends said we are leaving because we are a target but i'm not going to the east because there i don't know swahili i
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 376.67 384.69 <o,f0,male> if i go i will be killed i can't go back to my area it's more than one thousand kilometers i stayed after they looted everything
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 385.25 397.79 <o,f0,male> we have been doing research on botany and we have a small herbarium of four thousand five hundred sheets of plants we cut we dry and we packed them we mounted them on a
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 399.74 404.95 <o,f0,male> so that we start them for agriculture for medicine for whatever and for science
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 406.63 415.69 <o,f0,male> the study of the flora and the change of the forest that is people moving around that's even pygmies and this is a bright guy
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 418.04 426.67 <o,f0,male> person and pygmies i've been working with him about ten years and with soldiers they went to the forest for
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 429.20 438.77 <o,f0,male> know how to track elephant in the forest he have been attacked by leopard and they abandon him in the forest they came to told me
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 440.39 448.52 <o,f0,male> and what i did i gave him just antibiotics that we care for that tuberculosis and fortunately
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 462.77 466.79 <o,f0,male> so on and what of important things i think all of you here
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 469.45 474.02 <o,f0,male> have killed a lot five millions of congolese have gone because of
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 477.83 487.32 <o,f0,male> that they use it to make cell phone and it have been in that area all over in congo extraction and good big business of the
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 489.36 498.16 <o,f0,male> and what i did for the first war after we have lost everything i have to save something even myself my life and life of the staff
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 498.65 511.92 <o,f0,male> i buried some of our new vehicle engine i buried it to save it and some of equipment went with them on the top of the canopy to save it he 's not collecting plants he 's going to save our equipment
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 514.21 520.93 <o,f0,male> with the material that's left because they wanted to destroy it to burn it they didn't understand it they didn't go to school
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 521.90 529.88 <o,f0,male> it and that is me going to hurrying to uganda try to save that four thousand material with people
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 532.54 538.98 <o,f0,male> them on the bikes bicycles and after that we succeeded i housed that four thousand material
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 539.26 545.88 <o,f0,male> the herbarium of makerere university and after the war i have been able to bring it back home so that
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 547.53 557.88 <o,f0,male> the second war came while we didn't expect it with friends we have been sitting and watching match football and having some good music with
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 559.78 566.54 <o,f0,male> when it started i think so it was so bad we heard that now from the east again
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 568.32 576.50 <o,f0,male> and it's going fast this time i think kabila will go in place of as he did with mobutu and the reserve was
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 594.90 608.19 <o,f0,male> that's the powerful men we have to meet and to talk to them what's the regulation of the reserve and what is the regulation of the parks and they can't do what they are doing so we went to meet them that is
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 609.98 617.06 <o,f0,male> gold mining so we started talking with them convincing them that we are in a protected area
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 617.32 624.47 <o,f0,male> there is regulations that it's prohibited to do logging mining and poaching specifically
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 635.87 643.94 <o,f0,male> we don't think so we have to do it because to let our movement advance i say no way you are not going to do it here
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 644.30 656.88 <o,f0,male> we started talking with them and i was negotiating tried to protect our equipment tried to protect our staff and the villages of about one thousand five hundred people
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 657.48 664.28 <o,f0,male> and we continued but i was doing that negotiating with them sometimes we are having meeting and they are talking with

CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 756.62 763.41 <o,f0,male> on me so i was scared and when we finished the meeting i went to return it in the forest and i was

CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 791.66 801.08 <o,f0,male> and during the war after a week of heavy war fighting in the area we succeeded we had the first okapi this is the only trouser and
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 813.98 821.28 <o,f0,male> after a week we celebrated the birthday of that okapi they killed elephant just fifty meters
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 822.19 830.43 <o,f0,male> area where the zoo where okapi was born and i was mad i oppose it that they are now going to dissect it until i do my
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 831.41 838.11 <o,f0,male> report and then i see the chief commander and i succeeded the elephant just decayed and
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 841.72 845.95 <o,f0,male> what we are doing after that that was the situation of the
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 849.01 852.66 <o,f0,male> some money i was paid one hundred and fifty dollars i
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 855.46 864.24 <o,f0,male> to rebuild the herbarium because we didn't have good infrastructure to start plants wildlife conservation society more dealing with plants
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 864.72 876.88 <o,f0,male> i started this with seventy dollars and start fundraising money to where i've been going i had opportunity to go all over where herbarium for my african material is and
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 877.64 889.20 <o,f0,male> they supported me a bit and i built this now it's doing work to train young congolese and also what one of the speciality we are doing
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 889.59 898.11 <o,f0,male> my design is tracking the global warming effect on biodiversity and what the impacts of the ituri forest is
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 899.14 905.35 <o,f0,male> uptake carbon this is one of the study we are doing on forty hectares plot where we have
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 914.81 922.36 <o,f0,male> to see how that forest is contributing to the carbon reductions and that is i think
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 925.22 934.17 <o,f0,male> it's difficult for me this is a very embarrassing talk i know i don't know where to start where to finish it when i was thinking to come here
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 945.61 955.14 <o,f0,male> you people now we are talking about reconstitution rebuild africa but is gun industries a tool to
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 956.70 960.08 <o,f0,male> is it a game i think we
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 963.63 971.43 <o,f0,male> see the war like a game like soccer football everybody is happy but see what it's doing see what
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 972.23 983.45 <o,f0,male> going in darfur now we say oh my god see what the wars in rwanda that's because of the language of guns i don't think that someone may blame google
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 1011.89 1017.91 <o,f0,male> story i suspect a lot of people here have the same question i have how can we
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 1034.68 1042.03 <o,f0,male> i did it myself if i know when i was young that killing elephant i'm destroying biodiversity i would not
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 1044.10 1051.30 <o,f0,male> many many of you have seen the talents of africans but there are few who are going to school
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 1051.91 1061.28 <o,f0,male> many are dying because of all those kind of pandemics hiv malaria poverty not going to school
CorneilleEwango_2007G 1 CorneilleEwango_2007G 1072.47 1078.12 <o,f0,male> but many of them are just here because they don't have money and they can't go even to university
