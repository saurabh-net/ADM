RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 19.78 29.47 <o,f0,male> share with you today an original discovery but i want to tell it to you the way it really happened not the way i present it in a scientific meeting or the way you'd read it
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 29.77 37.03 <o,f0,male> in a scientific paper it's a story about beyond biomimetics to something i'm calling biomutualism
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 37.62 48.08 <o,f0,male> i define that as an association between biology and another discipline where each discipline reciprocally advances the other but where the collective discoveries that emerge are beyond any single field
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 48.73 56.25 <o,f0,male> now in terms of biomimetics as human technologies take on more of the characteristics of nature nature becomes a much more useful teacher
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 77.07 83.43 <o,f0,male> to climb up a wall so quickly we discovered it and what we found was that
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 85.97 93.14 <o,f0,male> that look like a rug and each of those hairs has the worst case of split ends possible about one hundred to one thousand split ends that are nano size
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 104.72 111.37 <o,f0,male> and i'm really pleased to report to you today that the first synthetic self cleaning dry adhesive has been made
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 111.82 119.67 <o,f0,male> from the simplest version in nature one branch my engineering collaborator ron fearing at berkeley had made the first synthetic version
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 120.15 130.12 <o,f0,male> and so has my other incredible collaborator mark cutkosky at standford he made much larger hairs than the gecko but used the same general principles and here is its first
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 132.12 139.56 <o,f0,male> that's kellar autumn my former ph d student professor now at lewis and clark literally giving his first born child up for this test
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 142.23 144.17 <o,f0,male> more recently this happened
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 158.40 167.27 <o,f0,male> and attached to a safety rope lynn began her sixty foot ascent lynn made it to the top in a perfect pairing of hollywood and science
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 168.29 171.71 <o,f0,male> so you're the first human being to officially emulate a gecko
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 173.20 176.22 <o,f0,female> and what a privilege that has been
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 182.28 188.63 <o,f0,male> to climb up and pull herself up and you can try this in the lobby and look at the gecko inspired material
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 189.94 200.93 <o,f0,male> now the problem with the robots doing this is that they can't get unstuck with the material this is the gecko 's solution they actually peel their toes away from the surface at high rates
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 201.15 212.41 <o,f0,male> as they run up the wall well i'm really excited today to show you the newest version of a robot stickybot using a new hierarchical dry adhesive here is the actual robot
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 217.47 219.37 <o,f0,male> and here is what it does
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 225.74 226.53 <o,f0,male> and if you look
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 227.46 233.46 <o,f0,male> you can see that it uses the toe peeling just like the gecko
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 236.93 238.87 <o,f0,male> some of the video you can see it climbing up
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 242.24 251.82 <o,f0,male> there it is and now it can go on other surfaces because of the new adhesive that the standford group was able to do in designing this incredible robot
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 255.66 263.36 <o,f0,male> one thing i want to point out is look at stickybot you see something on it it's not just to look like a gecko it has a tail
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 263.68 272.32 <o,f0,male> and just when you think you've figured out nature this kind of thing happens the engineers told us for the climbing robots that if they don't have a tail they fall off the wall
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 273.17 278.92 <o,f0,male> so what they did was they asked us an important question they said well
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 280.19 286.19 <o,f0,male> kind of looks like a tail even though we put a passive bar there do animals use their tails when they climb up walls
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 295.66 303.35 <o,f0,male> in reality we were then panicked being the biologists and we should know this already we said well what do tails do well we know that tails store fat
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 303.68 311.97 <o,f0,male> for example we know that you can grab onto things with them and perhaps it is most well known that they provide static balance
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 313.82 317.27 <o,f0,male> it can also act as a counterbalance so watch this kangaroo
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 319.67 328.10 <o,f0,male> see that tail that's incredible marc raibert built a uniroo hopping robot and it was unstable without its tail
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 331.70 336.71 <o,f0,male> now mostly tails limit maneuverability like this human inside this dinosaur suit
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 338.59 351.49 <o,f0,male> my colleagues actually went on to test this limitation by increasing the moment of inertia of a student so they had a tail and running them through and obstacle course and found a decrement in performance like you'd predict
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 354.46 356.83 <o,f0,male> but of course this is a passive tail
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 374.38 380.51 <o,f0,male> talked about the tail being a whip for communication it can also be used in defense
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 382.03 389.95 <o,f0,male> pretty powerful so we then went back and looked at the animal and we ran it up a surface but this time what we did is we put a slippery patch
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 390.24 403.07 <o,f0,male> that you see in yellow there and watch on the right what the animal is doing with its tail when it slips this is slowed down ten times so here is normal speed and watch it now slip and see what it does with its tail
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 406.39 414.49 <o,f0,male> it has an active tail that functions as a fifth leg and it contributes to stability if you make it slip a huge amount this is what we discovered
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 419.77 421.64 <o,f0,male> engineers had a really good idea
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 432.48 437.77 <o,f0,male> and what would happen if they climbed on the underside of that leaf and there was some wind or we
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 438.94 441.41 <o,f0,male> and we did that experiment that you see here
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 444.11 447.32 <o,f0,male> now that's real time you can't see anything but there it is slowed down
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 465.39 472.64 <o,f0,male> so they do it with this active tail as they swing around and then they always land in the sort of superman skydiving posture
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 474.55 481.58 <o,f0,male> okay now we wondered if we were right we should be able to test this in a physical model in a robot so for ted we actually built a robot
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 481.90 490.11 <o,f0,male> over there a prototype with the tail and we're going to attempt the first air righting response in a tail with a robot if we could have the lights on
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 491.15 493.16 <o,f0,male> okay there it goes
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 500.97 501.98 <o,f0,male> there it is
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 502.93 508.48 <o,f0,male> and it works just like it does in the animal so all you need is a swing of the tail to right yourself
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 511.81 520.47 <o,f0,male> now of course we were normally frightened because the animal has no gliding adaptations so we thought oh that's okay we'll put it in a vertical wind tunnel we'll blow the air up
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 521.00 526.06 <o,f0,male> give it a landing target a tree trunk just outside the plexi glass enclosure and see what it does
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 528.05 529.45 <o,f0,male> so we did and here is what it does
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 535.20 537.65 <o,f0,male> it does an equilibrium glide
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 538.23 543.44 <o,f0,male> highly controlled this is sort of incredible but actually it's quite beautiful when you take a picture of
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 545.50 548.78 <o,f0,male> and it's better than that it just in the slide maneuvers in
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 558.34 568.69 <o,f0,male> and then we had to film this several times to believe this it also does this watch this it oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin it can actually swim through the air
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 569.60 573.39 <o,f0,male> but watch its front legs can you see what they are doing
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 574.61 583.94 <o,f0,male> what does that mean for the origin of flapping flight maybe it's evolved from coming down from trees and trying to control a glide stay tuned for that
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 586.80 588.76 <o,f0,male> so then we wondered can they actually maneuver with this
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 589.32 591.67 <o,f0,male> so there is the landing target could they steer towards it
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 631.82 640.69 <o,f0,male> of animal gliding down there is a red trajectory line look at the end to see the animal but then as it gets closer to the tree look at the close up and see if you can see it land
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 642.45 645.93 <o,f0,male> so there it comes down there is a gecko at the end of that trajectory line you see it there there
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 647.35 654.17 <o,f0,male> watch up there and you can see the landing did you see it hit it actually uses its tail too just like we saw in the lab
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 655.79 662.32 <o,f0,male> so now we can continue this mutualism by suggesting that they can make an active tail
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 662.85 665.79 <o,f0,male> and here is the first active tail in the robot
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 667.16 671.08 <o,f0,male> made by boston dynamics so to conclude
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 671.27 684.91 <o,f0,male> i think we need to build biomutualisms like i showed that will increase the pace of basic discovery in their application to do this though we need to redesign education in a major way to balance depth with interdisciplinary communication and explicitly train people
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 685.28 694.94 <o,f0,male> how to contribute to and benefit from other disciplines and of course you need the organisms and the environment to do it that is whether you care about security search and rescue or health
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 695.43 705.98 <o,f0,male> we must preserve nature 's designs otherwise these secrets will be lost forever and from what i heard from our new president i'm very optimistic thank you
