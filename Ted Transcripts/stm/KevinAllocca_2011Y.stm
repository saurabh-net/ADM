KevinAllocca_2011Y 1 KevinAllocca_2011Y 36.16 51.66 <o,f0,male> but now web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world 's culture any one of you could be famous on the internet by next saturday but there are over forty eight hours of video uploaded to youtube every minute
KevinAllocca_2011Y 1 KevinAllocca_2011Y 51.66 58.85 <o,f0,male> and of that only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment so how does it happen
KevinAllocca_2011Y 1 KevinAllocca_2011Y 58.85 68.05 <o,f0,male> three things tastemakers communities of participation and unexpectedness all right let 's go
KevinAllocca_2011Y 1 KevinAllocca_2011Y 93.25 103.41 <o,f0,male> last summer but he didn 't actually set out to make a viral video bear he just wanted to share a rainbow because that 's what you do when your name is yosemite mountain bear
KevinAllocca_2011Y 1 KevinAllocca_2011Y 111.31 117.08 <o,f0,male> so what happened here jimmy kimmel actually
KevinAllocca_2011Y 1 KevinAllocca_2011Y 146.15 159.34 <o,f0,male> rebecca black 's friday is one of the most popular videos of the year it 's been seen nearly two hundred million times this year this is a chart of what it looked like and similar to double rainbow it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere
KevinAllocca_2011Y 1 KevinAllocca_2011Y 165.52 168.45 <o,f0,male> and if you 're wondering about those other spikes those are also fridays
KevinAllocca_2011Y 1 KevinAllocca_2011Y 172.67 177.06 <o,f0,male> but what about this day this one particular friday
KevinAllocca_2011Y 1 KevinAllocca_2011Y 177.06 193.85 <o,f0,male> well tosh zero picked it up a lot of blogs starting writing about michael j nelson from mystery science theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on twitter but what 's important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience accelerating the process
KevinAllocca_2011Y 1 KevinAllocca_2011Y 193.85 204.33 <o,f0,male> and so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it and now there are ten thousand parodies of friday on youtube
KevinAllocca_2011Y 1 KevinAllocca_2011Y 204.33 208.76 <o,f0,male> even in the first seven days there was one parody for every other day of the week
KevinAllocca_2011Y 1 KevinAllocca_2011Y 231.75 242.78 <o,f0,male> so nyan cat is a looped animation with looped music it 's this just like this it 's been viewed nearly fifty million times this year
KevinAllocca_2011Y 1 KevinAllocca_2011Y 242.85 248.93 <o,f0,male> and if you think that that is weird you should know that there is a three hour version of this that 's been viewed four million times
KevinAllocca_2011Y 1 KevinAllocca_2011Y 258.55 261.19 <o,f0,male> were watching other cats watch this video
KevinAllocca_2011Y 1 KevinAllocca_2011Y 270.17 279.77 <o,f0,male> but what 's important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this techie geeky internet culture there were remixes
KevinAllocca_2011Y 1 KevinAllocca_2011Y 304.14 308.41 <o,f0,male> an entire remix community sprouted up that brought it from
KevinAllocca_2011Y 1 KevinAllocca_2011Y 308.41 315.78 <o,f0,male> being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of because we don 't just enjoy now we participate
KevinAllocca_2011Y 1 KevinAllocca_2011Y 329.96 346.58 <o,f0,male> in a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have when a friend of mine told me that i needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle fines in new york city i admit i wasn 't very interested
KevinAllocca_2011Y 1 KevinAllocca_2011Y 400.29 416.46 <o,f0,male> these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defines the popularity i mean as mentioned earlier one of the biggest stars in the world right now justin bieber got his start on youtube no one has to green light your idea
KevinAllocca_2011Y 1 KevinAllocca_2011Y 416.51 427.63 <o,f0,male> and we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture and these are not characteristics of old media and they 're barely true of the media of today but they will define the entertainment
