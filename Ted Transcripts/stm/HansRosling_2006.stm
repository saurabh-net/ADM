HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 16.26 29.73 <o,f0,male> ten years ago i took on the task to teach global development to swedish undergraduate students that was after having spent about twenty years together with african institutions studying hunger in africa so i was sort of
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 39.88 51.99 <o,f0,male> but when you get that opportunity you get a little nervous i thought these students coming to us actually have the highest grade you can get in swedish college systems so maybe they know everything i'm going to teach them about so i did a
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 52.87 61.38 <o,f0,male> when they came and one of the questions from which i learnt a lot was this one which country has the highest child mortality of these five pairs
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 62.22 74.60 <o,f0,male> and i put them together so that in each pair of country one has twice the child mortality of the other and this means that it's much bigger a difference than the uncertainty of the data
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 74.88 86.59 <o,f0,male> i won 't put you at a test here but it's turkey which is highest there poland russia pakistan and south africa and these were the results of the swedish students i did it so i got the confidence interval which is pretty narrow
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 86.72 95.40 <o,f0,male> and i got happy of course a one point eight right answer out of five possible that means that there was a place for a professor of international health and for my
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 96.99 103.66 <o,f0,male> one late night when i was compiling the report i really realized my discovery i
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 104.62 111.47 <o,f0,male> that swedish top students know statistically significantly less about the world than the chimpanzees
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 113.47 115.03 <o,f0,male> because the chimpanzee would score
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 116.76 123.97 <o,f0,male> if i gave them two bananas with sri lanka and turkey they would be right half of the cases but the students are not there the problem for me
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 124.15 132.65 <o,f0,male> was not ignorance it was preconceived ideas i did also an unethical study of the professors of the karolinska institute that
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 132.84 136.94 <o,f0,male> hands out the nobel prize in medicine and they are on par with the chimpanzee there
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 140.10 150.99 <o,f0,male> this is where i realized that there was really a need to communicate because the data of what's happening in the world and the child health of every country is very well aware we did this
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 151.51 159.78 <o,f0,male> which displays it like this every bubble here is a country this country over here is china
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 160.63 166.65 <o,f0,male> india the size of the bubble is the population and on this axis here i put fertility rate
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 167.32 174.13 <o,f0,male> because my students what they said when they looked upon the world and i asked them what do you really think about the world
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 175.28 185.09 <o,f0,male> i first discovered that the textbook was tintin mainly and they said the world is still we and them and we is western world and them is third world
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 185.79 192.29 <o,f0,male> and what do you mean with western world i said well that's long life and small family and third world is short life and large
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 193.59 202.48 <o,f0,male> so this is what i could display here i put fertility rate here number of children per woman one two three four up to about eight children per woman
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 236.04 245.86 <o,f0,male> or have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here or have they got longer lives and live up there let 's see we stopped the world then this is all u n statistics that have been
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 246.41 251.75 <o,f0,female> here we go can you see there it's china there moving against better health there improving there all the green
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 252.68 263.48 <o,f0,female> countries are moving towards smaller families your yellow ones here are the arabic countries and they get larger families but they no longer life but not larger families the africans are the green down here they still remain
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 263.80 273.25 <o,f0,female> this is india indonesia 's moving on pretty fast and in the eighties here you have bangladesh still among the african countries there but now bangladesh it's a miracle that happens in the
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 273.80 282.56 <o,f0,female> the imams start to promote family planning they move up into that corner and in nineties we have the terrible hiv epidemic that takes down
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 282.73 292.79 <o,f0,female> the life expectancy of the african countries and all the rest of them move up into the corner where we have long lives and small family and we have a completely new world
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 321.31 323.50 <o,f0,male> during the war indicate
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 324.43 331.95 <o,f0,male> even with all the death there was an improvement of life expectancy by the end of the year the family planning started in vietnam and they went for smaller families
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 344.14 350.30 <o,f0,male> we have in vietnam the same life expectancy and the same family size
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 359.36 372.71 <o,f0,male> if we don't look in the data we underestimate the tremendous change in asia which was in social change before we saw the economical change let 's move over to another way here in which we could
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 373.15 380.64 <o,f0,male> display the distribution in the world of the income this is the world distribution of income of people
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 381.96 385.81 <o,f0,male> one dollar ten dollars or one hundred dollars per day
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 386.90 389.48 <o,f0,male> gap between rich and poor any longer this is a myth
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 389.97 391.39 <o,f0,male> a little hump here
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 392.53 397.20 <o,f0,male> but there are people all the way and if we look where the income ends up
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 398.61 409.15 <o,f0,male> the income this is one hundred percent the world 's annual income and the richest twenty percent they take out of that about seventy four percent
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 409.65 418.51 <o,f0,male> and the poorest twenty percent they take about two percent and this shows that the concept of developing countries is extremely doubtful
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 418.79 431.39 <o,f0,male> we think about aid like these people here giving aid to these people here but in the middle we have most the world population and they have now twenty four percent of the income we heard it in other forms
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 431.81 439.99 <o,f0,male> and who are these where are the different countries i can show you africa this is africa
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 440.51 443.67 <o,f0,male> ten percent the world population most in poverty this is
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 445.27 452.35 <o,f0,male> the rich country the country club of the u n and they are over here on this side quite an overlap between africa and
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 453.27 462.34 <o,f0,male> and this is latin america it has everything on this earth from the poorest to the richest in latin america and on top of that we can put east europe
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 474.60 482.48 <o,f0,male> and we have most who lived in absolute poverty were asians the problem in the world was the poverty in asia and if i now
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 482.79 490.23 <o,f0,male> let the world move forward you will see that while population increase there are hundreds of millions in asia getting out of poverty
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 490.40 497.71 <o,f0,male> and some others getting into poverty and this is the pattern we have today and the best projection from the world bank is that this will happen
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 498.42 507.40 <o,f0,male> and we will not have a divided world we'll have most people in the middle of course it's a logarithmic scale here but our concept of economy is growth with percent
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 507.62 513.82 <o,f0,male> we look upon it as a possibility of percentile increase if i change
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 514.26 524.57 <o,f0,male> and i take gdp per capita instead of family income and i turn these individual data into regional data of gross domestic product
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 524.94 536.60 <o,f0,male> and i take the regions down here the size of the bubble is still the population and you have the oecd there and you have sub saharan africa there and we take off the arab states there coming both from africa and from asia
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 536.84 544.49 <o,f0,male> and we put them separately and we can expand this axis and i can give it a new dimension here by adding
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 544.88 555.61 <o,f0,male> the social values there child survival now i have money on that axis and i have the possibility of children to survive there in some countries ninety nine point seven percent of children survive to five years of age
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 555.95 565.01 <o,f0,male> others only seventy and here it seems there is a gap between oecd latin america east europe east asia arab states
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 565.34 575.81 <o,f0,male> south asia and sub saharan africa the linearity is very strong between child survival and money but let me split sub saharan africa
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 576.52 584.35 <o,f0,male> is there and better health is up there i can go here and i can split sub saharan africa
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 584.52 593.02 <o,f0,male> into its countries and when it burst the size of his country bubble is the size of the population sierra leone down there mauritius is up there
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 593.82 606.31 <o,f0,male> was the first country to get away with trade barriers and they could sell their sugar they could sell their textiles on equal terms as the people in europe and north america there's a huge difference between africa and
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 609.52 616.28 <o,f0,male> humanitarian aid here in uganda development aid here time to invest there you can go for
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 617.51 630.72 <o,f0,male> it's a tremendous variation within africa which we rarely often make that it's equal everything i can split south asia here india 's the big bubble in the middle but a huge difference between afghanistan and
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 631.03 642.56 <o,f0,male> sri lanka i can split arab states how are they same climate same culture same religion huge difference even between neighbors yemen civil war united arab emirate money
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 642.74 651.64 <o,f0,male> which was quite equally and well used not as the myth is and that includes all the children of the foreign workers who are in the
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 653.16 664.88 <o,f0,male> often better than you think many people say data is bad there is an uncertainty margin but we can see the difference here cambodia singapore the differences are much bigger than the weakness of the data east europe
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 670.46 673.92 <o,f0,male> very very differently and there is latin america
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 674.63 682.52 <o,f0,male> today we don't have to go to cuba to find a healthy country in latin america chile will have a lower child mortality than cuba within some few years from now
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 683.07 690.97 <o,f0,male> and here we have high income countries in the oecd and we get the whole pattern here of the world which is more or less like
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 691.53 695.64 <o,f0,male> this and if we look at it how it looks the world
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 713.20 716.85 <o,f0,male> so it's sort of difficult to get
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 732.99 734.92 <o,f0,male> south korea which is this one
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 735.66 738.55 <o,f0,male> with brazil which is this one
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 749.46 751.29 <o,f0,male> and you can see how
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 753.03 759.57 <o,f0,male> south korea is making a very very fast advancement whereas brazil is much slower
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 759.75 767.77 <o,f0,male> and if we move back again here and we put on trails on them like this you can see again that
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 768.78 777.24 <o,f0,male> speed of development is very very different and the countries are moving more or less in the same rate
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 777.54 789.60 <o,f0,male> as money and health but it seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first and to show that you can put on the way of united arab emirate they came from here
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 790.00 800.98 <o,f0,male> a mineral country they cached all the oil they got all the money but health cannot be bought at the supermarket you have to invest in health you have to get kids into schooling you have to train health staff
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 801.10 809.36 <o,f0,male> you have to educate the population and sheikh sayed did that in a fairly good way and in spite of falling oil prices he brought this country up here
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 809.59 817.76 <o,f0,male> so we've got a much more mainstream appearance of the world where all countries tend to use their money better than they used in the past
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 819.26 821.53 <o,f0,male> now this is more or less if you look at
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 826.65 834.73 <o,f0,male> they are like this now that's dangerous to use average data because there is such a lot of difference within countries
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 847.46 855.28 <o,f0,male> uganda these are the quintiles of uganda the richest twenty percent of ugandans are there the poorest are down there if i split south africa
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 855.89 861.57 <o,f0,male> it's like this if i go down and look at niger where there was such a terrible famine
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 863.21 876.36 <o,f0,male> it's like this the twenty percent poorest of niger is out here and the twenty percent richest of south africa is there and yet we tend to discuss on what solutions there should be in africa everything in this world exists in africa
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 877.10 890.10 <o,f0,male> you can't discuss universal access to hiv for that quintile up here with the same strategy as down here the improvement of the world must be highly contextualized and it's not relevant
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 890.21 903.78 <o,f0,male> to have it on regional level we must be much more detailed we find that students get very excited when they can use this and even more policy makers and the corporate sectors would like to see how the world
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 904.61 916.22 <o,f0,male> changing now why doesn't this take place why are we not using the data we have we have data in the united nations in the national statistical agencies and in universities and other non governmental organizations
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 916.45 921.42 <o,f0,female> the data is hidden down in the databases and the public is there and the internet is there
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 932.67 941.41 <o,f0,male> they take some nourishment down from the databases but people put prices on them stupid passwords and boring statistics
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 942.93 946.79 <o,f0,female> and this won 't work so
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 947.13 957.23 <o,f0,female> is needed we have the databases it's not the new database you need we have wonderful design tools and more and more are added up here so we started a nonprofit venture
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 958.02 958.95 <o,f0,male> which we called
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 959.47 971.16 <o,f0,male> linking data to design we call it gapminder from the london underground where they warn you mind the gap so we thought gapminder was appropriate and we started to write software which could link the data like this
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 971.65 980.27 <o,f0,male> and it wasn't that difficult it took some person years and we have produced animations you can take a data set and put it there we are liberating
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 981.72 990.93 <o,f0,male> some few u n organization some countries accept that their databases can go out on the world but what we really need is of course a search function
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 991.24 1004.20 <o,f0,male> a search function where we can copy the data up to a searchable format and get it out in the world and what do we hear when we go around i've done anthropology on the main statistical units everyone says it 's impossible
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 1016.61 1018.45 <o,f0,male> but this is what we would like to see isn't it
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 1019.49 1026.35 <o,f0,male> the publicly funded data is down here and we would like flowers to grow out on the net and one of the crucial
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 1035.27 1041.85 <o,f0,male> good news that the present new head of u n statistics he doesn't say it's impossible he only says we
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 1050.67 1059.24 <o,f0,male> so we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years we will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 1074.95 1084.52 <o,f0,male> is this that china is growing it's not so equal any longer and it's appearing here overlooking the united states almost like a ghost isn't it
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 1093.16 1102.44 <o,f0,male> but i think it's very important to have all this information we need really to see it and instead of looking at this
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 1102.69 1114.00 <o,f0,male> i would like to end up by showing the internet users per one thousand in this software we access about five hundred variables from all the countries quite easily it takes some
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 1114.44 1124.35 <o,f0,male> time to change for this but on the axises you can quite easily get any variable you would like to have and the thing would be
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 1124.57 1132.39 <o,f0,male> to get up the databases free to get them searchable and with a second click to get them into the graphic formats where you can
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 1134.04 1142.65 <o,f0,male> understand them now statisticians doesn't like it because they say that this will not show
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 1143.53 1151.24 <o,f0,male> the reality we have to have statistical analytical methods but this is hypothesis generating i end now with the world
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 1152.55 1162.89 <o,f0,male> there the internet is coming the number of internet users are going up like this this is the gdp per capita and it's a new technology coming in but then amazingly how well it
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 1163.80 1175.65 <o,f0,male> to the economy of the countries that's why the one hundred dollar computer will be so important but it's a nice tendency it's as if the world is flattening off isn't it these countries are lifting more than the economy
HansRosling_2006 1 HansRosling_2006 1175.95 1183.40 <o,f0,male> and will be very interesting to follow this over the year as i would like you to be able to do with all the publicly funded data thank you very much
