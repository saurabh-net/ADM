ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 60.46 75.34 <o,f0,female> has been with me ever since i was a child i remember i was about thirteen glued to a grainy black and white television in my parents living room as soviet tanks rolled into budapest
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 75.34 82.57 <o,f0,female> and kids not much older than me were throwing themselves at the tanks and getting mown down
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 82.57 92.04 <o,f0,female> and i rushed upstairs and started packing my suitcase and my mother came up and said what on earth are you doing and i said i 'm going to budapest

ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 139.45 149.5 <o,f0,female> bullies use violence in three ways they use political violence to intimidate
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 149.5 154.31 <o,f0,female> physical violence to terrorize
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 154.31 159.48 <o,f0,female> and mental or emotional violence to undermine
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 161.99 169.95 <o,f0,female> and only very rarely in very few cases does it work to use more violence nelson mandela
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 170.48 173.83 <o,f0,female> went to jail believing in violence
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 173.83 191.38 <o,f0,female> and twenty seven years later he and his colleagues had slowly and carefully honed the skills the incredible skills that they needed to turn one of the most vicious governments the world has known into a democracy
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 191.38 195.45 <o,f0,female> and they did it in a total devotion to non violence
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 195.45 210.78 <o,f0,female> they realized that using force against force doesn 't work so what
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 226.9 231.65 <o,f0,female> it 's my response my attitude to oppression
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 257 270.94 <o,f0,female> and meditation or self inspection is one of the ways again it 's not the only one it 's one of the ways of gaining this kind of inner power
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 270.94 277.66 <o,f0,female> and my heroine here like satish 's is aung san suu kyi in burma
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 277.66 297.66 <o,f0,female> she was leading a group of students on a protest in the streets of rangoon they came around a corner faced with a row of machine guns and she realized straight away that the soldiers with their fingers shaking on the triggers were more scared than the student protesters behind her
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 297.66 308.9 <o,f0,female> but she told the students to sit down and she walked forward with such calm and such clarity
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 309.01 318.43 <o,f0,female> and such total lack of fear that she could walk right up to the first gun put her hand on it
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 339.95 345.72 <o,f0,female> so what about our fear i have a little mantra
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 345.72 353.1 <o,f0,female> my fear grows fat on the energy i feed it
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 353.1 359.41 <o,f0,female> and if it grows very big it probably happens so we all know the
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 415.52 418.93 <o,f0,female> paralyzed with fear at coming to talk to you
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 450.33 470.22 <o,f0,female> but anger as an engine in an engine is powerful if we can put our anger inside an engine it can drive us forward it can get us through the dreadful moments and it can give us real inner power and i learned this
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 470.6 484.27 <o,f0,female> in my work with nuclear weapon policy makers because at the beginning i was so outraged at the dangers they were exposing us to that i just wanted to argue and blame and make them wrong
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 484.27 487.95 <o,f0,female> totally ineffective
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 506.6 522.37 <o,f0,female> and they 're doing what they think is best and that 's the basis on which we have to talk with them so that 's the third one anger and it brings me to the crux of what 's going on or what i perceive as going on in the world today which is that
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 539.47 556.35 <o,f0,female> it 's people joining up with people as bundy just said miles away to bring about change and peace direct spotted quite early on that local people in areas of very hot conflict
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 556.35 564.09 <o,f0,female> know what to do they know best what to do so peace direct gets behind them to do that
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 564.54 574.86 <o,f0,female> and the kind of thing they 're doing is demobilizing militias rebuilding economies resettling refugees
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 575.1 584.83 <o,f0,female> even liberating child soldiers and they have to risk their lives almost every day to do this
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 584.83 587.66 <o,f0,female> and
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 608.18 621.86 <o,f0,female> and i think that the u s military is finally beginning to get this up to now their counter terrorism policy
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 622.48 633.65 <o,f0,female> has been to kill insurgents at almost any cost and if civilians get in the way that 's written as collateral damage
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 652.2 663.7 <o,f0,female> so the training of the troops has to change and i think there are signs that it is beginning to change the british military have always been much better at this
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 678.37 681.64 <o,f0,female> in iraq actually
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 681.64 687.57 <o,f0,female> and suddenly people were pouring out of the houses on either side of the road screaming
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 687.58 697.12 <o,f0,female> yelling furiously angry and surrounded these very young troops who were completely terrified didn 't know what was going on couldn 't speak arabic
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 697.37 706.21 <o,f0,female> and chris hughes strode into the middle of the throng with his weapon above his head pointing at the ground and he said kneel
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 706.21 710.32 <o,f0,female> and these huge soldiers with their
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 731.04 739.56 <o,f0,female> that to me is wisdom in action in the moment that 's what he did
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 739.56 751.94 <o,f0,female> and it 's happening everywhere now you don 't believe me have you asked yourselves why and how

ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 780.59 788.01 <o,f0,female> and egypt and this hasn 't just happened
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 788.01 804.59 <o,f0,female> a lot of it is due to a book written by an eighty year old man in boston gene sharp he wrote a book called from dictatorship to democracy with eighty one methodologies for non violent resistance
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 804.59 809.4 <o,f0,female> and it 's been translated into twenty six languages it 's flown around the world
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 809.4 812.93 <o,f0,female> and it 's being used by young
ScillaElworthy_2012X 1 ScillaElworthy_2012X 812.93 820.2 <o,f0,female> people and older people everywhere because it works
