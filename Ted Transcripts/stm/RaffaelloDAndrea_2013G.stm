RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 38.12 40 <o,f0,male> quads have been around for a long time
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 40.25 57.61 <o,f0,male> the reason that they 're so popular these days is because they 're mechanically simple by controlling the speeds of these four propellers these machines can roll pitch yaw and accelerate along their common orientation on board are also a battery a computer various sensors and wireless radios
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 59.04 62.74 <o,f0,male> quads are extremely agile but this agility comes at a cost
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 63.68 70.87 <o,f0,male> they are inherently unstable and they need some form of automatic feedback control in order to be able to fly
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 75.74 78.35 <o,f0,male> so how did it just do that
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 79.26 87.9 <o,f0,male> cameras on the ceiling and a laptop serve as an indoor global positioning system it 's used to locate objects in the space that have these reflective markers on them
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 88.25 97.29 <o,f0,male> this data is then sent to another laptop that is running estimation and control algorithms which in turn sends commands to the quad which is also running estimation and control algorithms
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 101.85 107.29 <o,f0,male> the bulk of our research is algorithms it 's the magic that brings these machines to life
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 107.29 115.48 <o,f0,male> so how does one design the algorithms that create a machine athlete we use something broadly called model based design
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 115.48 129.39 <o,f0,male> we first capture the physics with a mathematical model of how the machines behave we then use a branch of mathematics called control theory to analyze these models and also to synthesize algorithms for controlling them
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 129.39 142.64 <o,f0,male> for example that 's how we can make the quad hover we first captured the dynamics with a set of differential equations we then manipulate these equations with the help of control theory to create algorithms that stabilize the quad
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 142.64 145.92 <o,f0,male> let me demonstrate the strength of this approach
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 148.97 164.39 <o,f0,male> suppose that we want this quad to not only hover but to also balance this pole with a little bit of practice it 's pretty straightforward for a human being to do this although we do have the advantage of having two feet on the ground and the use of our very versatile hands
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 164.5 178.42 <o,f0,male> it becomes a little bit more difficult when i only have one foot on the ground and when i don 't use my hands notice how this pole has a reflective marker on top which means that it can be located in the space
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 191.35 211.27 <o,f0,male> you can notice that this quad is making fine adjustments to keep the pole balanced how did we design the algorithms to do this we added the mathematical model of the pole to that of the quad once we have a model of the combined quad pole system we can use control theory to create algorithms for controlling it here you see that
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 214.46 220.05 <o,f0,male> it goes back to the nice balanced position
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 220.05 223.73 <o,f0,male> we can also augment the model to include where we want the quad to be in space
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 224.23 231.16 <o,f0,male> using this pointer made out of reflective markers i can point to where i want the quad to be in space a fixed distance away from me
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 247.72 250.73 <o,f0,male> the key to these acrobatic maneuvers is algorithms
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 250.84 265.96 <o,f0,male> designed with the help of mathematical models and control theory let 's tell the quad to come back here and let the pole drop and i will next demonstrate the importance of understanding physical models and the workings of the physical world
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 276.16 294.48 <o,f0,male> notice how the quad lost altitude when i put this glass of water on it unlike the balancing pole i did not include the mathematical model of the glass in the system in fact the system doesn 't even know that the glass of water is there like before i could use the pointer to tell the quad where i want it to be in space
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 320.29 330.22 <o,f0,male> you put these two things together the net result is that all side forces on the glass are small and are mainly dominated by aerodynamic effects which as these speeds are negligible
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 330.22 335.37 <o,f0,female> and
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 335.37 340.17 <o,f0,male> that 's why you don 't need to model the glass it naturally doesn 't spill no matter what the quad does
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 357.72 365.01 <o,f0,male> the lesson here is that some high performance tasks are easier than others and that understanding the physics of the
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 365.01 372.27 <o,f0,male> problem tells you which ones are easy and which ones are hard in this instance carrying a glass of water is easy balancing a pole is hard
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 373.72 381.77 <o,f0,male> we 've all heard stories of athletes performing feats while physically injured can a machine also perform with extreme physical damage
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 384.62 392.76 <o,f0,male> four fixed motor propeller pairs in order to fly because there are four degrees of freedom to control roll pitch yaw and acceleration
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 421.12 428.76 <o,f0,male> if we analyze the mathematical model of this machine with only two working propellers we discover that there 's an unconventional way to fly it
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 439.72 447.94 <o,f0,male> we relinquish control of yaw but roll pitch and acceleration can still be controlled with algorithms that exploit this new configuration
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 453.4 457.75 <o,f0,male> mathematical models tell us exactly when and why this is possible
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 457.78 462.44 <o,f0,male> in this instance this knowledge allows us to design novel machine architectures
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 462.73 465.26 <o,f0,male> or to design clever algorithms that
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 465.26 471.66 <o,f0,male> gracefully handle damage just like human athletes do instead of building machines with redundancy
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 471.66 484.98 <o,f0,male> we can 't help but hold our breath when we watch a diver somersaulting into the water or when a vaulter is twisting in the air the ground fast approaching will the diver be able to pull off a rip entry will the vaulter stick the landing
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 484.98 499.3 <o,f0,male> suppose we want this quad here to perform a triple flip and finish off at the exact same spot that it started this maneuver is going to happen so quickly that we can 't use position feedback to correct the motion during execution there simply isn 't enough time
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 499.3 518.34 <o,f0,male> instead what the quad can do is perform the maneuver blindly observe how it finishes the maneuver and then use that information to modify its behavior so that the next flip is better similar to the diver and the vaulter it is only through repeated practice that the maneuver can be learned and executed to the highest standard
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 530.95 538.84 <o,f0,male> striking a moving ball is a necessary skill in many sports how do we make a machine do what an athlete does seemingly without effort
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 562.33 576.1 <o,f0,male> this quad has a racket strapped onto its head with a sweet spot roughly the size of an apple so not too large the following calculations are made every twenty milliseconds or fifty times per second we first figure out where the ball is going
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 576.29 581.8 <o,f0,male> we then next calculate how the quad should hit the ball so that it flies to where it was thrown from
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 581.8 597.98 <o,f0,male> third a trajectory is planned that carries the quad from its current state to the impact point with the ball fourth we only execute twenty milliseconds worth of that strategy twenty milliseconds later the whole process is repeated until the quad strikes the ball
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 609.91 615.01 <o,f0,male> machines can not only perform dynamic maneuvers on their own they can do it collectively
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 615.21 618.82 <o,f0,male> these three quads are cooperatively carrying a sky net
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 633.72 643.14 <o,f0,male> perform an extremely dynamic and collective maneuver to launch the ball back to me notice that at full extension these quads are vertical
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 650.85 657.67 <o,f0,male> when fully extended this is roughly five times greater than what a bungee jumper feels at the end of their launch
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 670.87 675.54 <o,f0,male> re plan a cooperative strategy fifty times per second
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 676.46 680.57 <o,f0,male> everything we have seen so far has been about the machines and their capabilities
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 680.71 685.3 <o,f0,male> what happens when we couple this machine athleticism with that of a human being
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 685.3 694.35 <o,f0,male> what i have in front of me is a commercial gesture sensor mainly used in gaming it can recognize what my various body parts are doing in real time
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 694.35 705.35 <o,f0,male> similar to the pointer that i used earlier we can use this as inputs to the system we now have a natural way of interacting with the raw athleticism of these quads with my gestures
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 756.29 763.88 <o,f0,male> interaction doesn 't have to be virtual it can be physical take this quad for example it 's trying to stay at a fixed point in space
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 763.88 767.72 <o,f0,male> if i try to move it out of the way it fights me
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 768.49 773.86 <o,f0,male> and moves back to where it wants to be we can change this behavior however
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 774.28 785.38 <o,f0,male> we can use mathematical models to estimate the force that i 'm applying to the quad once we know this force we can also change the laws of physics as far as the quad is concerned of course
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 787.77 791.06 <o,f0,male> here the quad is behaving as if it were in a viscous fluid
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 816.39 821 <o,f0,male> so we can physically interact with these quads and we can change the laws of physics
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 821.13 822.84 <o,f0,male> let 's have a little bit of fun with this
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 823.34 836.44 <o,f0,male> for what you will see next these quads will initially behave as if they were on pluto as time goes on gravity will be increased until we 're all back on planet earth but i assure you we won 't get there okay here goes
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 886.82 889.87 <o,f0,male> thinking now these guys are having way too much fun
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 890.22 895.17 <o,f0,male> and you 're probably also asking yourself why exactly are they building machine athletes
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 896.06 901.38 <o,f0,male> some conjecture that the role of play in the animal kingdom is to hone skills and develop capabilities
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 901.42 905.08 <o,f0,male> others think that it has more of a social role that it 's used to bind the group
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 905.3 912.26 <o,f0,male> similarly we use the analogy of sports and athleticism to create new algorithms for machines to push them to their limits
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 913.13 916.4 <o,f0,male> what impact will the speed of machines have on our way of life
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 1 RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G 916.6 927.61 <o,f0,male> like all our past creations and innovations they may be used to improve the human condition or they may be misused and abused this is not a technical choice we are faced with it 's a social one
