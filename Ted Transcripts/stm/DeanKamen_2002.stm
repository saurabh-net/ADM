DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 12.77 19.63 <o,f0,male> pointed out every time you come here you learn something this morning the world 's experts from i guess three or four different companies
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 19.98 27.83 <o,f0,male> on building seats i think concluded that ultimately the solution is people shouldn 't sit down i could have told them
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 40.17 48.54 <o,f0,male> thirty and fifty years from today that they will be steering cars by wire without all that mechanical stuff
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 50.12 50.95 <o,f0,male> that's reassuring
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 56.37 65.41 <o,f0,male> they then pointed out there'd be sort of the other controls by wire to get rid of all that mechanical stuff that's pretty good but
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 66.04 71.58 <o,f0,male> get rid of the wires then you don't need anything to control the car except thinking about
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 76.25 82.32 <o,f0,male> i would love to talk about the technology and sometime in what's past the fifteen minutes i'll be happy
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 82.81 91.79 <o,f0,male> talk to all the techno geeks around here about what's in here but if i had one thing to say about this before we get to first
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 92.58 107.04 <o,f0,male> it would be that from the time we started building this the big idea wasn't the technology it really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it in the ibot for the disabled community the big idea here
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 108.08 117.95 <o,f0,male> is i think a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation and maybe to put that in perspective
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 140.07 148.69 <o,f0,male> for instance in that time ninety one percent of america lived either on farms or in small towns so the car
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 149.53 156.87 <o,f0,male> the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage was a big deal it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage it was half as long
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 172.65 185.75 <o,f0,male> and a million of them urinating and doing other things and the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable so the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 186.76 196.39 <o,f0,male> it also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm or their farm to a town or from a town to a city it all made sense with ninety one percent of the people living there
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 198.13 207.96 <o,f0,male> by the nineteen fifties we started connecting all the towns together with what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world the highway system and it is certainly
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 209.09 215.24 <o,f0,male> a wonder and by the way as i take shots at old technologies i want to assure everybody and
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 227.70 236.83 <o,f0,male> but think about where the world is today fifty percent of the global population now lives in cities that's three point two billion people
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 248.54 254.54 <o,f0,male> and fifty years ago locomotives got efficient enough steam power that we turned the continent into a country
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 255.73 265.48 <o,f0,male> over the last hundred years we started building cars and then over the fifty years we've connected every city to every other city in an extraordinarily efficient way and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 266.55 268.51 <o,f0,male> but during that entire process
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 269.08 280.15 <o,f0,male> more and more people have been born and more and more people are moving to cities china alone is going to move four to six hundred million people into cities in the next decade and a half
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 281.16 290.63 <o,f0,male> and so nobody i think would argue that airplanes in the last fifty years have turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 302.36 313.46 <o,f0,male> and i certainly wouldn't want to give up my airplane or my helicopter or my humvee or my porsche i love them all i don't keep any of them in my living room the fact is
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 315.50 327.55 <o,f0,male> the last mile is the problem and half the world now lives in dense cities and people spend depending on who they are between ninety and ninety five percent of their energy getting around on foot i think
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 329.17 340.65 <o,f0,male> i don't know what data would impress you but how about forty three percent of the refined fuel produced in the world is consumed by cars in metropolitan areas in the united states
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 342.63 351.67 <o,f0,male> three million people die every year in cities due to bad air and almost all particulate pollution on this planet is produced
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 352.71 359.96 <o,f0,male> by transportation devices particularly sitting in cities and again i say that not to attack any industry i think
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 360.51 362.08 <o,f0,male> i really do i love my airplane
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 362.85 371.91 <o,f0,male> and cars on highways moving sixty miles an hour are extraordinarily efficient both from an engineering point of view an energy consumption point of view
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 380.53 384.43 <o,f0,male> it's neither fun nor efficient nor productive it's not sustainable
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 395.55 400.09 <o,f0,male> if five percent of that population became quote middle class and wanted to
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 402.08 412.91 <o,f0,male> the way we've gone in the last hundred years at the same time that fifty percent of their population are moving into cities of the size and density of manhattan every six weeks it isn't sustainable environmentally
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 413.47 422.83 <o,f0,male> it isn't sustainable economically there just ain't enough oil and it's not sustainable politically i mean what are we fighting over right now we can make it complicated but
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 423.23 426.88 <o,f0,male> what's the world fighting over right now so it seemed to me
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 430.20 438.85 <o,f0,male> somebody had to work on that last mile and it was dumb luck we were working on ibots but once we made this we instantly decided it could be a great
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 439.34 448.85 <o,f0,male> alternative to jet skis you don't need the water or snowmobiles you don't need the snow or skiing it's just fun and people love to move around doing fun things
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 450.46 454.73 <o,f0,male> and every one of those industries by the way just golf carts alone is a multi billion dollar industry
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 456.08 468.67 <o,f0,male> rather than go license this off which is what we normally do it seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology but into an understanding of a world that's solved all its other problems but has somehow come to accept
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 469.23 477.32 <o,f0,male> that cities which right back from ancient greece on were meant to walk around cities that were architected and built for people
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 477.89 488.38 <o,f0,male> now have a footprint that while we've solved every other transportation problem and it's like moore 's law i mean look at the time it took to cross a continent in a conestoga wagon
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 489.49 499.36 <o,f0,male> railroad then an airplane every other form of transportation 's been improved in five thousand years we've gone backwards in getting around cities
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 500.05 510.14 <o,f0,male> they've gotten bigger they're spread out the most expensive real estate on this planet in every city wilshire boulevard or fifth avenue or tokyo
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 510.62 520.06 <o,f0,male> or paris the most expensive real estate is their downtowns sixty five percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars the twenty largest cities in the world
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 521.01 528.75 <o,f0,male> so you wonder what if cities could give to their pedestrians what we take for granted as we now go between cities
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 529.63 535.24 <o,f0,male> what if you could make them fun attractive clean environmentally friendly
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 541.46 543.80 <o,f0,male> access via this as that last link
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 544.42 545.72 <o,f0,male> to mass transit
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 546.59 553.61 <o,f0,male> to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs and use our cars the way we want and then have our cities energized again
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 556.03 558.13 <o,f0,male> we thought it would be really neat to do that
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 558.68 567.24 <o,f0,male> and one of the problems we really were worried about is how do we get legal on the sidewalk because technically i've got motors i've got wheels i'm a motor vehicle
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 568.00 573.27 <o,f0,male> i don't look like a motor vehicle i have the same footprint as a pedestrian i have the same unique capability
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 575.36 588.03 <o,f0,male> to deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space i took this down to ground zero and knocked my way through crowds for an hour i'm a pedestrian but the law typically lags technology by a generation or two and
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 588.68 592.59 <o,f0,male> if we get told we don't belong on the sidewalk we have two choices
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 600.78 604.54 <o,f0,male> maybe we should be out in the street in front of a greyhound bus or a vehicle
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 606.35 620.09 <o,f0,male> we've been so concerned about that we went to the postmaster general of the united states as the first person we ever showed on the outside and said put your people on it everybody trusts their postman and they belong on the sidewalks and they'll use it
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 622.47 630.18 <o,f0,male> he agreed we went to a number of police departments that want their police officers back in the neighborhood on the beat carrying seventy pounds of stuff
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 630.82 634.66 <o,f0,male> they love it and i can't believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 638.43 651.56 <o,f0,male> so we've been working really really hard but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop as an attitude about what's important and how to apply the technology we went out and we found some visionary people with enough
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 654.30 659.30 <o,f0,male> let us design and build these things and in hopefully enough time to get them accepted
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 660.62 668.46 <o,f0,male> so i'm happy really i am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want and yes it's really fun and yes you should all go out and try it
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 669.16 678.54 <o,f0,male> but if i could ask you to do one thing it's not to think about it as a piece of technology but just imagine that although we all understand somehow that it's reasonable
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 679.47 686.48 <o,f0,male> that we use our four thousand pound machine which can go sixty miles an hour that can bring you everywhere you want to go and somehow
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 688.33 693.17 <o,f0,male> it's also what we used for the last mile and it's broken and it doesn't work
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 694.97 698.17 <o,f0,male> one of the more exciting things that occurred to us about
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 698.93 707.18 <o,f0,male> why it might get accepted happened out here in california a few weeks ago after we launched it we were here with a news crew
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 707.35 715.13 <o,f0,male> on venice beach zipping up and back and he 's marveling at the technology and meanwhile bicycles are zipping by and skateboarders are zipping by
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 715.79 720.73 <o,f0,male> and a little old lady i mean if you looked in the dictionary a little old lady
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 722.04 726.45 <o,f0,male> came by me and now that i'm on this i'm the height of a normal adult now and
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 727.79 731.99 <o,f0,male> she just stops and the camera is there and she looks up at me and
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 733.31 734.61 <o,f0,male> says can i try that
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 735.96 749.30 <o,f0,male> and what was i you know how are you going to say anything and so i said sure so i get off and she gets on and with a little bit of the usual ah then she turns around and she goes about
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 750.25 759.46 <o,f0,male> twenty feet and she turns back around and she's all smiles and she comes back to me and she stops and she says
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 764.34 767.31 <o,f0,female> and the camera is looking down at her i'm thinking wow that was great
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 769.17 771.02 <o,f0,male> please lady don't say another word
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 774.66 779.35 <o,f0,female> and the camera is down at her and this guy has to put the microphone in her face said what do you mean by that
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 782.78 784.43 <o,f0,female> and she looks up and she says well
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 786.18 790.32 <o,f0,male> she's still watching these guys go she says i can't ride a bike no she says i can't use
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 791.43 796.12 <o,f0,male> a skateboard and i've never used roller blades she knew them by name she says and it's been
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 796.66 801.54 <o,f0,male> fifty years since i rode a bicycle then she looks up she's looking up and she says
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 802.52 810.92 <o,f0,male> and i'm eighty one years old and i don't drive a car anymore i still have to get to the store and i can't carry a lot of things and
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 811.73 819.33 <o,f0,male> it suddenly occurred to me that among my many fears were not just that the bureaucracy and the regulators and the legislators might not get it
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 820.32 831.62 <o,f0,male> it was that fundamentally you believe there's pressure among the people not to invade the most precious little bit of space left the sidewalks in these cities when you look at the
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 832.02 841.99 <o,f0,male> thirty six inches of legal requirement for sidewalk then the eight foot for the parked car then the three lanes and then the other eight feet it's that little piece is all that's there
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 843.28 853.42 <o,f0,male> but she looks up and says this and it occurs to me well kids aren't going to mind these things and they don't vote and business people and then young adults aren't going to mind these things they're pretty cool so i
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 854.59 863.07 <o,f0,male> i was worried that it's the older population that's going to worry so having seen this and having worried about it for eight years
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 863.59 871.83 <o,f0,male> the first thing i do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regulatory guys call aarp get an appointment right away we've got to show them this thing
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 872.59 879.94 <o,f0,male> and they took it to washington they showed them and they're going to be involved now watching how these things get absorbed
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 880.31 887.59 <o,f0,male> in a number of cities like atlanta where we're doing trials to see if it really can in fact help re energize their downtown
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 895.28 908.03 <o,f0,male> the bottom line is whether you believe the united nations or any of the other think tanks in the next twenty years all human population growth on this planet will be in cities
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 908.39 917.63 <o,f0,male> in asia alone it will be over a billion people they learned to start with cell phones they didn't have to take the one hundred year trip we took
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 932.06 942.32 <o,f0,male> being in a four thousand pound machine to do it cars were not meant for parallel parking they're wonderful machines to go between cities but just think about it we've solved all
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 943.14 952.26 <o,f0,male> long range high speed problems the greeks went from the theater of dionysus to the parthenon in their sandals you do it
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 952.61 964.77 <o,f0,male> in your sneakers not much has changed if this thing goes only three times as fast as walking three times a thirty minute walk becomes ten minutes your choice when living in a city
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 965.32 967.28 <o,f0,male> if it's now ten minutes
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 975.72 983.16 <o,f0,male> but if you could put a pin in most cities and imagine how far you could if you had the time walk in one half hour it's the city
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 983.90 993.30 <o,f0,male> if you could make it fun and make it eight or ten minutes you can't find your car un park your car move your car re park your car and go somewhere you can't get to a cab or
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 994.21 1005.33 <o,f0,male> we could change the way people allocate their resources the way this planet uses its energy make it more fun and we're hoping to some extent history will say we were right
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 1007.12 1013.56 <o,f0,male> that's segway this is a stirling cycle engine this had been confused by a lot of things we're doing
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 1014.12 1021.57 <o,f0,male> this little beast right now is producing a few hundred watts of electricity yes it could be attached to this and yes
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 1023.13 1028.16 <o,f0,male> kilogram of propane you could drive from new york to boston if you so choose
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 1053.33 1062.43 <o,f0,male> ten watt hours per kilogram in lead twenty watt hours per kilogram nickel cadmium forty watt hours per kilogram in nickel metal hydride sixty watt hours per kilogram in lithium
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 1062.75 1072.76 <o,f0,male> eight thousand seven hundred and fifty watt hours of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline which is why nobody drives electric cars but in any event if you can burn it
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 1073.55 1083.99 <o,f0,male> with the same efficiency because it's external combustion as your kitchen stove if you can burn any fuel it turns out to be pretty neat it makes just enough electricity to for instance do this
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 1084.32 1092.90 <o,f0,male> which at night is enough electricity in the rest of the world as mister holly doctor holly pointed out can run computers and a light bulb
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 1093.43 1096.33 <o,f0,male> but more interestingly the thermodynamics of this
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 1106.19 1117.79 <o,f0,male> if you wanted to boil water and re condense it at a rate of ten gallons an hour it takes about twenty five a little over twenty five point three kilowatt twenty five thousand watts of continuous power to do it
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 1118.32 1130.94 <o,f0,male> so much energy you couldn't afford to desalinate or clean water in this country that way certainly in the rest of the world your choice is to devastate the place turning everything that will burn into heat or drink the water that's available
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 1131.64 1138.75 <o,f0,male> the number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water depending on whose numbers you believe it's between sixty and eighty five thousand
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 1139.10 1140.42 <o,f0,male> people per day
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 1150.14 1157.47 <o,f0,male> we figured out how to put a vapor compression distiller on this thing with a counter flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat then using
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 1157.64 1165.33 <o,f0,male> a little bit of the electricity control that process and for four hundred and fifty watts which is a little more than half of its waste heat
DeanKamen_2002 1 DeanKamen_2002 1166.13 1176.50 <o,f0,male> it will make ten gallons an hour of distilled water from anything that comes into it to cool it so if we put this box on here in a few years could we have a solution to transportation
