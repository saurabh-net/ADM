LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 17.67 29.16 <o,f0,female> i want to start my talk today with two observations about the human species the first observation is something that you might think is quite obvious and that's that our species homo sapiens is actually really really smart
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 31.60 42.83 <o,f0,female> you're all doing things that no other species on the planet does right now and this is of course not the first time you've probably recognized this of course in addition to being smart we're also an extremely vain species
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 50.83 62.87 <o,f0,female> the fact that we're noble in reason and infinite in faculties and just kind of awesome er than anything else on the planet when it comes to all things cerebral but of course there's a second observation about the human species that i want to focus on a little bit more
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 71.20 78.83 <o,f0,female> when it comes to some aspects of our decision making now i'm seeing lots of smirks out there don't worry i'm not going to call anyone in particular out on any aspects of your own
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 89.62 98.35 <o,f0,female> just blow up in our face we've watched the financial markets that we uniquely create these markets that were supposed to be foolproof we've watched them kind of collapse before our eyes
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 113.79 126.22 <o,f0,female> but it turns out what social scientists are actually learning is that most of us when put in certain contexts will actually make very specific mistakes the errors we make are actually predictable we make them again and again
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 135.92 144.18 <o,f0,female> a real puzzle to me as a sort of scholar of human nature what i'm most curious about is how is a species that's as smart as we are
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 223.55 235.43 <o,f0,female> is a possibility that i worry a little bit more about because if it's us that's messed up it's not actually clear how we go about dealing with it we might just have to accept the fact that we're error prone and try to design things around it
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 264.30 278.67 <o,f0,female> this means that your great great great great great great with about five million greats in there grandmother was probably the same great great great great grandmother with five million greats in there as holly up here you know so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really distant but albeit evolutionary relative
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 291.10 298.25 <o,f0,female> what if we put holly into the same context as humans does she make the same mistakes as us does she not learn from them and so on
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 322.33 330.08 <o,f0,female> we should actually start in the financial domain maybe we should look at monkey 's economic decisions and try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 331.57 343.98 <o,f0,female> hit a sort second problem a little bit more methodological which is that maybe you guys don't know but monkeys don't actually use money i know you haven't met them but this is why you know they're not in the queue behind you at the grocery store or the atm you know they don't do this stuff
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 357.14 365.83 <o,f0,female> what you're looking at over here is actually the first unit that i know of of non human currency we weren't very creative at the time we started these studies so we just called it a token
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 366.21 373.55 <o,f0,female> but this is the unit of currency that we've taught our monkeys at yale to actually use with humans to actually buy different pieces of food
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 374.30 383.45 <o,f0,female> it doesn't look like much in fact it isn't like much like most of our money it's just a piece of metal as those of you who 've taken currencies home from your trip know once you get home it's actually pretty useless
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 383.78 393.13 <o,f0,female> was useless to the monkeys at first before they realized what they could do with it when we first gave it to them in their enclosures they actually kind of picked them up looked at them they were these kind of weird things
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 424.15 431.51 <o,f0,female> and waiting happily and getting her food here 's felix i think he 's our alpha male he 's a kind of big guy but he too waits patiently gets his food and goes on
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 431.91 437.78 <o,f0,female> so the monkeys get really good at this they're surprisingly good at this with very little training we just allowed them to pick this up on their own
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 474.75 485.27 <o,f0,female> the way this works is that our monkeys normally live in a kind of big zoo social enclosure when they get a hankering for some treats we actually allowed them a way out into a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 485.54 491.77 <o,f0,female> upon entering the market it was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human markets because as the monkeys entered the door of the market
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 492.40 502.11 <o,f0,female> human would give them a big wallet full of tokens so they could actually trade the tokens with one of these two guys here two different possible human salesmen that they could actually buy stuff from
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 514.91 527.19 <o,f0,female> and you can see that each of the experimenters is actually holding up a little yellow food dish and that's what the monkey can for a single token so everything costs one token but as you can see sometimes tokens buy more than others sometimes more grapes than others
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 537.28 542.84 <o,f0,female> all of a sudden the market opens here 's her choice one grapes or two grapes you can see honey very good market economist
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 545.67 551.75 <o,f0,female> teach our financial advisers a few things or two so not just honey most of the monkeys went with guys who had more
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 560.09 569.60 <o,f0,female> the more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economists to actually look at the monkeys data using economic tools they basically matched not just qualitatively
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 569.74 578.83 <o,f0,female> but quantitatively with what we saw humans doing in a real market so much so that if you saw the monkeys numbers you couldn't tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same market
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 589.51 602.51 <o,f0,female> well we already saw anecdotally a couple of signs that they might one thing we never saw in the monkey marketplace was any evidence of saving you know just like our own species the monkeys entered the market spent their entire budget and then went back to everyone else
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 602.90 608.44 <o,f0,female> the other thing we also spontaneously saw embarrassingly enough is spontaneous evidence of larceny
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 608.66 617.78 <o,f0,female> the monkeys would rip off the tokens at every available opportunity from each other often from us you know things we didn't necessarily think we were introducing but things we spontaneously saw
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 618.03 626.81 <o,f0,female> so we said this looks bad can we actually see if the monkeys are doing exactly the same dumb things as humans do one possibility is just kind of let the monkey
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 644.77 653.74 <o,f0,female> and so since the best way to see how people go wrong is to actually do it yourself i'm going to give you guys a quick experiment to sort of watch your own financial intuitions in action
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 654.23 667.18 <o,f0,female> so imagine that right now i handed each and every one of you a thousand u s dollars so ten crisp hundred dollar bills take these put it in your wallet and spend a second thinking about what you're going to do with it because it's yours now you can buy whatever you want donate it take it
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 681.03 690.67 <o,f0,female> so it's a chance to get more but it's pretty risky your other option is a bit safe your just going to get some money for sure i'm just going to give you five hundred bucks you can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 691.43 692.79 <o,f0,female> see what your intuition is here
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 705.97 718.38 <o,f0,female> well the so what comes when start thinking about the same problem set up just a little bit differently so now imagine that i give each and every one of you two thousand dollars twenty crisp hundred dollar bills now you can buy double to stuff you were going to get before
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 737.36 743.73 <o,f0,female> or you could play it safe which means you have to reach back into your wallet and give me five of those dollar one hundred bills for certain
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 744.30 756.38 <o,f0,female> and i'm seeing a lot of furrowed brows out there so maybe you're having the same intuitions as the subjects that were actually tested in this which is when presented with these options people don't choose to play it safe they actually tend to go a little risky
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 766.31 778.46 <o,f0,female> but people 's intuitions about how much risk to take varies depending on where they started with so what's going on well it turns out that this seems to be the result of at least two biases that we have at the psychological level
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 787.78 801.07 <o,f0,female> we find it very easy to think in very relative terms as options change from one time to another so we think of things as oh i'm going to get more or oh i'm going to get less this is all well and good except that changes in different directions actually
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 801.72 813.63 <o,f0,female> whether or not we think options are good or not and this leads to the second bias which economists have called loss aversion the idea is that we really hate it when things go into the red we really hate it when we have to lose out on some money
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 824.31 832.24 <o,f0,female> that means when we're in a risk mindset excuse me when we're in a loss mindset we actually become more risky which can actually be really worrying
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 877.36 883.41 <o,f0,female> the guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape so it looks pretty good but they're going to give the monkeys bonuses
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 883.58 895.99 <o,f0,female> the guy on the left is a safe bonus all the time he adds one to give the monkeys two the guy on the right is actually a risky bonus sometimes the monkeys get no bonus so this is a bonus of zero sometimes the monkeys get two extra
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 896.28 902.93 <o,f0,female> for a big bonus now they get three but this is the same choice you guys just faced do the monkeys actually want to play it safe
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 911.78 923.39 <o,f0,female> people here played it safe turns out the monkeys play it safe too qualitatively and quantitatively they choose exactly the same way as people when tested in the same thing you might say well maybe the monkeys just don't like
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 924.16 937.53 <o,f0,female> maybe we should see how they do with losses and so we ran a second version of this now the monkeys meet two guys who aren't giving them bonuses they're actually giving them less than they expect so they look like they're starting out with a big amount these are three grapes the monkey 's really psyched for this
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 937.80 946.73 <o,f0,female> but now they learn these guys are going to give them less than they expect they guy on the left is a safe loss every single time he 's going to take one of these away and give the monkeys just
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 947.32 956.62 <o,f0,female> the guy on the right is the risky loss sometimes he gives no loss so the monkeys are really psyched but sometimes he actually gives a big loss taking away two to give the monkeys only one
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 966.13 976.09 <o,f0,female> the remarkable thing to us is that when you give monkeys this choice they do the same irrational thing that people do they actually become more risky depending on how the experimenters started
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 993.94 1003.22 <o,f0,female> some of the kind of not so nice things we do like steal it and so on but they also do some of the irrational things we do they systematically get things wrong and in the same ways that we do
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1003.55 1015.15 <o,f0,female> this is the first take home message of the talk which is that if you saw the beginning of this and you thought oh i'm totally going to go home and hire a capuchin monkey financial adviser they're way cuter than the one at you know don't do that they're probably going to be just as dumb as the human one you already have
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1016.41 1025.60 <o,f0,female> so you know a little bad sorry sorry sorry a little bad for monkey investors but of course you know the reason you're laughing is bad for humans too because we've answered the question we started out with
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1026.14 1034.80 <o,f0,female> we wanted to know where these kinds of errors came from and we started with the hope that maybe we can sort of tweak our financial institutions tweak our technologies to make ourselves better
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1062.69 1070.85 <o,f0,female> well one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome you know think of our evolutionary predilection for eating sweet things fatty things like cheesecake
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1079.57 1089.19 <o,f0,female> my guess is that the same thing is going to be true when humans are perceiving different financial decisions when you're watching your stocks plummet into the red when you're watching your house price go down
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1089.47 1101.20 <o,f0,female> you're not going to be able to see that in anything but old evolutionary terms this means that the biases that lead investors to do badly that lead to the foreclosure crisis are going to be really hard to overcome
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1109.84 1116.14 <o,f0,female> which is that humans are not only smart we're really inspirationally smart to the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1116.52 1125.74 <o,f0,female> we're so good at overcoming our biological limitations you know i flew over here in an airplane i didn't have to try to flap my wings i'm wearing contact lenses now so that i can see
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1127.40 1137.25 <o,f0,female> on my own near sightedness we actually have all of these cases where we overcome our biological limitations through technology and other means seemingly pretty easily
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1137.52 1147.14 <o,f0,female> but we have to recognize that we have those limitations and here 's the rub it was camus who once said that man is the only species who refuses to be what he really is
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1147.69 1161.99 <o,f0,female> but the irony is that it might only be in recognizing our limitations that we can really actually overcome them the hope is that you all will think about your limitations not necessarily as unovercomable but to recognize them accept them
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1162.20 1173.41 <o,f0,female> and then use the world of design to actually figure them out that might be the only way that we will really be able to achieve our own human potential and really be the noble species we hope to all be thank you
