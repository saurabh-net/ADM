RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 12.40 24.94 <o,f0,female> this is the first of two rather extraordinary photographs i'm going to show you today it was taken eighteen years ago i was nineteen years old at the time i had just returned from one of the deepest dives i'd ever made at that time a little over two hundred feet and
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 25.75 36.32 <o,f0,female> i had caught this little fish here and it turns out that that particular one was the first live one of that ever taken alive i'm not just an ichthyologist i'm a bona fide fish nerd and to a fish nerd this is some pretty exciting stuff
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 36.60 50.22 <o,f0,female> and more exciting was the fact that the person who took this photo was a guy named jack randall the greatest living ichthyologist on earth the grand poobah of fish nerds if you will and so it was really exciting to me to have this moment in time
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 72.36 79.92 <o,f0,female> i learned two really important things that day the first thing i learned well i'm mortal that's a really big one and the second thing i learned was that
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 80.05 91.28 <o,f0,female> i knew with profound certainty this is exactly what i was going to do for the rest of my life i had to focus all my energies towards going to find new species of things down on deep coral reefs
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 91.80 99.89 <o,f0,female> now when you think of a coral reef this is what most people think of all these big hard elaborate corals and lots of bright colorful fishes and things but this is really just the tip of the iceberg
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 100.47 109.16 <o,f0,female> if you look at this sort of diagram of a coral reef we know a lot about that part up near the top and the reason we know so much about it is scuba divers can very easily go down there and access it
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 110.04 118.14 <o,f0,female> there is a problem with scuba though in that it imposes some limitations on how deep you can go and it turns out that depth is about two hundred feet i'll get into why
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 118.48 127.81 <o,f0,female> that is in just a minute but the point is scuba divers generally stay less than one hundred feet deep and very rarely go much below this at least not with any kind of sanity so to go deeper
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 142.95 152.70 <o,f0,female> that almost all research using submersibles has taken place well below five hundred feet now it's pretty obvious at this point that there's this zone here in the middle and that's the zone that really
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 153.18 161.27 <o,f0,female> centers around my own personal pursuit of happiness i want to find out what's in this zone we know almost nothing about it scuba divers can't get there submarines go right on past
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 161.71 170.96 <o,f0,female> it it took me a year to learn how to walk again after i had my diving accident in palau and during that year i spent a lot of time learning about physics and physiology of diving and figuring out how to overcome these limitations so
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 171.40 180.39 <o,f0,female> going to show you a basic idea we're all breathing air right now air is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen about twenty percent oxygen about eighty percent nitrogen is in our lungs and
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 180.68 186.96 <o,f0,female> there's a phenomenon called henry 's law that says that gases will dissolve into a fluid in proportion to the partial pressures which you're exposing them to so
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 197.27 206.68 <o,f0,female> the problem happens when you start to go underwater now the deeper you go underwater the higher the pressure is if you were to go down to a depth of about one hundred and thirty feet which is the recommended limit for most scuba divers
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 207.32 218.92 <o,f0,female> you get this pressure effect and the effect of that pressure is that you have an increased density of gas molecules in every breath you take and then over time those gas molecules dissolve into your blood and tissues and start to fill you up
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 219.26 231.85 <o,f0,female> now if you were to go down to say three hundred feet you don't have five times as many gas molecules in your lungs you've got ten times as many gas molecules in your lungs and sure enough they dissolve into your blood and tissues as well and of course if you were to down
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 245.94 257.12 <o,f0,female> the first limitation is the oxygen oxygen toxicity now we all know the song love is like oxygen you get too much you get too high not enough and you're going to die well in the context of diving you get too much you die also
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 257.57 267.72 <o,f0,female> you die also because oxygen toxicity can cause a seizure makes you convulse underwater not a good thing to happen underwater it happens because there's too much concentration of oxygen in your body
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 267.90 277.30 <o,f0,female> the nitrogen has two problems one of them is what jacques cousteau called rapture of the deep it's nitrogen narcosis it makes you loopy the deeper you go the loopier you get
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 313.76 324.48 <o,f0,female> and at the time really i wasn't the only one who didn't know what i was doing almost nobody did and this rig was actually used for a dive of three hundred feet but over time we got a little bit better at it and we came up with this really sophisticated looking rig with
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 358.29 365.94 <o,f0,female> three main advantages to a rebreather one they're quiet they don't make any noise two they allow you to stay underwater longer three they allow you to go deeper and
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 366.27 377.33 <o,f0,female> how is it that they do that well in order to really understand how they do that you kind of have to take off the hood and look underneath and see what's going on there are three basic systems to a closed circuit rebreather the most fundamental of these is called the breathing loop
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 388.62 402.96 <o,f0,female> the counterlungs aren't high tech they're just simply flexible bags they allow you to mechanically breathe or mechanically ventilate when you exhale your breath it goes in the exhale counterlung when you inhale a breath it comes from the inhale counterlung it's just pure mechanics allowing you to cycle air through this breathing loop
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 403.46 411.11 <o,f0,female> and the other component on a breathing loop is the carbon dioxide absorbent canister now as we breathe we produce carbon dioxide
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 422.10 431.17 <o,f0,female> so that's the breathing loop in a nutshell now the second main component of a closed circuit rebreather is the gas system now the primary purpose of the gas system is to
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 439.81 452.57 <o,f0,female> but if we only had an oxygen gas supply cylinder we wouldn't be able to go very deep because we'd run into oxygen toxicity very very quickly so we need another gas something to dilute the oxygen with and that
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 453.03 464.70 <o,f0,female> now in our applications we generally put air inside this diluent gas supply because it's a very cheap and easy source of nitrogen so that's where we get our nitrogen from but if we want to go deeper of course we need another gas supply we need
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 493.58 502.42 <o,f0,female> now normally you don't have to do that because all of it's done automatically for you with the electronics the third system of a rebreather the most critical part of a rebreather are the oxygen sensors
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 502.79 514.38 <o,f0,female> need three of them so that if one of them goes bad you know which one it is you need voting logic you also have three microprocessors any one of those computers can run the entire system so you have to lose two of them there's also back up power supplies
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 514.70 524.85 <o,f0,female> and of course there's multiple displays to get the information to the diver this is the high tech gadgetry that allows us to do what we do on these kind of deep dives and i can talk about it all day just ask my wife
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 550.69 562.65 <o,f0,female> then we just start dropping dropping dropping people have asked me it must take a long time to get there no it only takes a couple of minutes to get all the way down to three or four hundred feet which is where we're aiming for it's kind of like skydiving in slow motion it's really a very
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 576.09 588.38 <o,f0,female> and all of a sudden you're confronted with a tremendous amount of diversity much more than anyone used to believe now not all of it not all of it is new species like that fish you see with the white stripe that's a known species but if you look carefully
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 588.84 599.62 <o,f0,female> into the cracks and crevices you'll see little things scurrying all over the place there's a just unbelievable diversity it's not just fish either these are crinoids sponges black corals
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 609.16 615.91 <o,f0,female> find them but this is what it looks like and this kind of habitat just goes on and on and on for miles this is papua new guinea
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 629.50 638.25 <o,f0,female> high tech gear on your back you're in a remote reef off papua new guinea thousands of miles from the nearest recompression chamber and you're completely surrounded by sharks
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 647.41 651.80 <o,f0,female> you start talking like donald duck there's no situation in the world that can seem tense
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 700.12 710.69 <o,f0,female> now you've seen video like this on tv a lot and it's very intimidating and i think it gives the wrong impression about sharks sharks are actually not very dangerous animals and that's why we weren't worried much why we were joking around down there
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 722.63 732.35 <o,f0,female> by a shark so sharks aren't quite as dangerous as most people make them out to be now i don't know if any of you get u s news and world report i got the recent issue there's a
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 747.04 757.42 <o,f0,female> as a fish nerd i have to laugh because you know they don't call us fish nerds for nothing we actually do get excited about finding a new dorsal spine in a guppy but it's much more than that
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 768.19 779.12 <o,f0,female> this thing just look at the monetary value of this thing a couple of these ended up getting sold through the aquarium trade to japan where they sold for fifteen thousand dollars apiece that's half a million dollars a pound
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 798.46 808.26 <o,f0,female> with a black spot and i thought aw damn i should have caught one i think that's a new species and then eventually i got around to looking in my bucket sure enough i had caught one i just completely forgot that i had caught one
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 808.57 814.90 <o,f0,female> and so this one we decided to give the name centropyge narcosis to so that's it's official scientific name in reference to
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 815.84 824.54 <o,f0,female> this is another neat one when we first found it we weren't even sure what family this thing belonged to so we just called it the doctor seuss fish because it looked like something out of one of those books
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 825.26 838.04 <o,f0,female> now this one 's pretty cool if you go to papua new guinea and go down three hundred feet you're going to see this big mounds and this may be kind of hard to see but they're about oh a couple meters in diameter if you look closely you'll see there's a little white fish a little white and gray fish that hangs out near
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 862.64 872.68 <o,f0,female> quickly we find them we're up to seven new species per hour of time we spend at that depth now if you go to an amazon jungle and fog a tree you may get a lot of bugs but for fishes
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 884.42 897.48 <o,f0,female> there are only five to six thousand known species so a very large percentage of what is out there isn't really known we thought we had a handle on all the reef fish diversity evidently not and i'm going to just close on a very somber note at the beginning i told you
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 898.53 909.72 <o,f0,female> that i was going to show you two extraordinary photographs this is the second extraordinary photograph i'm going to show you this one was taken at the exact moment i was down there filming those sharks this was taken exactly three hundred feet above my head
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 911.45 916.41 <o,f0,female> and the reason this photograph is extraordinary is because it captures a moment in the very last minute of a person 's life
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 917.64 920.62 <o,f0,female> less than sixty seconds after this picture was taken this guy was dead
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 921.93 933.61 <o,f0,female> when we recovered his body we figured out what had gone wrong he had made a very simple mistake he turned the wrong valve when he filled his cylinder he had eighty percent oxygen in his tank when he should have had forty he had an oxygen toxicity seizure and he drowned
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 934.97 943.23 <o,f0,female> the reason i show this not to put a downer on everything but i just want to use it to key off my philosophy of life in general which is that we all have two goals
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 943.67 957.57 <o,f0,female> first goal we share with every other living thing on this planet which is to survive i call it perpetuation the survival of the species and survival of ourselves because they're both about perpetuating the genome and the second goal is for those of us who have mastered that first goal is to
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 958.04 966.89 <o,f0,female> you know you call it spiritual fulfillment you can call it financial success you can call it any number of different things i call it seeking joy this pursuit of happiness
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 967.40 975.55 <o,f0,female> so i guess my theme on this is this guy lived his life to the fullest he absolutely did you have to balance those two goals if you live your whole life in fear i mean
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 975.84 982.65 <o,f0,female> life is a sexually transmitted disease with one hundred percent mortality so you can't live your life in fear
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 987.67 995.25 <o,f0,female> but at the same time you don't want to get so focused on rule number two or goal number two that you neglect goal number one
RichardPyle_2004 1 RichardPyle_2004 995.57 1002.46 <o,f0,female> because once you're dead you really can't enjoy anything after that i wish you all the best of luck in maintaining that balance in your future endeavors thanks
