SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 19.61 21.3 <o,f0,male> the future of learning
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 27.64 30.58 <o,f0,male> i need to tell you a little story
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 30.62 32.77 <o,f0,male> which kind of sets the stage
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 32.99 39.97 <o,f0,male> i tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools where did it come from
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 56.57 58.75 <o,f0,male> and the biggest of the empires on this planet
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 61.85 63.77 <o,f0,male> trying to run the entire planet
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 64.61 66.18 <o,f0,male> without computers
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 66.54 68.15 <o,f0,male> without telephones
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 68.3 75.75 <o,f0,male> with data handwritten on pieces of paper and traveling by ships
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 76.01 77.81 <o,f0,male> but the victorians actually did it
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 77.91 79.46 <o,f0,male> what they did was
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 80.04 84.24 <o,f0,male> amazing they created a global computer
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 85.11 87.13 <o,f0,male> made up of people
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 87.66 93.55 <o,f0,male> it 's still with us today it 's called the bureaucratic administrative machine
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 94.59 98.28 <o,f0,male> in order to have that machine running
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 98.69 100.55 <o,f0,male> you need lots and lots of people
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 102.1 103.72 <o,f0,male> they made another machine
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 104.15 105.76 <o,f0,male> to produce those people
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 109.03 111.96 <o,f0,male> the school the schools would produce the people
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 112.49 118.65 <o,f0,male> who would then become parts of the bureaucratic administrative machine
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 118.99 120.55 <o,f0,male> they must be
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 121.02 123.21 <o,f0,male> identical to each other
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 128.98 130.61 <o,f0,male> they must be able to read
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 130.98 136.45 <o,f0,male> and they must be able to do multiplication division addition and subtraction in their head
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 137.02 140.72 <o,f0,male> they must be so identical that you could pick one up from new zealand
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 142.97 145.61 <o,f0,male> and ship them to canada and he would be instantly functional
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 146.65 149.38 <o,f0,male> the victorians were great engineers
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 149.49 152.54 <o,f0,male> they engineered a system that was so robust
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 153.22 154.77 <o,f0,male> that it 's still with us today
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 155.43 159.69 <o,f0,male> continuously producing identical people
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 160.29 163.85 <o,f0,male> for a machine that no longer exists
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 169.25 172.13 <o,f0,male> with that design that produces these identical people
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 192.74 194.78 <o,f0,male> it 's wonderfully constructed
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 195.5 197.46 <o,f0,male> it 's just that we don 't need it anymore
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 199.93 201.44 <o,f0,male> it 's outdated
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 201.81 208.28 <o,f0,male> what are the kind of jobs that we have today well the clerks are the computers they 're there in thousands in every office
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 208.64 213.46 <o,f0,male> and you have people who guide those computers to do their clerical jobs
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 213.97 216.94 <o,f0,male> those people don 't need to be able to write beautifully by hand
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 220.69 222.67 <o,f0,male> they do need to be able to read
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 222.95 226.76 <o,f0,male> in fact they need to be able to read discerningly
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 232.63 237.75 <o,f0,male> we know that people will work from wherever they want whenever they want in whatever way they want
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 250.41 254.99 <o,f0,male> i used to teach people how to write computer programs in new delhi fourteen years ago
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 267.38 272.38 <o,f0,male> at the same time we also had lots of parents rich people who had computers
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 295.69 299.98 <o,f0,male> i made a hole in the boundary wall of the slum next to my office
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 317.49 322.36 <o,f0,male> they said why have you put it there i said just like that and they said
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 326.79 329.77 <o,f0,male> about eight hours later we found them browsing
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 330.06 332.97 <o,f0,male> and teaching each other how to browse so i said well that 's impossible
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 333.38 340.54 <o,f0,male> because how is it possible they don 't know anything my colleagues said no it 's a simple solution
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 341.07 344.75 <o,f0,male> one of your students must have been passing by showed them how to use the mouse
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 345.32 355.7 <o,f0,male> so i said yeah that 's possible so i repeated the experiment i went three hundred miles out of delhi into a really remote village where the chances of a passing software development engineer
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 366.81 372.62 <o,f0,male> a couple of months found kids playing games on it when they saw me they said we want a faster processor and a better mouse
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 382.36 389.84 <o,f0,male> in an irritated voice they said you 've given us a machine that works only in english so we had to teach ourselves english in order to use it
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 396.48 399.19 <o,f0,male> teach ourselves said so casually
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 408.2 414.14 <o,f0,male> to his left is his student she 's six
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 414.66 416.78 <o,f0,male> and he 's teaching her how to browse
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 418.13 423.45 <o,f0,male> then onto other parts of the country i repeated this over and over again
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 439.28 441.19 <o,f0,male> and finally a girl
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 441.67 443.35 <o,f0,male> explaining in marathi
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 444.15 447.33 <o,f0,male> what it is and said there 's a processor inside
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 449.72 451.28 <o,f0,male> so i started publishing
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 451.94 467.66 <o,f0,male> i published everywhere i wrote down and measured everything and i said in nine months a group of children left alone with a computer in any language will reach the same standard as an office secretary in the west i 'd seen it happen over and over and over again
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 468.75 475.94 <o,f0,male> but i was curious to know what else would they do if they could do this much i started experimenting with other subjects
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 476.39 479.09 <o,f0,male> among them for example pronunciation
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 484.33 487.85 <o,f0,male> and they needed good pronunciation because that would improve their jobs
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 488.16 495.17 <o,f0,male> i gave them a speech to text engine in a computer and i said keep talking into it until it types what you say
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 525.75 527.87 <o,f0,male> in a very clear english accent
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 529.85 539.13 <o,f0,male> so then people said well how far will it go where does it stop i decided i would destroy my own argument
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 539.15 541.35 <o,f0,male> by creating an absurd proposition
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 555.51 557.96 <o,f0,male> and i said i 'll measure them they 'll get a zero
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 558.3 563.04 <o,f0,male> i 'll spend a couple of months i 'll leave it for a couple of months i 'll go back they 'll get another zero
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 581.34 587.77 <o,f0,male> the children came rushing said what 's all this so i said it 's very topical very important
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 621.9 626.62 <o,f0,male> so i said well what did i expect so i said okay but
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 630.67 632.49 <o,f0,male> so they said we haven 't given up
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 639.6 648.18 <o,f0,male> so a little girl who you see just now she raised her hand and she says to me in broken tamil and english she said well apart from the fact that improper replication
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 674.82 676.45 <o,f0,male> absurd but
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 691.2 693.95 <o,f0,male> a twenty two year old girl who was an accountant
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 694.17 697.9 <o,f0,male> and she played with them all the time so i asked this girl can you help them
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 698.02 700.41 <o,f0,male> so she says absolutely not
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 701.24 705.9 <o,f0,male> i didn 't have science in school i have no idea what they 're doing under that tree all day long
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 708.38 712.83 <o,f0,male> i said i 'll tell you what use the method of the grandmother
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 712.94 717.18 <o,f0,male> so she says what 's that i said stand behind them whenever they do anything you just say
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 717.21 719.26 <o,f0,male> well wow i mean how did you do that
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 726.66 730 <o,f0,male> she did that for two more months the scores jumped to fifty percent
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 730.86 738.21 <o,f0,male> kallikuppam had caught up with my control school in new delhi a rich private school with a trained biotechnology teacher
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 738.35 740.22 <o,f0,male> when i saw that graph i knew
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 740.38 743.08 <o,f0,male> there is a way to level the playing field
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 753.92 764.78 <o,f0,male> i got the camera angle wrong that one is just amateur stuff but what she was saying as you could make out was about neurons with her hands were like that and she was saying neurons communicate
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 772.18 774.13 <o,f0,male> well we know what they 're like today
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 774.48 779.85 <o,f0,male> what 's learning going to be like we know what it 's like today children pouring over with their mobile phones on the one hand
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 780.07 784.68 <o,f0,male> and then reluctantly going to school to pick up their books with their other hand
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 785.42 786.93 <o,f0,male> what will it be tomorrow
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 792.78 798.54 <o,f0,male> could it be that at the point in time when you need to know something you can find out in two minutes
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 815.64 819.05 <o,f0,male> knowing that 's what distinguishes us from the apes
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 825.88 827.62 <o,f0,male> and become homo sapiens
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 827.83 829.39 <o,f0,male> it took us only ten thousand
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 829.57 831.57 <o,f0,male> to make knowing obsolete
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 831.94 837.16 <o,f0,male> what an achievement that is but we have to integrate that into our own future
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 838.22 840.62 <o,f0,male> encouragement seems to be the key
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 840.9 844.62 <o,f0,male> if you look at kuppam if you look at all of the experiments that i did
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 844.8 846.32 <o,f0,male> it was simply
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 848.76 850.3 <o,f0,male> saluting learning
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 852.12 853.97 <o,f0,male> there is evidence from neuroscience
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 854.74 865.24 <o,f0,male> the reptilian part of our brain which sits in the center of our brain when it 's threatened it shuts down everything else it shuts down the prefrontal cortex the parts which learn
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 865.61 867.22 <o,f0,male> it shuts all of that down
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 867.83 877.51 <o,f0,male> punishment and examinations are seen as threats we take our children we make them shut their brains down and then we say perform
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 878.63 880.77 <o,f0,male> why did they create a system like that
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 881.52 887.84 <o,f0,male> because it was needed there was an age in the age of empires when you needed those people
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 887.96 892.82 <o,f0,male> who can survive under threat when you 're standing in a trench all alone
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 899.61 905.77 <o,f0,male> but the age of empires is gone what happens to creativity in our age
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 906.09 908.51 <o,f0,male> we need to shift that balance back
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 913.9 915.94 <o,f0,male> looking for british grandmothers
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 917.32 925.76 <o,f0,male> i put out notices and papers saying if you are a british grandmother if you have broadband and a web camera can you give me one hour of your time per week for free
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 926.22 930.8 <o,f0,male> i got two hundred in the first two weeks i know more british grandmothers than anyone in the universe
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 936.45 941.89 <o,f0,male> the granny cloud sits on the internet if there 's a child in trouble we beam a gran
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 942.48 946.38 <o,f0,male> she goes on over skype and she sorts things out
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 946.49 949.88 <o,f0,male> i 've seen them do it from a village called diggles
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 949.97 955.62 <o,f0,male> in northwestern england deep inside a village in tamil nadu india
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 955.66 957.34 <o,f0,male> six thousand miles away
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 957.45 962.56 <o,f0,male> she does it with only one age old gesture
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 990.52 994.45 <o,f0,male> i think what we need to look at is we need to look at learning
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 995.08 1008.77 <o,f0,male> as the product of educational self organization if you allow the educational process to self organize then learning emerges it 's not about making learning happen it 's about letting it happen
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 1009.06 1012.9 <o,f0,male> the teacher sets the process in motion
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 1012.91 1020.46 <o,f0,male> and then she stands back in awe and watches as learning happens i think that 's what all this is pointing at
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 1020.84 1023.14 <o,f0,male> but how will we know how will we come to know
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 1028.67 1047.05 <o,f0,male> they are basically broadband collaboration and encouragement put together i 've tried this in many many schools it 's been tried all over the world and teachers sort of stand back and say it just happens by itself and i said yeah it happens by itself how did you know that i said
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 1047.05 1050.15 <o,f0,male> you won 't believe the children who told me and where they 're from
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 1115.59 1122.45 <o,f0,male> they built the first curriculum but we 've lost sight of those wondrous questions we 've brought it down to
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 1128.96 1133.7 <o,f0,male> the way you would put it to a nine year old is to say if a meteorite was coming to hit the earth
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 1134.55 1137.96 <o,f0,male> how would you figure out if it was going to or not
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 1138.09 1145.57 <o,f0,male> and if he says well what how you say there 's a magic word it 's called the tangent of an angle and leave him alone he 'll figure it out
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 1146.47 1149.16 <o,f0,male> so here are a couple of images from soles
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 1151.32 1156.16 <o,f0,male> i 've tried incredible incredible questions
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 1156.45 1160.46 <o,f0,male> when did the world begin how will it end
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 1160.87 1165.19 <o,f0,male> to nine year olds this one is about what happens to the air we breathe
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 1165.71 1176.3 <o,f0,male> this is done by children without the help of any teacher the teacher only raises the question and then stands back and admires the answer
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 1187.14 1190.76 <o,f0,male> we don 't want to be spare parts for a great human computer do we
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 1191 1193.15 <o,f0,male> so we need to design
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 1193.22 1194.76 <o,f0,male> a future for learning
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 1195.23 1199.21 <o,f0,male> and i 've got to hang on i 've got to get this wording exactly right
SugataMitra_2013 1 SugataMitra_2013 1199.59 1214.49 <o,f0,male> because you know it 's very important my wish is to help design a future of learning by supporting children all over the world to tap into their wonder and their ability to work together help me build this school it will be called the school in the cloud
