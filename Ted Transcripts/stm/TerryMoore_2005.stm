TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 12.24 16.84 <o,f0,female> of
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 16.84 22.07 <o,f0,male> ted audience as a wonderful collection of some of the most effective intelligent intellectual
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 22.07 31.59 <o,f0,male> savvy worldly and innovative people in the world and i think that 's true however i also have reason to believe that many if not most of you
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 31.59 43.6 <o,f0,male> are actually tying your shoes incorrectly laughter now i know that seems ludicrous i know that seems ludicrous and believe me i lived the same sad life until about three years ago
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 43.6 53.23 <o,f0,male> and what happened to me was i bought what was for me a very expensive pair of shoes but those shoes came with round nylon laces and i couldn 't keep them tied
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 53.23 60.94 <o,f0,male> so i went back to the store and said to the owner i love the shoes but i hate the laces he took a look and said oh you 're tying them wrong
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 60.94 68.67 <o,f0,male> now up until that moment i would have thought that by age fifty one of the life skills that i had really nailed
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 68.67 74.16 <o,f0,male> was tying my shoes but not so let me demonstrate
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 79.96 84.26 <o,f0,male> now as it turns out
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 90.89 103.44 <o,f0,male> strong form and a weak form of this knot and we were taught to tie the weak form and here 's how to tell if you pull the strands at the base of the knot you will see that the bow will orient itself down the long axis of the shoe
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 103.58 105.69 <o,f0,male> that 's the weak form of the knot
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 105.69 117.33 <o,f0,male> but not to worry if we start over and simply go the other direction around the bow we get this the strong form of the knot
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 117.34 121.27 <o,f0,male> and if you pull the cords under the knot you will see that the bow
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 141.61 146.5 <o,f0,male> go the other way around the loop this is a little hard for children but i think you can handle
