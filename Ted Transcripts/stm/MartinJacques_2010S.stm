MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 17.00 23.12 <o,f0,male> changing with really remarkable speed if you look at the chart at the top here
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 32.33 40.81 <o,f0,male> and if you look at the chart for two thousand and fifty it's projected that the chinese economy will be twice the size
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 41.25 47.39 <o,f0,male> of the american economy and the indian economy will be almost the same size as the american economy
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 48.38 60.57 <o,f0,male> should bear in mind here that these projections were drawn up before the western financial crisis a couple of weeks ago i was looking at the latest projection by bnp paribas
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 61.12 63.01 <o,f0,male> for when china will
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 76.76 86.51 <o,f0,male> twenty that's just a decade away china is going to change the world in two fundamental respects
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 87.22 99.80 <o,f0,male> first of all it's a huge developing country with a population of one point three billion people which has been growing for over thirty years at around ten percent a year
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 100.33 108.23 <o,f0,male> and within a decade it will have the largest economy in the world never before in the modern era
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 108.98 120.97 <o,f0,male> has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country rather than a developed country secondly for the first time in the modern era
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 121.92 133.57 <o,f0,male> the dominant country in the world which i think is what china will become will be not from the west and from very very different civilizational roots
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 134.00 144.46 <o,f0,male> now i know it's a widespread assumption in the west that as countries modernize they also westernize this is an illusion
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 145.17 155.93 <o,f0,male> it's an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition markets and technology it is not it is also shaped equally by history and culture china is not like the west
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 156.40 163.96 <o,f0,male> and it will not become like the west it will remain in very fundamental respects very different
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 164.43 171.68 <o,f0,male> now the big question here is obviously how do we make sense of china how do we try to understand what china is and the problem we have
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 172.30 180.64 <o,f0,male> west at the moment by and large is that the conventional approach is that we understand it really in western terms using western ideas
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 181.21 194.46 <o,f0,male> we can 't now i want to offer you three building blocks for trying to understand what china is like just as a beginning the first is this that china
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 195.96 204.61 <o,f0,male> not really a nation state okay it's called itself a nation state for the last hundred years but everyone who knows anything about china knows it's a lot older than this
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 205.12 215.67 <o,f0,male> this was what china looked like with the victory of the qin dynasty in two hundred and twenty one b c at the end of the warring state period the birth of modern china and you can see it against the boundaries of modern china
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 216.08 226.89 <o,f0,male> or immediately afterward the han dynasty still two thousand years ago and you can see already it occupies most of what we now know as eastern china which is where the vast majority of chinese lived then and
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 227.13 235.00 <o,f0,male> live now now what is extraordinary about this is what gives china it's sense of being china what gives
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 236.00 245.62 <o,f0,male> the chinese the sense of what it is to be chinese comes not from the last hundred years not from the nation state period which is what happened in the west
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 247.27 253.73 <o,f0,male> from the period if you like of the civilization state i'm thinking here for example of
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 254.30 263.83 <o,f0,male> customs like ancestral worship of a very distinctive notion of the state likewise a very distinctive notion of the family social relationships like
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 272.97 281.93 <o,f0,male> unlike the western states and most countries in the world is shaped by its sense of civilization its existence as a civilization state rather than as a nation state and there's one
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 283.77 293.62 <o,f0,male> and that is this of course we know china 's big huge demographically and geographically with a population of one point three billion people what we often
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 294.54 301.75 <o,f0,male> really aware of is the fact that china is extremely diverse and very pluralistic
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 301.94 312.63 <o,f0,male> and in many ways very decentralized you can't run a place on this scale simply from beijing even though we think this to be the case it's never been the case
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 313.67 323.46 <o,f0,male> so this is china a civilization state rather than a nation state and what does it mean well i think it has all sorts of profound implications i'll give you two quick ones
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 324.44 333.79 <o,f0,male> the first is that the most important political value for the chinese is unity is the maintenance of
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 334.24 344.89 <o,f0,male> chinese civilization you know two thousand years ago europe breakdown the fragmentation of the holy roman empire it divided and it's remained divided ever since china
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 345.40 356.61 <o,f0,male> the same time period went in exactly the opposite direction very painfully holding this huge civilization civilization state together the second is
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 370.44 382.80 <o,f0,male> one country two systems and i'll lay a wager that barely anyone in the west believed them window dressing when china gets it's hands on hong kong that won 't be the case thirteen years on
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 403.39 415.92 <o,f0,male> one nation one system that is the nation state mentality but you can't run a country like china a civilization state on the basis of one civilization one system it
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 418.04 426.73 <o,f0,male> so actually the response of china to the question of hong kong as it will be to the question of taiwan was a natural response one civilization
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 427.30 436.23 <o,f0,male> many systems let me offer you another building block to try and understand china maybe not such a comfortable one
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 437.33 445.35 <o,f0,male> the chinese have a very very different conception of race to most other countries do you know of the
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 446.76 454.18 <o,f0,male> one point three billion chinese over ninety percent of them think they belong to the same race the
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 455.45 466.31 <o,f0,male> now this is completely different from the other world 's most populous countries india the united states indonesia brazil all of them
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 469.06 474.21 <o,f0,male> the chinese don't feel like that china is only multiracial really
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 475.10 482.91 <o,f0,male> the margins so the question is why well the reason i think essentially is again back to the civilization state
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 497.24 507.83 <o,f0,male> nurtured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity now the great advantage of this historical experience has been that
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 511.15 518.40 <o,f0,male> china could never have held together the han identity has been the cement which has held this country together
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 518.78 526.30 <o,f0,male> the great disadvantage of it is that the han have a very weak conception of cultural difference they really believe in
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 528.16 537.67 <o,f0,male> their own superiority and they are disrespectful of those who are not hence their attitude for example to the uyghurs and to
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 539.33 552.09 <o,f0,male> or let me give you my third building block the chinese state now the relationship between the state and society in china is very different from that in the west
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 553.09 566.22 <o,f0,male> now we in the west overwhelmingly seem to think in these days at least that the authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy the problem with this proposition is that
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 567.34 573.92 <o,f0,male> the chinese state enjoys more legitimacy and more authority
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 574.46 581.55 <o,f0,male> amongst the chinese than is true with any western state
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 583.15 594.54 <o,f0,male> and the reason for this is because well there are two reasons i think and it's obviously got nothing to do with democracy because in our terms the chinese certainly don't have a democracy and the reason for this is
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 596.49 608.44 <o,f0,male> because the state in china is given a very special it enjoys a very special significance as the representative the embodiment and the guardian
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 608.98 618.85 <o,f0,male> of chinese civilization of the civilization state this is as close as china gets to a kind of spiritual role
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 619.88 625.93 <o,f0,male> and the second reason is because whereas in europe and north america the state
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 626.84 635.92 <o,f0,male> power is continuously challenged i mean in the european tradition historically against the church against other sectors of the aristocracy against merchants and so on
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 636.26 640.44 <o,f0,male> for one thousand years the power of the chinese state
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 641.93 656.09 <o,f0,male> has not been challenged it's had no serious rivals so you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in china is very different from our experience in western
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 656.58 664.28 <o,f0,male> history the result by the way is that the chinese have a very different view of the state
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 665.55 678.42 <o,f0,male> whereas we tend to view it as an intruder a stranger certainly an organ whose powers need to be limited or defined and constrained the chinese don't see the
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 680.24 693.04 <o,f0,male> the chinese view the state as an intimate not just as an intimate actually as a member of the family not just in fact as a member of the family but as the head of the family the patriarch of the family
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 693.97 702.59 <o,f0,male> this is the chinese view of the state very very different to ours it's embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 702.79 710.35 <o,f0,male> the case in the west and i would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here in the chinese context
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 711.76 718.96 <o,f0,male> a new kind of paradigm which is different from anything we've had to think about in the past
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 720.43 732.82 <o,f0,male> that china believes in the market and the state i mean adam smith already writing in the late eighteenth century said the chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 733.23 741.01 <o,f0,male> in europe and apart from the mao period that has remained more or less the case ever since but this is combined with an extremely strong
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 741.58 755.39 <o,f0,male> and ubiquitous state the state is everywhere in china i mean it's leading firms many of them are still publicly owned private firms however large they are like lenovo depend in many ways on state patronage
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 767.48 775.27 <o,f0,male> this is a very old state tradition a very old tradition of statecraft i mean if you want an illustration of this the great wall is one
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 775.68 785.35 <o,f0,male> this is another this is the grand canal which was constructed in the first instance in the fifth century b c and was finally completed in the seventh century a d
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 785.82 794.74 <o,f0,male> it went for one thousand one hundred and fourteen miles linking beijing with hangzhou and shanghai
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 795.42 809.85 <o,f0,male> so there's a long history of extraordinary state infrastructural projects in china which i suppose helps us to explain what we see today which is something like the three gorges dam and many other expressions of state
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 810.22 820.94 <o,f0,male> competence within china so there we have three building blocks for trying to to understand the difference that is china the civilization state
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 821.52 827.90 <o,f0,male> the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 828.40 836.03 <o,f0,male> and yet we still insist by and large in thinking that we can understand china
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 836.16 850.65 <o,f0,male> by simply drawing on western experience looking at it through western eyes using western concepts if you want to know why we unerringly seem to get china wrong our predictions about what's going to happen to china
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 850.91 859.38 <o,f0,male> are incorrect this is the reason unfortunately i think i have to say that i think
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 861.47 870.99 <o,f0,male> attitude towards china is that of a kind of little westerner mentality it's kind of arrogant it's arrogant in the sense that we think that we
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 871.44 881.47 <o,f0,male> best and therefore we have the universal measure and secondly it's ignorant we refuse to really address the issue
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 881.78 891.92 <o,f0,male> of difference you know there's a very interesting passage in a book by paul cohen the american historian and paul cohen argues that the west
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 893.57 900.41 <o,f0,male> thinks of itself as probably the most cosmopolitan of all cultures but it's not
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 901.09 908.40 <o,f0,male> in many ways it's the most parochial because for two hundred years the west
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 908.66 916.18 <o,f0,male> has been so dominant in the world that it's not really needed to understand other cultures
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 916.85 925.30 <o,f0,male> other civilizations because at the end of the day it could if necessary by force get its own way
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 925.55 938.91 <o,f0,male> whereas those cultures virtually the rest of the world in fact which have been in a far weaker position vis a vis the west have been thereby forced to understand the west because of the west 's presence in those societies and
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 939.99 948.98 <o,f0,male> they are as a result more cosmopolitan in many ways than the west i mean take the question of east asia east asia japan korea china etc
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 949.61 958.57 <o,f0,male> the world 's population lives there now the largest economic region in the world and i'll tell you now that east asianers people from east asia are far more
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 960.08 968.52 <o,f0,male> about the west than the west is about east asia now this point is very germane i'm afraid
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 969.72 977.48 <o,f0,male> to the present because what's happening back to that chart at the beginning the goldman sachs chart what is happening is that
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 977.93 987.31 <o,f0,male> very rapidly in historical terms the world is being driven and shaped not by the old developed countries
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 987.96 996.24 <o,f0,male> but by the developing world we've seen this in terms of the g twenty usurping very rapidly the position of the g seven
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 997.40 1004.06 <o,f0,male> the g eight and there are two consequences of this first
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 1004.73 1008.00 <o,f0,male> the west is rapidly losing its
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 1022.62 1031.40 <o,f0,male> and that is what is going to happen in the future and the second implication is that the world will inevitably as a consequence become increasingly
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 1032.67 1039.56 <o,f0,male> to us because it'll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 1051.94 1056.51 <o,f0,male> are unaware about the way the world is changing
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 1056.77 1068.19 <o,f0,male> some people i've got an english friend in china and he said the continent is sleepwalking into oblivion well maybe that's true maybe that's an exaggeration
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 1068.55 1077.03 <o,f0,male> but there's another problem which goes along with this that europe is increasingly out of touch with the world and that is a sort of
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 1089.73 1095.95 <o,f0,male> is no longer true if you want to feel the future if you want to taste the future try china there's old confucius
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 1096.85 1105.65 <o,f0,male> this is a railway station the like of which you've never seen before it doesn't even look like a railway station this is the new guangzhou railway station for
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 1105.85 1114.21 <o,f0,male> the high speed trains china already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 1114.82 1123.00 <o,f0,male> or take this now this is an idea but it's an idea to by tried out shortly in a suburb of beijing here you have a
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 1124.68 1134.40 <o,f0,male> on the upper deck carries about two thousand people it travels on rails down a suburban road and the cars travel underneath it
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 1149.53 1160.69 <o,f0,male> so this is a solution to a situation where china 's going to have many many many cities over twenty million people okay so how would i like to finish
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 1162.32 1170.56 <o,f0,male> what should our attitude be towards this world that we see very rapidly developing
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 1173.60 1178.82 <o,f0,male> i think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it but i want to argue above all
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 1179.45 1186.81 <o,f0,male> picture positive for this world for two hundred years the world
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 1187.44 1189.49 <o,f0,male> was essentially
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 1199.81 1207.91 <o,f0,male> the arrival of countries like china and india between them thirty eight percent of the world 's population and others like indonesia and brazil and
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 1212.49 1219.13 <o,f0,male> the most important single act of democratization in the last two hundred years
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 1230.80 1238.60 <o,f0,male> as humanists we must welcome surely this transformation and we will have to learn about these civilizations
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 1239.19 1252.58 <o,f0,male> this big ship here was the one sailed in by zheng he in the early fifteenth century on his great voyages around the south china sea the east china sea and across the indian ocean to east africa
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 1254.14 1262.31 <o,f0,male> the little boat in front of it was the one in which eighty years later christopher columbus crossed the atlantic
MartinJacques_2010S 1 MartinJacques_2010S 1274.91 1282.47 <o,f0,male> i think they're playing golf christ the chinese even invented golf welcome to the future thank you
