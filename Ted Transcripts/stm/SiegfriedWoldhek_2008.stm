SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 16.92 17.66 <o,f0,female> good morning
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 18.29 21.86 <o,f0,male> let 's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 23.44 28.66 <o,f0,male> we're all familiar with his fantastic work his drawings his paintings his inventions his writings
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 29.42 31.18 <o,f0,male> but we do not know his face
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 31.86 38.13 <o,f0,male> thousands of books have been written about him but there's controversy and it remains about his looks
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 38.96 43.78 <o,f0,male> even this well known portrait is not accepted by many art historians so what do you think
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 44.35 47.59 <o,f0,male> is this the face of leonardo da vinci or isn't it
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 63.93 70.27 <o,f0,male> i find that hard to believe his contemporaries made faces like the ones you see here en face or three quarters
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 71.17 76.65 <o,f0,male> so surely a passionate drawer like leonardo must have made self portraits from time to time
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 78.50 82.16 <o,f0,male> so let 's try to find them i think that if we were to scan all of his work
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 82.82 86.64 <o,f0,male> and look for self portraits we would find his face looking at us
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 87.69 90.83 <o,f0,male> so i looked at all of his drawings more than seven hundred
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 91.22 95.79 <o,f0,male> and looked for male portraits there are about one hundred and twenty you see them here
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 97.17 105.99 <o,f0,male> which ones of these could be self portraits well for that they have to be done as we just saw en face or three quarters so we can eliminate all the profiles
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 106.86 108.86 <o,f0,male> it also has to be sufficiently detailed
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 109.21 114.41 <o,f0,male> so we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 115.32 122.64 <o,f0,male> and we know from his contemporaries that leonardo was a very handsome even beautiful man so we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 124.51 128.64 <o,f0,male> and look what happens only three candidates remain that fit the bill
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 131.01 132.86 <o,f0,male> yes indeed the old man is there
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 133.43 136.57 <o,f0,male> as is this famous pen drawing of the homo vitruvianos
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 137.07 141.78 <o,f0,male> and lastly the only portrait of a male that leonardo painted the musician
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 142.67 146.84 <o,f0,male> we go into these faces i should explain why i have some right to talk about them
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 147.35 153.54 <o,f0,male> i've made more than one thousand one hundred portraits myself for newspapers over the course of three hundred thirty years sorry thirty years
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 170.49 181.51 <o,f0,male> they have the same broad forehead the horizontal eyebrows the long nose the curved lips and the small well developed chin i couldn't believe my eyes when i first saw that there is no reason why these portraits should look alike
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 181.73 188.70 <o,f0,male> all we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self portrait and look they are very similar now
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 189.68 197.51 <o,f0,male> made in the right order the young man should be made first and as you see here from the years that they were created it is indeed the case they are made in the right order
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 197.73 209.93 <o,f0,male> what was the age of leonardo at the time does that fit yes it does he was thirty three thirty eight and sixty three when these were made so we have three pictures potentially of the same person of the same age as leonardo at the time
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 210.59 212.96 <o,f0,male> but how do we know it's him and not someone else
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 213.43 226.92 <o,f0,male> well we need a reference and here 's the only picture of leonardo that's widely accepted it's a statue made by verrocchio of david for which leonardo posed as a boy of fifteen and if we now compare the face of the statue
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 227.32 228.88 <o,f0,male> with the face of the musician
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 229.31 235.35 <o,f0,male> you see the very same features again the statue is the reference and it connects the identity of leonardo to those three faces
