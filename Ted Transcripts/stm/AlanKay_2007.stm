AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 16.00 17.73 <o,f0,male> great way to start i think
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 18.28 21.37 <o,f0,male> with my view of simplicity is to
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 21.83 29.78 <o,f0,male> take a look at ted here you are understanding why we're here what's going on with no difficulty at all
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 31.29 41.37 <o,f0,male> the best ai in the planet would find it complex and confusing and my little dog watson would find it simple and understandable but would miss the point
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 45.72 47.87 <o,f0,male> have a great time and of course if you're a speaker
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 51.69 52.92 <o,f0,male> like hans rosling
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 53.53 61.06 <o,f0,male> a speaker finds this complex tricky but in hans rosling 's case he had a secret weapon yesterday literally
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 61.76 70.38 <o,f0,male> in his sword swallowing act and i must say i thought of quite a few objects that i might try to swallow today and finally gave up
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 71.93 73.11 <o,f0,male> he just did it and that was
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 74.35 77.32 <o,f0,male> wonderful thing so puck meant
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 78.23 89.73 <o,f0,male> not only are we fools in the pejorative sense but that we're easily fooled in fact what shakespeare was pointing out is we go to the theater in order to be fooled so we're actually looking forward to it
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 91.04 93.55 <o,f0,male> we go to magic shows in order to be fooled
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 94.76 96.05 <o,f0,male> and this makes
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 97.02 99.75 <o,f0,male> many things fun but it makes it difficult
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 100.55 105.43 <o,f0,male> to actually get any kind of picture on the world we live in or on ourselves
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 115.40 118.15 <o,f0,male> the problem you have with
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 118.74 124.82 <o,f0,male> to draw is not that you can't move your hand but that the way your brain perceives images
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 126.50 127.38 <o,f0,male> is faulty
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 128.04 136.11 <o,f0,male> trying to perceive images into objects rather than seeing what's there and to prove it she says the exact size and shape of these tabletops
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 136.59 139.57 <o,f0,male> is the same and i'm going to prove it to you
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 140.41 144.91 <o,f0,male> she does this with cardboard but since i have an expensive computer here
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 145.90 147.83 <o,f0,male> rotate this little guy around and
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 151.90 161.95 <o,f0,male> now having seen that and i've seen it hundreds of times because i use this in every talk i give i still can't see that they're the same size and shape and i doubt that you can either
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 168.98 172.88 <o,f0,male> measure very very carefully and if you measure very very carefully with a stiff arm
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 173.48 177.00 <o,f0,male> a straight edge you'll see that those two shapes are exactly
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 178.15 180.59 <o,f0,male> same size and the talmud
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 182.13 191.09 <o,f0,male> saw this a long time ago saying we see things not as they are but as we are i certainly would like to know what happened to the person who had that insight
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 191.78 196.67 <o,f0,male> back then if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 202.99 209.03 <o,f0,male> what we call reality is a kind of hallucination happening inside here it's a waking dream
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 209.68 211.74 <o,f0,male> and understanding that that is what
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 212.54 213.91 <o,f0,male> we actually exist in
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 215.05 228.58 <o,f0,male> one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history and what that means simple and understandable might not be actually simple or understandable and things we think are complex might be made simple and understandable
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 230.88 236.44 <o,f0,male> somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our flaws we can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 238.24 242.33 <o,f0,male> the way i think of it is we can't learn to see until we admit we're blind
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 249.30 251.15 <o,f0,male> finding ways to see things and
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 259.46 266.72 <o,f0,male> little additional parts for our brain made out of powerful ideas that help us see the world in different ways and
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 267.54 269.90 <o,f0,male> these are in the form of sensory apparatus
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 277.10 281.59 <o,f0,male> most importantly in the ability to change perspective on things
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 282.10 287.95 <o,f0,male> i'll talk about that a little bit it's this change in perspective and what it is we think we're perceiving
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 288.82 290.96 <o,f0,male> that has helped us make more
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 297.56 302.89 <o,f0,male> not taught in any k through twelve curriculum in america that i'm aware of
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 308.10 311.89 <o,f0,male> one of the things that goes from simple to complex is when we do more
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 319.36 322.66 <o,f0,male> and in fact we can keep on doing it for a very long time
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 324.20 327.60 <o,f0,male> but murray gell mann yesterday talked about emergent properties
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 328.80 332.59 <o,f0,male> another name for them could be architecture as a metaphor
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 333.27 335.64 <o,f0,male> for taking the same old material and
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 338.86 341.85 <o,f0,male> non obvious non simple ways of combining it
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 344.67 355.02 <o,f0,male> what murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature of having the descriptions at various levels be rather
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 356.13 364.55 <o,f0,male> similar all goes down to the idea that the elementary particles are both sticky and stand offish
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 365.44 367.83 <o,f0,male> and they're in violent motion
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 368.93 371.80 <o,f0,male> those three things give rise to all the different levels
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 380.11 381.93 <o,f0,male> so when i saw the roslings
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 388.05 394.06 <o,f0,male> in conveying complex ideas simply but then i had a thought of boy maybe it's too simple
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 394.62 405.69 <o,f0,male> and i put some effort in to try and check to see how well these simple portrayals of trends over time actually matched up with
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 406.19 414.90 <o,f0,male> some ideas and investigations from the side and i found that they matched up very well so the roslings have been able to do simplicity
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 416.04 419.08 <o,f0,male> without removing what's important about the data
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 420.07 421.04 <o,f0,male> whereas the
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 422.45 430.73 <o,f0,male> film yesterday that we saw of the simulation of the inside of a cell as a former molecular biologist i didn't like that at all
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 432.27 442.55 <o,f0,male> not because it wasn't beautiful or anything but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand about molecular biology and that is why is there
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 443.45 450.30 <o,f0,male> any probability at all of two complex shapes finding each other just the right way so they combine together and be catalyzed
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 451.60 458.90 <o,f0,male> and what we saw yesterday was every reaction was fortuitous they just swooped in the air and bound and something
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 461.90 466.32 <o,f0,male> those molecules are spinning at the rate of about a million revolutions per second
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 468.30 473.49 <o,f0,male> agitating back and forth their size every two nanoseconds
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 473.93 482.52 <o,f0,male> they're completely crowded together they're jammed they're bashing up against each other and if you don't understand that in your mental model of this stuff
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 483.68 491.88 <o,f0,male> what happens inside of a cell seems completely mysterious and fortuitous and i think that's exactly the wrong image for when you're trying to teach science
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 495.89 504.46 <o,f0,male> so another thing that we do is to confuse adult sophistication with the actual understanding of some principle
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 505.24 507.81 <o,f0,male> so a kid who 's fourteen in high school
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 509.61 510.39 <o,f0,male> this version of the
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 524.59 526.88 <o,f0,male> direct one one that gives you more of the feeling
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 527.86 532.28 <o,f0,male> of math is something closer to pythagoras own proof which goes like this
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 532.93 536.48 <o,f0,male> so here we have this triangle and if we surround that
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 537.25 539.94 <o,f0,male> c square with three more triangles
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 540.63 543.24 <o,f0,male> and we copy that notice that we can
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 553.49 554.82 <o,f0,male> that is all you have to do
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 556.46 558.65 <o,f0,male> and this kind of proof is the kind of proof
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 574.18 575.89 <o,f0,male> now let 's go to young children
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 577.70 580.09 <o,f0,male> this is a very unusual teacher who
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 581.65 594.36 <o,f0,male> was a kindergarten and first grade teacher but was a natural mathematician so she was like that jazz musician friend you have who never studied music but is a terrific musician she just had a feeling for math and
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 595.61 598.30 <o,f0,male> here are her six year olds and she's got them
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 599.62 601.45 <o,f0,male> making shapes out of a shape
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 615.66 629.39 <o,f0,male> and this teacher did on every project was to have the children act like first it was a creative arts project and then something like science so they'd created these artifacts now she had them look at them
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 629.85 632.04 <o,f0,male> and do this laborious which i thought
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 633.01 637.03 <o,f0,male> for a long time until she explained to me was to slow them down
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 637.70 639.43 <o,f0,male> so they'll think so they're cutting out the
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 642.59 644.50 <o,f0,male> but the whole point of this thing is
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 646.97 650.98 <o,f0,male> them to look at this chart and fill it out
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 651.50 658.22 <o,f0,male> what have you noticed about what you did and so six year old lauren there noticed that the first one took one
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 659.15 661.81 <o,f0,male> and the second one took three more
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 663.29 666.81 <o,f0,male> and the total was four on that one the third one took five more
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 667.50 671.95 <o,f0,male> and the total was nine on that one and then the next one so she saw right away that
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 672.96 678.99 <o,f0,male> the additional tiles that you had to add around the edges was always going to grow by two
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 679.42 686.82 <o,f0,male> so she was very confident about how she made those numbers there and she could see that these were the square numbers up until about six
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 696.16 698.29 <o,f0,male> so that's what lauren did and then the teacher
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 699.03 706.47 <o,f0,male> gillian ishijima had the kids bring all of their projects up to the front of the room and put them on the floor and everybody went batshit
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 712.35 716.02 <o,f0,male> no matter what the shapes were the growth law is the same
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 717.07 725.84 <o,f0,male> and the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd will recognize these two progressions as a first order discrete differential equation and a second order discrete
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 730.96 731.72 <o,f0,male> by six year olds
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 737.67 738.75 <o,f0,male> so let 's take a look now
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 741.28 743.49 <o,f0,male> how we might use the computer for some of this
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 744.61 750.75 <o,f0,male> and so the first idea here is just to show you the kind of things that children
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 752.01 757.57 <o,f0,male> do i'm using the software that we're putting on the one hundred dollar laptop
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 758.90 760.14 <o,f0,male> so i'd like to draw a little
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 782.70 785.13 <o,f0,male> and here 's a little behavior car forward
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 785.97 792.37 <o,f0,male> each time i click it car turn if i want to make a little script to do this over and over again i just drag these guys out
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 805.89 808.81 <o,f0,male> goes straight that's a bit of a revelation for nine year olds
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 813.09 819.07 <o,f0,male> a little bit like kissing your sister as far as driving a car so the kids want to do a steering wheel
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 820.19 821.64 <o,f0,male> so they draw a steering wheel
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 825.52 826.00 <o,f0,male> we'll
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 841.78 848.17 <o,f0,male> there and to just drop it into the script here and now i can steer the car with the steering wheel
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 895.63 900.26 <o,f0,male> we get a visual pattern of what these nine year olds called acceleration
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 901.96 903.72 <o,f0,male> so how did the children do science
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 907.29 907.63 <o,f0,female> to the
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 916.59 917.18 <o,f0,female> not
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 973.05 982.04 <o,f0,male> because of course he didn't bother doing the experiment and neither did st thomas aquinas and it was not until galileo actually did it that an adult thought like a child
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 982.57 983.98 <o,f0,male> only four hundred years ago
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 985.70 989.04 <o,f0,male> we get one child like that about every classroom of thirty kids
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 990.03 996.46 <o,f0,male> will actually cut straight to the chase now what if we want to look at this more closely we can take a movie
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 997.35 1011.32 <o,f0,male> of what's going on but even if we single stepped this movie it's tricky to see what's going on and so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side or stack them up so when the children see this they say ah acceleration
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1023.67 1030.81 <o,f0,male> so what i'm doing is measuring from the bottom of one image to the bottom of the next image about a fifth of a second later
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1031.96 1036.39 <o,f0,male> like that and they're getting faster and faster each time and if i stack these guys
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1041.42 1045.72 <o,f0,male> then we see the differences the increase in the speed
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1046.46 1053.73 <o,f0,male> is constant and they say oh yeah constant acceleration we've done that already and how shall we
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1056.56 1058.40 <o,f0,male> and verify that we actually
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1066.22 1068.25 <o,f0,male> the ball and run the movie at the same time
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1080.25 1084.62 <o,f0,male> very cleverly by running a ball down backwards down the strings of his lute
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1086.03 1091.02 <o,f0,male> i pulled out those apples to remind myself to tell you that this is actually
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1104.84 1106.60 <o,f0,male> this stuff works here
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1110.46 1120.45 <o,f0,male> gravity here 's this increase the speed by something increase the ship 's speed if i start the little game here that the kids have done it'll crash the
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1122.33 1124.74 <o,f0,male> but if i oppose gravity here we
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1149.77 1157.39 <o,f0,male> but in fact if you think of it children are the future we send to the future forget about messages children are the future
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1167.35 1172.97 <o,f0,male> this summer we're going to build five million of these one hundred dollar laptops and maybe fifty million next year
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1174.04 1174.77 <o,f0,male> but we
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1181.10 1189.61 <o,f0,male> that means that we once again have a thing where we can put technology out but the mentoring that is required to go from
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1220.08 1222.18 <o,f0,male> dollars so this is actually cheap
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1222.96 1224.28 <o,f0,male> and einstein said
