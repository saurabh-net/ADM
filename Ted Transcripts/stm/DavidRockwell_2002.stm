DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 22.34 29.19 <o,f0,male> question him rather than speaking in fact what we're going to talk about i think is in fact
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 31.63 35.03 <o,f0,male> a subject that is probably better served by a conversation
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 38.53 41.40 <o,f0,male> a bit of news clip to
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 45.44 52.02 <o,f0,male> since the september eleventh attack on the world trade center many people have flocked to downtown new york to see and pay respects at
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 52.40 54.96 <o,f0,male> what amounts to the sixteen acre burial ground
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 55.81 61.83 <o,f0,male> now as cbs 's jim axelrod reports they're putting the finishing touches on a new way for people to visit and view the
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 63.82 71.01 <o,f0,male> forget the empire state building or the statue of liberty there's a new place in new york where the crowds are thickest ground zero
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 71.91 74.54 <o,f0,male> my step daughter here from indianapolis
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 75.03 82.77 <o,f0,male> this was out of all the tourist sites in new york city this was her number one pick ja thousands now line up on lower broadway
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 88.24 93.36 <o,f0,male> even on the coldest winter days to honor and remember it's reality
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 97.08 105.72 <o,f0,male> so many in fact that seeing has become a bit of a problem but i think that people are very frustrated that they're not able to get closer to see what's going on
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 119.21 128.48 <o,f0,male> they'll get an incredible panorama and understand i think more completely the sheer totality of the destruction of the
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 129.31 130.34 <o,f0,male> if you think about it
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 134.71 136.73 <o,f0,male> the grand canyon or the washington monument
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 137.32 139.82 <o,f0,male> people come here to see what's no longer there
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 140.40 145.54 <o,f0,male> first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site but as
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 146.60 147.25 <o,f0,male> moving burial
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 147.94 155.01 <o,f0,male> the walls are bare by design so people can fill them with their own memorials the way they already have along the current
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 155.72 165.00 <o,f0,male> from our hearts it affected us just as much ja the ramps are made of simple material the kind of plywood you see at construction sites which is really the whole point
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 165.48 168.02 <o,f0,male> in the face of america 's worst destruction
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 173.00 186.65 <o,f0,male> this is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment but certainly david you are known as i know a phrase you hate an entertainment architect
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 188.19 190.67 <o,f0,male> your work is highly sensual
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 190.81 193.26 <o,f0,male> even hedonistic dr i like that
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 195.76 199.46 <o,f0,male> it's about pleasure casinos and hotels and restaurants
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 202.13 206.09 <o,f0,male> how did the shock that all of us and especially all of us in new york felt on the
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 212.96 216.54 <o,f0,male> well the truth of the matter is post september eleventh
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 218.13 223.13 <o,f0,male> i felt myself in the role originally first of all as someone who lives in tribeca
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 223.73 234.48 <o,f0,male> and whose neighborhood was devastated and as someone who works less than a mile from there that i was in the role of forcing one hundred people who work
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 255.32 263.77 <o,f0,male> found myself the friday after september eleventh two days afterwards literally unable to motivate anyone and to do anything we
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 264.42 266.11 <o,f0,male> gave the office a few days off
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 268.27 271.32 <o,f0,male> in discussing this with other architects
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 280.83 289.88 <o,f0,male> and i thought it was astonishing to speculate as if this were a competition on something that was such a fresh wound and
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 290.82 298.04 <o,f0,male> had a series of discussions first with rick scofidio and liz diller who collaborated with us on this and several other people
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 298.87 301.62 <o,f0,male> and really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 302.85 306.73 <o,f0,male> and that as people who create places the
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 308.02 313.80 <o,f0,male> way to help wasn't to pontificate or to make up scenarios but to help right now
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 314.70 321.36 <o,f0,male> so we tried to come up with a way as a group to have a kind of design swat team and that was the mission that we came up with
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 323.73 331.43 <o,f0,male> were you conscious of suddenly as a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants suddenly
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 335.36 338.48 <o,f0,male> well what i was aware of was there was this overwhelming need
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 342.67 352.68 <o,f0,male> we were asked to participate in a few projects before this there was a school ps two hundred and thirty four that had been evacuated down at
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 353.27 365.63 <o,f0,male> ground zero they moved to an abandoned school we took about twenty or thirty architects and designers and artists and over four days it was like this urban barn raising to renovate it and everyone wanted to help it was just extraordinary
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 365.89 372.02 <o,f0,male> tom otterness contributed maira kalman contributed and it became this cathartic experience for us
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 383.04 387.99 <o,f0,male> as this project and this is only one of four that you've designed to surround the site you
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 391.37 396.51 <o,f0,male> against the incredibly byzantine entrenched
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 418.73 429.09 <o,f0,male> that had to do with long term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city and the fact is that there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled and there was talk
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 440.00 448.47 <o,f0,male> white rich corporate group that was not representative of the city ka shocking dr yeah surprising
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 450.30 450.68 <o,f0,male> so
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 451.35 452.86 <o,f0,male> rick and liz and kevin and i
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 454.49 455.60 <o,f0,male> came up with the idea
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 456.64 469.58 <o,f0,male> the city actually approached us we first approached the city about pier ninety four we saw how ps two hundred and thirty four worked the families the victims of the families were going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing ka on the hudson river dr yeah
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 470.14 482.98 <o,f0,male> and the city actually through tim zagat initially and then through christyne nicholas then we got to giuliani said you know we don't want to do anything with pier ninety four right now but we have an observation platform for the families down at ground zero
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 483.36 491.09 <o,f0,male> that we'd like to be a more dignified experience for the families and a way to protect it from the weather so i went down there with rick and liz and kevin
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 491.77 505.57 <o,f0,male> and i've got to say it was the most moving experience of my life it was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it where the families of the victims had left notes to them and
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 506.80 516.79 <o,f0,male> mediation between us and the experience there was no filter and i remembered on september eleventh on fourteenth street the roof of our building we can see the world trade towers
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 524.05 534.76 <o,f0,male> from a conference room on the eighth floor on a tv that we had set up and then everyone was up on the roof so i ran up there and it was amazing how much harder it was to believe in real life
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 545.66 552.61 <o,f0,male> was a very powerful experience so we went back to the city and said we're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 554.51 554.94 <o,f0,male> but
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 555.98 557.53 <o,f0,male> we've spent some time down there
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 559.75 566.35 <o,f0,male> at the same time the city had this need they were looking for a solution to deal with thirty or forty thousand people a day who
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 566.63 569.19 <o,f0,male> going down there that had nowhere to go
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 570.32 578.71 <o,f0,male> there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site so dealing with it is just an immediate master plan there was a way there had to be a way to get people to move around the site
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 583.38 595.27 <o,f0,male> we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits and getting everybody on board but simply funding this thing it looks like you know a fairly simple thing but this was a half a million dollar
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 595.97 598.47 <o,f0,male> we knew that if it wasn't privately funded
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 599.80 608.28 <o,f0,male> and we also frankly knew that if it didn't happen by the end of the giuliani administration then everyone who we were dealing with at the dot and the police department and all of
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 609.21 616.95 <o,f0,male> we were meeting with twenty or thirty people with the city at a time and it was set up by the office of emergency management this incredible
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 622.66 627.72 <o,f0,male> and there was therefore this ticking clock because giuliani was obviously out three months after that
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 629.43 633.83 <o,f0,male> so the first thing we had to do was find a way to
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 641.80 651.52 <o,f0,male> surprise and we also had to be as under the radar screen as we could be in new york because the key was not raising a lot of objection and sort of working
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 654.65 664.89 <o,f0,male> we came up with the idea of setting up a foundation mainly because when we found a contractor who would build this he would not agree to
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 677.66 681.61 <o,f0,male> his initials are js and he owns rockefeller center if that helps anyone
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 686.41 692.30 <o,f0,male> we met with him the prices from the contractors were between five to seven hundred thousand dollars
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 693.16 698.80 <o,f0,male> and atlantic heydt who 's the largest scaffolding contractor in the country volunteered to do it at cost
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 700.13 703.57 <o,f0,male> so this developer said you know what we'll underwrite the entire expense
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 722.73 724.10 <o,f0,male> the size that we had drawn it
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 724.78 728.23 <o,f0,male> the spinal tap scene where you get the tiny little stonehenge i guess
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 731.49 745.11 <o,f0,male> in fact it was as if this was going to be window washing scaffolding there was no sense of the fact that this is next to saint paul that this is really a place that needs to be kind of dignified and a place to reflect and remember
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 745.32 753.41 <o,f0,male> and i've got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together watching the crowds that gathered at saint paul which is just to the right and moving around the site and i
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 753.72 762.75 <o,f0,male> live down there so we spent a lot of time looking at the need and i think people were amazed at two things i think they were amazed at the destruction
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 763.60 768.10 <o,f0,male> but i think there was a sense of disbelief about the heroics of new yorkers
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 774.82 780.39 <o,f0,male> we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said i 'm going to lock the door because this developer will not
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 781.79 787.26 <o,f0,male> to have you leave till you've signed off on this and we said well this is half the size it
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 788.18 795.61 <o,f0,male> doesn't have any of the design features that have been agreed upon by everyone everyone in the city we'd have to go back to the beginning to do this
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 796.59 800.88 <o,f0,male> and i convinced him that we should leave the room with the agreement to build it as designed
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 802.66 809.01 <o,f0,male> the next day i got an email from the developer saying that he was withdrawing all funding
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 811.82 812.70 <o,f0,male> so we
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 813.13 818.92 <o,f0,male> didn't know what to do but we decided to cast a very wide net we emailed out letters to as many people as we could
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 819.48 823.07 <o,f0,male> several people in the audience here who were very helpful
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 823.96 831.49 <o,f0,male> thought of abandoning ship at that point dr no in fact i told the contractor to go ahead he had already ordered materials based on my go ahead
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 832.17 833.54 <o,f0,male> we knew that one way or another this
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 838.81 839.70 <o,f0,male> we just felt it had
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 842.24 845.40 <o,f0,male> you were funding yourself then with contributions and this
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 848.34 854.88 <o,f0,male> richard i think very correctly made the point at the beginning before all the chair designers
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 856.20 859.99 <o,f0,male> about the history of chair designers imposing
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 868.66 876.30 <o,f0,male> seems to me with this that it was the opposite of that because this was an unprecedented singular design
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 876.83 880.32 <o,f0,male> here 's the issue we knew
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 884.14 889.79 <o,f0,male> we think about the site and think about the need for a memorial it was important that this not be categorized as a memorial
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 890.15 892.47 <o,f0,male> that this was a place for people to
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 893.33 894.79 <o,f0,male> to remember
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 897.69 909.09 <o,f0,male> kind of quiet place so it led us to using design solutions that created as few filters between the viewer as we said about the families platform and the experience as possible
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 909.72 914.84 <o,f0,male> it's all incredibly humble material it's scaffolding and
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 916.80 927.63 <o,f0,male> and it allows by sort of the procession of the movement up by saint paul 's and down the other side it gives you about three hundred feet to go up thirteen feet from the ground to
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 927.99 932.09 <o,f0,male> where you get the three hundred and sixty degree view but the design was driven by a need to be
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 956.37 967.92 <o,f0,male> zero is ka your work i mean we've talked about this before a lot of your work i think is informed by your belief in or your focus on the
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 969.18 972.25 <o,f0,male> of all things and the evanescence of things and a kind of
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 972.83 976.32 <o,f0,male> eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die sort of
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 976.80 978.02 <o,f0,male> sense of existence
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 979.70 980.37 <o,f0,male> this is
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 981.59 984.64 <o,f0,male> clearly not a work for the ages you know
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1000.51 1006.14 <o,f0,male> i think this is obviously substantially different from anything we'd ever thought about doing before just by the nature of it
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1008.48 1018.90 <o,f0,male> where it overlaps with thoughts about our work in general is number one the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done and kevin kennon
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1020.34 1023.78 <o,f0,male> rick scofidio liz diller and all the people within the city
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1025.81 1033.01 <o,f0,male> norman lear who i spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding offered to give us a bridge loan
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1036.58 1043.51 <o,f0,male> so the notion of collaboration i think this reinforces how important that is and in terms of the temporary nature of it
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1044.72 1055.36 <o,f0,male> our goal was not to create something that would be there longer than it needed to be i think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1056.60 1061.34 <o,f0,male> we felt may not have been happening enough in this city about what's really happening there
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1064.31 1065.02 <o,f0,male> and a day
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1066.02 1076.55 <o,f0,male> was giuliani 's farewell address where he proposed the idea of all of ground zero being a memorial which was very controversial but it resonated with a lot of people and i think regardless of
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1077.04 1079.42 <o,f0,male> what the position is about how this
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1080.83 1085.70 <o,f0,male> sacred piece of land is to be used having it come out of actually seeing it
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1086.24 1090.32 <o,f0,male> in a real encounter i think makes it a more powerful dialogue
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1090.83 1094.40 <o,f0,male> and that's what we were interested in so that very much is in the realm of
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1097.18 1109.05 <o,f0,male> it seems to me among other things a lovely piece of civic infrastructure it enables that conversation to get serious and six months after the fact and only a few months away from the site
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1109.21 1111.67 <o,f0,male> being cleaned we are very quickly
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1112.56 1116.77 <o,f0,male> now getting to the point where those conversations about what should go there are getting serious
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1117.77 1121.27 <o,f0,male> do you have having been as physically
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1122.62 1125.94 <o,f0,male> site as you have been doing this project have any ideas about what should or shouldn 't be done
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1129.22 1137.56 <o,f0,male> one thing that shouldn 't be done is evaluate i think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1139.56 1144.75 <o,f0,male> the protetch gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings which had some
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1157.08 1165.06 <o,f0,male> planning and uses and i think there should be a broader which there's starting to be the dialogue is really opening up to what does this site really want to be
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1165.33 1171.94 <o,f0,male> and i truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out that it's going to be very hard to
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1174.25 1182.55 <o,f0,male> there's a few discussions right now that i think are very positive about depressing the west side highway and connecting this over so that there's one uninterrupted piece of
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1183.91 1187.64 <o,f0,male> well i think that's interesting and it gets to another issue that was
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1193.47 1198.55 <o,f0,male> not many of us love the world trade center as a piece of architecture as what it had done to this city and that
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1200.69 1205.48 <o,f0,male> huge plaza is this an opportunity is the silver lining a silver lining here
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1206.08 1208.58 <o,f0,male> to rebuild some more traditional city grid or not
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1209.82 1219.94 <o,f0,male> i think there's a real opportunity to engage in a discussion of why we live in cities and why do we live in places where such dissimilar people collide up against us each day
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1220.53 1229.57 <o,f0,male> i don't think it has much to do with fifty or sixty or seventy or eighty thousand new office spaces regardless of what the number is so yeah i think there is a chance to re look at
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1237.55 1238.88 <o,f0,male> which was the building just north of the
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1239.43 1241.23 <o,f0,male> right which the towers fell into
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1248.35 1252.23 <o,f0,male> the rest of the city so i think a public dialogue i think
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1252.74 1259.08 <o,f0,male> you know i'd like to see an international competition and a call for ideas for uses
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1260.40 1262.63 <o,f0,male> whether it's arts whether it's housing whether it's
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1264.36 1273.25 <o,f0,male> and we're looking for other things this small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help including taking a small piece adjacent to the site
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1273.73 1285.50 <o,f0,male> and inviting ten architects who currently don't have a voice in new york to do artist housing and find other ways to encourage the discussion to be against sort of monolithic single solutions and more about
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1286.07 1287.51 <o,f0,male> a multiplicity of things
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1288.01 1290.28 <o,f0,male> before we end i know you have
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1291.49 1296.59 <o,f0,male> piece of digital video of the experience of being on
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1298.17 1305.35 <o,f0,male> john kamen who 's here actually put together a two and a half minute piece that shows the platform in use so i thought that
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1339.70 1340.68 <o,f0,male> a memorial but were you
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1346.05 1347.36 <o,f0,male> we certainly did as much
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1348.40 1350.74 <o,f0,male> research as we could and we were conscious of
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1377.17 1380.14 <o,f0,male> the scaffolding you can see built up over the street
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1422.62 1423.82 <o,f0,male> you on behalf of new yorkers for
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1425.66 1427.85 <o,f0,male> and getting this done but the kind of
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1428.96 1434.74 <o,f0,male> virtually instantaneous nature of its erection and its being there almost before
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1436.23 1438.96 <o,f0,male> believe that a response of this magnitude could be
