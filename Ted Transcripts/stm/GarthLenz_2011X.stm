GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 15.74 30.13 <o,f0,male> world 's largest and most devastating environmental and industrial project is situated in the heart of the largest and most intact forest in the world canada 's boreal forest it stretches right across northern canada
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 30.13 41.83 <o,f0,male> in labrador it 's home to the largest remaining wild caribou herd in the world the george river caribou herd numbering approximately four hundred thousand animals unfortunately when i was there i couldn 't find one of them but you have the antlers as proof
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 42.65 52.3 <o,f0,male> all across the boreal we 're blessed with this incredible abundance of wetlands wetlands globally are one of the most endangered ecosystems
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 64.23 73.66 <o,f0,male> in the boreal they are also the home where almost fifty percent of the eight hundred bird species found in north america migrate north to breed and raise their young
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 75.26 89.89 <o,f0,male> in ontario the boreal marches down south to the north shore of lake superior and these incredibly beautiful boreal forests were the inspiration for some of the most famous art in canadian history the group of seven
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 89.89 98.47 <o,f0,male> were very inspired by this landscape and so the boreal is not just a really key part of our natural heritage
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 98.47 101.62 <o,f0,male> but also an important part of our cultural heritage
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 101.62 110.74 <o,f0,male> in manitoba this is an image from the east side of lake winnipeg and this is the home of the newly designated unesco cultural heritage site
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 111.58 126.9 <o,f0,male> in saskatchewan as across all of the boreal home to some of our most famous rivers an incredible network of rivers and lakes that every school age child learns about the peace the athabasca the churchill here the mackenzie and
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 126.9 136.08 <o,f0,male> these networks were the historical routes for the voyageur and the coureur des bois the first non aboriginal explorers of northern canada that
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 136.08 151.85 <o,f0,male> taking from the first nations people used canoes and paddled to explore for a trade route a northwest passage for the fur trade in the north the boreal is bordered by the tundra and just below that in yukon
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 151.85 164.27 <o,f0,male> we have this incredible valley the tombstone valley and the tombstone valley is home to the porcupine caribou herd now you 've probably heard about the porcupine caribou herd in the context of its breeding ground
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 164.27 176.53 <o,f0,male> in arctic national wildlife refuge well the wintering ground is also critical and it also is not protected and is potentially could be potentially exploited for gas and mineral rights
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 177.16 194.43 <o,f0,male> the western border of the boreal in british columbia is marked by the coast mountains and on the other side of those mountains is the greatest remaining temperate rainforest in the world the great bear rainforest and we 'll discuss that in a few minutes in a bit more detail all across the boreal it 's home for a huge
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 194.43 200.64 <o,f0,male> incredible range of indigenous peoples and a rich and varied culture
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 200.64 208.7 <o,f0,male> and i think that one of the reasons why so many of these groups have retained a link to the past know their native languages
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 208.74 220.08 <o,f0,male> the songs the dances the traditions i think part of that reason is because of the remoteness the span and the wilderness of this almost ninety five percent intact ecosystem
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 220.08 231.26 <o,f0,male> and i think particularly now as we see ourselves in a time of environmental crisis we can learn so much from these people who have lived so sustainably in this ecosystem for over ten thousand years
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 232.58 243.68 <o,f0,male> in the heart of this ecosystem is the very antithesis of all of these values that we 've been talking about and i think these are some of the core values that make us proud to be canadians this is the alberta tar sands
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 243.83 248.46 <o,f0,male> the largest oil reserves on the planet outside of saudi arabia
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 248.51 263.9 <o,f0,male> trapped underneath the boreal forest and wetlands of northern alberta are these vast reserves of this sticky tar like bitumen and the mining and the exploitation of that is creating devastation on a scale that the planet has never seen before
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 265.52 269.71 <o,f0,female> i want to try to convey some sort of a sense of the size of this
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 269.92 289.56 <o,f0,female> if you look at that truck there it is the largest truck of its kind of the planet it is a four hundred ton capacity dump truck and its dimensions are forty five feet long by thirty five feet wide and twenty five feet high if i stand beside that truck my head comes to around the bottom of the yellow part of that hubcap
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 289.56 297.11 <o,f0,female> within the dimensions of that truck you could build a three thousand square foot two story home quite easily i did the math
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 297.63 304.73 <o,f0,female> so instead of thinking of that as a truck think of that as a three thousand square foot home that 's not a bad size home
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 304.74 310.81 <o,f0,female> and line those trucks homes back and forth across there from the bottom
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 310.85 312.93 <o,f0,female> all the way to the top
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 313.04 318.48 <o,f0,female> and then think of how large that very small section of one mine is
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 318.95 327.06 <o,f0,female> now you can apply that same kind of thinking here as well now here you see of course as you go further on these trucks become like a pixel
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 327.56 333.36 <o,f0,female> again imagine those all back and forth there how large is that one portion of a mine
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 334.83 346.61 <o,f0,female> that would be a huge vast metropolitan area probably much larger than the city of victoria and this is just one of a number of mines ten mines
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 346.63 359.07 <o,f0,female> so far right now this is one section of one mining complex and there are about another forty or fifty in the approval process no tar sands mine has actually ever been denied approval so it is essentially a rubber stamp
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 360.05 378.33 <o,f0,female> the other method of extraction is what 's called the in situ and here massive amounts of water are super heated and pumped through the ground through these vasts networks of pipelines seismic lines drill paths compressor stations and even though this looks maybe not quite as repugnant as the mines
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 378.53 390.99 <o,f0,male> it 's even more damaging in some ways it impacts and fragments a larger part of the wilderness where there is ninety percent reduction of key species like woodland caribou and grizzly bears
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 390.99 398.7 <o,f0,male> and it consumes even more energy more water and produces at least as much greenhouse gas so these in situ
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 398.7 403.35 <o,f0,male> developments are at least as ecologically damaging as the mines
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 404.06 407.29 <o,f0,male> the oil produced from either method
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 407.41 411.98 <o,f0,male> produces more greenhouse gas emissions than any other oil
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 412.03 415.58 <o,f0,male> this is one of the reasons why it 's called the world 's dirtiest oil
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 415.65 430.65 <o,f0,male> it 's also one of the reasons why it is the largest and fastest growing single source of carbon in canada and it is also a reason why canada is now number three in terms of producing carbon per person
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 430.65 449.27 <o,f0,female> the tailings ponds are the largest toxic impoundments on the planet oil sands or rather i should say tar sands oil sands is a p r created term so that the oil companies wouldn 't be trying to promote something that sounds like a sticky tar like substance that 's the world 's dirtiest oil
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 449.51 455.26 <o,f0,female> so they decided to call it oil sands the tar sands consume more water than any other oil
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 455.26 473.44 <o,f0,female> process three to five barrels of water are taken polluted and then returned into tailings ponds the largest toxic impoundments on the planet semcrude just one of the licensees in just one of their tailings ponds dumps two hundred and fifty thousand tons of this toxic gunk every single day
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 473.79 483.16 <o,f0,female> that 's creating the largest toxic impoundments in the history of the planet so far this is enough toxin to cover the face of lake eerie a foot deep
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 484.75 489.44 <o,f0,female> and the tailings ponds range in size up to nine thousand acres
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 489.63 493.4 <o,f0,female> that 's two thirds the size of the entire island of manhattan
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 499.24 506.01 <o,f0,female> so this is an absolutely this is one of the larger tailings ponds this might be what i don 't know half the size of manhattan
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 506.34 515.87 <o,f0,female> and you can see in the context it 's just a relatively small section of one of ten mining complexes and another forty to fifty on stream to be approved soon
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 517.66 525.83 <o,f0,female> and of course these tailings ponds well you can 't see many ponds from outer space and you can see these so maybe we should stop calling them ponds
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 525.96 533.63 <o,f0,female> these massive toxic wastelands are built unlined and on the banks of the athabasca river
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 533.63 552.63 <o,f0,female> and the athabasca river drains downstream to a range of aboriginal communities in fort chippewa the eight hundred people there are finding toxins in the food chain this has been scientifically proven the tar sands toxins are in the food chain and this is causing cancer rates up to ten times what they are in the rest of canada
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 552.63 568.77 <o,f0,female> in spite of that people have to live have to eat this food in order to survive the incredibly high price of flying food into these remote northern aboriginal communities and the high rate of unemployment makes this an absolute necessity for survival
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 568.77 577.45 <o,f0,female> and not that many years ago i was lent a boat by a first nations man and he said when you go out on the river do not under any circumstances
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 593.29 598.64 <o,f0,female> what that does to your soul and that 's what we 're doing
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 598.98 614.81 <o,f0,female> the boreal forest is also perhaps our best defense against global warming and climate change the boreal forest sequesters more carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem and this is absolutely key
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 614.97 619.25 <o,f0,female> so what we 're doing is we 're taking the most concentrated
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 622.13 634.71 <o,f0,female> twice as much greenhouse gases are sequestered in the boreal per acre than the tropical rainforests and what we 're doing is we 're destroying this carbon sink turning it into a carbon bomb
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 634.71 645.47 <o,f0,female> and we 're replacing that with the largest industrial project in the history of the world which is producing the most high carbon greenhouse gas emitting oil in the world
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 646.02 650.55 <o,f0,female> and we 're doing this on the second largest oil reserves on the planet
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 650.99 658.03 <o,f0,female> this is one of the reasons why canada originally a climate change hero we were one of the first signatories of the kyoto accord
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 658.41 663.42 <o,f0,female> now we 're the country that has full time lobbyists in the european union and washington d c
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 663.51 679.09 <o,f0,female> threatening trade wars when these countries talk about wanting to bring in positive legislation to limit the import of high carbon fuels of greenhouse gas emissions anything like this at international conferences
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 679.09 690.45 <o,f0,female> whether they 're in copenhagen or cancun international conferences on climate change we 're the country that gets the dinosaur award every single day as being the biggest obstacle to progress on this issue
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 691.76 706.37 <o,f0,female> just seventy miles downstream is the world 's largest freshwater delta the peace athabasca delta the only one at the juncture of all four migratory flyways this is a globally significant wetland perhaps the greatest on the planet
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 706.37 713.42 <o,f0,female> incredible habitat for half the bird species you find in north america migrating here
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 713.42 723.88 <o,f0,female> and also the last refuge for the largest herd of wild bison and also of course critical habitat for another whole range of other species but it too
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 723.88 739.38 <o,f0,male> is being threatened by the massive amount of water being drawn from the athabasca which feeds these wetlands and also the incredible toxic burden of the largest toxic unlined impoundments on the planet which are leaching in to the food chain for all the species downstream
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 740.03 748.11 <o,f0,female> so as bad as all that is things are going to get much worse much much worse this is the infrastructure as we see it about now
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 748.17 754.86 <o,f0,female> this is what 's planned for two thousand and fifteen and you can see here the keystone pipeline
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 755.25 766.05 <o,f0,female> which would take tar sands raw down to the gulf coast punching a pipeline through the heart the agricultural heart of north america of the united states
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 766.07 780.26 <o,f0,female> and securing the contract with the dirtiest fuel in the world by consumption of the united states and promoting a huge disincentive to a sustainable clean energy future for america
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 781.2 782.95 <o,f0,female> here you see the
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 798.23 809.18 <o,f0,female> and building a pipeline with an industrial highway would change forever this incredible wilderness which is a true rarity on the planet today
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 809.39 821.28 <o,f0,female> so the great bear rainforest is just over the hill there within a few miles we go from these dry boreal forests of one hundred year old trees maybe ten inches across
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 821.28 836.97 <o,f0,female> and soon we 're in the coastal temperate rainforest rain drenched one thousand year old trees twenty feet across a completely different ecosystem and the great bear rainforest is generally considered to be the largest coastal temperate rainforest ecosystem in the world
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 836.97 842.57 <o,f0,female> some of the greatest densities of some of the most iconic and threatened species on the planet
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 842.9 846.58 <o,f0,female> and yet there 's a proposal of course to build a pipeline
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 847.52 858.98 <o,f0,female> to take huge tankers ten times the size of the exxon valdez through some of the most difficult to navigate waters in the world where only just a few years ago a b c ferry ran aground
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 858.98 872.01 <o,f0,female> when one of these tar sands tankers carrying the dirtiest oil ten times as much as the exxon valdez eventually hits a rock and goes down we 're going to have one of the worst ecological disasters this planet has ever seen
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 872.01 883.75 <o,f0,female> and here we have the plan out to two thousand and thirty what they 're proposing is an almost four times increase in production and that would industrialize an area the size of florida
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 884.51 896.08 <o,f0,female> in doing so we 'll be removing a large part of our greatest carbon sink and replacing it with the most high greenhouse gas emission oil in the future
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 896.62 906.62 <o,f0,female> the world does not need any more tar mines the world does not need any more pipelines to wed our addiction to fossil fuels
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 906.7 919.3 <o,f0,female> and the world certainly does not need the largest toxic impoundments to grow and multiply and further threaten the downstream communities and let 's face it we all live downstream in an era of global warming and climate change
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 920.1 929.72 <o,f0,female> what we need is we all need to act to ensure that canada respects the massive amounts of freshwater that we hold in this country
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 929.97 942.42 <o,f0,female> we need to ensure that these wetlands and forests that are our best and greatest and most critical defense against global warming are protected and we are not releasing that carbon bomb into the atmosphere
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 942.42 954.06 <o,f0,female> and we need to all gather together and say no to the tar sands and we can do that there is a huge network all over the world fighting to stop this project
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 954.06 968.98 <o,f0,female> and i quite simply think that this is not something that should be decided just in canada everyone in this room everyone across canada everyone listening to this presentation has a role to play and i think a responsibility because what we do here
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 969.48 979.08 <o,f0,female> is going to change our history it 's going to color our possibility to survive and for our children to survive and have a rich future
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 980.82 987.52 <o,f0,female> we have an incredible gift in the boreal an incredible opportunity to preserve our best defense against global warming
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 988.07 999.5 <o,f0,female> but we could let that slip away the tar sands could threaten not just a large section of the boreal it compromises the life and the health of some of our
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 1013.42 1026.11 <o,f0,female> it could destroy the great bear rainforest the largest temperate rainforest in the world and it could have huge impacts on the future of the agricultural heartland of north america
GarthLenz_2011X 1 GarthLenz_2011X 1042.05 1047.75 <o,f0,female> and to say no to the tar sands and yes to a clean energy future for all thank you so much
