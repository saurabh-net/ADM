ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 24.22 35.8 <o,f0,male> maybe you 're out on the road for a long day and you just wanted to get home you were tired but you felt you could drive a few more miles maybe you thought i 've had less to drink than everybody else i should be the one to go home
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 36.07 38.97 <o,f0,male> or maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 46.46 48.18 <o,f0,male> that you could push
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 48.3 51.84 <o,f0,male> and the car would get you home safely
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 51.91 64.21 <o,f0,male> now that 's been the promise of the self driving car the autonomous vehicle and it 's been the dream since at least one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine when general motors showcased this idea at their futurama booth at the world 's fair
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 84.34 92.75 <o,f0,male> now california 's considering similar legislation and this would make sure that the autonomous car is not one of those things that has to stay in vegas
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 113.23 117.75 <o,f0,male> now why would we want to do such a thing well there 's two really good reasons for this
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 128 136.52 <o,f0,male> now if you 're like me and the other seventy percent of the population who know that we are above average drivers you understand that 's a very high bar
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 137.12 138.86 <o,f0,male> there 's another reason as well
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 138.95 146.94 <o,f0,male> just like race car drivers can use all of the friction between the tire and the road all of the car 's capabilities to go as fast as possible
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 146.97 151.6 <o,f0,male> we want to use all of those capabilities to avoid any accident we can
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 152.07 159.53 <o,f0,male> now you may push the car to the limits not because you 're driving too fast but because you 've hit an icy patch of road conditions have changed
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 159.78 168.72 <o,f0,male> in those situations we want a car that is capable enough to avoid any accident that can physically be avoided
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 170.07 175.28 <o,f0,male> i must confess there 's kind of a third motivation as well you see i have a passion for racing
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 175.72 180.8 <o,f0,male> in the past i 've been a race car owner a crew chief and a driving coach
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 180.82 183.88 <o,f0,male> although maybe not at the level that you 're currently expecting
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 185.02 189.12 <o,f0,male> one of the things that we 've developed in the lab we 've developed several vehicles
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 189.16 193.36 <o,f0,male> is what we believe is the world 's first autonomously drifting car
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 218.47 227.29 <o,f0,male> we 've also worked with volkswagen oracle on shelley an autonomous race car that has raced at one hundred and fifty miles an hour through the bonneville salt flats
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 228.1 231.46 <o,f0,male> gone around thunderhill raceway park in the sun
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 231.67 233.87 <o,f0,male> the wind and the rain
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 234.24 245.07 <o,f0,male> and navigated the one hundred and fifty three turns and twelve point four miles of the pikes peak hill climb route in colorado with nobody at the wheel
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 252.27 255.39 <o,f0,male> i guess it goes without saying that we 've had a lot of fun doing this
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 260.82 262.69 <o,f0,male> these autonomous cars
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 262.77 266.51 <o,f0,male> we have developed a tremendous appreciation
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 266.88 270.17 <o,f0,male> for the capabilities of human race car drivers
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 271.02 274.71 <o,f0,male> as we 've looked at the question of how well do these cars perform
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 274.85 277.89 <o,f0,male> we wanted to compare them to our human counterparts
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 281.58 283.43 <o,f0,female> are amazing
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 287.41 294.29 <o,f0,male> we can take a mathematical model of a car and with some iteration we can actually find the fastest way around that track
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 294.81 298.42 <o,f0,male> we line that up with data that we record from a professional driver
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 299.11 302.42 <o,f0,male> and the resemblance is absolutely remarkable
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 302.99 305.7 <o,f0,male> yes there are subtle differences here
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 305.89 319.92 <o,f0,male> but the human race car driver is able to go out and drive an amazingly fast line without the benefit of an algorithm that compares the trade off between going as fast as possible in this corner and shaving a little bit of time off of the straight over here
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 320.44 325.87 <o,f0,male> not only that they 're able to do it lap after lap after lap
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 326.41 332.96 <o,f0,male> they 're able to go out and consistently do this pushing the car to the limits every single time
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 333.61 336.21 <o,f0,male> it 's extraordinary to watch
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 336.59 338.12 <o,f0,male> you put them in a new car
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 338.19 342.03 <o,f0,male> and after a few laps they 've found the fastest line in that car
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 342.29 343.84 <o,f0,female> and they 're off to the races
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 345.47 347.03 <o,f0,female> it really makes you think
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 347.6 350.42 <o,f0,female> we 'd love to know what 's going on inside their brain
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 352.99 354.51 <o,f0,female> so as researchers that 's what we decided to find out
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 355.98 358.53 <o,f0,male> we decided to instrument not only the car
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 358.61 365.83 <o,f0,male> but also the race car driver to try to get a glimpse into what was going on in their head as they were doing this
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 366.25 370.78 <o,f0,male> now this is dr lene harbott applying electrodes to the head of john morton
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 370.82 381.63 <o,f0,male> john morton is a former can am and imsa driver who 's also a class champion at le mans fantastic driver and very willing to put up with graduate students and this sort of research
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 381.9 388.55 <o,f0,male> she 's putting electrodes on his head so that we can monitor the electrical activity in john 's brain as he races around the track
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 388.88 402.37 <o,f0,male> now clearly we 're not going to put a couple of electrodes on his head and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track however neuroscientists have identified certain patterns that let us tease out some very important aspects of this
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 402.49 406.52 <o,f0,male> for instance the resting brain tends to generate a lot of alpha waves
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 416.63 429.66 <o,f0,male> now we can measure this and we can look at the relative power between the theta waves and the alpha waves this gives us a measure of mental workload how much the driver is actually challenged cognitively at any point along the track
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 430.52 435.91 <o,f0,male> now we wanted to see if we could actually record this on the track so we headed down south to laguna seca
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 442.26 456.63 <o,f0,male> now the corkscrew is a chicane followed by a quick right handed turn as the road drops three stories now the strategy for driving this as explained to me was you aim for the bush in the distance and as the road falls away you realize it was actually the top of a tree
ChrisGerdes_2012X 1 ChrisGerdes_2012X 464.98 466.6 <o,f0,male> life is way too short
