MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 16.32 33.06 <o,f0,male> to do this tedtalk i was really chuckled because you see my father 's name was ted and much of my life especially my musical life is really a talk that i 'm still having with him or the part of me that he continues to be
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 37.12 42.79 <o,f0,male> he was a self taught illustrator and musician he didn 't read a note
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 43.27 48.91 <o,f0,male> and he was profoundly hearing impaired yet he was my greatest teacher
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 48.91 57.18 <o,f0,male> because even through the squeaks of his hearing aids his understanding of music was profound and for him it wasn 't so much
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 57.18 69.49 <o,f0,male> the way the music goes as about what it witnesses and where it can take you and he did a painting of this experience which he called in the realm of music
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 104.75 122.66 <o,f0,male> they didn 't know all that much about it but they gave me the opportunity to discover it together with them and i think inspired by that memory it 's been my desire to try and bring it to as many other people as i can sort of pass it on through whatever means
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 122.66 139.17 <o,f0,male> and how people get this music how it comes into their lives really fascinates me one day in new york i was on the street and i saw some kids playing baseball between stoops and cars and fire hydrants and a tough slouchy kid got up to bat
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 150.53 152.27 <o,f0,male> and he ran around the bases
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 153.15 160.29 <o,f0,male> and i thought go figure how did this piece of eighteenth century austrian aristocratic entertainment
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 160.43 163.9 <o,f0,male> turn into the victory crow of this new york
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 177.53 193.88 <o,f0,male> classical music is an unbroken living tradition that goes back over one thousand years and every one of those years has had something unique and powerful to say to us about what it 's like to be alive
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 203.72 206.11 <o,f0,male> but what classical music does
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 206.26 215.96 <o,f0,male> is to distill all of these musics down to condense them to their absolute essence and from that essence create
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 216.01 221.29 <o,f0,male> a new language a language that speaks very lovingly
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 225.07 227.78 <o,f0,male> it 's a language that 's still evolving
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 227.81 232.29 <o,f0,male> now over the centuries it grew into the big pieces we always think of like
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 241.99 246.2 <o,f0,male> to bring you back to a fragile and personal moment like this one from
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 246.2 249.14 <o,f0,male> the beethoven violin concerto
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 270.03 273.24 <o,f0,male> it 's so simple
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 295.32 297.34 <o,f0,male> four hundred and forty per second
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 308.78 317.33 <o,f0,male> but the way we react to different combinations of these phenomena is complex and emotional and not totally understood
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 334.5 337.58 <o,f0,male> and
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 342.69 345.25 <o,f0,male> and in the seventeenth century
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 345.59 347.16 <o,f0,male> it was more like this
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 367.43 379.18 <o,f0,male> happy with this last chord even though a while back it would have puzzled or annoyed you or sent some of you running from the room and the reason you like it is because you 've inherited whether you knew it or not centuries worth
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 389.71 401.64 <o,f0,male> of the music 's powerful silent partner the way it 's been passed on notation now the impulse to notate or more exactly i should say encode music
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 404.62 416.15 <o,f0,male> in two hundred b c a man named sekulos wrote this song for his departed wife and inscribed it on her gravestone in the notational system of the greeks
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 451.1 459.21 <o,f0,male> in these excerpts from the christmas mass puer natus est nobis for us is born
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 495.76 509.62 <o,f0,male> well notation not only passed the music on notating and encoding the music changed its priorities entirely because it enabled the musicians to imagine music on a much vaster scale now
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 509.65 515.19 <o,f0,male> inspired moves of improvisation could be recorded saved considered
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 515.23 533.07 <o,f0,male> prioritized made into intricate designs and from this moment classical music became what it most essentially is a dialogue between the two powerful sides of our nature instinct and intelligence
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 533.14 540 <o,f0,male> and there began to be a real difference at this point between the art of improvisation and the art of composition
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 546.17 558.16 <o,f0,male> all possible moves testing them out prioritizing them out until he sees how they can form a powerful and coherent design of ultimate and enduring
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 570.32 585.09 <o,f0,male> but every musician strikes a different balance between faith and reason instinct and intelligence and every musical era had different priorities of these things different things to pass on different whats
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 590.58 603.68 <o,f0,male> the big what was to praise god and by the one thousand four hundred s music was being written that tried to mirror god 's mind as could be seen in the design of the night sky
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 628.34 636.09 <o,f0,male> this
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 691.7 704.2 <o,f0,male> this of course was the birth of opera and its development put music on a radical new course the what now was not to mirror the mind of god but to follow the emotion turbulence of man
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 720.05 723.84 <o,f0,male> have with us the triads either the
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 724.04 725.61 <o,f0,male> major one
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 747.88 750.84 <o,f0,female> six hundred and fifty nine vibrations per second
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 751.31 753.25 <o,f0,female> or e flat
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 761.65 764.52 <o,f0,male> thirty seven freakin vibrations
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 765.57 780.91 <o,f0,male> so you can see in a system like this there was enormous subtle potential of representing human emotions and in fact as man began to understand more his complex and ambivalent nature harmony grew more complex to reflect it
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 783.88 786.59 <o,f0,male> emotions beyond the ability of words
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 802.37 808.36 <o,f0,male> printing put music the scores the codebooks of music into the hands of performers everywhere
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 814.21 823.82 <o,f0,male> this is when those big forms arose the symphonies the sonatas the concertos and in these big architectures of time
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 824.39 829.98 <o,f0,male> composers like beethoven could share the insights of a lifetime
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 830.55 832.59 <o,f0,male> a piece like beethoven 's fifth
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 833.03 839.7 <o,f0,male> basically witnessing how it was possible for him to go from sorrow and anger
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 842.95 848.35 <o,f0,male> over the course of a half an hour step by exacting step
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 848.61 854.71 <o,f0,male> of his route to the moment when he could make it across to joy
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 877.23 882.13 <o,f0,male> and it turned out the symphony could be used for more complex issues like
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 882.37 885.76 <o,f0,male> gripping ones of culture such as nationalism or
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 886.06 889.3 <o,f0,male> quest for freedom or the frontiers of
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 894.88 897.92 <o,f0,male> one thing until recently was always the same and that was
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 897.99 902.55 <o,f0,male> when the musicians stopped playing the music stopped
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 912.81 931.68 <o,f0,male> what 's left what sticks with people in the audience at the end of a performance is it a melody or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude and how might that change their lives to me this is the intimate personal side of music it 's the passing on part it 's the why part of it
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 932.15 934.4 <o,f0,male> to me that 's the most essential of all
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 935.7 940.67 <o,f0,male> mostly it 's been a person to person thing a teacher student performer audience thing
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 940.92 949.11 <o,f0,male> and then around one thousand eight hundred and eighty came this new technology that first mechanically then through analogs then digitally created a new and miraculous way of
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 949.25 950.76 <o,f0,male> passing things on
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 950.77 953.06 <o,f0,male> albeit an impersonal one
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 953.46 961.43 <o,f0,male> people could now hear music all the time even though it wasn 't necessary for them to play an instrument read music or even go to concerts
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 973.4 988.61 <o,f0,male> and technology pushed composers to tremendous extremes using computers and synthesizers to create works of intellectually impenetrable complexity beyond the means of performers and audiences at the same time
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 988.75 1002.48 <o,f0,male> technology by taking over the role that notation had always played shifted the balance within music between instinct and intelligence way over to the instinctive side the culture in which we live now
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1002.69 1010.39 <o,f0,male> is awash with music of improvisation that 's been sliced diced layered and god knows distributed and sold
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1010.52 1015.19 <o,f0,male> what 's the long term effect of this on us or on music nobody knows
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1015.19 1032.22 <o,f0,male> the question remains what happens when the music stops what sticks with people now that we have unlimited access to music what does stick with us well let me show you a story of what i mean by really sticking with us i was visiting a cousin of mine in an old age home
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1032.32 1045.57 <o,f0,male> and i spied a very shaky old man making his way across the room on a walker he came over to a piano that was there and he balanced himself and began playing something like this
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1057.93 1059.92 <o,f0,male> suddenly got it and i said friend
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1060.24 1063.06 <o,f0,male> by any chance are you trying to play this
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1091.61 1102.47 <o,f0,male> well that 's why i take every performance so seriously why it matters to me so much i never know who might be there who might be absorbing it and what will happen to it in their life
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1102.47 1108.06 <o,f0,male> but now i 'm excited that there 's more chance than ever before possible of sharing this music
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1108.06 1116.71 <o,f0,male> that 's what drives my interest in projects like the tv series keeping score with the san francisco symphony that looks at the backstories of music and working
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1116.71 1128.33 <o,f0,male> with the young musicians at the new world symphony on projects that explore the potential of the new performing arts centers for both entertainment and education and of course the new world
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1145.72 1148 <o,f0,male> to be explorers together
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1148.48 1155.42 <o,f0,male> sure the big events attract a lot of attention but what really matters is what goes on every single day
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1155.42 1169.3 <o,f0,male> we need your perspectives your curiosity your voices and it excites me now to meet people who are hikers chefs code writers taxi drivers people i never would have guessed who loved the music and who are passing it on
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1169.7 1179.35 <o,f0,male> you don 't need to worry about knowing anything if you 're curious if you have a capacity for wonder if you 're alive you know all that you need to know
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1179.53 1193.34 <o,f0,male> you can start anywhere ramble a bit follow traces get lost be surprised amused inspired all that what all that how is out there waiting for you to discover its why
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1 MichaelTilsonThomas_2012 1193.92 1196.33 <o,f0,male> to dive in and pass it on
