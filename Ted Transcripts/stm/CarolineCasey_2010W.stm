CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 23.79 29.27 <o,f0,female> i wanted to be a biker chick laughter i wanted to race cars
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 32.33 35.38 <o,f0,female> and i wanted to be mowgli from the jungle book
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 35.68 38.79 <o,f0,female> because they were all about being free
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 51.57 55.83 <o,f0,female> not that we could have afforded i drive but to give me the dream of driving
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 57.26 63.54 <o,f0,female> and on my seventeenth birthday i accompanied my little sister in complete innocence
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 63.79 65.77 <o,f0,female> as i always had all my life
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 66.33 75.83 <o,f0,female> my visually impaired sister to go to see an eye specialist because big sisters are always supposed to support their little sisters
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 76.26 79.28 <o,f0,female> and my little sister wanted to be a pilot god help her
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 79.68 83.37 <o,f0,female> so i used to get my eyes tested just for fun
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 83.99 87.61 <o,f0,female> and on my seventeenth birthday after my fake eye exam
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 88.29 92.95 <o,f0,female> the eye specialist just noticed it happened to be my birthday and he said
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 118.72 120.92 <o,f0,female> on my seventeenth birthday
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 121.64 123.89 <o,f0,female> as janis ian would best say
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 124.32 126.25 <o,f0,female> i learned the truth at seventeen
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 187.35 192.18 <o,f0,female> every man in this room even you steve is george clooney
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 218.55 220.32 <o,f0,female> no special needs schools
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 229.3 231.02 <o,f0,female> and they decided to tell me
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 239.01 240.97 <o,f0,female> a boy given a girl 's name
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 241.47 247.05 <o,f0,female> i would grow up and learn from experience how to be tough and how to survive
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 252.12 256.16 <o,f0,female> but more significantly they gave me the ability to believe
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 257.11 258.95 <o,f0,female> totally to believe
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 285.85 289.56 <o,f0,female> and i swear to god i walked out of his office i will drive
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 289.56 293.21 <o,f0,female> i will drive you 're mad i 'll drive i know i can drive
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 293.7 311.62 <o,f0,female> and with the same dogged determination that my father had bred into me since i was such a child he taught me how to sail knowing i could never see where i was going i could never see the shore and i couldn 't see the sails and i couldn 't see the destination but he told me to believe and feel the wind in my face
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 311.67 330.1 <o,f0,female> and that wind in my face made me believe that he was mad and i would drive and for the next eleven years i swore nobody would ever find out that i couldn 't see because i didn 't want to be a failure and i didn 't want to be weak and i believed i could do it so i rammed through life as only a casey can do
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 330.1 340.95 <o,f0,female> and i was an archeologist and then i broke things and then i managed a restaurant and then i slipped on things and then i was a masseuse and then i was a landscape gardener and then i went to business school and you know disabled people are hugely educated
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 340.95 346.17 <o,f0,female> and then i went in and i got a global consulting job with accenture and they didn 't even know
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 346.52 350.35 <o,f0,female> and it 's extraordinary how far belief can take you
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 351.66 355.11 <o,f0,female> in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine two and a half years into that job
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 364.81 366.53 <o,f0,female> very unexpectedly
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 375.2 378.77 <o,f0,female> and two years in i really could see very little
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 379.49 382.61 <o,f0,female> and i found myself in front of an hr manager
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 408 415.7 <o,f0,female> and you all know what it is you don 't need to have a disability to know that we all know how hard it is to admit weakness and failure and it 's frightening isn 't
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 452.95 454.8 <o,f0,female> it 's such a small thing
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 455.43 457.77 <o,f0,female> and you know how exhausting it can be to try to
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 473.54 480.3 <o,f0,female> and that eye specialist he didn 't bother testing my eyes god no it was therapy and he asked me several questions of which many were
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 482.3 484.66 <o,f0,female> why why are you fighting so hard
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 484.73 486.45 <o,f0,female> not to be yourself
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 486.93 488.93 <o,f0,female> and do you love what you do
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 517.35 519.17 <o,f0,female> and as i left his office
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 519.4 520.91 <o,f0,female> he called me back
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 521.14 523.4 <o,f0,female> and he said i think it 's time i think
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 535.78 537.5 <o,f0,female> and my chest ached
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 537.53 548.5 <o,f0,female> and i had no idea where i was going i had no idea but i did know the game was up and i went home and because the pain in my chest ached so much i thought i 'll go out for a run really not a very sensible thing to do and
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 567.43 569.3 <o,f0,female> broken fallen
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 581.9 584.5 <o,f0,female> and i was broken and i was angry
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 584.83 586.83 <o,f0,female> and i didn 't know what to do
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 607.05 618.55 <o,f0,female> i just simply had no answers i had lost my belief look where my belief had brought me to and now i had lost it and now i really couldn 't see i was crumpled and then i remember thinking about that
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 630.09 632.92 <o,f0,female> and really slowly slowly slowly
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 694.54 697.39 <o,f0,female> i 'm going to be an elephant handler
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 698.66 705.17 <o,f0,female> and i had no idea how i was going to be an elephant handler from global management consultant
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 750.47 764.89 <o,f0,female> and you know what when you really believe in yourself and everything about you it 's extraordinary what happens and you know what that trip that thousand kilometers it raised enough money for six thousand cataract eye operations six thousand people got to see because of that when i came home off that elephant
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 777.58 794.04 <o,f0,female> because my organization was always going to be named after my elephant because disability is like the elephant in the room and i wanted to make you see it in a positive way no charity no pity but i wanted to work only and truly with business and media leadership to totally reframe disability in a way that was
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 794.04 796.62 <o,f0,female> and possible
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 796.78 798.56 <o,f0,female> it was extraordinary
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 815.43 820.3 <o,f0,female> i was petrified and i speak but this is an amazing audience
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 823.65 831.84 <o,f0,female> but as i was traveling here you 'll be very happy to know i did use my white symbol stick cane because it 's really good to skip queues in the airport
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 831.84 833.53 <o,f0,female> and i got my way here
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 879.27 882.59 <o,f0,female> you can make change happen and we need to make it happen
CarolineCasey_2010W 1 CarolineCasey_2010W 888 891.26 <o,f0,female> disabled perfect normal whatever
