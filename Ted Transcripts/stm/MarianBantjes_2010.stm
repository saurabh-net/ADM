MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 17.24 17.98 <o,f0,female> by reciting a
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 20.23 22.19 <o,f0,female> oh beloved dentist
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 23.36 33.72 <o,f0,female> your rubber fingers in my mouth your voice so soft and muffled lower the mask dear dentist lower the mask
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 37.10 43.51 <o,f0,female> okay in this presentation i'm going to be putting the right side of your brains through a fairly serious workout you're going to see
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 43.81 54.59 <o,f0,female> lot of imagery and it's not always connected to what i'm talking about so i need you to kind of split your brains in half let the images flow over one side and listen to me on the other
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 55.22 64.68 <o,f0,female> so i am one of those people with a transformative personal story six years ago after twenty years in graphic design and typography
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 65.39 73.77 <o,f0,female> i changed the way i was working and the way most graphic designers work to pursue a more personal approach to my work
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 75.35 80.68 <o,f0,female> with only the humble attempt to simply make a living doing something that i loved
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 82.40 88.52 <o,f0,female> something weird happened i became bizarrely popular
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 89.92 99.23 <o,f0,female> my current work seems to resonate with people in a way that has so taken me by surprise that i still frequently wonder what in the hell is going on
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 100.00 106.11 <o,f0,female> and slowly coming to understand that the appeal of what i do may be connected to why i do it
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 111.36 117.18 <o,f0,female> so where my work as a graphic designer was to follow strategy my work
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 118.53 124.50 <o,f0,female> follows my heart and my interests with the guidance of my ego
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 125.31 137.56 <o,f0,female> to create work that is mutually beneficial to myself and a client now this is heresy in the design world the ego is not supposed to be involved in graphic design
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 138.84 149.04 <o,f0,female> but i find that for myself without exception the more i deal with the work as something of my own as something that is personal the more
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 165.93 168.33 <o,f0,female> qualities like does it bring joy
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 169.20 173.30 <o,f0,female> is there a sense of wonder and does it invoke curiosity
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 174.21 179.88 <o,f0,female> this is a scientific diagram by the way i don't have time to explain it but it has to do with dna and
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 181.21 184.19 <o,f0,female> so i have a particular imaginative approach to visual work
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 184.97 188.75 <o,f0,female> the things that interest me when i'm working are visual structure
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 189.86 199.28 <o,f0,female> surprise and anything that requires figuring things out so for this reason i'm particularly drawn to systems and patterns
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 214.27 226.46 <o,f0,female> and puzzling it is i started by creating a series of tiling units and these tiling units i designed specifically so that they would contain parts of letter forms within their shapes
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 226.93 234.84 <o,f0,female> so that i could then join those pieces together to create letters and then words within the abstract patterning
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 246.40 248.11 <o,f0,female> so here 's the word puzzle again
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 249.53 257.23 <o,f0,female> and here it is with the abstract surrounding and as you can see it's extremely difficult to read but all
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 257.60 265.12 <o,f0,female> to do is fill certain areas of those letter forms and i can bring those words out of the background pattern
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 274.11 286.35 <o,f0,female> and this way working with the art director i'm able to bring it to just the right point that it's puzzling for the audience they can figure out that there's something they have to read but it's not impossible for them to read
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 303.20 307.25 <o,f0,female> so ultimately my goal is to create something unexpected
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 309.21 315.89 <o,f0,female> to this end i have worked in sugar for stefan sagmeister three time ted speaker and this
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 320.68 329.58 <o,f0,female> eating cereal for breakfast all of my life and for that same amount of time i've been spilling sugar on the table and just kind of playing with it with my fingers
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 330.32 340.72 <o,f0,female> and eventually i used this technique to create a piece of artwork and then i used it again to create six pieces for stefan 's book things in my life i've learned so far
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 342.17 345.17 <o,f0,female> and these were created without sketches just freehand
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 345.33 350.98 <o,f0,female> by putting the sugar down on a white surface and then manipulating it to get the words and designs out of it
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 373.15 376.90 <o,f0,female> give to their parents which is in itself a form of honor
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 377.42 380.26 <o,f0,female> this what you can do with some household tinfoil
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 382.93 384.60 <o,f0,female> okay well it's what i can do with some
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 392.46 393.35 <o,f0,female> i'm very
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 393.98 396.93 <o,f0,female> wonder in design as an impetus to
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 398.40 405.35 <o,f0,female> to say i wonder is to say i question i ask and to experience wonder is to experience
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 406.83 414.84 <o,f0,female> so i'm currently working on a book which plays with both senses of the word as i explore some of my own ideas and inquiries in
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 416.23 417.58 <o,f0,female> rather peacock like
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 419.59 426.07 <o,f0,female> the world is full of wonder but the world of graphic design for the most part is not
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 426.56 434.72 <o,f0,female> so i'm using my own writings as a kind of testing ground for a book that has an interdependency between word and image as a kind of
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 435.66 444.17 <o,f0,female> force i think that one of the things that religions got right was the use of visual wonder to deliver a message
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 444.68 458.05 <o,f0,female> i think this true marriage of art and information is woefully underused in adult literature and i'm mystified as to why visual wealth is not more commonly used to enhance intellectual wealth
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 458.52 464.42 <o,f0,female> when we look at works like this we tend to associate them with children 's literature there's an implication
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 464.79 473.33 <o,f0,female> that ornamental graphics detract from the seriousness of the content but i really hope to have the opportunity to change that perception
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 479.46 485.40 <o,f0,female> but i'm nearly done for some reason i thought it would be a good idea to put an intermission
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 487.58 489.62 <o,f0,female> and this is it just to give you and me a
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 499.88 510.39 <o,f0,female> i do these valentines i've been sending out valentines on a fairly large scale since two thousand and five these are my valentines from two thousand and five and two thousand and six
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 510.98 517.27 <o,f0,female> and i started by doing just a single image like this and sending them out to each person but in
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 518.44 525.44 <o,f0,female> i got the cockamamie idea to hand draw each valentine for everyone on my mailing
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 526.60 529.21 <o,f0,female> i reduced my mailing list to one hundred and fifty people
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 530.54 543.33 <o,f0,female> and i drew each person their own unique valentine and put their name on it and numbered it and signed it and sent it out believe it or not i devised this as a time saving
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 545.48 556.17 <o,f0,female> i was very busy in the beginning of that year and i didn't know when i was going to find time to design and print a single valentine and i thought i could kind of do this piecemeal as i was traveling
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 583.41 597.60 <o,f0,female> last year i took a more conceptual approach to the valentine i had this idea that i wanted people to receive a kind of mysterious love letter like a found fragment in their mailbox
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 598.05 607.03 <o,f0,female> i wanted it to be something that was not addressed to them or signed by me something that caused them to wonder what on earth this thing
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 608.49 616.06 <o,f0,female> and i specifically wrote four pages that don't connect there were four different versions of this and i
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 617.38 624.55 <o,f0,female> so that they begin in the middle of a sentence end in the middle of a sentence and they're on the one hand universal so i
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 634.60 638.71 <o,f0,female> been a love letter to them and i'm just going to read one of them to you
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 640.57 648.14 <o,f0,female> you 've never really been sure of this but i can assure you that this quirk you're so self conscious of is intensely endearing
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 648.59 655.63 <o,f0,female> just please accept that this piece of you escapes with your smile and those of us who notice are happy to catch it in passing
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 656.29 661.87 <o,f0,female> time spent with you is like chasing and catching small birds but without the scratches and bird shit
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 663.66 671.64 <o,f0,female> that is to say your thoughts and words flit and dart disconcertedly elusive at times but when caught and examined
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 672.74 683.89 <o,f0,female> such a wonder such a delightful reward there's no passing time with you only collecting the collecting of moments with the hope for preservation and at the same time release
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 694.42 704.03 <o,f0,female> and it's so crushing to think that you may not know how truly wonderful you are how inspiring and delightful and really truly the most completely
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 713.07 725.04 <o,f0,female> so valentine 's day is coming up in a couple of days and these are currently arriving in mailboxes all around the world this year i got what i really have to say is a rather brilliant
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 729.35 730.91 <o,f0,female> to laser cut my
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 731.80 740.03 <o,f0,female> used christmas cards so i solicited friends to send me their used christmas cards and
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 740.46 748.92 <o,f0,female> i made five hundred of these each one of them is completely different i'm just really really thrilled with them i don't have that much else to say but
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 751.64 753.66 <o,f0,female> they turned out really well
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 755.25 767.79 <o,f0,female> i do spend a lot of time on my work and one of the things that i've been thinking about recently is what is worth while what is it that's worth spending my time on and my life on in this way
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 774.38 780.26 <o,f0,female> and yes sometimes i'm swayed by money but ultimately i don't consider that a worthy goal
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 786.55 790.75 <o,f0,female> the conditions i work under and the audience that i'm able to reach
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 791.53 793.79 <o,f0,female> so i might ask who is it for
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 794.30 796.75 <o,f0,female> what does it say and what does it do
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 798.16 800.89 <o,f0,female> you know i have to tell you it's really
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 801.30 807.77 <o,f0,female> difficult for someone like me to come up on stage at this conference with these
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 820.50 820.68 <o,f0,female> and
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 821.84 831.34 <o,f0,female> it's very very common for designers and people in the visual arts to feel that we're not contributing enough
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 832.54 835.42 <o,f0,female> or worse that all we're doing is contributing to landfill
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 836.57 839.80 <o,f0,female> here i am i'm showing you some
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 844.33 848.75 <o,f0,female> but i've come to believe that truly imaginative visual work
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 849.35 851.74 <o,f0,female> is extremely important in society
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 866.66 875.03 <o,f0,female> work that is interesting unusual intriguing work that maybe opens up that sense of inquiry in the
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 876.84 879.47 <o,f0,female> that i'm seeding the imagination of the populace
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 887.82 890.72 <o,f0,female> because inspiration is cross pollinating
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 903.81 906.28 <o,f0,female> a philanthropist or a babysitter
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 907.62 916.30 <o,f0,female> and this isn't something that you can quantify or track or measure and we tend to undervalue things in society that we can't measure
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 917.07 925.77 <o,f0,female> but i really believe that a fully operating rich society needs these seeds coming from all directions and all disciplines
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 926.11 932.81 <o,f0,female> in order to keep the gears of inspiration and imagination flowing and cycling and growing
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 935.44 937.52 <o,f0,female> so that's why i do what i do
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 938.59 941.37 <o,f0,female> and why i spend so much time and effort on it
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 942.76 949.25 <o,f0,female> and why i work in the commercial public sphere as opposed to the isolated private sphere of fine art
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 960.10 971.21 <o,f0,female> actually really feel that it's worthwhile to spend my valuable and limited time on this earth in this way and i thank you for allowing me to show it to you
