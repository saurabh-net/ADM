JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 23.47 26.53 <o,f0,male> but not that much in the humanities and in history
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 26.53 33.81 <o,f0,male> i think there 's a belief that it 's just impossible that you cannot quantify the doings of mankind that you cannot measure history
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 33.81 47.03 <o,f0,male> but i don 't think that 's right i want to show you a couple of examples why so my collaborator erez and i were considering the following fact that two kings separated by centuries will speak a very different language that 's a powerful historical force
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 94.14 104.66 <o,f0,male> namely if a verb is one hundred times more frequent than another it regularizes ten times slower that 's a piece of history but it comes in a mathematical wrapping
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 104.66 110.66 <o,f0,male> now in some cases math can even help explain or propose explanations for historical forces
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 110.92 124.18 <o,f0,male> so here steve pinker and i were considering the magnitude of wars during the last two centuries there 's actually a well known regularity to them where the number of wars that are one hundred times deadlier is ten times smaller
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 136.93 140.01 <o,f0,male> so steve and i through mathematical analysis
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 154.3 162.91 <o,f0,male> for instance committing ten thousand soldiers to the next battle sounds like a lot it 's relatively enormous if you 've already committed one thousand soldiers previously
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 162.91 170.66 <o,f0,male> but it doesn 't sound so much it 's not relatively enough it won 't make a difference if you 've already committed one hundred thousand soldiers previously
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 170.66 174.41 <o,f0,male> so you see that because of the way we perceive quantities
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 174.41 187.17 <o,f0,male> as the war drags on the number of soldiers committed to it and the casualties will increase not linearly like ten thousand eleven thousand twelve thousand but exponentially ten thousand later twenty thousand later forty thousand
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 187.17 201.61 <o,f0,male> and so that explains this pattern that we 've seen before so here mathematics is able to link a well known feature of the individual mind with a long term historical pattern that unfolds over centuries and across continents
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 201.61 218.13 <o,f0,male> so these types of examples today there are just a few of them but i think in the next decade they will become commonplace the reason for that is that the historical record is becoming digitized at a very fast pace so there 's about one hundred and thirty million books that have been written since the dawn of time
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 218.13 232.98 <o,f0,male> companies like google have digitized many of them above twenty million actually and when the stuff of history is available in digital form it makes it possible for a mathematical analysis to very quickly and very conveniently review trends in our history and our culture
