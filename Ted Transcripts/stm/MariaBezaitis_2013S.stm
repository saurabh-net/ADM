MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 34.56 46.68 <o,f0,female> don 't talk to strangers says stay from anyone who 's not familiar to you stick with the people you know stick with people like you
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 46.68 48.77 <o,f0,female> how appealing
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 61.69 80 <o,f0,female> my phrase for this value of being with not like us is strangeness and my point is that in today 's digitally intensive world strangers are quite frankly not the point the point that we should be worried about is how much strangeness are we getting
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 80 90.55 <o,f0,female> why strangeness because our social relations are increasingly mediated by data and data turns our social relations into digital relations
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 90.55 104.09 <o,f0,female> and that means that our digital relations now depend extraordinarily on technology to bring to them a sense of robustness a sense of discovery a sense of surprise and unpredictability
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 104.09 122.47 <o,f0,female> why not strangers because strangers are part of a world of really rigid boundaries they belong to a world of people i know versus people i don 't know and in the context of my digital relations i 'm already doing things with people i don 't know
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 122.47 137.44 <o,f0,female> the question isn 't whether or not i know you the question is what can i do with you what can i learn with you what can we do together that benefits us both i spend a lot of time
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 137.44 145.47 <o,f0,female> thinking about how the social landscape is changing how new technologies create new constraints and new opportunities for people
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 145.47 160.63 <o,f0,female> the most important changes facing us today have to do with data and what data is doing to shape the kinds of digital relations that will be possible for us in the future the economies of the future depend on that our social lives in the future depend on that
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 160.63 168.69 <o,f0,female> the threat to worry about isn 't strangers the threat to worry about is whether or not we 're getting our fair share of strangeness
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 168.69 180.66 <o,f0,female> now twentieth century psychologists and sociologists were thinking about strangers but they weren 't thinking so dynamically about human relations and they were thinking about strangers in the context of influencing practices
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 180.66 188.91 <o,f0,female> stanley milgram from the sixty s and seventy s the creator of the small world experiments which became later popularized as six degrees of separation
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 188.91 198.27 <o,f0,female> made the point that any two arbitrarily selected people were likely connected from between five to seven intermediary steps his point was that strangers are
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 202.7 222.6 <o,f0,female> mark granovetter stanford sociologist in one thousand nine hundred and seventy three in his seminal essay the strength of weak ties made the point that these weak ties that are a part of our networks these strangers are actually more effective at diffusing information to us than are our strong ties the people closest to us
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 222.6 236.34 <o,f0,female> he makes an additional indictment of our strong ties when he says that these people who are so close to us these strong ties in our lives actually have a homogenizing effect on us they produce sameness
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 236.34 252.7 <o,f0,female> my colleagues and i at intel have spent the last few years looking at the ways in which digital platforms are reshaping our everyday lives what kinds of new routines are possible we 've been looking specifically at the kinds of digital platforms that have enabled us to take our possessions
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 252.7 260.84 <o,f0,female> those things that used to be very restricted to us and to our friends in our houses and to make them available to people we don 't know
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 277.34 296.89 <o,f0,female> to the things in their lives change so do their relations with other people and yet recommendation system after recommendation system continues to miss the boat it continues to try to predict what i need based on some past characterization of who i am of what i 've already done
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 296.89 303.8 <o,f0,female> security technology after security technology continues to design data protection in terms of threats and attacks
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 303.8 316.13 <o,f0,female> keeping me locked into really rigid kinds of relations categories like friends and family and contacts and colleagues don 't tell me anything about my actual relations
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 316.13 329.01 <o,f0,female> a more effective way to think about my relations might be in terms of closeness and distance where at any given point in time with any single person i am both close and distant from that individual
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 329.02 342.3 <o,f0,female> all as a function of what i need to do right now people aren 't close or distant people are always a combination of the two and that combination is constantly changing
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 342.3 354.94 <o,f0,female> what if technologies could intervene to disrupt the balance of certain kinds of relationships what if technologies could intervene to help me find the person that i need right now
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 354.94 363.82 <o,f0,female> strangeness is that calibration of closeness and distance that enables me to find the people that i need right now
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 363.82 379.36 <o,f0,female> that enables me to find the sources of intimacy of discovery and of inspiration that i need right now strangeness is not about meeting strangers it simply makes the point that we need to disrupt our zones of familiarity
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 379.36 387.69 <o,f0,female> so jogging those zones of familiarity is one way to think about strangeness and it 's a problem faced not just by individuals today but also by organizations
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 387.69 392.35 <o,f0,female> organizations that are trying to embrace massively new opportunities
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 392.35 407.75 <o,f0,female> whether you 're a political party insisting to your detriment on a very rigid notion of who belongs and who does not whether you 're the government protecting social institutions like marriage and restricting access of those institutions to the few
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 407.75 418.6 <o,f0,female> whether you 're a teenager in her bedroom who 's trying to jostle her relations with her parents strangeness is a way to think about how we pave the way to new kinds of relations
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 418.6 422.37 <o,f0,female> we have to change the norms
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 422.37 429.98 <o,f0,female> we have to change the norms in order to enable new kinds of technologies as a basis for new kinds of businesses
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 429.98 436.89 <o,f0,female> what interesting questions lie ahead for us in this world of no strangers
MariaBezaitis_2013S 1 MariaBezaitis_2013S 436.89 454.9 <o,f0,female> how might we think differently about our relations with people how might we think differently about our relations with distributed groups of people how might we think differently about our relations with technologies things that effectively become social participants in their own right
