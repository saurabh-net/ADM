ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 13.28 17.84 <o,f0,female> here 's the most important economic fact of our time
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 17.84 26.58 <o,f0,female> we are living in an age of surging income inequality particularly between those at the very top and everyone else
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 26.58 38.52 <o,f0,female> this shift is the most striking in the u s and in the u k but it 's a global phenomenon it 's happening in communist china in formerly communist russia it 's happening in india
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 38.52 47.6 <o,f0,female> in my own native canada we 're even seeing it in cozy social democracies like sweden finland and germany
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 50.57 64.83 <o,f0,female> in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s the one percent accounted for about ten percent of the national income in the united states today their share has more than doubled to above twenty percent
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 64.83 84.41 <o,f0,female> but what 's even more striking is what 's happening at the very tippy top of the income distribution the zero point one percent in the u s today account for more than eight percent of the national income they are where the one percent was thirty years ago
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 84.41 95.48 <o,f0,female> let me give you another number to put that in perspective and this is a figure that was calculated in two thousand and five by robert reich the secretary of labor in the clinton administration
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 100.82 114.1 <o,f0,female> bill gates and warren buffett and he found that it was equivalent to the wealth of the bottom forty percent of the u s population one hundred and twenty million people
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 114.1 126.04 <o,f0,female> now as it happens warren buffett is not only himself a plutocrat he is one of the most astute observers of that phenomenon and he has his own favorite number
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 153.67 164.23 <o,f0,female> and i probably don 't need to tell you that we haven 't seen anything similar happen to the middle class whose wealth has stagnated if not actually decreased
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 170.48 188.04 <o,f0,female> one of the reasons i think is a sort of boiled frog phenomenon changes which are slow and gradual can be hard to notice even if their ultimate impact is quite dramatic think about what happened after all to the poor frog but i think there 's something else going on
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 188.15 204.06 <o,f0,female> talking about income inequality even if you 're not on the forbes four hundred list can make us feel uncomfortable it feels less positive less optimistic to talk about how the pie is sliced than to think about how to make the pie bigger
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 204.06 215.87 <o,f0,female> and if you do happen to be on the forbes four hundred list talking about income distribution and inevitably its cousin income redistribution can be downright threatening
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 215.87 225.84 <o,f0,female> so we 're living in the age of surging income inequality especially at the top what 's driving it and what can we do about it
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 225.84 231.66 <o,f0,female> one set of causes is political lower taxes
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 231.67 240.32 <o,f0,female> deregulation particularly of financial services privatization weaker legal protections for trade unions
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 240.32 246.58 <o,f0,female> all of these have contributed to more and more income going to the very very top
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 246.58 261.62 <o,f0,female> a lot of these political factors can be broadly lumped under the category of crony capitalism political changes that benefit a group of well connected insiders but don 't actually do much good for the rest of us
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 261.62 266.7 <o,f0,female> in practice getting rid of crony capitalism is incredibly difficult
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 266.7 276.95 <o,f0,female> think of all the years reformers of various stripes have tried to get rid of corruption in russia for instance or how hard it is to re regulate the banks
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 276.95 294.67 <o,f0,female> even after the most profound financial crisis since the great depression or even how difficult it is to get the big multinational companies including those whose motto might be don 't do evil to pay taxes at a rate even approaching that paid by the middle class
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 294.67 308.91 <o,f0,female> but while getting rid of crony capitalism in practice is really really hard at least intellectually it 's an easy problem after all no one is actually in favor of crony capitalism
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 308.91 322.16 <o,f0,female> indeed this is one of those rare issues that unites the left and the right a critique of crony capitalism is as central to the tea party as it is to occupy wall street
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 322.16 334.17 <o,f0,female> but if crony capitalism is intellectually at least the easy part of the problem things get trickier when you look at the economic drivers of surging income inequality
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 334.17 351.26 <o,f0,female> in and of themselves these aren 't too mysterious globalization and the technology revolution the twin economic transformations which are changing our lives and transforming the global economy are also powering the rise of the super rich
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 351.26 369.21 <o,f0,female> just think about it for the first time in history if you are an energetic entrepreneur with a brilliant new idea or a fantastic new product you have almost instant almost frictionless access to a global market of more than a billion people
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 369.21 380.29 <o,f0,female> as a result if you are very very smart and very very lucky you can get very very rich very very quickly
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 380.29 399.47 <o,f0,female> the latest poster boy for this phenomenon is david karp the twenty six year old founder of tumblr recently sold his company to yahoo for one point one billion dollars think about that for a minute one point one billion dollars twenty six years old
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 399.47 406.87 <o,f0,female> it 's easiest to see how the technology revolution and globalization are creating this sort of superstar effect
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 406.95 422.4 <o,f0,female> in highly visible fields like sports and entertainment we can all watch how a fantastic athlete or a fantastic performer can today leverage his or her skills across the global economy as never before
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 422.4 442.19 <o,f0,female> but today that superstar effect is happening across the entire economy we have superstar technologists we have superstar bankers we have superstar lawyers and superstar architects there are superstar cooks and superstar farmers there are even and this is my personal favorite example superstar dentists
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 442.19 453.02 <o,f0,female> the most dazzling exemplar of whom is bernard touati the frenchman who ministers to the smiles of fellow superstars like russian oligarch roman abramovich
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 453.02 457.84 <o,f0,female> or european born american fashion designer diane von furstenberg
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 471.2 473.65 <o,f0,female> in contrast with crony capitalism
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 473.65 479.62 <o,f0,female> so much of what globalization and the technology revolution have done is highly positive
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 479.62 495.54 <o,f0,female> let 's start with technology i love the internet i love my mobile devices i love the fact that they mean that whoever chooses to will be able to watch this talk far beyond this auditorium i 'm even more of a fan of globalization
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 495.54 511.29 <o,f0,female> this is the transformation which has lifted hundreds of millions of the world 's poorest people out of poverty and into the middle class and if you happen to live in the rich part of the world it 's made many new products affordable
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 511.38 520.18 <o,f0,female> who do you think built your iphone and things that we 've relied on for a long time much cheaper think of your dishwasher or your t shirt
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 520.18 524.3 <o,f0,female> so what 's not to like well a few things
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 524.3 543.39 <o,f0,female> one of the things that worries me is how easily what you might call meritocratic plutocracy can become crony plutocracy imagine you 're a brilliant entrepreneur who has successfully sold that idea or that product to the global billions and become a billionaire in the process
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 543.39 559.98 <o,f0,female> it gets tempting at that point to use your economic nous to manipulate the rules of the global political economy in your own favor and that 's no mere hypothetical example think about amazon
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 603.85 619.8 <o,f0,female> again this is no mere hypothetical it 's what the russian oligarchs did in creating the sale of the century privatization of russia 's natural resources it 's one way of describing what happened with deregulation of the financial services in the u s and the u k
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 631.39 640.67 <o,f0,female> and they are people who are acutely aware of how important highly sophisticated analytical and quantitative skills are in today 's economy
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 640.67 647.64 <o,f0,female> that 's why they are spending unprecedented time and resources educating their own children
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 647.64 655.07 <o,f0,female> the middle class is spending more on schooling too but in the global educational arms race that starts at nursery school
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 655.07 670.26 <o,f0,female> and ends at harvard stanford or mit the ninety nine percent is increasingly outgunned by the one percent the result is something that economists alan krueger and miles corak call the great gatsby curve
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 670.26 675.65 <o,f0,female> as income inequality increases social mobility decreases
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 675.65 685.55 <o,f0,female> the plutocracy may be a meritocracy but increasingly you have to be born on the top rung of the ladder to even take part in that race
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 685.55 704.4 <o,f0,female> the third thing and this is what worries me the most is the extent to which those same largely positive forces which are driving the rise of the global plutocracy also happen to be hollowing out the middle class in western industrialized economies let 's start with technology
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 704.4 711.52 <o,f0,female> those same forces that are creating billionaires are also devouring many traditional middle class jobs
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 711.63 714.37 <o,f0,female> when 's the last time you used a travel agent
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 714.37 729.56 <o,f0,female> and in contrast with the industrial revolution the titans of our new economy aren 't creating that many new jobs at its zenith g m employed hundreds of thousands facebook fewer than ten thousand
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 729.56 732.1 <o,f0,female> the same is true of globalization
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 732.1 750.39 <o,f0,female> for all that it is raising hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in the emerging markets it 's also outsourcing a lot of jobs from the developed western economies the terrifying reality is that there is no economic rule which automatically translates
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 750.39 755.12 <o,f0,female> increased economic growth into widely shared prosperity
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 755.12 770.07 <o,f0,female> that 's shown in what i consider to be the most scary economic statistic of our time since the late one thousand nine hundred and ninety s increases in productivity have been decoupled from increases in wages and employment
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 770.07 780.96 <o,f0,female> that means that our countries are getting richer our companies are getting more efficient but we 're not creating more jobs and we 're not paying people as a whole more
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 780.96 788.91 <o,f0,female> one scary conclusion you could draw from all of this is to worry about structural unemployment
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 788.91 798.55 <o,f0,female> what worries me more is a different nightmare scenario after all in a totally free labor market we could find jobs for pretty much everyone
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 798.55 810.97 <o,f0,female> the dystopia that worries me is a universe in which a few geniuses invent google and its ilk and the rest of us are employed giving them massages
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 810.97 818.22 <o,f0,female> so when i get really depressed about all of this i comfort myself in thinking about the industrial revolution
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 818.22 835.11 <o,f0,female> after all for all its grim satanic mills it worked out pretty well didn 't it after all all of us here are richer healthier taller well there are a few exceptions and live longer
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 883.73 893.82 <o,f0,female> today we are living through an era of economic transformation comparable in its scale and its scope to the industrial revolution
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 893.82 905.03 <o,f0,female> to be sure that this new economy benefits us all and not just the plutocrats we need to embark on an era of comparably ambitious social and political change
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 1 ChrystiaFreeland_2013G 905.03 908.88 <o,f0,female> we need a new new deal
