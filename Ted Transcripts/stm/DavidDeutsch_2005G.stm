DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 12.61 25.50 <o,f0,female> we've been told to go out on a limb and say something surprising so i'll try and do that but i want to start with two things that everyone already knows
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 26.01 34.06 <o,f0,female> and the first one in fact is something that has been known for most of recorded history and that is that
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 35.28 43.71 <o,f0,female> the planet earth or the solar system or our environment or whatever is uniquely suited to sustain
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 44.71 55.80 <o,f0,female> our evolution or creation as it used to be thought and our present existence and most important our future survival
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 57.03 67.91 <o,f0,female> nowadays this idea has a dramatic name spaceship earth and the idea there is that outside the spaceship the universe is implacably hostile and inside
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 68.93 79.36 <o,f0,female> all we have all we depend on and we only get the one chance if we mess up our spaceship we've got nowhere else to go now the second thing that everyone already knows is that
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 80.11 89.46 <o,f0,female> contrary to what was believed for most of human history human beings are not in fact the hub of existence
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 89.82 102.84 <o,f0,female> as stephen hawking famously said we're just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet that's in orbit around a typical star which is on the outskirts of a typical galaxy and so on
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 104.69 105.11 <o,f0,male> now
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 105.44 117.78 <o,f0,female> the first of those two things that everyone knows is kind of saying that we're at a very un typical place uniquely suited and so on and the second one is saying that we're at a typical place and
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 131.01 135.74 <o,f0,female> but that doesn't prevent them from both being completely false
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 141.45 147.79 <o,f0,female> let me start with the second one typical well
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 148.26 158.18 <o,f0,female> is this a typical place well let 's look around you know and look in a random direction and we see a wall and chemical scum
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 159.73 167.32 <o,f0,female> and that's not typical of the universe at all all you've got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 167.73 176.02 <o,f0,female> and look back and you won 't see any walls or chemical scum at all all you see is a blue planet and if you go further than that
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 176.66 184.32 <o,f0,female> you'll see the sun the solar system and the stars and so on but that's still not typical of the universe because stars
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 185.12 193.65 <o,f0,female> in galaxies and most places in the universe a typical place in the universe is nowhere near any galaxies so
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 194.93 203.46 <o,f0,female> let 's go further till we're outside the galaxy and look back and yeah there's the huge galaxy with spiral arms laid out in front of us and
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 204.78 212.90 <o,f0,female> at this point we've come one hundred thousand light years from here but we're still nowhere near
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 213.55 221.23 <o,f0,female> a typical place in the universe to get to a typical place you've got to go one thousand times as far as that
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 221.95 230.26 <o,f0,female> into intergalactic space and so what does that look like typical what does a typical place in the universe look like well
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 250.46 262.08 <o,f0,female> well not quite not quite perfect you see in intergalactic space intergalactic space is completely dark pitch dark it's so dark
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 262.45 271.01 <o,f0,female> that if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you and that star were to explode as a supernova
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 272.31 280.20 <o,f0,female> and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you you still wouldn't be able to see even a glimmer
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 287.68 296.40 <o,f0,female> is so bright so brilliant an event that it would kill you stone dead at a range of several light years
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 297.36 307.52 <o,f0,female> and yet from intergalactic space it's so far away you wouldn't even see it it's also very cold out there less than three degrees above absolute zero
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 308.08 321.05 <o,f0,female> and it's very empty the vacuum there is one million times less dense than the highest vacuum that our best technology on earth can currently create so that's how
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 322.23 330.10 <o,f0,female> different a typical place is from this place and that is how un typical this place is so can we have the lights back on please
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 330.80 332.21 <o,f0,male> thank you
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 333.75 345.19 <o,f0,female> now how do we know about an environment that's so far away and so different and so alien from anything we're used to well the earth our environment in the form of us
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 345.77 354.42 <o,f0,female> is creating knowledge well what does that mean well look out even further than we've just been i mean from here with a telescope
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 354.74 363.02 <o,f0,female> and you'll see things that look like stars they're called quasars quasars originally meant quasi stellar object which means
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 363.41 370.68 <o,f0,female> things that look a bit like stars but they're not stars and we know what they are
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 372.00 379.03 <o,f0,female> billions of years ago and billions of light years away the material at the center of a galaxy collapsed
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 379.57 389.02 <o,f0,female> towards a super massive black hole and then intense magnetic fields directed some of the energy of that gravitational collapse and some of the matter
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 389.64 396.34 <o,f0,female> back out in the form of tremendous jets which illuminated lobes with the brilliance of i think it's a trillion
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 398.98 399.67 <o,f0,male> now
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 400.33 408.65 <o,f0,female> the physics of the human brain could hardly be more unlike the physics of such a jet we couldn't survive for an instant in it
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 424.81 434.24 <o,f0,female> and yet that jet happened in precisely such a way that billions of years later on the other side of the universe
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 434.63 446.49 <o,f0,female> some bit of chemical scum could accurately describe and model and predict and explain above all there's your reference what was happening there
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 446.98 448.17 <o,f0,female> in reality
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 449.04 458.80 <o,f0,female> the one physical system the brain contains an accurate working model of the other the quasar not just a superficial image of it though it contains that as well
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 459.26 468.88 <o,f0,female> but an explanatory model embodying the same mathematical relationships and the same causal structure now that is knowledge
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 469.45 483.17 <o,f0,female> and if that weren't amazing enough the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other is increasing with time that is the growth of knowledge so the laws of physics have this special property
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 483.60 493.14 <o,f0,female> that physical objects as unlike each other as they could possibly be can nevertheless embody the same mathematical and causal structure
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 493.99 503.92 <o,f0,female> and to do it more and more so over time so we are a chemical scum that is different this chemical scum has universality
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 504.39 517.30 <o,f0,female> its structure contains with ever increasing precision the structure of everything this place and not other places in the universe is a hub which contains within itself
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 517.53 527.15 <o,f0,female> the structural and causal essence of the whole of the rest of physical reality and so far from being insignificant the fact that the laws of physics allow this
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 527.38 535.11 <o,f0,female> or even mandate that this can happen is one of the most important things about the physical world
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 536.16 546.17 <o,f0,female> how does the solar system and our environment in the form of us acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe well one thing that's
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 547.35 554.84 <o,f0,female> true about stephen hawking 's remark i mean it is true but it's the wrong emphasis one thing that's true about it is that
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 555.31 567.59 <o,f0,female> it doesn't do it with any special physics there's no special dispensation no miracles involved it does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance one of them is matter
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 568.36 579.75 <o,f0,female> because the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing information processing is computation computation requires a computer there's no known way of making a computer without matter
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 580.15 590.18 <o,f0,female> we also need energy to make the computer and most important to make the media in effect onto which we record the knowledge that we discover and then
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 590.86 598.66 <o,f0,female> thirdly less tangible but just as essential for the open ended creation of knowledge of explanations is
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 599.51 608.05 <o,f0,female> evidence now our environment is inundated with evidence we happen to get round to testing let 's say
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 608.94 615.76 <o,f0,female> newton 's law of gravity about three hundred years ago but the evidence that we used to do that was
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 616.45 624.41 <o,f0,female> falling down on every square meter of the earth for billions of years before that and will continue to fall on for billions of years afterwards
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 625.04 633.94 <o,f0,female> and the same is true for all the other sciences as far as we know evidence to discover the most fundamental truths of all the sciences is
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 634.35 641.77 <o,f0,female> here just for the taking on our planet our location is saturated with evidence and also with matter and energy
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 642.15 653.14 <o,f0,female> out in intergalactic space those three prerequisites for the open ended creation of knowledge are at their lowest possible supply as i said it's empty it's cold and it's dark out
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 654.97 655.95 <o,f0,male> or is it
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 656.72 661.80 <o,f0,female> now actually that's just another parochial misconception because
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 663.54 669.94 <o,f0,female> imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space the same size as our home the solar system
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 670.18 678.08 <o,f0,female> now that cube is very empty by human standards but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 678.47 689.63 <o,f0,female> and a million tons is enough to make say a self contained space station on which there's a colony of scientists that are devoted to creating an open ended stream of knowledge and so on
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 690.33 699.79 <o,f0,female> now it's way beyond present technology to even gather the hydrogen from intergalactic space and form it into other elements and so on but
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 700.42 712.92 <o,f0,female> the thing is in a comprehensible universe if something isn't forbidden by the laws of physics then what could possibly prevent us from doing it other than knowing how in other words it's a matter of knowledge
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 713.14 720.83 <o,f0,female> not resources and the same well if we could do that we'd automatically have an energy supply because the transmutation would be a fusion reactor
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 721.48 734.22 <o,f0,female> and evidence well again it's dark out there to human senses but all you've got to do is take a telescope even one of present day design look out and you'll see the same galaxies as we do from here
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 735.15 749.13 <o,f0,female> and with a more powerful telescope you'll be able to see stars and planets in those galaxies you'll be able to do astrophysics and learn the laws of physics and locally there you could build particle accelerators and learn elementary particle physics and chemistry and so on
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 761.68 772.51 <o,f0,female> but i have to tell you and sorry richard but i never did like biology field trips much and i think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million years
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 776.51 784.05 <o,f0,female> in fact intergalactic space does contain all the prerequisites for the open ended creation of knowledge
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 784.85 796.58 <o,f0,female> any such cube anywhere in the universe could become the same kind of hub that we are if the knowledge of how to do so were present
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 798.38 809.58 <o,f0,female> so we're not in a uniquely hospitable place if intergalactic space is capable of creating an open ended stream of explanations then so is almost every other environment so is the
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 810.28 824.72 <o,f0,female> so is a polluted earth and the limiting factor there and here is not resources because they're plentiful but knowledge which is scarce now this cosmic knowledge
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 824.98 834.08 <o,f0,female> based view may and i think ought to make us feel very special but it should also make us feel vulnerable because it means that
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 834.66 846.20 <o,f0,female> without the specific knowledge that's needed to survive the ongoing challenges of the universe we won 't survive them all it takes is for a supernova to go off a few light years away and we'll all be dead
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 846.99 857.82 <o,f0,female> martin rees has recently written a book about our vulnerability to all sorts of things from astrophysics to scientific experiments gone wrong and most importantly to
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 858.46 870.38 <o,f0,female> terrorism with weapons of mass destruction and he thinks that civilization only has a fifty percent chance of surviving this century i think he 's going to talk about that later in the conference now i don't think that
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 882.52 894.17 <o,f0,female> it depends not on chance but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time the danger is not at all unprecedented species go extinct all the time
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 905.67 915.87 <o,f0,female> then logically our only hope is to make use of the one feature that distinguishes our species and our civilization from all the others
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 916.47 927.93 <o,f0,female> namely our special relationship with the laws of physics our ability to create new explanations new knowledge to be a hub of existence
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 928.34 940.02 <o,f0,female> so let me now apply this to a current controversy not because i want to advocate any particular solution but just to illustrate the kind of thing i mean and the controversy is global warming
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 940.58 954.25 <o,f0,female> now i'm a physicist but i'm not the right kind of physicist in regard to global warming i'm just a layman and the rational thing for a layman to do is to take seriously the prevailing scientific theory
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 954.56 960.02 <o,f0,female> and according to that theory it's already too late to avoid a disaster because
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 960.49 969.23 <o,f0,female> if it's true that our best option at the moment is to prevent co two emissions with something like the kyoto protocol with its constraints on economic activity and
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 980.20 985.87 <o,f0,female> the actions that are advocated are not even purported to solve the problem merely to postpone it by a little
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 986.30 994.64 <o,f0,female> so it's already too late to avoid it and it probably has been too late to avoid it ever since before anyone realized the danger
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 994.89 1006.46 <o,f0,female> was probably already too late in the nineteen seventies when the best available scientific theory was telling us that industrial emissions were about to precipitate a new ice age in which billions would die
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 1007.73 1016.58 <o,f0,female> now the lesson of that seems clear to me and i don't know why it isn't informing public debate it is that we can't always know
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 1016.86 1026.66 <o,f0,female> when we know of an impending disaster and how to solve it at a cost less than the cost of the disaster itself then there's not going to be much argument really
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 1027.25 1035.91 <o,f0,female> but no precautions and no precautionary principle can avoid problems that we do not yet foresee
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 1047.61 1057.52 <o,f0,female> that's only if we know what to prevent if you've been punched on the nose then the science of medicine does not consist of teaching you how to avoid punches
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 1058.14 1065.88 <o,f0,female> if medical science stopped seeking cures and concentrated on prevention only then it would achieve very little of either
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 1066.32 1080.41 <o,f0,female> the world is buzzing at the moment with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs it ought to be buzzing with plans to reduce the temperature and with plans to live at the higher temperature
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 1080.74 1093.04 <o,f0,female> and not at all costs but efficiently and cheaply and some such plans exist things like swarms of mirrors in space to deflect the sunlight away and encouraging aquatic organisms to eat more carbon dioxide
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 1093.49 1101.96 <o,f0,female> at the moment these things are fringe research they're not central to the human effort to face this problem or problems in general
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 1102.41 1115.47 <o,f0,female> and with problems that we are not aware of yet the ability to put right not the sheer good luck of avoiding indefinitely is our only hope not just of solving problems but of survival
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 1116.19 1116.46 <o,f0,male> so
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 1118.14 1121.18 <o,f0,female> take two stone tablets and
DavidDeutsch_2005G 1 DavidDeutsch_2005G 1121.43 1133.30 <o,f0,female> carve on them on one of them carve problems are soluble and on the other one carve problems are inevitable thank you
