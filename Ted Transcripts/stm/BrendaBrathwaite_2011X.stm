BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 15.99 23.63 <o,f0,female> we think of games there 's all kinds of things maybe you 're ticked off or maybe you 're looking forward to a new game you 've been up too late playing a game all these things happen to me
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 23.63 37.88 <o,f0,female> but when we think about games a lot of times we think about stuff like this first person shooters or the big what we would call aaa games or maybe you 're a facebook game player this is one my partner and i worked on maybe you play facebook games and that 's what we 're making right now this is a lighter form of game
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 37.88 43.97 <o,f0,female> maybe you think about the tragically boring board games that hold us hostage in thanksgiving situations
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 43.97 62.89 <o,f0,female> this would be one of those tragically boring board games that you can figure out or maybe you 're in your living room you know playing with the wii with the kids or something like that and you know there 's this whole range of games and that 's very much what i think about i make my living from games i 've been lucky enough to do this since i was fifteen which also qualifies as i 've never really had a real job
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 62.89 75.55 <o,f0,female> but we think about games as fun and that 's completely reasonable but let 's just think about this so this one here this is the one thousand nine hundred and eighty olympics now i don 't know where you guys were but i was in my living room it was practically a religious event
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 75.64 95.5 <o,f0,female> and this is when the americans beat the russians and this was yes it was technically a game hockey is a game but really was this a game i mean people cried i 've never seen my mother cry like that at the end of monopoly and so this was just an amazing experience or you know if anybody here is from boston
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 95.5 102.49 <o,f0,female> so when the boston red sox won the world series after i believe three hundred and fifty one years
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 102.76 115.12 <o,f0,female> when they won the world series it was amazing i happened to be living in springfield at the time and the best part of it was is that you would close the women 's door in the bathroom and i remember seeing go sox and i thought really
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 134.55 138.39 <o,f0,female> so this was an amazing experience and again yes it was a game
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 138.39 144.83 <o,f0,female> but they didn 't write newspaper articles people didn 't say you know really i can die now because the red sox won
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 163.66 167.44 <o,f0,female> and i was at a dinner part of the job of it when you 're a chair of a department is to
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 167.44 171.18 <o,f0,female> eat and i did that very well and so i 'm out at a dinner with this guy
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 171.18 183.05 <o,f0,female> called zig jackson so this is zig in this photograph this is also one of zig 's photographs he 's a photographer and he goes all around the country taking pictures of himself
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 183.05 200.5 <o,f0,female> and you can see here he 's got zig 's indian reservation and this particular shot this is one of the more traditional shots this is a rain dancer and this is one of my favorite shots here so you can look at this and maybe you 've even seen things like this this is an expression of culture right and this
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 216.47 230.57 <o,f0,female> right like seriously nobody would do this it baffles the mind and so zig being indian likewise it baffles his mind his favorite photograph my favorite photograph of his which i don 't have in here is indian taking picture of white people taking pictures of indians
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 251.55 258.25 <o,f0,female> or not and that was fascinating to me as a game designer because it never occurs to me like should i make the game about this difficult topic
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 258.25 264.37 <o,f0,female> or not because we just make things that are fun or you know will make you feel fear you know that visceral excitement
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 264.5 269.81 <o,f0,female> but every other medium does it so this is my kid this is maezza and when she was
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 269.81 273.88 <o,f0,female> seven years old she came home from school one day and like i do every single day i asked her
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 273.88 288.85 <o,f0,female> what 'd you do today so she said we talked about the middle passage now this was a big moment maezza 's dad is black and i knew this day was coming i wasn 't expecting it at seven i don 't know why but i wasn 't anyways so i asked her how do you feel about that
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 289.2 308.24 <o,f0,female> so she proceeded to tell me and so any of you who are parents will recognize the bingo buzzwords here so the ships start in england they come down from england they go to africa they go across the ocean that 's the middle passage part they come to america where the slaves are sold she 's telling me but abraham lincoln was elected president and then he passed the emancipation proclamation and now they 're free
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 308.24 320.37 <o,f0,female> pause for about ten seconds can i play a game mommy and i thought that 's it and so you know this is the middle passage this is an incredibly significant event
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 320.37 324.57 <o,f0,female> and she 's treating it like basically some black people went on a cruise
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 353.03 356.49 <o,f0,female> this was the boat it was made quickly obviously
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 382.69 392.64 <o,f0,female> and she realizes you know we don 't have enough food and so she asks what to do and i say well we can either remember she 's seven we can either put some people in the water
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 396.03 406.42 <o,f0,female> and she just the look on her face came over and she said now mind you this is after a month of this is black history month right after a month she says to me did this really happen
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 463.45 468.74 <o,f0,female> so this is a game called siochan leat it 's peace be with you it 's the entire history of my family in a single game
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 468.76 479.72 <o,f0,female> i made another game called train i was making a series of six games that covered difficult topics and if you 're going to cover a difficult topic this is one you need to cover and i 'll let you figure out what that 's about on your own
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 479.95 489.84 <o,f0,female> and i also made a game about the trail of tears this is a game with fifty thousand individual pieces i was crazy when i decided to start it but i 'm in the middle of it now
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 489.9 500.84 <o,f0,female> it 's the same thing i 'm hoping that i 'll teach culture through these games and the one i 'm working on right now which is because i 'm right in the middle of it and these for some reason choke me up like crazy is a game called mexican kitchen workers
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 1 BrendaBrathwaite_2011X 500.84 513.76 <o,f0,female> and originally it was a math problem more or less like here 's the economics of illegal immigration and the more i learned about the mexican culture my partner is mexican the more i learned that you know for all of us food is a basic need but
