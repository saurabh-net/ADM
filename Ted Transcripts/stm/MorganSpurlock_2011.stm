MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 25.25 26.83 <o,f0,male> i
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 37.16 39.28 <o,f0,male> difficult and dangerous
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 39.85 42.37 <o,f0,male> and i spent thirty days eating nothing but this
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 43.24 44.78 <o,f0,male> fun in the beginning
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 47.18 48.81 <o,f0,male> very dangerous in the end
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 50.15 58.99 <o,f0,male> in fact most of my career i 've been immersing myself into seemingly horrible situations for the whole goal of trying to
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 58.99 66.75 <o,f0,male> examine societal issues in a way that make them engaging that make them interesting that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertaining and
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 66.75 68.3 <o,f0,male> accessible to an audience
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 68.33 75.47 <o,f0,male> so when i knew i was coming here to do a ted talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship i knew i would want to do something a little different
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 75.77 79.24 <o,f0,male> so as some of you may or may not have heard a couple weeks ago i
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 79.24 81.04 <o,f0,male> took out an ad on ebay
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 81.74 84.06 <o,f0,male> i sent out some facebook messages
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 84.6 86.14 <o,f0,male> some twitter messages
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 97.63 102.48 <o,f0,male> was going to get the once in a lifetime opportunity because i 'm sure chris anderson will never let it happen again
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 107.36 109.4 <o,f0,male> that at the time didn 't have a title
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 109.55 114.87 <o,f0,male> didn 't really have a lot of content and didn 't really give much hint as to what the subject matter would actually be
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 115.33 117.13 <o,f0,male> so what you were getting was this
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 117.5 120.87 <o,f0,male> your name here presents my ted talk
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 120.96 130.47 <o,f0,male> that you have no idea what the subject is and depending on the content could ultimately blow up in your face especially if i make you or your company look stupid for doing it but that being said
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 130.65 132.8 <o,f0,male> it 's a very good media opportunity
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 144.58 146.32 <o,f0,male> that 's just a working title by the way
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 151.68 157.48 <o,f0,male> i knew that someone would buy the naming rights now if you 'd have asked me that a year ago i wouldn 't have been able to tell you that with any certainty
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 157.58 167.35 <o,f0,male> but in the new project that i 'm working on my new film we examine the world of marketing advertising and as i said earlier i put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 167.45 169.51 <o,f0,male> but nothing could prepare me
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 169.68 173 <o,f0,male> nothing could ready me for anything as difficult
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 173.37 175.1 <o,f0,male> or as dangerous
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 262.36 264.5 <o,f0,male> it is the ultimate respect
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 268.51 270.9 <o,f0,male> people are going to be to it
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 288.37 290.99 <o,f0,male> pursuing a couple big really obvious brands
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 331.56 335.27 <o,f0,male> turns out it really means we want nothing to do with your movie
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 357.49 370.84 <o,f0,male> this intersection of new media and old media and the fractured media landscape isn 't the idea to get that new buzz worthy delivery vehicle that 's going to get that message to the masses no that 's what i thought
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 371.04 375.03 <o,f0,male> but the problem was you see my idea had one fatal
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 375.03 378.54 <o,f0,male> flaw and that flaw
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 385.33 391.89 <o,f0,male> this would have been fine but what this image represents was the problem see when you do a google image search for transparency this is
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 397.83 400.7 <o,f0,male> this is one of the first images that comes up so
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 401.02 403.19 <o,f0,male> i like the way you roll sergey brin
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 407.62 410.69 <o,f0,male> this is was the problem transparency
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 410.81 414.77 <o,f0,male> free from pretense or deceit easily detected or seen through
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 414.77 431.88 <o,f0,male> readily understood characterized by visibility or accessibility of information especially concerning business practices that last line being probably the biggest problem you see we hear a lot about transparency these days our politicians say it our president says it even our ceo 's say it
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 432.13 438.68 <o,f0,male> but suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality something suddenly changes but why well transparency is scary
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 455.35 457.52 <o,f0,male> and it 's also very risky
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 494.21 501.94 <o,f0,male> he would say son there 's three sides to every story there 's your story there 's my story
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 514.59 519.01 <o,f0,male> that i would have to go on my own i 'd have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies myself
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 548.59 553.3 <o,f0,male> the greatest movie ever sold so how specifically will we see ban in the film
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 553.66 558.9 <o,f0,male> any time i 'm ready to go any time i open up my medicine cabinet you will see ban deodorant
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 566.72 581.98 <o,f0,male> i want to help you calm down so maybe you should put some one before the interview so we 'll offer one of these fabulous scents whether it 's a floral fusion or a paradise winds they 'll have their chance we will have them geared for both male or female solid roll on or stick whatever it may be
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 582.48 584.44 <o,f0,male> that 's the two cent tour
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 584.97 588.83 <o,f0,male> so now i can answer any of your questions and give you the five cent tour
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 622.99 627.37 <o,f0,male> i think fresh is a great word that really spins this category into the positive versus
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 641.78 649.07 <o,f0,male> what about me what about a regular guy i need to go talk to the man on the street the people who are like me the regular joes they need to tell me about my brand
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 673.9 679.89 <o,f0,male> dark glamor i like a lot of black colors a lot of grays and stuff like that
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 728.34 732.43 <o,f0,male> but i do often find myself at the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 833.39 840.18 <o,f0,male> will just focus on one of their strengths or the other instead of focusing on both most companies
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 882.83 885.86 <o,f0,male> up attributes are things like being playful
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 886.29 890.96 <o,f0,male> being fresh like the fresh prince contemporary adventurous edgy
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 890.96 897.15 <o,f0,male> daring like errol flynn nimble or agile profane domineering magical or mystical like gandalf
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 906.85 915.36 <o,f0,male> are you reliable stable familiar safe secure sacred contemplative or wise like the dalai lama or yoda
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 915.85 917.37 <o,f0,male> over the course of this film
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 917.76 930.86 <o,f0,male> we had five hundred plus companies who were up and down companies saying no they didn 't want any part of this project they wanted nothing to do with this film mainly because they would have no control they would have no control over the final product but we did get seventeen brand partners
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 930.94 936.39 <o,f0,male> who were willing to relinquish that control who wanted to be in business with someone as mindful and as playful as myself
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 937.62 942.34 <o,f0,male> and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn 't be able to tell
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 942.38 945.21 <o,f0,male> stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 945.78 956.29 <o,f0,male> they enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they 're using mri 's to target the desire centers of your brain for both commercials as well
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 971.86 974.38 <o,f0,male> schools all across america
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 975.24 988.82 <o,f0,male> what 's incredible for me is the projects that i 've gotten the most feedback out of or i 've had the most success in are ones where i 've interacted with things directly and that 's what these brands did they cut out the middleman they cut out their agencies and said maybe these agencies don 't have my best interest in mind
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 988.99 996.66 <o,f0,male> i 'm going to deal directly with the artist i 'm going to work with him to create something different something that 's going to get people thinking that 's going to challenge the way we look at the world
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 996.82 1003.85 <o,f0,male> and how has that been for them has it been successful well since the film premiered at the sundance film festival let 's take a look according to burrelles
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 1003.88 1021.22 <o,f0,male> the movie premiered in january and since then and this isn 't even the whole thing we 've had nine hundred million media impressions for this film that 's literally covering just like a two and a half week period that 's only online no print no tv the film hasn 't even been distributed yet it 's not even online it 's not even streaming it 's not even been out into other foreign countries yet
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 1021.22 1022.87 <o,f0,male> so ultimately
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 1023.3 1031.64 <o,f0,male> this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum and not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to advised their clients not to take part
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 1032.27 1042.71 <o,f0,male> what i always believe is that if you take chances if you take risks that in those risks will come opportunity i believe that when you push people away from that you 're pushing them more towards failure
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 1043.05 1049.73 <o,f0,male> i believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse then you 're preparing your whole company to be reward challenged
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 1050.12 1064.49 <o,f0,male> i feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take risks we need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may scare them ultimately moving forward i think we have to embrace fear we 've got to put that bear in a cage
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 1075.04 1080.9 <o,f0,male> one big spoonful at a time we have to embrace risk and ultimately we have to embrace transparency
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 1082.3 1090.98 <o,f0,male> today more than ever a little honesty is going to go a long way and that being said through honesty and transparency my entire talk embrace transparency
MorganSpurlock_2011 1 MorganSpurlock_2011 1091.25 1092.85 <o,f0,male> has been brought to you
