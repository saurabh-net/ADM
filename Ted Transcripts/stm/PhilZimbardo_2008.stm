PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 36.81 47.41 <o,f0,female> and i had friends who were really good kids who lived out the doctor jekyll mister hyde scenario robert louis stevenson that is they took drugs got in trouble went to jail some got killed
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 48.24 57.12 <o,f0,female> and some did it without drug assistance so when i read robert louis stevenson that wasn't fiction the only question is what was in the juice and more importantly
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 57.47 68.40 <o,f0,female> that line between good and evil which privileged people like to think is fixed and impermeable with them on the good side and the others on the bad side i knew that line was movable and it was permeable
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 69.00 77.79 <o,f0,female> people could be seduced across that line and under good and some rare circumstances bad kids could recover with help with reform with rehabilitation
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 93.49 105.25 <o,f0,female> that tells us several things one the world is was will always be filled with good and evil because good and evil is the yin and yang of the human condition it tells me something else if you remember god 's favorite angel was lucifer
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 106.01 117.69 <o,f0,female> apparently lucifer means the light it also means the morning star in some scripture and apparently he disobeyed god and that's the ultimate disobedience to authority and when he did
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 135.58 144.74 <o,f0,female> he didn't do a good job of keeping it there though so this arc of the cosmic transformation of god 's favorite angel into the devil for me sets the context for understanding
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 145.15 154.22 <o,f0,female> human beings who are transformed from good ordinary people into perpetrators of evil so the lucifer effect although it focuses on the negatives
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 155.05 166.82 <o,f0,female> the negatives that people can become not the negatives that people are leads me to a psychological definition evil is the exercise of power and that's the key it's about power
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 177.46 184.20 <o,f0,female> you google evil a word that should surely have withered by now you come up with one hundred and thirty six million hits in a third of a second
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 184.76 187.52 <o,f0,female> a few years ago i am sure all of you were shocked
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 187.87 201.39 <o,f0,female> as i was with the revelation of american soldiers abusing prisoners in a strange place in a controversial war abu ghraib in iraq and these were men and women who were putting prisoners through
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 204.41 213.77 <o,f0,female> i was shocked but i wasn't surprised because i had seen those same visual parallels when i was the prison superintendent of the stanford prison study immediately the bush administration military
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 215.01 226.80 <o,f0,female> what what all administrations say when there's a scandal don 't blame us it's not the system it's the few bad apples the few rogue soldiers my hypothesis is american soldiers are good usually maybe it was the barrel that was bad
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 238.88 251.04 <o,f0,female> i could study him have him come to my home get to know him do psychological analysis to see was he a good apple or bad apple and thirdly i had access to all of the one thousand pictures that these soldiers took
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 262.24 270.17 <o,f0,female> what i've done is i organized them into various categories but these are by united states military police army reservists
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 270.85 283.48 <o,f0,female> they are not soldiers prepared for this mission at all and it all happened in a single place tier one a on the night shift why tier one a was the center for military intelligence it was the interrogation hold
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 284.21 295.08 <o,f0,female> cia was there interrogators from titan corporation all there and they're getting no information about the insurgency so they're going to put pressure on these soldiers military police to cross the line
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 295.44 305.25 <o,f0,female> give them permission to break the will of the enemy to prepare them for interrogation to soften them up to take the gloves off those are the euphemisms and this is how it was interpreted
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 415.65 423.21 <o,f0,female> pretty horrific that's one of the visual illustrations of evil and it should not have escaped you that
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 423.57 431.74 <o,f0,female> the reason i paired the prisoner with his arms out with leonardo da vinci's ode to humanity is that that prisoner was mentally ill
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 432.04 443.54 <o,f0,female> that prisoner covered himself with shit every day and they used to have to roll him in dirt so he wouldn't stink but the guards ended up calling him shit boy what was he doing in that prison rather than in some mental institution
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 460.85 471.27 <o,f0,female> so how do psychologists go about understanding such transformations of human character if you believe that they were good soldiers before they went down to that dungeon there are three ways the main way is it's called dispositional
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 471.55 480.29 <o,f0,female> we look at what's inside of the person the bad apples this is the foundation of all of social sciences the foundation of religion the foundation of war
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 497.35 509.95 <o,f0,female> and social scientists stop there and they miss the big point that i discovered when i became an expert witness for abu ghraib the power is in the system the system creates the situation that corrupts the individuals and the system is the legal political
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 526.77 528.54 <o,f0,female> with these three factors
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 529.57 538.50 <o,f0,female> and it's a dynamic interplay what do the people bring into the situation what does the situation bring out of them and what is the system that creates and maintains that situation
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 548.35 556.84 <o,f0,female> effect although it focuses on evil really is a celebration of the human mind 's infinite capacity to make any of us kind or cruel
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 568.10 581.53 <o,f0,female> this is a wonderful cartoon in the new yorker which really summarizes my whole talk i 'm neither a good cop nor a bad cop jerome like yourself i'm a complex amalgam of positive and negative personality traits that emerge or not depending on the circumstances
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 584.41 590.50 <o,f0,female> some of you think you know about but very few people have ever read the story you watched the movie
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 629.07 639.22 <o,f0,female> four dollars for your time and it said we don't want college students we want men between twenty and fifty in the later studies they ran women ordinary people barbers clerks white collar people so you go
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 640.43 647.36 <o,f0,female> and one of you is going to be a learner and one of you is going to be a teacher the learner 's a genial middle aged guy he gets tied up to the shock apparatus in another room
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 648.85 655.19 <o,f0,female> could be middle aged could be as young as twenty and one of you is told by the authority the guy in the lab coat your job
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 655.91 663.79 <o,f0,female> to give this guy material to learn gets it right reward him gets it wrong you press a button on the shock box the first button is fifteen volts he doesn't even feel it
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 664.42 671.63 <o,f0,female> that's the key all evil starts with fifteen volts and then the next step is another fifteen volts the problem is at the end of the
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 700.76 710.96 <o,f0,female> what percent of american citizens would go to the end they said only one percent because that's sadistic behavior and we know psychiatry knows only one percent of americans are sadistic ok
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 723.78 732.22 <o,f0,female> in study sixteen where you see somebody like you go all the way ninety percent go all the way in study five if you see people rebel ninety percent rebel
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 742.92 751.55 <o,f0,female> and it's like a dial on human nature a dial in a sense that you can make almost everybody totally obedient down to the majority down to
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 753.03 759.89 <o,f0,female> so what are the external parallels for all research is artificial what's the validity in the real world nine hundred and twelve american citizens committed suicide
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 768.26 777.15 <o,f0,female> reverend jim jones he persuaded them to commit mass suicide and so he 's the modern lucifer effect a man of god who becomes the angel of death
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 779.46 781.40 <o,f0,female> study is all about individual authority
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 782.22 789.72 <o,f0,female> to control people most of the time we are in institutions so the stanford prison study is a study of the power of institutions
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 799.38 808.53 <o,f0,female> so this study which i did with my graduate students especially craig haney we also began work with an ad we didn't have money so we had a cheap little ad but we wanted college students for a study of prison life
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 873.93 881.31 <o,f0,male> the front door and knocks and says he 's looking for me so they right there you know they took me out the door they put my hands against
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 882.44 886.48 <o,f0,male> car it was a real cop car it was a real policeman and there were real neighbors in the street
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 888.40 889.14 <o,f0,male> this was
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 891.09 893.35 <o,f0,male> and there was cameras all around and neighbors all
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 894.07 896.15 <o,f0,male> they put me in the car then they drove me around
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 910.92 914.61 <o,f0,male> they put me in a cell which was just like a
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 915.80 917.01 <o,f0,male> with a door with bars
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 918.75 923.90 <o,f0,male> you could tell it wasn't a real jail they locked me in there in this degrading little outfit
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 925.29 926.91 <o,f0,male> they were taking this experiment
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 927.59 938.56 <o,f0,female> here are the prisoners who are going to be dehumanized they're going to become numbers here are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity guards get prisoners to clean the toilet bowls out with their bare hands to do other humiliating tasks
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 939.01 950.22 <o,f0,female> strip them naked they sexually taunt them they begin to do degrading activities like having them simulate sodomy you saw simulating fellatio in soldiers in abu ghraib my guards did it in five days
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 964.85 971.42 <o,f0,female> does it make a difference if warriors go to battle changing their appearance or not does it make a difference if they're anonymous in how they treat their victims
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 971.77 980.43 <o,f0,female> we know in some cultures they go to war they don't change their appearance in other cultures they paint themselves like lord of the flies in some they wear masks in many soldiers are anonymous in uniform
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 980.85 990.11 <o,f0,female> so this anthropologist john watson found twenty three cultures that had two bits of data do they change their appearance fifteen do they kill torture mutilate thirteen
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 1001.49 1011.38 <o,f0,female> that's the power of anonymity so what are the seven social processes that grease the slippery slope of evil mindlessly taking the first small step dehumanization of others de individuation of self
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 1011.84 1020.68 <o,f0,female> diffusion of personal responsibility blind obedience of authority uncritical conformity to group norms passive tolerance to evil through inaction or indifference and it
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 1029.17 1038.17 <o,f0,female> nothing is easier than to denounce the evil doer nothing more difficult than understanding him dostoevksy tells us understanding is not excusing psychology is not excuse iology
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 1065.81 1076.61 <o,f0,female> the landmark stanford study provides a cautionary tale for all military operations if you give people power without oversight it's a prescription for abuse they knew that and let that happen
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 1078.13 1080.77 <o,f0,female> so another report an investigative report by general fay
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 1081.56 1082.28 <o,f0,female> the system is
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 1105.60 1117.94 <o,f0,female> paradigm shift in all of these areas the shift is away from the medical model that focuses only on the individual the shift is toward a public health model that recognizes situational and systemic vectors of disease
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 1133.61 1142.13 <o,f0,female> that's a decision that you have to make that's a personal thing so i want to end very quickly on a positive note heroism as the antidote to evil
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 1142.49 1152.57 <o,f0,female> by promoting the heroic imagination especially in our kids in our educational system we want kids to think i'm the hero in waiting waiting for the right situation to come along and i will act heroically
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 1161.95 1175.95 <o,f0,female> the counterpoint to hannah arendt 's banality of evil our traditional societal heroes are wrong because they are the exceptions they organize their whole life around this that's why we know their names and our kids heroes are also role models for them because they have supernatural talents
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 1176.28 1182.74 <o,f0,female> we want our kids to realize most heroes are everyday people and the heroic act is unusual this is joe darby
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 1182.98 1191.52 <o,f0,female> he was the one that stopped those abuses you saw because when he saw those images he turned them over to a senior investigating officer he was a low level private and that stopped
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 1192.22 1201.67 <o,f0,female> was he a hero no they had to put him in hiding because people wanted to kill him and then his mother and his wife for three years they were in hiding this is the woman who stopped the stanford prison
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 1202.85 1211.22 <o,f0,female> i said it got out of control i was the prison superintendent i didn't know it was out of control i was totally indifferent she came down saw that madhouse and said you know what
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 1211.59 1219.17 <o,f0,female> it's terrible what you're doing to those boys they're not prisoners they're not guards they're boys and you are responsible and i ended the study the next day
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 1219.92 1221.81 <o,f0,female> the good news is i married her the next year
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 1232.21 1244.30 <o,f0,female> came to my senses obviously so situations have the power to do through but the point is this is the same situation that can inflame the hostile imagination in some of us that makes us perpetrators of evil
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 1244.63 1253.81 <o,f0,female> can inspire the heroic imagination in others it's the same situation and you're on one side or the other most people are guilty of the evil of inaction because your mother said don 't get involved
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 1255.42 1266.74 <o,f0,female> have to say mama humanity is my business so the psychology of heroism is we're going to end in a moment how do we encourage children in new hero courses that i'm working with matt langdon he has a hero workshop
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 1267.08 1277.51 <o,f0,female> to develop this heroic imagination this self labeling i am a hero in waiting and teach them skills to be a hero you have to learn to be a deviant because you're always going against the conformity of the group
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 1279.05 1288.24 <o,f0,female> heroes are ordinary people whose social actions are extraordinary who act the key to heroism is two things a you've got to act when other people are passive b you have to act socio centrically
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 1290.29 1300.11 <o,f0,female> with the story that some of you know about wesley autrey new york subway hero fifty year old african american construction worker he 's standing on a subway in new york a white guy falls on the tracks the subway train is coming
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 1300.45 1313.84 <o,f0,female> there's seventy five people there you know what they freeze he 's got a reason not to get involved he 's black the guy 's white and he 's got two little kids instead he gives his kids to a stranger jumps on the tracks puts the guy between the tracks lays on him the subway goes over him
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 1322.78 1326.33 <o,f0,female> and he said i did what anyone could do no big deal to jump
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 1326.95 1332.94 <o,f0,female> and the moral imperative is i did what everyone should do and so one day you will be in a new situation
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 1345.73 1354.01 <o,f0,female> the point is are we ready to take the path to celebrating ordinary heroes waiting for the right situation to come along to put heroic imagination into action
PhilZimbardo_2008 1 PhilZimbardo_2008 1354.85 1363.71 <o,f0,female> because it may only happen once in your life and when you pass it by you'll always know i could have been a hero and i let it pass me by so the point is thinking it and then doing
