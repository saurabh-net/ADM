FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 16.99 28.51 <o,f0,male> welcome to doha i am in charge of making this country 's food secure that is my job for the next two years to design an entire master plan
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 28.67 32.99 <o,f0,male> and then for the next ten years to implement it of course with
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 33.07 34.61 <o,f0,male> so many other people
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 76.37 84.89 <o,f0,male> none of the glamour that you see today existed no cities like you see today in doha or dubai or abu dhabi or kuwait or riyadh
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 85.06 89.34 <o,f0,male> it wasn 't that they couldn 't develop cities resources weren 't there to develop them
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 89.39 108.24 <o,f0,male> and you can see that life expectancy was also short most people died around the age of fifty so let 's move to chapter two the oil era one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine that 's when they discovered oil but unfortunately it wasn 't really fully exploited commercially until after the second
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 115.6 117.69 <o,f0,male> who roamed around the desert
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 118.26 120.58 <o,f0,male> looking for water looking for food
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 120.62 124.57 <o,f0,male> trying to take care of their livestock urbanize
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 125.05 130.76 <o,f0,male> you might find this strange but in my family we have different accents
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 131.2 135.14 <o,f0,male> my mother has an accent that is so different to my father
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 135.14 143.01 <o,f0,male> and we 're all a population of about three hundred thousand people in the same country there are about five or six accents in this country as i speak
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 174.1 183.9 <o,f0,male> let 's look at today this is probably the skyline that most of you know about doha so what 's the population today it 's one point seven million people
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 184.73 187.17 <o,f0,male> that is in less than sixty years
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 187.42 194.26 <o,f0,male> the average growth of our economy is about fifteen percent for the past five years lifespan
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 194.26 206.04 <o,f0,male> increased to seventy eight water consumption has increased to four hundred and thirty liters and this is amongst the highest worldwide from having no water whatsoever
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 206.46 216.28 <o,f0,male> to consuming water to the highest degree higher than any other nation i don 't know if this was a reaction to lack of water but
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 221.48 225.98 <o,f0,male> the interesting part is that we continue to grow fifteen percent
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 226.29 231.25 <o,f0,male> every year for the past five years without water
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 231.94 233.87 <o,f0,male> now that is historic
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 242.7 258.57 <o,f0,male> not only cities that we 're building but cities with dreams and people who are wishing to be scientists doctors build a nice home bring the architect design my house these people are adamant that this is a livable space when it wasn 't
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 258.83 262.1 <o,f0,male> but of course with the use of technology so brazil has one
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 262.1 264.61 <o,f0,male> thousand seven hundred and eighty two
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 264.76 279.57 <o,f0,male> millimeters per year of precipitation of rain qatar has seventy four and we have that growth rate the question is how how could we survive that we have no water whatsoever simply because of
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 279.65 298.91 <o,f0,male> this gigantic mammoth machine called desalination energy is the key factor here it changed everything it is that thing that we pump out of the ground we burn tons of probably most of you used it coming to doha so that is our lake if you can see it
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 298.91 307.33 <o,f0,male> that is our river that is how you all happen to use and enjoy water this is the best
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 307.33 310.42 <o,f0,male> technology that this region could ever
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 314.54 318.06 <o,f0,male> do you worry much i would say
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 318.37 328.55 <o,f0,male> perhaps if you look at the global facts you will realize of course i have to worry there is growing demand growing population we 've turned seven billion only a few months ago
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 328.99 335.43 <o,f0,male> and so that number also demands food and there 's predictions that we 'll be nine billion by two thousand and fifty
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 335.43 351.93 <o,f0,male> so a country that has no water has to worry about what happens beyond its borders there 's also changing diets by elevating to a higher socio economic level they also change their diet they start eating more meat
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 364.06 367.01 <o,f0,male> this is the situation in qatar for those who don 't know
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 367.75 373.02 <o,f0,male> we only have two days of water reserve we import ninety percent of our food
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 373.27 391.3 <o,f0,male> and we only cultivate less than one percent of our land the limited number of farmers that we have have been pushed out of their farming practices as a result of open market policy and bringing the big competitions etc etc so we also face risks
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 401.31 403.29 <o,f0,male> is there a sustainable solution
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 403.62 405.17 <o,f0,male> indeed there is
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 405.17 417.77 <o,f0,male> this slide sums up thousands of pages of technical documents that we 've been working on over the past two years let 's start with the water so we know very well i showed you earlier that we need this energy
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 417.77 432.43 <o,f0,male> so if we 're going to need energy what sort of energy a depletable energy fossil fuel or should we use something else do we have the comparative advantage to use another sort of energy i guess most of you by now realize that we do three hundred days of sun
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 432.98 452.72 <o,f0,male> and so we will use that renewable energy to produce the water that we need and we will probably put one thousand eight hundred megawatts of solar systems to produce three point five million cubic meters of water and that is a lot of water that water will go then to the farmers and the farmers will be able to water their plants
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 452.72 456.57 <o,f0,male> and they will be able then to supply society with food
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 456.57 462.13 <o,f0,male> but in order to sustain the horizontal line because these are the projects these are the systems that we will deliver
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 477.54 494.18 <o,f0,male> is legislation policies regulations without it we can 't do anything so that 's what we are planning to do within two years we should hopefully be done with this plan and taking it to implementation our objective is to be a millennium city
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 498.43 501.87 <o,f0,male> rome london
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 501.87 504.34 <o,f0,male> paris damascus cairo
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 504.51 507.9 <o,f0,male> we are only sixty years old but we want to live forever
FahadAlAttiya_2012S 1 FahadAlAttiya_2012S 508.74 514.99 <o,f0,male> as a city to live in peace thank you very much
