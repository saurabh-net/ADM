SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 17.14 21.67 <o,f0,male> speak today about the relationship between science and human values
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 22.24 25.61 <o,f0,male> now it's generally understood that questions of morality
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 33.15 35.63 <o,f0,male> thought that science can help us get what we value
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 39.10 47.06 <o,f0,male> and consequently most people i think most people probably here think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 47.63 53.00 <o,f0,male> questions like what is worth living for what is worth dying for what constitutes a good life
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 54.02 63.52 <o,f0,male> so i'm going to argue that this is an illusion that the separation between science and human values is an illusion and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 72.73 75.85 <o,f0,male> and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 76.89 81.01 <o,f0,male> often thought that there is no description of the way the world is
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 85.13 87.24 <o,f0,male> but i think this is quite clearly untrue
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 88.48 90.65 <o,f0,male> values are a certain kind of fact
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 92.39 95.09 <o,f0,male> facts about the wellbeing of conscious creatures
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 95.82 98.43 <o,f0,male> why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 99.77 101.22 <o,f0,male> we feel compassion for rocks
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 102.32 109.12 <o,f0,male> because we don't think rocks can suffer and if we're more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects as indeed we are
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 119.42 126.78 <o,f0,male> is something that we could be right or wrong about and if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 127.22 130.08 <o,f0,male> well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 130.77 132.00 <o,f0,male> and there is no
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 133.29 140.71 <o,f0,male> notion no version of human morality and human values that i've ever come across that is not at some point
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 146.73 148.73 <o,f0,male> even if you get your values from religion
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 149.56 158.02 <o,f0,male> even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death either to an eternity of happiness with god or an eternity of suffering in hell
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 158.63 168.98 <o,f0,male> you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes and to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim which of course may or may not be true
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 170.87 177.97 <o,f0,male> now to speak about the conditions of well being in this life for human beings we know that there is a continuum of such facts
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 178.55 181.10 <o,f0,male> we know that it's possible to live in a failed state
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 181.74 186.10 <o,f0,male> where everything that can go wrong does go wrong where mothers can not feed their children
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 193.13 196.31 <o,f0,male> and we know that it's possible to move along this continuum
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 206.21 209.76 <o,f0,male> that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 222.01 231.97 <o,f0,male> so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors probably not there are truths to be known about how human communities flourish
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 232.32 240.48 <o,f0,male> whether or not we understand these truths and morality relates to these truths so in talking about values we are talking about facts
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 242.10 252.50 <o,f0,male> now our situation in the world can be understood at many levels ranging from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements but if we're going to talk about human wellbeing
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 252.96 260.61 <o,f0,male> we are of necessity talking about the human brain because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 264.62 267.42 <o,f0,male> the suicide bomber does get seventy two virgins
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 267.90 269.79 <o,f0,male> in the afterlife in this life
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 270.44 275.35 <o,f0,male> his personality his rather unfortunate personality is the product of his brain
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 276.86 284.48 <o,f0,male> so the contributions of culture if culture changes us as indeed it does it changes us by changing our brains and so therefore
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 284.98 294.80 <o,f0,male> whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can at least in principle be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind neuroscience psychology
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 297.08 301.85 <o,f0,male> so what i'm arguing is that value is reducable to facts to facts about the conscious
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 305.20 311.36 <o,f0,male> and we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 312.13 320.04 <o,f0,male> i think of this as kind of a moral landscape with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well being of conscious creatures both personal and collective
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 321.00 329.08 <o,f0,male> and one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human wellbeing that we rarely access that few people access and these await our discovery
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 342.04 344.92 <o,f0,male> now let me be clear about what i'm not saying i'm not saying
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 345.67 348.51 <o,f0,male> that science is guaranteed to map this space
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 349.57 352.94 <o,f0,male> we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 353.41 359.13 <o,f0,male> i don't think for instance that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 359.85 366.87 <o,f0,male> or whether we should bomb iran 's nuclear facilities or whether you can deduct the full cost of ted as a business expense
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 369.20 375.65 <o,f0,male> if questions affect human wellbeing then they do have answers whether or not we can find them and just admitting this
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 389.68 391.80 <o,f0,male> there are twenty one states in our country
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 401.60 404.70 <o,f0,male> raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 405.46 409.28 <o,f0,male> and hundreds of thousands of children incidentally are subjected to this every year
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 410.05 413.99 <o,f0,male> the locations of these enlightened districts i think will fail to surprise you
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 414.96 426.59 <o,f0,male> we're not talking about connecticut and the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious the creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod lest we spoil the child
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 427.23 430.38 <o,f0,male> this is in proverbs thirteen and twenty and i believe twenty three
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 432.46 434.46 <o,f0,male> but we can ask the obvious question
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 435.88 448.15 <o,f0,male> is it a good idea generally speaking to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 450.27 450.76 <o,f0,male> is there
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 453.24 456.45 <o,f0,male> that this question has an answer and that it matters
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 459.24 463.14 <o,f0,male> now many of you might worry that the notion of wellbeing is truly undefined
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 463.58 469.22 <o,f0,male> and seemingly perpetually open to be reconstrued and so how therefore can there be an objective
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 486.27 488.00 <o,f0,male> now around eighty in the developed world
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 504.28 511.85 <o,f0,male> notice that the fact that the concept of health is open genuinely open for revision does not make it vacuous
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 512.73 516.51 <o,f0,male> the distinction between a healthy person and a dead one
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 517.22 520.49 <o,f0,male> is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 536.65 538.48 <o,f0,male> an objective morality
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 539.20 541.52 <o,f0,male> well think of how we talk about food
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 542.63 544.81 <o,f0,male> i would never be tempted to argue to you
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 551.38 554.64 <o,f0,male> but there is nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 556.04 559.87 <o,f0,male> the fact that there are many right answers to the question what is food
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 560.55 565.34 <o,f0,male> does not tempt us to say that there are no
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 592.35 596.20 <o,f0,male> a principle like don 't lose your queen is very good to follow
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 596.99 604.28 <o,f0,male> but clearly it admits of exceptions there are moments when losing your queen is a brilliant thing to do there are moments when it is the only good thing you can do
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 605.54 612.43 <o,f0,male> and yet chess is a domain of perfect objectivity the fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 616.41 619.87 <o,f0,male> the sort of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 622.41 624.18 <o,f0,male> consider the great problem of women 's bodies
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 627.49 630.16 <o,f0,male> is one thing you can do about them you can cover them up
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 631.03 634.50 <o,f0,male> now it is the position generally speaking of our intellectual community that
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 635.18 636.52 <o,f0,male> we may not like this
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 637.07 640.97 <o,f0,male> we might think of this as wrong in boston or palo alto
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 642.14 650.48 <o,f0,male> who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 651.67 660.48 <o,f0,male> and who are we to say even that they are wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 661.98 663.84 <o,f0,male> who are are we not to say this
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 666.89 673.17 <o,f0,male> that we know so little about human wellbeing that we have to be non judgmental about a practice like this
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 674.70 682.55 <o,f0,male> i'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil women should be able to wear whatever they want as far as i'm concerned but what does voluntary mean
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 685.41 687.23 <o,f0,male> where when a girl gets raped
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 688.18 691.34 <o,f0,male> her fathers first impulse rather often
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 692.03 694.11 <o,f0,male> is to murder her out of shame
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 696.49 699.55 <o,f0,male> just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 702.49 703.64 <o,f0,male> daughter gets raped
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 704.36 705.41 <o,f0,male> and what you want to do
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 722.21 727.61 <o,f0,male> now to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 730.25 733.74 <o,f0,male> this is what it's like to go to a news stand almost anywhere in the civilized world
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 734.72 739.33 <o,f0,male> now granted for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 743.59 746.10 <o,f0,male> if we are in a reflective mood we can ask
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 747.55 749.45 <o,f0,male> is this the perfect expression
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 750.08 758.63 <o,f0,male> of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women 's bodies i mean is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 760.34 763.91 <o,f0,male> probably not okay so perhaps there is some place on the spectrum
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 764.65 769.15 <o,f0,male> between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 791.34 802.43 <o,f0,male> now the irony from my perspective is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 802.78 808.51 <o,f0,male> and of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 809.47 814.65 <o,f0,male> not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well being
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 815.28 827.39 <o,f0,male> in fact the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 829.01 832.57 <o,f0,male> this is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 832.99 836.47 <o,f0,male> and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 841.61 846.19 <o,f0,male> the demagogues are right about one thing we need a universal conception of human values
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 848.03 856.61 <o,f0,male> now what stands in the way of this well one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality especially secular academic scientist types
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 857.58 860.51 <o,f0,male> when talking about morality we value differences of opinion
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 878.97 882.93 <o,f0,male> so we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one 's time
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 885.87 898.81 <o,f0,male> most western intellectuals look at this situation and say well there is nothing for the dalai lama to be really right about really right about or for ted bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 900.05 912.73 <o,f0,male> real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science he likes chocolate he likes vanilla there is nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 913.78 916.32 <o,f0,male> notice that we don't do this in science
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 916.84 920.07 <o,f0,male> on the left you have edward witten he 's a string theorist
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 921.05 927.64 <o,f0,male> if you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around in my experience half of them will say ed witten
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 928.65 930.56 <o,f0,male> the other half will tell you they don't like the question
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 950.84 956.28 <o,f0,male> nothing would happen because i'm not a physicist i don't understand string theory i'm the ted bundy of string theory
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 959.04 962.13 <o,f0,male> i wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 963.45 975.12 <o,f0,male> but this is just the point whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded that is what it is to have a domain of expertise that is what it is for knowledge to count
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 975.96 981.68 <o,f0,male> how have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 982.12 983.32 <o,f0,male> or moral talent
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 983.69 984.76 <o,f0,male> or moral genius
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 990.04 996.04 <o,f0,male> have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 997.32 1001.70 <o,f0,male> the taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1003.08 1006.73 <o,f0,male> no how is their ignorance
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1009.89 1013.24 <o,f0,male> any less obvious on the subject of human wellbeing
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1020.33 1022.62 <o,f0,male> so this i think is what the world needs now
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1023.41 1025.50 <o,f0,male> it needs people like ourselves
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1025.94 1033.04 <o,f0,male> to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing and morality relates
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1037.72 1043.32 <o,f0,male> for individuals and even for whole cultures to care about the wrong things
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1051.14 1055.15 <o,f0,male> just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1056.24 1062.80 <o,f0,male> we live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less and they will one day mean nothing
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1064.23 1073.14 <o,f0,male> we live in a world filled with destructive technology and this technology can not be uninvented it will always be easier to break things than to fix them
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1074.11 1077.92 <o,f0,male> it seems to me therefore patently obvious that we can no more
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1081.09 1091.85 <o,f0,male> respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human wellbeing than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1092.36 1097.57 <o,f0,male> or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes we simply must converge
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1098.32 1101.39 <o,f0,male> on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1134.84 1143.90 <o,f0,male> combustible material there whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world hearing some of this may well be doing the screaming with rage thing after as well
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1154.83 1156.65 <o,f0,male> in the muslim world spoken with a lot of
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1157.12 1159.96 <o,f0,male> muslim women and some of them would say something else they would say
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1161.17 1171.33 <o,f0,male> you know this is a celebration of female specialness it helps build that and it's a result of the fact that and this is arguable a sophisticated psychological view
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1171.46 1179.60 <o,f0,male> that male lust is not to be trusted i mean can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1196.60 1203.28 <o,f0,male> you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don't veil yourself and so if anyone in this room wanted to
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1204.94 1211.97 <o,f0,male> a very funny hat or tattoo their face i think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want but we have to be honest
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1212.66 1224.37 <o,f0,male> about the constraints that these women are placed under and so i think we shouldn 't be so eager to always take their word for it especially when it's one hundred and twenty degrees out and they're wearing a full burqa
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1225.42 1233.65 <o,f0,male> a a lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress but can you
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1251.73 1262.31 <o,f0,male> i think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail then you have to admit that
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1263.46 1273.59 <o,f0,male> going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail so we're going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1284.81 1292.19 <o,f0,male> we are inevitably going to converge on that fact space so everything is not going to be up for grabs it's not going to be like
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1293.30 1301.81 <o,f0,male> veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1302.45 1309.94 <o,f0,male> well educated in the context of men who do desire women i mean i don't think we need an nsf grant to know that
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1319.19 1325.42 <o,f0,male> interrogate them do people love their daughters just as much in these systems
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1326.35 1328.98 <o,f0,male> and i think there are clearly right answers to that c a and if the
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1329.27 1336.06 <o,f0,male> come out that actually they do are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgement on some of these issues
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1336.50 1348.27 <o,f0,male> well yeah modulo one obvious fact that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system so you can say like because i knew my gay son was going to go to hell if
SamHarris_2010 1 SamHarris_2010 1358.07 1368.98 <o,f0,male> again then we have to talk about wellbeing in a larger context it's all of us in this together not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus
