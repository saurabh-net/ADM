Rives4AM_2007 1 Rives4AM_2007 23.35 26.28 <o,f0,male> every single morning to milk my labrador this
Rives4AM_2007 1 Rives4AM_2007 69.83 83.22 <o,f0,male> time for inconveniences mishaps yearnings a time for plotting to whack the chief of police like in this classic scene from the godfather coppola's script describes these guys as exhausted in shirt sleeves it is
Rives4AM_2007 1 Rives4AM_2007 87.41 98.23 <o,f0,male> than that like autopsies and embalmings in isabel allende 's the house of the spirits after the breathtaking green haired rosa is murdered the doctors preserve her with unguents and morticians paste they worked
Rives4AM_2007 1 Rives4AM_2007 100.90 108.98 <o,f0,male> a time for even grimmer stuff than that like in last april 's new yorker magazine this short fiction piece by martin amis starts
Rives4AM_2007 1 Rives4AM_2007 109.96 119.39 <o,f0,male> on september eleven two thousand and one he opened his eyes at four a m in portland maine and mohamed atta 's last day began for a time
Rives4AM_2007 1 Rives4AM_2007 119.65 127.71 <o,f0,male> that i find to be the most placid and uneventful hour of the day four in the morning sure gets an awful lot of bad press
Rives4AM_2007 1 Rives4AM_2007 128.52 141.45 <o,f0,male> across a lot of different media from a lot of big names and it made me suspicious i figured surely some of the most creative artistic minds in the world really aren't all defaulting back to this one
Rives4AM_2007 1 Rives4AM_2007 141.90 155.63 <o,f0,male> easy trope like they invented it right could it be there is something more going on here something deliberate something secret and who got the four in the morning bad rap ball rolling anyway i say
Rives4AM_2007 1 Rives4AM_2007 156.01 166.64 <o,f0,male> this guy alberto giacometti shown here with some of his sculptures on the swiss one hundred franc note he did it with this famous piece from the new york museum of modern art its title
Rives4AM_2007 1 Rives4AM_2007 173.26 174.89 <o,f0,female> not just the earliest cryptic
Rives4AM_2007 1 Rives4AM_2007 193.96 202.20 <o,f0,male> on your blackberries or your iphones if you've got them it works a little something like this is a recent google search for four in the morning results vary of course
Rives4AM_2007 1 Rives4AM_2007 202.40 210.70 <o,f0,male> this is pretty typical the top ten results yield you four hits for faron young 's song it 's four in the morning
Rives4AM_2007 1 Rives4AM_2007 211.09 219.56 <o,f0,male> three hits for judi dench 's film four in the morning one hit for wislawa szymborska 's poem four in the morning but what you may ask
Rives4AM_2007 1 Rives4AM_2007 219.88 227.02 <o,f0,male> a polish poet a british dame a country music hall of famer all have in common besides this totally
Rives4AM_2007 1 Rives4AM_2007 239.83 246.95 <o,f0,female> he shot himself in the head on december ninth which incidentally is judi dench 's birthday
Rives4AM_2007 1 Rives4AM_2007 249.96 252.43 <o,f0,female> but he didn't die on dench 's birthday he languished
Rives4AM_2007 1 Rives4AM_2007 252.68 261.40 <o,f0,male> the following afternoon when he finally succumbed to a supposedly self inflicted gunshot wound at the age of sixty four which incidentally
Rives4AM_2007 1 Rives4AM_2007 261.72 272.78 <o,f0,male> is how old alberto giacometti was when he died where was wislawa szymborska during all this she has the world 's most absolutely watertight alibi on that very day december ten
Rives4AM_2007 1 Rives4AM_2007 273.74 280.70 <o,f0,male> ninety six while mister four in the morning faron young was giving up the ghost in nashville tennessee miss four in the morning or one of them anyway
Rives4AM_2007 1 Rives4AM_2007 282.51 294.99 <o,f0,male> was in stockholm sweden accepting the nobel prize for literature one hundred years to the day after the death of alfred nobel himself coincidence no it's creepy coincidence
Rives4AM_2007 1 Rives4AM_2007 297.30 301.52 <o,f0,female> to me has a much simpler magic that's like me telling you hey you know the nobel prize was
Rives4AM_2007 1 Rives4AM_2007 302.58 310.05 <o,f0,male> one which coincidentally is the same year alberto giacometti was born no not everything fits so
Rives4AM_2007 1 Rives4AM_2007 310.89 321.81 <o,f0,male> into the paradigm but that does not mean there's not something going on at the highest possible levels in fact there are people in this room who may not want me to show you this clip we're about

Rives4AM_2007 1 Rives4AM_2007 447.20 456.33 <o,f0,male> what happens to american presidents at four hundred on inauguration day what happened to william jefferson clinton we might not ever know and i noticed
Rives4AM_2007 1 Rives4AM_2007 456.55 459.55 <o,f0,female> he 's not exactly around here today to face any tough
