TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 27.67 36.86 <o,f0,female> it it 's our tendency to overestimate our likelihood of experiencing good events in our lives and underestimate our likelihood of experiencing bad events
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 36.86 50.18 <o,f0,female> so we underestimate our likelihood of suffering from cancer being in a car accident we overestimate our longevity our career prospects in short we 're more optimistic than realistic but we are oblivious to the fact
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 50.88 56.09 <o,f0,female> take marriage for example in the western world divorce rates are about forty percent
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 56.75 62.7 <o,f0,female> that means that out of five married couples two will end up splitting their assets
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 62.73 67.94 <o,f0,female> but when you ask newlyweds about their own likelihood of divorce they estimate it at
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 67.99 76.96 <o,f0,female> zero percent and even divorce lawyers who should really know better hugely underestimate their own likelihood of divorce
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 120.47 127.74 <o,f0,female> but only thirty percent said that they thought families in general are doing better than a few generations ago
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 127.74 144.47 <o,f0,female> and this is a really important point because we 're optimistic about ourselves we 're optimistic about our kids we 're optimistic about our families but we 're not so optimistic about the guy sitting next to us and we 're somewhat pessimistic about the fate of our fellow citizens and the fate of our country
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 144.47 150.38 <o,f0,female> but private optimism about our own personal future remains persistent
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 158.71 176.14 <o,f0,female> now i 'm a scientist i do experiments so to show you what i mean i 'm going to do an experiment here with you so i 'm going to give you a list of abilities and characteristics and i want you to think for each of these abilities where you stand relative to the rest of the population
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 176.62 180.8 <o,f0,female> the first one is getting along well with others
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 181.15 184.52 <o,f0,female> who here believes they 're at the bottom twenty five percent
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 195.32 196.96 <o,f0,female> that 's most of us here
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 204.87 206.78 <o,f0,female> how attractive are you
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 237.05 254.46 <o,f0,female> and it 's a global phenomenon the optimism bias has been observed in many different countries in western cultures in non western cultures in females and males in kids in the elderly it 's quite widespread but the question is is it good for us
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 254.87 273.87 <o,f0,female> so some people say no some people say the secret to happiness is low expectations i think the logic goes something like this if we don 't expect greatness if we don 't expect to find love and be healthy and successful well we 're not going to be disappointed when these things don 't happen
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 274.14 281.24 <o,f0,female> and if we 're not disappointed when good things don 't happen and we 're pleasantly surprised when they do we will be happy
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 281.24 294.56 <o,f0,female> so it 's a very good theory but it turns out to be wrong for three reasons number one whatever happens whether you succeed or you fail people with high expectations always feel better
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 294.56 308.92 <o,f0,female> because how we feel when we get dumped or win employee of the month depends on how we interpret that event the psychologists margaret marshall and john brown studied students with high and low expectations
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 308.94 320.5 <o,f0,female> and they found that when people with high expectations succeed they attribute that success to their own traits i 'm a genius therefore i got an a therefore i 'll get an a again and again in the future
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 320.5 328.37 <o,f0,female> when they failed it wasn 't because they were dumb but because the exam just happened to be unfair next time they will do better
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 328.37 343.65 <o,f0,female> people with low expectations do the opposite so when they failed it was because they were dumb and when they succeeded it was because the exam just happened to be really easy next time reality would catch up with them so they felt worse
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 351.25 361.57 <o,f0,female> the behavioral economist george lowenstein asked students in his university to imagine getting a passionate kiss from a celebrity any celebrity then he said
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 362.26 368.01 <o,f0,female> how much are you willing to pay to get a kiss from a celebrity if the kiss was delivered immediately
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 368.2 374.84 <o,f0,female> in three hours in twenty four hours in three days in one year in ten years
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 375.43 393.29 <o,f0,female> he found that the students were willing to pay the most not to get a kiss immediately but to get a kiss in three days they were willing to pay extra in order to wait now they weren 't willing to wait a year or ten years no one wants an aging celebrity but three days
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 393.99 396.96 <o,f0,female> seemed to be the optimum amount
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 397.53 402.86 <o,f0,female> so why is that well if you get the kiss now it 's over and done with
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 417.77 421 <o,f0,female> this is by the way why people prefer friday to sunday
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 429.35 442.32 <o,f0,female> but they don 't it 's not because they really really like being in the office and they can 't stand strolling in the park or having a lazy brunch we know that because when you ask people about their ultimate favorite day of the week
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 442.32 448.06 <o,f0,female> surprise surprise saturday comes in at first then friday then sunday
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 448.06 459.63 <o,f0,female> people prefer friday because friday brings with it the anticipation of the weekend ahead all the plans that you have on sunday the only thing you can look forward to is the work week
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 461.52 470.65 <o,f0,female> optimists are people who expect more kisses in their future more strolls in the park and that anticipation enhances their wellbeing
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 471.34 477.06 <o,f0,female> in fact without the optimism bias we would all be slightly depressed
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 477.06 496.32 <o,f0,female> people with mild depression they don 't have a bias when they look into the future they 're actually more realistic than healthy individuals but individuals with severe depression they have a pessimistic bias so they tend to expect the future to be worse than it ends up being
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 496.34 505.58 <o,f0,female> so optimism changes subjective reality the way we expect the world to be changes the way we see it but it also changes objective reality
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 505.74 508.32 <o,f0,female> it acts as a self fulfilling prophecy
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 508.44 520.24 <o,f0,female> and that is the third reason why lowering your expectations will not make you happy controlled experiments have shown that optimism is not only related to success it leads to success
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 520.24 535.54 <o,f0,female> optimism leads to success in academia and sports and politics and maybe the most surprising benefit of optimism is health if we expect the future to be bright stress and anxiety are reduced
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 535.54 547.51 <o,f0,female> so all in all optimism has lots of benefits but the question that was really confusing to me was how do we maintain optimism in the face of reality
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 547.89 559.15 <o,f0,female> as an neuroscientist this was especially confusing because according to all the theories out there when your expectations are not met you should alter them but this is not what we find
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 559.35 574.23 <o,f0,female> we asked people to come into our lab in order to try and figure out what was going on we asked them to estimate their likelihood of experiencing different terrible events in their lives so for example what is your likelihood of suffering from cancer
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 574.59 583.34 <o,f0,female> and then we told them the average likelihood of someone like them to suffer these misfortunes so cancer for example is about thirty percent
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 583.8 589.42 <o,f0,female> and then we asked them again how likely are you to suffer from cancer
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 589.42 604.09 <o,f0,female> what we wanted to know was whether people will take the information that we gave them to change their beliefs and indeed they did but mostly when the information we gave them was better than what they expected
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 604.47 612.27 <o,f0,female> so for example if someone said my likelihood of suffering from cancer is about fifty percent and we said
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 612.43 623.58 <o,f0,female> hey good news the average likelihood is only thirty percent the next time around they would say well maybe my likelihood is about thirty five percent so they learned quickly and efficiently
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 623.63 640.38 <o,f0,female> but if someone started off saying my average likelihood of suffering from cancer is about ten percent and we said hey bad news the average likelihood is about thirty percent the next time around they would say yep still think it 's about eleven percent
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 653.49 663.92 <o,f0,female> everyone remembers that the average likelihood of cancer is about thirty percent and the average likelihood of divorce is about forty percent but they didn 't think that those numbers were related to them
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 664.68 671.57 <o,f0,female> what this means is that warning signs such as these may only have limited impact
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 672.16 675.93 <o,f0,female> yes smoking kills but mostly it kills the other guy
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 710.49 714.35 <o,f0,female> one of these regions is called the left inferior frontal gyrus
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 714.35 725.68 <o,f0,female> so if someone said my likelihood of suffering from cancer is fifty percent and we said hey good news average likelihood is thirty percent the left inferior frontal gyrus would respond fiercely
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 725.68 738.95 <o,f0,female> and it didn 't matter if you 're an extreme optimist a mild optimist or slightly pessimistic everyone 's left inferior frontal gyrus was functioning perfectly well whether you 're barack obama or woody allen
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 739.56 749.55 <o,f0,female> on the other side of the brain the right inferior frontal gyrus was responding to bad news and here 's the thing it wasn 't doing a very good job
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 749.76 751.53 <o,f0,female> the more optimistic you were
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 751.76 756.93 <o,f0,female> the less likely this region was to respond to unexpected negative information
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 757.07 767.43 <o,f0,female> and if your brain is failing at integrating bad news about the future you will constantly leave your rose tinted spectacles on
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 768.02 770.3 <o,f0,female> so we wanted to know
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 770.31 771.94 <o,f0,female> could we change this
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 772.35 776.7 <o,f0,female> could we alter people 's optimism bias
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 776.83 782.83 <o,f0,female> by interfering with the brain activity in these regions and there 's a way for us to do that
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 782.83 799.99 <o,f0,female> this is my collaborator ryota kanai and what he 's doing is he 's passing a small magnetic pulse through the skull of the participant in our study into their inferior frontal gyrus and by doing that he 's interfering with the activity of this brain region for about half an hour
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 799.99 803.55 <o,f0,female> after that everything goes back to normal i assure you
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 820.43 830.63 <o,f0,female> now we interfere with the region that we found to integrate negative information in this task and the optimism bias grew even larger
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 830.65 846.05 <o,f0,female> we made people more biased in the way that they process information then we interfered with the brain region that we found to integrate good news in this task and the optimism bias disappeared
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 846.73 853.94 <o,f0,female> we were quite amazed by these results because we were able to eliminate a deep rooted bias in humans
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 854.14 869.98 <o,f0,female> and at this point we stopped and we asked ourselves would we want to shatter the optimism illusion into tiny little bits if we could do that would we want to take people 's optimism bias away
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 869.98 879.9 <o,f0,female> well i 've already told you about all of the benefits of the optimism bias which probably makes you want to hold onto it for dear life but there are
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 879.94 883.39 <o,f0,female> of course pitfalls and it would be really foolish of us to ignore them
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 883.73 902.14 <o,f0,female> take for example this email i recieved from a firefighter here in california he says fatality investigations for firefighters often include we didn 't think the fire was going to do that even when all of the available information was there to make safe decisions
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 902.14 916.08 <o,f0,female> this captain is going to use our findings on the optimism bias to try to explain to the firefighters why they think the way they do to make them acutely aware of this very optimistic bias in humans
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 938.49 943.93 <o,f0,female> so they have adjusted the two thousand and twelve olympic budget for the optimism bias
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 943.96 955.19 <o,f0,female> my friend who 's getting married in a few weeks has done the same for his wedding budget and by the way when i asked him about his own likelihood of divorce he said he was quite sure it was zero percent
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 955.62 968.55 <o,f0,female> so what we would really like to do is we would like to protect ourselves from the dangers of optimism but at the same time remain hopeful benefiting from the many fruits of optimism
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 968.55 980.69 <o,f0,female> and i believe there 's a way for us to do that the key here really is knowledge we 're not born with an innate understanding of our biases these have to be identified by scientific investigation
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 980.69 991.35 <o,f0,female> but the good news is that becoming aware of the optimism bias does not shatter the illusion it 's like visual illusions in which understanding them does not make them go away
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 991.35 1003.68 <o,f0,female> and this is good because it means we should be able to strike a balance to come up with plans and rules to protect ourselves from unrealistic optimism but at the same time remain hopeful
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 1015.98 1024 <o,f0,female> because to make any kind of progress we need to be able to imagine a different reality and then we need to believe that that reality is possible
