OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 12.40 21.28 <o,f0,female> so what's image got do with it and i must say i think emeka is trying to send a lot of of subliminal messages because i'm going to keep harping on some of the issues
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 21.66 27.10 <o,f0,female> that have come up but i'm going to try and do something different and try and just close the loop
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 27.63 39.94 <o,f0,female> with some of my personal stories and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we've been talking about so africa is a complex continent full of contradictions as you can see we're not the only ones
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 49.05 56.88 <o,f0,female> and you know it's amazing i mean we need a whole conference just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent just think about that
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 57.28 64.92 <o,f0,female> you know and this is typically what we've been talking about the role that the media plays in focusing just on the negative stuff now
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 65.36 72.75 <o,f0,female> why is that a problem a typical disaster story disease corruption poverty
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 73.45 79.86 <o,f0,female> and some of you might be standing here thinking saying ok you know ory you're harvard educated and
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 80.35 90.39 <o,f0,female> all you privileged people come here saying forget the poor people let 's focus on business and the markets and whatever and there are all there's the eighty percent of africans who
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 91.07 99.13 <o,f0,female> really need help and i want to tell you that this is my story ok and it's the story of many of the africans who are here
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 101.87 111.61 <o,f0,female> with poverty i didn't grow up in the slums or anything that dire but i know what it is to grow up without having money or being able to support
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 113.45 122.60 <o,f0,female> about bellwether signs the bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast you know when things were good we had eggs and sausages
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 123.61 132.09 <o,f0,female> bad we had porridge and like many african families my parents could never save because they supported siblings cousins
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 133.70 144.14 <o,f0,female> you know their parents and things were always dicey now when i was born they realized they had a pretty smart kid and they didn't want me to go to the neighborhood school which was free
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 145.35 156.74 <o,f0,female> very interesting approach to education which was they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford so they took me to a private catholic elementary school
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 157.85 169.56 <o,f0,female> which set the foundation for what ended up being my career and what happened was because they could afford it sometimes sometimes not i got kicked out pretty much every term
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 170.84 179.85 <o,f0,female> you know someone would come in with a list of the people who haven't paid school fees and when they started getting pretty strict you had to leave until your school fees could be
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 180.95 188.85 <o,f0,female> thinking i mean why don't these guys just take me to a cheap school because you know as a kid you're embarrassed and
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 201.54 208.12 <o,f0,female> talk about corruption in kenya we have an entrance exam to go into high school
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 208.76 218.24 <o,f0,female> and there's national schools which are like the best schools and provincial schools my dream school at that time was kenya high school a national school i missed the cutoff by one point
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 218.74 230.02 <o,f0,female> and i was so disappointed and i was like oh my god you know what am i going to do and my father said ok listen let 's go and try and talk to the headmistress you know it's just one point i mean maybe she'll let you in
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 230.93 239.57 <o,f0,female> still there so we went to the school and because we were nobodies and because we didn't have
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 239.90 247.59 <o,f0,female> privilege and because my father didn't have the right last name he was treated like dirt and i
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 247.93 256.98 <o,f0,female> and listened to the headmistress talk to him saying you know who do you think you are and you know you must be joking if you think you can get a slot
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 257.64 265.02 <o,f0,female> and i had gone to school with other girls who were kids of politicians and who had done much much worse than i did and they had slots
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 266.17 271.05 <o,f0,female> and there's nothing worse than seeing your parent being humiliated in front of you you know
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 271.87 282.21 <o,f0,female> and we left and i swore to myself i'm never ever going to have to beg for anything in my life they called me two weeks later they're like oh yeah you can come now and i told them to stuff it
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 286.24 288.56 <o,f0,female> final story and i sort of have to speak quickly
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 303.45 313.45 <o,f0,female> and i'm pretty much the one who figured it out because i was a nerd and i was in the states at the time and they called me he was very sick the first time he got sick
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 314.21 323.82 <o,f0,female> and he had cryptococcal meningitis and so i went on to google cryptococcal meningitis you know because of doctor patient privilege they couldn't really tell us what was going on
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 333.33 345.73 <o,f0,female> read about the disease i pretty much realized what was going on the first time he got sick he recovered but what happened was that he had to be on medication that at that time diflucan which in the states is used for yeast infections
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 346.67 352.78 <o,f0,female> cost thirty dollars a pill he had to be on that pill for the rest of his life
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 355.03 362.27 <o,f0,female> you know so money ran out he got sick again and up until that time he had a friend who used to travel to india
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 366.62 373.45 <o,f0,female> get him a generic version of it and that kept him going but the money ran out he got sick again
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 382.95 392.52 <o,f0,female> the family couldn't get cash for him to start the treatment until monday the hospital put him on a water drip for three days
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 406.56 415.40 <o,f0,female> and you know now imagine if and i could go on and on imagine if this is all you know about me how would you look at me
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 418.09 418.70 <o,f0,female> with pity
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 418.94 425.30 <o,f0,female> you know sadness and this is how you look at africa
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 426.08 434.67 <o,f0,female> this is the damage it causes you don't see the other side of me you don't see the blogger you don't see the harvard educated lawyer the vibrant person you know
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 435.10 444.98 <o,f0,female> and i just wanted to personalize that because we talk about it in big terms and you wonder you know so what but it's damaging
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 446.11 455.42 <o,f0,female> i'm not unique right imagine if all you knew about william was the fact that he grew up in a poor village and you didn't know about the windmill you know
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 488.15 495.33 <o,f0,female> so what is to be done first of all africans we need to get better at telling our stories we heard about that yesterday
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 495.64 505.04 <o,f0,female> we had some of them this morning you know blogging is one way of doing that afrigator is an aggregator of african blogs that
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 505.42 513.23 <o,f0,female> was developed in south africa so we need to start getting better if no one else will tell our stories let 's do it and going back to the point i was trying to make this is the
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 532.03 545.36 <o,f0,female> is a tanzanian first swahili blogger he 's the only african who 's contributing to this people please we can't whine and complain the west is doing this what are we doing
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 563.02 575.79 <o,f0,female> the cheetah generation the aid approach you know is flawed and after all the hoopla of live eight we're still not anywhere in the picture no you're not
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 587.51 593.36 <o,f0,female> the point i'm trying to make though is that it's not enough for us to criticize
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 594.15 603.41 <o,f0,female> for those of you in the diaspora who are struggling with where should i be should i move back should i stay you know just jump the continent needs you
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 604.21 618.15 <o,f0,female> and i can't emphasize that enough you know i walked away from a job with one of the top firms in dc covington and burling six figures with two paychecks or three paychecks i could solve a lot of my family 's problems
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 619.18 628.27 <o,f0,female> but i walked away from that because my passion was here and because i wanted to do things that were fulfillling and because i'm needed here you know
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 643.11 654.39 <o,f0,female> i'm a corporate lawyer most of the time for an organization called enablis that supports entrepreneurs in south africa we're now moving into east africa and we give them business development
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 655.60 666.58 <o,f0,female> services as well as financing loan and equity i've also set up a project in kenya and what we do is we track the performance of kenyan mps my partner m who 's like a tech guru
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 667.01 672.78 <o,f0,female> hacked wordpress it costs us like twenty dollars a month just for hosting everything else on there is
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 683.85 691.70 <o,f0,female> where people can ask their mps questions there are some mps who participate and come back and ask and basically we started this because we were tired of complaining
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 692.18 699.34 <o,f0,female> about our politicians you know i believe that accountability stems from demand you're not just going to be accountable out of the goodness of your heart
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 699.69 706.87 <o,f0,female> and we as africans need to start challenging our leaders what are they doing you know they're not going to change just
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 707.32 719.77 <o,f0,female> out of nowhere so we need new policies we need where's that coming from you know another thing is that these leaders are a reflection of our society we talk about african governments like they've been dropped from mars
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 720.17 729.09 <o,f0,female> you know they come from us and what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don't like and how can we change that
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 729.48 737.10 <o,f0,female> so mzalendo was one small way we thought we could start inspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 737.88 745.97 <o,f0,female> where do we go from here i believe in the power of ideas i believe in the power of sharing knowledge and i'd ask all of you when you leave here
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 746.66 753.34 <o,f0,female> please just share and keep the ideas that you've gotten out of here going because it can make a difference
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 754.04 762.57 <o,f0,female> other thing i want to urge you to do is take an interest in the individual i've had lots of conversations about things i think
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 762.88 773.61 <o,f0,female> need to be happening in africa people are like ok if you don't do aid i'm a bleeding heart liberal what can i do and when i talk about my ideas they're like but it's not scalable you know give me something i can do with
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 775.09 782.96 <o,f0,female> not that easy you know and sometimes just taking an interest in the individual in the fellows you've met and the businesspeople you've met
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 783.39 790.29 <o,f0,female> it can make a huge difference especially in africa because usually the individual in africa carries a lot of people behind them
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 802.52 811.07 <o,f0,female> my cousin ran out of school fees and she's really smart i was paying her school fees a cousin of mine died of aids left an orphan so we said well what are we going to do with her
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 811.44 819.97 <o,f0,female> you know she's now my baby sister and because of the opportunities that were afforded to me i am able to lift all those people so don't underestimate that
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 821.10 832.37 <o,f0,female> an example this man changed my life he 's a professor he 's now at vanderbilt he 's an undergrad professor mitchell seligson and because of him i got into harvard law school and because he took an interest
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 834.61 841.61 <o,f0,female> and he was just like this is an overeager student which we don't normally get in the united states because everyone else is cynical and
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 864.42 873.66 <o,f0,female> and to me at that time university i was at university of pitts for undergrad and that was like heaven ok because compared to what could have been in kenya so i'm like yeah i'm just applying to pitt for
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 875.28 884.86 <o,f0,female> you know you're smart you have all these things going for you and i'm like because i'm here and it's cheap and you know i kind of like pittsburgh like that's the dumbest reason i've ever heard
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 889.41 896.58 <o,f0,female> he took me under his wing and he encouraged me and he said look you can get into harvard you're that good ok and if they don't admit
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 897.68 909.79 <o,f0,female> they're the ones who are messed up and he built me up you know and this is just an illustration you can meet other individuals here we just need a push that's all i needed was a push to go to the next level
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 936.63 943.61 <o,f0,female> whoever they want to be here without having to leave and they can have
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 953.24 965.22 <o,f0,female> grow up you know not so good circumstances and you can move just because you are born in rural arkansas whatever that doesn't define who you are for most africans
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 966.91 974.57 <o,f0,female> where you live or where you were born and the circumstances under which you were born determine the rest of your life
OryOkolloh_2007G 1 OryOkolloh_2007G 974.74 983.31 <o,f0,female> i would like to see that change and the change starts with us and as africans we need to take responsibility for our continent thank you
