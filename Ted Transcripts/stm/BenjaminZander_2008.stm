BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 25.55 35.19 <o,f0,male> and one of them wrote situation hopeless stop they don't wear shoes and the other one wrote glorious opportunity they don't have any shoes yet
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 36.64 47.83 <o,f0,male> now there's a similar situation in the classical music world because there are some people who think that classical music is dying and there are some of us who think you ain't seen nothing yet
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 48.90 54.92 <o,f0,male> and rather than go into statistics and trends and tell you about all the orchestras that are closing
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 55.25 64.06 <o,f0,male> and the record companies that are folding i thought we should do an experiment tonight an experiment actually it's not really an experiment because i know the outcome
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 104.57 112.15 <o,f0,male> i see some of you recognize this child now if he practices for a year and takes lessons he 's now eight and he sounds like this
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 119.93 122.33 <o,f0,male> for another year and takes lessons now he 's nine
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 129.41 132.05 <o,f0,male> for another and takes lessons now he 's ten
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 143.99 147.68 <o,f0,male> if you'd waited if you'd waited for one more year you would have heard this
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 157.13 165.52 <o,f0,male> what happened was not maybe what you thought which is he suddenly became passionate engaged involved got a new teacher he hit puberty
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 165.65 174.21 <o,f0,male> or whatever it is what actually happened was the impulses were reduced you see the first time he was playing with an impulse on every note
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 181.80 182.84 <o,f0,male> by looking at my head
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 185.05 187.72 <o,f0,male> the nine year old the nine year old put an impulse on every
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 190.43 194.51 <o,f0,male> and the ten year old on every eight notes and the
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 195.42 197.28 <o,f0,male> one impulse on the whole phrase
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 200.46 202.70 <o,f0,male> i don't know how we got into this position
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 205.35 211.02 <o,f0,male> say i'm going to move my shoulder over move my body no the music pushed me over which is why i call it one
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 218.70 226.07 <o,f0,male> you know a gentleman was once watching a presentation i was doing when i was working with a young pianist he was the president of a corporation in ohio
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 226.46 236.25 <o,f0,male> and i was working with this young pianist and i said the trouble with you is you're a two buttock player you should be a one buttock player and i moved his body like that while he was playing and suddenly the music took off
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 236.65 245.79 <o,f0,male> took flight there was a gasp in the audience when they heard the difference and then i got a letter from this gentleman he said i was so moved i went back and i transformed my entire company into a one
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 278.16 278.87 <o,f0,male> don't mind
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 289.85 298.10 <o,f0,male> now comes the third group these are the people who never listen to classical music it's just simply not part of your life you might hear it like second hand smoke at the airport but
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 312.42 322.07 <o,f0,male> people think they're tone deaf actually i hear a lot my husband is tone deaf actually you cannot be tone deaf nobody is tone deaf if you were tone deaf you couldn't change the
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 322.86 328.92 <o,f0,male> on your car in a stick shift car you couldn't tell the difference between somebody from texas and somebody from rome
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 329.48 338.36 <o,f0,male> and the telephone the telephone if your mother calls on the miserable telephone she calls and says hello you not only know who it is you know what mood she's in
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 339.18 346.95 <o,f0,male> you have a fantastic ear everybody has a fantastic ear so nobody is tone deaf but i tell you what it doesn't work for me
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 347.33 357.05 <o,f0,male> to go on with this thing with such a wide gulf between those who understand love and passionate about classical music and those who have no relationship
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 357.98 371.25 <o,f0,male> the tone deaf people they're no longer here but even between those three categories it's too wide a gulf so i'm not going to go on until every single person in this room downstairs and in aspen and everybody else looking
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 373.00 378.01 <o,f0,male> will come to love and understand classical music so that's what
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 379.16 386.86 <o,f0,male> now you notice that there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that this is going to work if you look at my face
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 387.58 395.04 <o,f0,male> it's one of the characteristics of a leader that he not doubt for one moment the capacity of the people he 's leading
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 395.39 402.62 <o,f0,male> to realize whatever he 's dreaming imagine if martin luther king had said i have a dream of course i'm not sure they'll be up to it
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 443.56 448.55 <o,f0,male> i think probably happened in this room when i started you thought how beautiful that sounds
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 462.67 464.98 <o,f0,male> the same place for our summer holidays next year
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 488.21 501.25 <o,f0,male> has it ever occurred to you that the reason you feel sleepy in classical music is not because of you but because of us did anybody think while i was playing why is he using so many impulses if i'd done this with my head you certainly would have thought it and for
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 507.63 517.38 <o,f0,male> the rest of your life every time you hear classical music you'll always be able to know if you hear those impulses so let 's see what's really going on here
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 517.49 519.25 <o,f0,male> we have a b this is a b
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 520.09 523.70 <o,f0,male> the next note is a c and the job of the c is to make the b sad
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 536.86 540.57 <o,f0,male> with four sads now
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 545.80 546.84 <o,f0,female> we have
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 555.93 556.51 <o,f0,male> that might
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 566.97 572.67 <o,f0,male> nobody is tone deaf right nobody is you know every village in bangladesh and every
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 574.66 583.70 <o,f0,male> hamlet in china everybody knows da da da da da everybody knows who 's expecting that e now chopin didn't want to reach the e there
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 593.69 601.92 <o,f0,male> he backs away and he goes up to him again and almost kills him and the critics all of whom are sitting in the back row there they have to have an opinion so they say hamlet is a procrastinator
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 603.28 615.25 <o,f0,male> they say hamlet has an oedipus complex no otherwise the play would be over stupid that's why shakespeare puts all that stuff in hamlet you know ophelia going mad and the play within the play and yorick 's skull and the grave diggers
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 615.41 622.97 <o,f0,male> that's in order to delay until act five he can kill him it's the same with the chopin he 's just about to reach the
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 628.84 629.84 <o,f0,male> now he gets excited
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 633.14 636.58 <o,f0,male> have to worry about it now he gets to f sharp and finally he goes down to
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 644.89 652.57 <o,f0,male> now we call that a deceptive cadence because it deceives us i always tell my students if you have a deceptive cadence be sure to raise your eyebrows then everybody will know
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 661.58 663.45 <o,f0,male> it's the wrong chord now he tries e again
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 678.78 690.50 <o,f0,male> it's the same gesture he makes when he comes home after a long day turns off the key in his car and says aah i'm home because we all know where home is so this is a piece which goes from away to
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 691.84 701.79 <o,f0,male> all the way through and you're going to follow b c b c b c b down to a down to g down to f almost goes to e but otherwise the play would be over he goes back up to b he gets very excited
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 702.98 711.29 <o,f0,male> to e it's the wrong chord it's the wrong chord it's the wrong chord and finally goes to e and it's home and what you're going to see is one buttock playing
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 713.79 724.75 <o,f0,male> for me to join the b to the e i have to stop thinking about every single note along the way and start thinking about the long long
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 725.03 737.45 <o,f0,male> line from b to e you know we were just in south africa and you can't go to south africa without thinking of mandela in jail for twenty seven years what was he thinking about lunch
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 752.47 761.28 <o,f0,male> to follow the line all the way from b to e and i've one last request before i play this piece all the way through would you think of somebody who you
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 762.83 773.23 <o,f0,male> who 's no longer there a beloved grandmother a lover somebody in your life who you love with all your heart but that person is no longer with you
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 774.70 783.76 <o,f0,male> bring that person into your mind and at the same time follow the line all the way from b to e and you'll hear everything that
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 908.84 908.97 <o,f0,male> now
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 909.21 909.58 <o,f0,female> you
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 913.65 913.92 <o,f0,female> may be
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 917.47 924.40 <o,f0,male> you may be wondering why i'm clapping well i did this at a school in boston with about seventy seventh graders twelve year olds
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 924.84 936.01 <o,f0,male> and i did exactly what i did with you and i told them and explained them and the whole thing and at the end they went crazy clapping they were clapping i was clapping they were clapping finally i said why am i clapping and one of the little kids said because we were listening
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 949.78 960.14 <o,f0,male> by a piece by chopin now that is something now am i sure that every single person followed that understood it was moved by it of course i can't be sure but i tell you what happened to me i was in ireland
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 973.30 981.45 <o,f0,male> and one of them came to me the next morning and he said you know i've never listened to classical music in my life but when you played that shopping piece
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 983.84 992.07 <o,f0,male> he said my brother was shot last year and i didn't cry for him but last night when you played that piece he was the one i was thinking about
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 992.93 1000.02 <o,f0,male> and i felt the tears streaming down my face and you know it felt really good to cry for my brother so i made up my mind at that moment
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 1000.77 1007.87 <o,f0,male> classical music is for everybody everybody now
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 1008.28 1020.03 <o,f0,male> how would you walk because you know my profession the music profession doesn't see it that way they say three percent of the population likes classical music if only we could move it to four percent our problems would be
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 1032.56 1037.03 <o,f0,male> if you thought everybody loves classical music they just haven't found out about it yet
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 1037.85 1038.00 <o,f0,male> see
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 1039.44 1045.90 <o,f0,male> different worlds now i had an amazing experience i was forty five years old i'd been conducting for twenty years
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 1046.17 1055.27 <o,f0,male> and i suddenly had a realization the conductor of an orchestra doesn't make a sound my picture appears on the front of the cd
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 1058.16 1069.21 <o,f0,male> but the conductor doesn't make a sound he depends for his power on his ability to make other people powerful and that changed everything for me it was totally life changing
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 1079.40 1087.19 <o,f0,male> i wanted to know whether i was doing that and you know how you find out you look at their eyes if their eyes are shining you know you're doing it
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 1088.19 1096.32 <o,f0,male> you could light up a village with this guy 's eyes right so if the eyes are shining you know you're doing it if the eyes are not shining you
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 1096.69 1109.84 <o,f0,male> ask a question and this is the question who am i being that my players eyes are not shining we can do that with our children too who am i being that my children 's eyes
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 1111.42 1120.48 <o,f0,male> that's a totally different world now we're all about to end this magical on the mountain week and we're going back into the world
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 1121.19 1129.17 <o,f0,male> and i say it's appropriate for us to ask the question who are we being as we go back out into the world
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 1129.82 1144.06 <o,f0,male> and you know i have a definition of success for me it's very simple it's not about wealth and fame and power it's about how many shining eyes i have around me so now i have one last thought which is that it really makes a difference what we say
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 1145.27 1156.80 <o,f0,male> the words that come out of our mouth i learned this from a woman who survived auschwitz one of the rare survivors she went to auschwitz when she was fifteen years old and
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 1159.41 1164.60 <o,f0,male> her brother was eight and the parents were lost and
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 1165.81 1173.67 <o,f0,male> she told me this she said we were in the train going to auschwitz and i looked down and saw my brother 's shoes were missing
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 1175.07 1181.77 <o,f0,male> so stupid can't you keep your things together for goodness sake the way an elder sister might speak to a younger brother
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 1197.27 1205.66 <o,f0,male> and i made a vow and the vow was i will never say anything that couldn't stand as the last thing i ever say
BenjaminZander_2008 1 BenjaminZander_2008 1206.94 1216.49 <o,f0,male> now can we do that no and we'll make ourselves wrong and others wrong but it is a possibility to live into thank you
