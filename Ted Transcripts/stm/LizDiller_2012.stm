LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 12.99 31.07 <o,f0,female> conventionally divide space into private and public realms and we know these legal distinctions very well because we 've become experts at protecting our private property and private space but we 're less attuned to the nuances of the public
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 31.07 42.52 <o,f0,female> what translates generic public space into qualitative space i mean this is something that our studio has been working on for the past decade and we 're doing this through some case studies
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 42.52 54.32 <o,f0,female> a large chunk of our work has been put into transforming this neglected industrial ruin into a viable post industrial space that looks forward and backward at the same time
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 54.85 70.45 <o,f0,female> and another huge chunk of our work has gone into making relevant a site that 's grown out of sync with its time we 've been working on democratizing lincoln center for a public that doesn 't usually have dollar three hundred to spend on an opera ticket
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 71.44 81.55 <o,f0,female> so we 've been eating drinking thinking living public space for quite a long time and it 's taught us really one thing and that is
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 81.64 84.43 <o,f0,female> to truly make good public space
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 84.7 91.98 <o,f0,female> you have to erase the distinctions between architecture urbanism landscape media design
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 92.02 107.48 <o,f0,female> and so on it really goes beyond distinction now we 're moving onto washington d c and we 're working on another transformation and that is for the existing hirshhorn museum that 's sited on the most revered public space in america
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 109.84 112.24 <o,f0,female> the national mall the mall is a symbol of
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 112.47 123.7 <o,f0,female> american democracy and what 's fantastic is that this symbol is not a thing it 's not an image it 's not an artifact actually it 's a space and it 's kind of
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 123.76 127.6 <o,f0,female> just defined by a line of buildings on either side
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 128.03 133.12 <o,f0,female> it 's a space where citizens can voice their discontent and show their power
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 133.32 146.32 <o,f0,female> it 's a place where pivotal moments in american history have taken place and they 're inscribed in there forever like the march on washington for jobs and freedom and the great speech that martin luther king gave there
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 146.55 155.29 <o,f0,female> the vietnam protests the commemoration of all that died in the pandemic of aids the march for women 's reproductive rights
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 155.42 164.69 <o,f0,female> right up until almost the present the mall is the greatest civic stage in this country for dissent
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 164.79 175.58 <o,f0,female> and it 's synonymous with free speech even if you 're not sure what it is that you have to say it may just be a place for civic commiseration
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 177.38 179.23 <o,f0,female> there is a huge disconnect
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 179.48 188.62 <o,f0,female> we believe between the communicative and discursive space of the mall and the museums that line it to either side
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 188.85 206.22 <o,f0,female> and that is that those museums are usually passive they have passive relationships between the museum as the presenter and the audience as the receiver of information and so you can see dinosaurs and insects and collections of locomotives and all of that
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 206.5 209.63 <o,f0,female> but you 're really not involved you 're being talked to
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 209.99 212.51 <o,f0,female> when richard koshalek
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 212.53 216.71 <o,f0,female> took over as director of the hirshhorn in two thousand and nine
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 230.98 239.94 <o,f0,female> together always and all the time there could be some very special relationship that could be forged here
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 239.94 245.91 <o,f0,female> in its uniqueness the question is is it possible ultimately for art to insert itself
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 245.93 260.56 <o,f0,female> into the dialogue of national and world affairs and could the museum be an agent of cultural diplomacy there are over one hundred and eighty embassies in washington d c there are over five hundred think tanks
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 260.56 270.86 <o,f0,female> there should be a way of harnessing all of that intellectual and global energy into and somehow through the museum there should be some kind of brain trust
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 271.27 280.59 <o,f0,female> so the hirshhorn as we began to think about it and as we evolved the mission with richard and his team it 's really his life blood
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 280.62 287.61 <o,f0,female> but beyond exhibiting contemporary art the hirshhorn will become a public forum
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 287.66 291.62 <o,f0,female> a place of discourse for issues around
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 291.62 293.24 <o,f0,female> culture
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 294.43 297.1 <o,f0,female> politics and policy
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 297.1 306.98 <o,f0,female> it would have the global reach of the world economic forum it would have the interdisciplinarity of the ted conference it would have the informality of the town square
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 307.38 316.19 <o,f0,female> and for this new initiative the hirshhorn would have to expand or appropriate a site for a contemporary deployable structure
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 316.19 330.32 <o,f0,female> this is it this is the hirshhorn so a two hundred and thirty foot diameter concrete doughnut designed in the early seventy s by gordon bunshaft it 's hulking it 's silent it 's cloistered it 's arrogant it 's a design challenge
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 330.6 335.9 <o,f0,female> architects love to hate it one redeeming feature is it 's lifted up off the ground
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 335.98 351.67 <o,f0,female> and it 's got this void and it 's got an empty core kind of in the spirit and that facade very much corporate and federal style and around that space the ring is actually galleries very very difficult to mount shows in there
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 351.76 359.91 <o,f0,female> when the hirshhorn opened ada louise huxstable the new york times critic had some choice words neo penitentiary modern a maimed
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 363.8 367.37 <o,f0,female> almost four decades later how will this building expand
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 367.68 369.38 <o,f0,female> for a new progressive program
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 369.57 381.48 <o,f0,female> where would it go it can 't go in the mall there is no space there it can 't go in the courtyard it 's already taken up by landscape and by sculptures well there 's always the hole
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 381.92 401.51 <o,f0,female> but how could it take the space of that hole and not be buried in it invisibly how could it become iconic and what language would it take the hirshhorn sits among the mall 's momumental institutions most are neoclassical heavy and opaque made of stone or concrete
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 401.51 407.16 <o,f0,female> and the question is if one inhabits that space what is the material
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 439.22 442.32 <o,f0,female> the expansion takes the shape of its container
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 442.35 445.46 <o,f0,female> and it oozes out wherever it can the top and sides
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 445.85 447.7 <o,f0,female> but more poetically
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 447.73 455.85 <o,f0,female> we like to think of the structure as inhaling the democratic air of the mall bringing it into itself
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 464.08 483.48 <o,f0,female> that was the lounge it 's basically one big volume of air that just oozes out in every direction the membrane is translucent it 's made of silcon coated glass fiber and it 's inflated twice a year for one month at a time this is the view from the inside
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 483.58 486.18 <o,f0,female> so you might have been wondering
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 509.5 512.9 <o,f0,female> it 's a combination of iconoclasm
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 513.09 517.39 <o,f0,female> and adoration
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 517.85 535.26 <o,f0,female> there was also some creative interpretation involved the congressional buildings act of one thousand nine hundred and ten limits the height of buildings in d c to one hundred and thirty feet except for spires towers domes and minarettes this pretty much exempts monuments of the church and state
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 535.26 543.91 <o,f0,female> and the bubble is one hundred and fifty three ft that 's the pantheon next to it it 's about one point two million cubic feet of compressed air
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 544.31 547.76 <o,f0,female> and so we argued it on the merits of being a dome
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 547.77 550.54 <o,f0,female> so there it is very stately
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 551.05 564.18 <o,f0,female> among all the stately buildings in the mall and while this hirshhorn is not landmarked it 's very very historically sensitive and so we couldn 't really touch its surfaces we couldn 't leave any traces behind
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 564.18 577.46 <o,f0,female> so we strained it from the edges and we held it by cables it 's a study of some bondage techniques which are actually very very important because it 's hit by wind all the time there 's one permanent steel ring at the top
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 577.52 580.39 <o,f0,female> but it can 't be seen from any vantage point on the mall
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 580.65 590.36 <o,f0,female> there are also some restrictions about how much it could be lit it glows from within it 's translucent but it can 't be more lit than the capitol or some of the monuments so it 's
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 590.36 602.97 <o,f0,female> down the hierarchy on lighting so it comes to the site twice a year it 's taken off the delivery truck it 's hoisted and then it 's inflated with this low pressure air
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 603.18 609.34 <o,f0,female> and then it 's restrained with the cables and then it 's ballasted with water at the very bottom
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 609.92 617.93 <o,f0,female> this is a very strange moment where we were asked by the bureaucracy at the mall how much time would it take to install
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 618.08 625.46 <o,f0,female> and we said well the first erection would take one week and they really connected with that idea and
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 638.72 651.51 <o,f0,female> this is a point cloud there are extreme pressures this is a very very unusual building in that there 's no gravity load but there 's load in every direction and i 'm just going to zip through
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 651.59 669.57 <o,f0,female> these slides and this is the space in action so flexible interior for discussions just like this but in the round luminous and reconfigurable could be used for anything for performances films for installations
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 669.57 683.04 <o,f0,female> and the very first program will be one of cultural dialogue and diplomacy organized in partnership with the council on foreign relations form and content are together here the bubble is an anti monument
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 683.04 701.88 <o,f0,female> the ideals of participatory democracy are represented through suppleness rather than rigidity art and politics occupy an ambiguous site outside the museum walls but inside of the museum 's core blending its air with the democratic air of the mall
LizDiller_2012 1 LizDiller_2012 711.8 713.82 <o,f0,female> thank you
