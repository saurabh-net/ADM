RennyGleeson_2009 1 RennyGleeson_2009 13.69 28.29 <o,f0,male> to talk to you about today is two things one the rise of a culture of availability and two a request so we're seeing a rise of this availability being driven by mobile device proliferation globally across all social strata
RennyGleeson_2009 1 RennyGleeson_2009 28.62 42.64 <o,f0,male> we're seeing along with that proliferation of mobile devices an expectation of availability and with that comes the third point which is obligation and an obligation to that availability and the problem is we're still working through from a societal standpoint
RennyGleeson_2009 1 RennyGleeson_2009 43.28 55.98 <o,f0,male> how we allow people to be available there's a significant delta in fact between what we're willing to accept apologies to hans rosling he said anything that's not using real stats is a lie but the big delta there is
RennyGleeson_2009 1 RennyGleeson_2009 56.42 62.15 <o,f0,male> how we deal with this from a public standpoint so we've developed certain tactics and strategies to
RennyGleeson_2009 1 RennyGleeson_2009 78.07 86.65 <o,f0,male> the stretch ok the gentleman on the left is saying screw you i'm going to check my device but the guy here on the right he 's doing the stretch it's that
RennyGleeson_2009 1 RennyGleeson_2009 87.92 94.56 <o,f0,male> out the physical contortion to get that device just below the tabletop or my favorite the love you mean it
RennyGleeson_2009 1 RennyGleeson_2009 100.41 111.94 <o,f0,male> or this one coming to us from india you can find this on youtube the gentleman who 's recumbent on a motorcycle while text messaging or what we call the sweet gravy stop me before i kill again
RennyGleeson_2009 1 RennyGleeson_2009 112.57 118.28 <o,f0,male> that is actually the device what this is doing is we find a a direct collision
RennyGleeson_2009 1 RennyGleeson_2009 121.92 134.60 <o,f0,male> we find a direct collision between availability and what's possible through availability and a fundamental human need which we've been hearing about a lot the need

RennyGleeson_2009 1 RennyGleeson_2009 164.92 177.83 <o,f0,male> our reality right now is less interesting than the story we're going to tell about it later this one i love this poor kid clearly a prop don't get me wrong a willing prop but the kiss that's being documented kind of looks like
RennyGleeson_2009 1 RennyGleeson_2009 180.07 182.08 <o,f0,male> this is the sound of one hand clapping
