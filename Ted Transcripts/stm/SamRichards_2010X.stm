SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 16.14 20.47 <o,f0,male> students often ask me what is sociology
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 20.61 22.6 <o,f0,male> and i tell them it 's the study
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 22.78 26.98 <o,f0,male> of the way in which human beings are shaped by things that they don 't see
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 31.66 41.29 <o,f0,male> how can i understand those invisible forces and i say empathy start with empathy it all begins with empathy take yourself
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 49.53 63.49 <o,f0,male> if a hundred years ago china had been the most powerful nation in the world and they came to the united states in search of coal and they found it and in fact they found lots of it right here and pretty soon they began shipping that coal
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 73.09 77.54 <o,f0,male> and they got fabulously wealthy in doing so and they built beautiful cities
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 77.54 80.91 <o,f0,male> all powered on that coal
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 89.8 92.05 <o,f0,male> i saw people struggling to get by
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 92.38 95.62 <o,f0,male> not knowing what was what and what was next
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 95.62 107.43 <o,f0,female> and then i asked myself the question i say how 's it possible that we could be so poor here in the united states because the coal is such a wealthy resource it 's so much money and i realized because the chinese
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 125.28 130.87 <o,f0,male> and sophisticated technology in order to ensure that people like me would not speak out
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 130.87 132.83 <o,f0,male> against this relationship
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 140.12 146.54 <o,f0,male> and everywhere were symbols of the chinese everywhere a constant reminder
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 170.3 173.93 <o,f0,male> and it gets really ugly and the chinese respond in a very ugly way
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 175.69 179.94 <o,f0,male> and before we know it they send in the tanks and then send in the troops
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 182.78 186.74 <o,f0,male> and lots of people are dying and it 's a very very difficult situation
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 187.63 190.21 <o,f0,male> can you imagine what you would feel
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 190.77 199.84 <o,f0,male> if you were in my shoes can you imagine walking out of this building and seeing a tank sitting out there or a truck full of soldiers
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 209.41 215.47 <o,f0,female> if you can that 's empathy that 's empathy you 've left your shoes and you 've stood in mine
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 217.97 222.93 <o,f0,male> okay so that 's the warm up that 's the warm up now we 're going to have
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 223.25 237.08 <o,f0,male> the real radical experiment and so for the remainder of my talk what i want you to do is put yourselves in the shoes of an ordinary arab muslim living in the middle east in particular in iraq
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 239.14 240.74 <o,f0,male> and so to help you
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 241.28 245.35 <o,f0,male> perhaps you 're a member of this middle class family in baghdad
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 245.61 251.85 <o,f0,male> and what you want is the best for your kids you want your kids to have a better life and you watch the news
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 251.85 268.34 <o,f0,male> you pay attention you read the newspaper you go down to the coffee shop with your friends and you read the newspapers from around the world and sometimes you even watch satellite cnn from the united states so you have a sense of what the americans are thinking but really you just want a better life for yourself that 's what you want
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 290.38 303.2 <o,f0,female> everybody knows that people here back in the united states know it 's about oil it 's because somebody else has a design for your resource it 's your resource it 's not somebody else 's it 's your land
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 303.63 307.1 <o,f0,female> it 's your resource somebody else has a design for it
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 307.94 313.22 <o,f0,female> and you know why they have a design you know why they have their eyes set on it because they have an entire
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 333.83 335.86 <o,f0,female> and they have big cities and the cities
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 335.86 338.62 <o,f0,male> are all dependent on oil
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 363.01 373.45 <o,f0,female> something else you see that you talk about americans don 't talk about this but you do there 's this thing this militarization of the world and it 's centered right in the united states and the united states
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 373.45 375.45 <o,f0,male> is responsible for almost one
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 379.3 390.39 <o,f0,male> four percent of the world 's population and you feel it you see it every day it 's part of your life and you talk about it with your friends you read about it and back
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 390.47 392.91 <o,f0,male> when saddam hussein was in power
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 401.61 406.03 <o,f0,male> somehow suddenly things mattered
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 407.54 411.31 <o,f0,male> and what you see something else the united states
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 419.37 425.43 <o,f0,male> there are a lot of countries oil producing countries that aren 't very democratic but supported by the united states
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 427.65 445.36 <o,f0,female> these incursions these two wars the ten years of sanctions the eight years of occupation the insurgency that 's been unleashed on your people the tens of thousands the hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 447.97 450.05 <o,f0,male> all because of oil
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 450.65 453.74 <o,f0,male> you can 't help but think that you talk about
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 454.73 457.41 <o,f0,male> it it 's in the forefront of your mind always
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 470.12 475.05 <o,f0,male> once a life of happiness and joy and suddenly pain and sorrow
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 477.12 495.41 <o,f0,male> everyone in your country has been touched by the violence the bloodshed the pain the horror everybody not a single person in your country has not been touched but there 's something else there 's something else about these
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 495.41 501.94 <o,f0,male> people these americans who are there there 's something else about them that you see they don 't see themselves and what do you see
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 506.35 513.99 <o,f0,female> god they have crosses they carry bibles their bibles have a little insignia that says u s army
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 517.98 531.87 <o,f0,female> before they send their sons and daughters off to war in your country and you know the reason before they send them off they go to a christian church and they pray to their christian god and they ask for protection and guidance from that god why
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 546.05 549.34 <o,f0,female> of course you do and they do wonderful things
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 549.36 563.62 <o,f0,female> you read about it you hear about it they 're there to build schools and help people and that 's what they want to do they do wonderful things but they also do the bad things and you can 't tell the difference and this guy you get a guy like lt gen william boykin i mean here 's a guy who says that your god
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 603.44 609.07 <o,f0,male> invade subdue them take their resources if they won 't submit kill them
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 609.37 613.49 <o,f0,male> that 's what this is about and you 're thinking my god these christians are coming to kill us
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 614.25 618.22 <o,f0,male> this is frightening you feel frightened of course you feel frightened

SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 1000.26 1008.62 <o,f0,male> you can walk a mile when it comes to understanding why that person 's driving forty miles per hour in the passing lane
SamRichards_2010X 1 SamRichards_2010X 1009.01 1010.84 <o,f0,male> or your teenage son
