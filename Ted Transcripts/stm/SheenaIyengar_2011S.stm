SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 16.49 19.61 <o,f0,female> how many choices you make in a typical day
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 24.94 28.92 <o,f0,female> i recently did a survey with over two thousand americans
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 29.01 34.96 <o,f0,female> and the average number of choices that the typical american reports making is about seventy in a typical day
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 67.22 72.5 <o,f0,female> only about twelve percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 73.95 75.67 <o,f0,female> think about your own choices
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 75.78 80.98 <o,f0,female> do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute category versus your one hour category
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 86.72 91.36 <o,f0,female> today i want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 91.5 93.39 <o,f0,female> which is the choice overload problem
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 93.86 97.42 <o,f0,female> i want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 98.1 104.27 <o,f0,female> now as i talk about this problem i 'm going to have some questions for you and i 'm going to want to know your answers
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 158.84 160.75 <o,f0,female> i used to love going to this store
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 182.97 188.52 <o,f0,female> and he pointed to the busloads of tourists that would show up everyday with cameras ready usually
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 188.81 190.52 <o,f0,female> we decided to do a little
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 201.13 208.36 <o,f0,female> we there put out six different flavors of jam or twenty four different flavors of jam and we looked at two things
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 214.2 217.41 <o,f0,female> more people stopped when there were twenty four about sixty percent
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 226.46 228.45 <o,f0,female> now we see the opposite effect
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 228.48 235.87 <o,f0,female> of the people who stopped when there were twenty four only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam of the people who stopped when there were six
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 236.57 241.06 <o,f0,female> well now we saw that thirty percent of them actually bought a jar of jam
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 241.33 247.56 <o,f0,female> now if you do the math people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam if they encountered six
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 255.48 266.51 <o,f0,female> but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us even in very consequential decisions we choose not to choose even when it goes against our best self interests
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 286.94 288.63 <o,f0,female> all in the u s
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 343.03 345.02 <o,f0,female> when there are more choices present
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 345.41 348.62 <o,f0,female> even then it has negative consequences
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 349.23 358.26 <o,f0,female> so for those people who did choose to participate the more choices available the more likely people were to completely avoid stocks or equity funds
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 358.8 363.9 <o,f0,female> the more choices available the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 415.67 417.52 <o,f0,female> simple techniques
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 418.09 425.77 <o,f0,female> techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research venues that you can easily apply in your businesses
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 449.32 454.66 <o,f0,female> there 's a lowering of costs there is an improvement of the choosing experience
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 469.47 472.96 <o,f0,female> a function of both increase in sales and lowering of costs
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 483.81 485.68 <o,f0,female> largest retailer
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 495.87 501.09 <o,f0,female> now in the financial savings world i think one of the best examples that has recently
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 514.24 516.87 <o,f0,female> those people who actually want to choose
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 517.01 520.66 <o,f0,female> they 're given twenty funds not three hundred or more funds
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 520.72 524.48 <o,f0,female> you know often people say i don 't know how to cut
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 526.65 535.44 <o,f0,female> and the first thing i do is i ask the employees tell me how these choices are different from one another and if your employees can 't tell them apart neither can your consumers
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 544.65 552.3 <o,f0,female> to offer people in this audience an all expenses paid free vacation to the most beautiful road in the world
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 607.22 609.27 <o,f0,female> that it was more real the second time around
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 610.47 613.93 <o,f0,female> because the pictures made it feel more real to you
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 614.56 620.24 <o,f0,female> which brings me to the second technique for handling the choice overload problem which is concretization
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 632.78 635.85 <o,f0,female> and that the consequences need to be felt in a vivid sort of way in a very concrete
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 642.19 645.75 <o,f0,female> a credit card as opposed to cash because it doesn 't feel like real money
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 677.56 679.62 <o,f0,female> the one little thing we added
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 687.25 689.29 <o,f0,female> by doing that simple thing
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 708.45 710.19 <o,f0,female> so for example
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 710.23 712.59 <o,f0,female> here 's a study we did in a magazine aisle
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 716.69 719.64 <o,f0,female> the magazine aisles range anywhere from three hundred and thirty
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 719.64 723.57 <o,f0,female> one different kinds of magazines all the way up to six hundred and sixty
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 731.03 735.66 <o,f0,female> versus i show you four hundred magazines and divide them up into twenty categories
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 735.84 743.18 <o,f0,female> you believe that i have given you more choice and a better choosing experience if i gave you the four hundred than if i gave you the six hundred
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 743.47 746.57 <o,f0,female> because the categories tell me how to tell them apart
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 831.55 835.26 <o,f0,female> car colors exterior car colors i 've got fifty six choices
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 877.27 883.26 <o,f0,female> they go from low choice to high choice they 're hanging in there it 's the same information
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 883.46 894.8 <o,f0,female> it 's the same number of choices the only thing that i have done is i have varied the order in which that information is presented if i start you off easy i learn how to choose
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 911.2 912.92 <o,f0,female> so let me recap
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 918.96 924.32 <o,f0,female> cut get rid of the extraneous alternatives concretize make it real
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 931.55 949.58 <o,f0,female> all of these techniques that i 'm describing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices better for you you can use them on yourself better for the people that you are serving because i believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be choosy about choosing
