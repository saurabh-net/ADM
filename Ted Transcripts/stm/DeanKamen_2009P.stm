DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 15.80 19.02 <o,f0,male> it's not about technology it's about people and stories
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 19.81 32.56 <o,f0,male> i could show you what recently was on television as a high quality video sixty minutes many of you may have seen it and it was the now director of the entire piece of the
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 40.15 44.41 <o,f0,male> who was adamantly opposed to these crazy devices that don't work
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 45.21 53.14 <o,f0,male> and it turns out that with sixty minutes cameras rolling in the background after he pretty much made his position clear on this he had his hook and he had his
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 63.49 69.53 <o,f0,male> it's the first time he 's felt like he 's had an arm in thirty nine years but that would sort of be jumping to the middle of the story
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 70.78 77.96 <o,f0,male> and i'm not going to show you that polished video i'm going to instead in a minute or two show you an early crude video because
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 83.87 86.79 <o,f0,male> few years ago i was visited by the guy that runs darpa
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 88.07 90.57 <o,f0,male> people that fund all the advanced technologies that
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 97.30 100.43 <o,f0,male> they have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 102.00 105.99 <o,f0,male> i get this sort of unrequested by me anyway visit
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 110.67 113.07 <o,f0,male> from the military and the guy that runs darpa
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 124.18 130.72 <o,f0,male> the most remote places that we put soldiers hills of afghanistan iraq
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 131.29 132.83 <o,f0,male> they were quite proud of the fact that
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 149.67 151.57 <o,f0,male> car accident in a major city in the united states
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 161.45 163.34 <o,f0,male> part of the face it's probably not coming back
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 164.81 171.68 <o,f0,male> so they started giving me the statistics on how many of these kids had lost an arm and then the surgeon pointed out with a lot of anger
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 173.95 178.36 <o,f0,male> at the end of the civil war they were shooting each other with muskets if somebody lost an arm
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 179.21 181.23 <o,f0,male> we gave them a wooden stick with a hook on it
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 187.60 189.69 <o,f0,male> we give them a plastic stick with a hook on it
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 191.01 193.27 <o,f0,male> and they basically said this is unacceptable
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 194.30 200.10 <o,f0,male> and then the punchline so dean we're here because you make medical stuff you're going to give us an arm
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 201.21 205.99 <o,f0,male> and i was waiting for the five hundred pages of bureaucracy and paperwork and
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 207.94 208.91 <o,f0,male> no the guy says
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 211.34 212.97 <o,f0,male> guy into this conference room
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 214.59 216.84 <o,f0,male> and wearing the arm you're going to give us
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 217.49 220.72 <o,f0,male> he or she is going to pick up a raisin or a grape off this table
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 234.74 237.06 <o,f0,male> the wrist flex at the elbow abduct and
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 239.20 239.68 <o,f0,male> either way they
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 241.41 247.59 <o,f0,male> oh by the way dean it's going to fit on a fiftieth percentile female frame namely thirty two inches from the long
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 254.46 256.72 <o,f0,male> be completely self contained including all its power
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 258.45 261.98 <o,f0,male> so they finished that and i as you can tell am a bashful guy
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 262.89 263.70 <o,f0,male> i told them they're
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 272.16 275.38 <o,f0,male> the surgeon says to me dean you need to know
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 276.51 278.52 <o,f0,male> more than two dozen of these kids have come back
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 282.17 284.79 <o,f0,male> i can not imagine i'm sorry you may have
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 295.98 299.20 <o,f0,male> but compared to that losing two seems like
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 299.80 301.16 <o,f0,male> would be an inconvenience
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 302.95 306.91 <o,f0,male> anyway i went home that night i thought about it i literally could not sleep
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 307.61 307.77 <o,f0,male> i
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 313.49 315.29 <o,f0,male> so i decided we've got to do this
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 316.36 324.45 <o,f0,male> trust me i've got a day job i've got a lot of day jobs most of my day job keeps me busy funding my fantasies like first and water and power and i've got a lot
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 326.36 326.79 <o,f0,male> but i
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 330.93 332.24 <o,f0,male> did a little investigation
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 336.04 336.89 <o,f0,male> i still think they're
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 348.36 349.86 <o,f0,male> what it takes to make things like
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 352.38 353.89 <o,f0,male> great he said you got two years
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 358.92 361.48 <o,f0,male> that's under nine pounds that has all that capability
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 362.52 364.96 <o,f0,male> will take the other nine to make it functional and useful
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 366.98 375.87 <o,f0,male> agreed to disagree i went back and i started putting the team together the best guys i could find with a passion to do this at the end of exactly one year
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 376.49 382.07 <o,f0,male> we had a device with fourteen degrees of freedom all the sensors all the microprocessors all the stuff inside
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 383.12 388.74 <o,f0,male> i could show you it with a cosmesis on it that's so real it's eerie but then you wouldn't see all this cool stuff
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 398.61 402.70 <o,f0,male> i think you could see in aimee 's capabilities and attitudes
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 403.35 405.59 <o,f0,male> people with a desire to do something
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 406.24 408.70 <o,f0,male> are quite remarkable and nature is quite
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 418.91 426.54 <o,f0,male> literally he 's got no shoulder on one side and it high trans humeral on the other and that's chuck and randy together
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 428.94 439.55 <o,f0,male> after ten hours were playing in our office and we took some pretty cruddy home movies at the end of the one i'm going to show it's only about a minute and a couple of seconds long
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 442.77 446.20 <o,f0,male> chuck does something that to this day i'm jealous of i can't do it
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 447.15 449.00 <o,f0,male> he picks up a spoon picks it up
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 449.98 451.96 <o,f0,male> scoops out some shredded wheat
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 462.43 463.53 <o,f0,male> i can not do that
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 467.01 472.08 <o,f0,male> his wife was standing behind me she's standing behind me at the time and she says dean
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 473.80 476.67 <o,f0,male> chuck hasn't fed himself in nineteen years
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 477.55 480.03 <o,f0,male> so you've got a choice we keep the arm
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 480.49 480.95 <o,f0,male> you keep
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 493.86 495.26 <o,f0,male> this is chuck showing
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 498.47 504.81 <o,f0,male> he 's punching our controls guy the guy behind him is our engineer surgeon which is a convenient guy to have around
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 506.39 510.98 <o,f0,male> there's randy these guys are passing a rubber little ball between them
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 512.19 514.02 <o,f0,male> and just as in the spirit of
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 515.16 518.92 <o,f0,male> first gracious professionalism they are quite proud of this so they decide to share
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 521.02 526.38 <o,f0,male> this is a non trivial thing to do by the way imagine doing that with a wooden stick and a hook on the end of it doing
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 528.83 533.97 <o,f0,male> now chuck is doing something quite extraordinary at least for my limited physical skill
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 536.56 542.81 <o,f0,male> and now he 's going to do what darpa asked me for he 's going to pick up a grape he didn't drop it he didn't break it
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 563.27 565.62 <o,f0,male> but as i've learned from richard
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 575.80 582.65 <o,f0,male> i hadn't dealt with this kind of problem or frankly this whole segment of the medical world
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 583.78 585.32 <o,f0,male> i'll give you some astounding things
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 602.28 612.49 <o,f0,male> i put a bunch of guys in my plane and i said we're flying down to walter reed and we're going talk to these kids because frankly it doesn't matter whether we like this arm it doesn't matter whether the department of defense likes
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 613.54 623.21 <o,f0,male> when i told them that they weren't entirely enthusiastic but i told them it really doesn't matter what their opinion is there is only one opinion that matters the kids that are either going to use it
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 625.16 628.55 <o,f0,male> i told a bunch of my engineers look we're going to walk into walter reed
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 628.97 630.97 <o,f0,male> and you're going to see people lots of them
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 650.39 653.89 <o,f0,male> we walked into walter reed and i could not have been more wrong
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 655.28 656.98 <o,f0,male> we did see a bunch of people
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 657.41 660.02 <o,f0,male> a lot of them missing a lot of body parts
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 661.11 666.00 <o,f0,male> and parts they had left were burned half a face gone an ear burned
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 670.43 674.19 <o,f0,male> sitting at a table they were brought together for us and we started asking them all questions
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 675.26 677.62 <o,f0,male> i'd say to them we 're not quite as good as nature yet
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 678.34 682.53 <o,f0,male> i could give you fine motor control or i could let you curl forty pounds
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 683.05 686.03 <o,f0,male> i probably can't do both i can give you fast control
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 686.91 691.40 <o,f0,male> low reduction ratios in these gears or i can give you power i can't give you both
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 692.54 696.61 <o,f0,male> and we were trying to get them to all help us know what to give them
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 705.21 705.97 <o,f0,male> and woman
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 708.12 711.41 <o,f0,male> given enough we're here to help you we need data we need to
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 714.36 720.34 <o,f0,male> after a half an hour maybe there was one guy at the far end of the table who wasn't saying much you could see he was missing an
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 721.23 722.56 <o,f0,male> he was leaning on his other arm
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 724.97 730.23 <o,f0,male> i called down to the end hey you haven't said much if we needed this or this what would you want and he said you know
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 733.35 736.09 <o,f0,male> the lucky guy at this table i lost
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 740.60 741.01 <o,f0,male> so
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 742.49 744.74 <o,f0,male> much he had a great spirit like all the rest
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 746.68 750.91 <o,f0,male> and he made a few comments and the meeting ended we said goodbye to all these
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 769.84 771.15 <o,f0,male> they gave it to us
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 772.35 773.53 <o,f0,male> they're not finished giving
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 780.37 781.32 <o,f0,male> i started working harder
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 787.24 789.52 <o,f0,male> went out to brooke army medical center
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 790.94 793.95 <o,f0,male> and we saw lots of these kids lots of
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 803.08 804.42 <o,f0,male> and we've been working harder yet
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 811.74 812.91 <o,f0,male> and i get a call and we go back
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 817.41 821.50 <o,f0,male> we go back to walter reed and a kid literally
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 822.30 824.00 <o,f0,male> twenty some odd days before that
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 848.70 849.82 <o,f0,male> he 's got no legs
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 850.59 854.53 <o,f0,male> he 's got no arms he 's got a small residual limb on one side
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 856.03 857.07 <o,f0,male> half of his face
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 877.51 881.07 <o,f0,male> this kid was from staten island and he said i
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 887.26 887.61 <o,f0,male> you think
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 891.23 893.36 <o,f0,male> i turned around and went how are we going to do this
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 895.19 895.60 <o,f0,male> anyway
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 896.55 899.40 <o,f0,male> he was just like all the rest of them he doesn't really want a lot
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 909.84 911.77 <o,f0,male> so i was on my way out here
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 923.53 924.93 <o,f0,male> to help the families
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 926.76 928.93 <o,f0,male> of all the kids
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 930.68 933.29 <o,f0,male> some that have died some that have like brandon
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 937.12 944.44 <o,f0,male> what am i going to say this is not a happy thing look if this happens to you i can give you this stuff is still not at good at the original equipment
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 947.54 948.08 <o,f0,male> you need to
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 954.88 956.74 <o,f0,male> a lot people there recovering
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 957.95 964.56 <o,f0,male> some further along than others but universally these people that have been through this had
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 965.37 966.45 <o,f0,male> astounding attitudes
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 972.77 976.21 <o,f0,male> makes a huge difference to them i'll shut up except one
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 983.64 985.79 <o,f0,male> i have i don't think anybody does it intentionally
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 991.23 992.45 <o,f0,male> how much will they get
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 994.51 998.25 <o,f0,male> this country is involved as we've all heard in this great healthcare debate
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 1003.14 1004.10 <o,f0,male> is entitled to how much
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 1011.48 1024.23 <o,f0,male> i don't have an answer to that not everybody can be entitled to everything simply because you were born here it's not possible it would be nice but let 's be realistic they are tough questions there is polarized groups down there i don't know the answers
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 1031.45 1036.57 <o,f0,male> what do we need to do there is very polarized answers to that question too and i don't have any
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 1038.59 1041.83 <o,f0,male> those are political questions economic questions strategic
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 1044.61 1046.91 <o,f0,male> i don't have the answer but let me give you a simple
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 1052.89 1053.69 <o,f0,female> is an easy
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 1055.53 1056.65 <o,f0,male> i know what these kids
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 1059.02 1060.32 <o,f0,male> on the healthcare side
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 1061.99 1063.33 <o,f0,male> i was talking to one of them
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 1082.64 1084.04 <o,f0,male> one hundred feet
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 1089.20 1091.59 <o,f0,male> it wouldn't have made and old pigeon jealous
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 1092.81 1094.95 <o,f0,male> now we got eagles out there
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 1101.62 1102.68 <o,f0,male> a bird flying around
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 1105.38 1109.34 <o,f0,male> i think eventually we'll make these things extraordinary and i said to that kid
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 1112.82 1116.65 <o,f0,male> when your buddies are envious of your luke arm
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 1117.33 1119.21 <o,f0,male> because of what it can do and how it
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 1120.27 1121.11 <o,f0,male> and i'll keep working
DeanKamen_2009P 1 DeanKamen_2009P 1135.45 1138.19 <o,f0,male> and whining and complaining about what our foreign policy ought to be
