CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 16.55 30.06 <o,f0,female> talk about surgical robots is also a talk about surgery and while i've tried to make my images not too graphic keep in mind that surgeons have a different relationship with blood than normal people do
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 31.01 38.81 <o,f0,female> because after all what a surgeon does to a patient if it were done without consent would be a felony
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 40.09 47.40 <o,f0,female> surgeons are the tailors the plumbers the carpenters some would say the butchers of the medical world
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 48.04 55.75 <o,f0,female> cutting reshaping reforming bypassing fixing but you need to talk about
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 63.27 74.14 <o,f0,female> some kind of a perspective of where we are right now with surgical robots and where we're going to be going in the future i want to give you a little bit of perspective of how we got to this point
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 74.84 88.36 <o,f0,female> how we even came to believe that surgery was ok that this was something that was possible to do that this kind of cutting and reforming was ok so a little bit of perspective
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 89.11 93.61 <o,f0,female> about ten thousand years of perspective this is a trephanated skull
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 109.64 122.57 <o,f0,female> five to ten thousand years now imagine this you are a healer in a stone age village and you have some guy that you're not quite sure what's wrong with him oliver sacks is going to be born way in the future
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 122.79 133.00 <o,f0,female> he 's got some seizure disorder and you don't understand this but you think to yourself i 'm not quite sure what's wrong with this guy but maybe if i cut a hole in his head i can fix it
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 133.74 146.63 <o,f0,female> now that is surgical thinking now we've got the dawn of interventional surgery here what is astonishing about this is even though we don't know really how much of this was intended to be
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 161.59 169.78 <o,f0,female> and so what we are seeing is evidence of a refined technique that was being handed down over thousands and thousands of years
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 170.13 179.97 <o,f0,female> all over the world this arose independently at sites everywhere that had no communication to one another we really are seeing the dawn of interventional surgery
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 180.74 193.74 <o,f0,female> now we can fast forward many thousands of years into the bronze age and beyond and we see new refined tools coming out but surgeons in these eras are a little bit more conservative than their bold trephanating ancestors
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 194.32 203.50 <o,f0,female> these guys confined their surgery to fairly superficial injuries and surgeons were tradesmen rather than physicians
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 204.18 218.23 <o,f0,female> this persisted all the way into and through the renaissance that may have saved the writers but it didn't really save the surgeons terribly much they were still a mistrusted lot surgeons still had a bit of a pr problem
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 230.38 237.75 <o,f0,female> because we were in the age before anesthesia the agony of the patient is really as much of the public spectacle as the
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 238.26 245.53 <o,f0,female> surgery itself one of the most famous of these guys frere jacques shown here doing a lithotomy
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 246.18 259.07 <o,f0,female> the removal of the bladder stone one of the most invasive surgeries they did at the time had to take less than two minutes you had to have quite a flare for the dramatic and be really really quick and so here you see him doing a lithotomy
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 259.52 273.17 <o,f0,female> and he is credited with doing over four thousand of these public surgeries wandering around in europe which is an astonishing number when you think that surgery must have been a last resort i mean who would put themselves through that
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 274.83 279.46 <o,f0,female> until anesthesia the absence of sensation
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 300.15 312.14 <o,f0,female> this was truly a revolution in surgery but there was a pretty big problem with this after these very long painstaking operations attempting to cure things they'd never been able to touch before
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 313.10 314.91 <o,f0,female> the patients died
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 316.31 324.06 <o,f0,female> they died of massive infection surgery didn't hurt anymore but it killed you pretty quickly
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 324.80 334.61 <o,f0,female> and infection would continue to claim a majority of surgical patients until the next big revolution in surgery which was the aseptic technique
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 336.00 344.17 <o,f0,female> joseph lister was asepis 's or sterility 's biggest advocate to a very very skeptical bunch of surgeons
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 351.94 359.96 <o,f0,female> and they said they had learned it was as important to wash your hands before doing surgery as it was to wash up afterwards
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 370.00 375.52 <o,f0,female> with the patient insensitive to pain and a sterile operating field
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 376.49 382.67 <o,f0,female> all bets were off the sky was the limit you could now start doing surgery
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 386.08 387.20 <o,f0,female> the gut
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 387.48 394.64 <o,f0,female> on the liver on the heart on the brain transplantation you could take an organ out of one person you could put it in another person and it would
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 396.38 406.04 <o,f0,female> surgeons didn't have a problem with respectability anymore they had become gods the era of the big surgeon big incision had arrived
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 407.21 416.44 <o,f0,female> but at quite a cost because they are saving lives but not necessarily quality of life because healthy people
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 416.79 426.34 <o,f0,female> don't usually need surgery and unhealthy people have a very hard time recovering from a cut like that the question had to be asked well
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 426.85 439.17 <o,f0,female> can we do these same surgeries but through little incisions laparoscopy is doing this kind of surgery surgery with long instruments through small incisions
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 439.76 448.70 <o,f0,female> and it really changed the landscape of surgery some of the tools for this had been around for a hundred years but it had only been used as a diagnostic technique
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 449.02 457.03 <o,f0,female> until the nineteen eighties when there was changes in camera technologies and things like that that allowed this to be done for real operations
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 458.49 467.35 <o,f0,female> so what you see this is now the first surgical image as we're coming down the tube this is a new entry into the body it looks very different from what you're expecting surgery to look like
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 468.02 474.30 <o,f0,female> we bring instruments in from two separate cuts in the side and then you can start manipulating tissue
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 475.42 479.91 <o,f0,female> within ten years of the first gallbladder surgeries being done
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 481.70 487.14 <o,f0,female> a majority of gallbladder surgeries were being done laparoscopically truly
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 487.88 494.31 <o,f0,female> pretty big revolution but there were casualties of this revolution
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 495.45 503.77 <o,f0,female> these techniques were a lot harder to learn than people had anticipated the learning curve was very long and during that learning curve the complications went
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 504.13 512.36 <o,f0,female> quite a bit higher surgeons had to give up their three d vision they had to give up their wrists they had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 516.35 526.93 <o,f0,female> has over three thousand hours of laparoscopic experience now this is a particularly frustrating placement of the needle but this is hard
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 527.82 530.21 <o,f0,female> and one of the reasons why it is so hard
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 531.01 542.43 <o,f0,female> is because the external ergonomics are terrible you've got these long instruments and you're working off your center line and the instruments are essentially working backwards
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 543.45 551.44 <o,f0,female> so what you need to do to take the capability of your hand and put it on the other side of that small incision is you need to put a
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 552.36 560.99 <o,f0,female> on that instrument and so i get to talk about robots the da vinci robot put just that wrist on the other side of that
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 572.14 579.96 <o,f0,female> and you can pass it all the way through and follow it in a trajectory and the reason why this becomes so much easier is you can see
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 580.88 589.99 <o,f0,female> the bottom the hands are making the motions and the instruments are following those motions exactly now what you put between
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 590.57 597.55 <o,f0,female> those instruments and those hands is a large fairly complicated robot the surgeon is sitting at a console and
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 620.03 624.99 <o,f0,female> which is a prostate deep in the pelvis and it requires fine dissection and
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 635.39 648.43 <o,f0,female> without cracking the chest this is all done in between the ribs and you can go inside the heart itself and repair the valves from the inside you've got these technologies
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 662.77 670.11 <o,f0,female> i talked about the large complicated robot with all its bells and whistles one of those robots will cost you about as much as a solid gold surgeon
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 682.81 694.42 <o,f0,female> but there are other barriers so something like a prostatectomy the prostate is small and it's in one spot and you can set your robot up very precisely to work in that one spot
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 704.91 718.33 <o,f0,female> but if you need to reach more places than just one you need to move the robot and you need to put some new incisions in there and you need to re set it up and you need to add some more ports and more
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 719.66 732.59 <o,f0,female> and the problem is it gets time consuming and cumbersome and for that reason there are many surgeries that just aren't being done with the da vinci so we had to ask the question well how do we fix that
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 734.09 746.72 <o,f0,female> what if we could change it so that we didn't have to re set up each time we wanted to move somewhere different what if we could bring all the instruments in together in one place how would that change the capabilities of the surgeon
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 747.81 755.96 <o,f0,female> and how would that change the experience for the patient now to do that we need to be able to bring a camera
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 756.30 763.10 <o,f0,female> and instruments in together through one small tube like that tube you saw in the laparoscopy video
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 764.28 768.44 <o,f0,female> or not so coincidentally like a tube like this
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 769.55 777.97 <o,f0,female> so what's going to come out of that tube is the debut of this new technology this new robot that is going to be able to reach anywhere
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 781.98 784.60 <o,f0,female> so here it comes this is the camera
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 793.93 802.58 <o,f0,female> it has to be able to come off of the center line and then be able to work back toward that center line he 's a cheeky little devil
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 822.32 829.16 <o,f0,female> but it's worth it for the freedom that this gives us as we're going around for the patient however
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 831.86 834.82 <o,f0,female> it's transparent this is all they're going to see
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 837.45 840.33 <o,f0,female> it's very exciting to think where we get to go with this
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 842.03 845.65 <o,f0,female> we get to write the script of the next revolution in surgery
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 846.13 848.91 <o,f0,female> as we take these capabilities and we get to
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 849.82 857.97 <o,f0,female> go to the next places we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be and i think to really get the rest of the way in that revolution
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 858.29 871.63 <o,f0,female> we need to not just take our hands in in new ways we also need to take our eyes in in new ways we need to see beyond the surface we need to be able to guide what we're cutting in a much better way
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 875.66 886.93 <o,f0,female> this is a cancer surgery one of the problems with this even for surgeons who 've been looking at this a lot is you can't see the cancer especially when it's hidden below the surface
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 897.57 904.29 <o,f0,female> go bind to the cancer and we can make those markers glow and we can take special cameras
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 904.94 916.39 <o,f0,female> and we can look at it now we know where we need to cut even when it's below the surface we can take these markers and we can inject them in a tumor site
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 927.15 934.42 <o,f0,female> we can inject these dyes into the bloodstream so that when we sew on a new vessel and we bypass a blockage on the heart
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 934.70 943.81 <o,f0,female> we can see if we actually made the connection before we close that patient back up again something that we haven't been able to do without radiation before
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 946.17 947.23 <o,f0,female> we can light
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 961.91 972.38 <o,f0,female> and we don't even need to confine ourselves to this macro vision we have flexible microscopic probes that we can bring down into the body
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 973.04 984.72 <o,f0,female> and we can look at cells directly i'm looking at nerves here so these are nerves you see down on the bottom and the microscope probe that's being held by the robotic hand up at the top so this is all very prototypey at this point
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 985.78 998.73 <o,f0,female> but you care about nerves if you are a surgical patient because they let you keep continence bladder control and sexual function after surgery all of which is generally fairly important to the patient
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 1002.13 1010.65 <o,f0,female> so with the combination of these technologies we can reach it all and we can see it all we can
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 1011.39 1019.30 <o,f0,female> heal the disease and we can leave the patient whole and intact and functional afterwards
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 1021.29 1029.31 <o,f0,female> i've talked about the patient as if the patient is somehow someone abstract outside this room and that is not the case
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 1030.32 1041.90 <o,f0,female> many of you all of you maybe will at some point or have already faced a diagnosis of cancer or heart disease or some organ disfuction that's going to buy you a date with a surgeon
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 1043.21 1045.76 <o,f0,female> and when you get to that point
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 1047.69 1053.99 <o,f0,female> these maladies don't care how many books you've written how many companies you've started
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 1054.33 1062.23 <o,f0,female> that nobel prize you have yet to win how much time you planned to spend with your children these maladies come for us all
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 1063.29 1068.86 <o,f0,female> and the prospect i'm offering you of an easier surgery is that going to make that diagnosis any less terrifying
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 1070.84 1072.96 <o,f0,female> i'm not sure i really even want it to
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 1074.67 1080.42 <o,f0,female> because facing your own mortality causes a re evaluation of priorities
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 1081.18 1089.53 <o,f0,female> and a realignment of what your goals are in life unlike anything else and i would never want to deprive you of that epiphany
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 1091.10 1092.43 <o,f0,female> what i want instead
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 1093.55 1095.95 <o,f0,female> is for you to be whole
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 1097.41 1102.65 <o,f0,female> intact and functional enough to go out and save the world
