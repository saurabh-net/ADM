ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 42.13 48.19 <o,f0,male> instead he went on to build a glittering empire of department stores
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 71.74 77.23 <o,f0,male> and he paid each one of them a monthly salary so that they could write in peace
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 77.23 82.32 <o,f0,male> and yet in the late thirty s salman saw what 's coming
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 82.32 96.32 <o,f0,male> he fled germany together with his family leaving everything else behind his department stores confiscated he spent the rest of his life in a relentless pursuit of art and culture
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 113.87 117.55 <o,f0,male> such is the power of self study
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 117.55 120.15 <o,f0,male> and these are my parents
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 120.15 128.48 <o,f0,male> they too did not enjoy the privilege of college education they were too busy building a family and a country
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 128.48 140.26 <o,f0,male> and yet just like salman they were lifelong tenacious self learners and our home was stacked with thousands of books records and artwork
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 140.26 143.43 <o,f0,male> i remember quite vividly my father telling me
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 206.12 209.36 <o,f0,male> sophisticated this early awe
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 209.37 212.75 <o,f0,male> with the basics has only intensified
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 212.75 230.02 <o,f0,male> so it 's not surprising that about twelve years ago when noam and i were already computer science professors we were equally frustrated by the same phenomenon as computers became increasingly more complex our students were losing the forest for the trees
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 230.02 237.99 <o,f0,male> and indeed it is impossible to connect with the soul of the machine if you interact with a black box p c or a mac
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 237.99 242.42 <o,f0,male> which is shrouded by numerous layers of closed proprietary software
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 242.42 256.08 <o,f0,male> so noam and i had this insight that if we want our students to understand how computers work and understand it in the marrow of their bones then perhaps the best way to go about it is to have them build a complete
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 256.08 264.3 <o,f0,male> working general purpose useful computer hardware and software from the ground up from first principles
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 264.3 277.65 <o,f0,male> now we had to start somewhere and so noam and i decided to base our cathedral so to speak on the simplest possible building block which is something called nand
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 277.65 296.53 <o,f0,male> it is nothing more than a trivial logic gate with four input output states so we now start this journey by telling our students that god gave us nand laughter and told us to build a computer and when we asked how god said one step at a time
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 296.53 307.7 <o,f0,male> and then following this advice we start with this lowly humble nand gate and we walk our students through an elaborate sequence of projects in which they gradually build
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 322.57 337.73 <o,f0,male> the students celebrate the end of this tour de force by using jack to write all sorts of cool games like pong snake and tetris you can imagine the tremendous joy of playing with a tetris game that you wrote in jack
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 337.73 349.09 <o,f0,male> and then compiled into machine language in a compiler that you wrote also and then seeing the result running on a machine that you built starting with nothing more than a few thousand nand gates
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 373.84 390.13 <o,f0,male> the trick was to decompose the computer 's construction into numerous stand alone modules each of which could be individually specified built and unit tested in isolation from the rest of the project
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 390.13 398.39 <o,f0,male> and from day one noam and i decided to put all these building blocks freely available in open source on the web
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 401.75 421 <o,f0,male> project descriptions software tools hardware simulators cpu emulators stacks of hundreds of slides lectures we laid out everything on the web and invited the world to come over take whatever they need and do whatever they want with it and then
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 425.43 429.93 <o,f0,male> and in short order thousands of people were building our machine
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 429.93 441.73 <o,f0,male> and nand two tetris became one of the first massive open online courses although seven years ago we had no idea that what we were doing is called moocs
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 441.73 460.1 <o,f0,male> we just observed how self organized courses were kind of spontaneously spawning out of our materials for example pramode c e an engineer from kerala india has organized groups of self learners who build our computer under his good guidance
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 460.1 472.11 <o,f0,male> and parag shah another engineer from mumbai has unbundled our projects into smaller more manageable bites that he now serves in his pioneering do it yourself computer science program
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 472.11 487.92 <o,f0,male> the people who are attracted to these courses typically have a hacker mentality they want to figure out how things work and they want to do it in groups like this hackers club in washington d c that uses our materials to offer community courses
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 487.92 507.69 <o,f0,male> and because these materials are widely available and open source different people take them to very different and unpredictable directions for example yu fangmin from guangzhou has used fpga technology to build our computer and show others how to do the same using a video clip
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 507.69 524.17 <o,f0,male> and ben craddock developed a very nice computer game that unfolds inside our cpu architecture which is quite a complex three d maze that ben developed using the minecraft three d simulator engine
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 524.17 530.56 <o,f0,male> the minecraft community went bananas over this project and ben became an instant media celebrity
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 530.56 540.67 <o,f0,male> and indeed for quite a few people taking this nand two tetris pilgrimage if you will has turned into a life changing experience
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 540.67 552.37 <o,f0,male> for example take dan rounds who is a music and math major from east lansing michigan a few weeks ago dan posted a victorious post on our website and i 'd like to read it to
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 552.37 555.36 <o,f0,male> so here 's what dan said
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 555.36 572.44 <o,f0,male> i did the coursework because understanding computers is important to me just like literacy and numeracy and i made it through i never worked harder on anything never been challenged to this degree but given what i now feel capable of doing i would certainly do it again
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 572.44 579.4 <o,f0,male> to anyone considering nand two tetris it 's a tough journey but you 'll be profoundly changed so
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 590.36 607.32 <o,f0,male> and it 's quite amazing because these people cannot care less about grades they are doing it because of one motivation only they have a tremendous passion to learn and with that in mind
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 607.32 613.87 <o,f0,male> i 'd like to say a few words about traditional college grading i 'm sick of it
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 613.87 626.47 <o,f0,male> we are obsessed with grades because we are obsessed with data and yet grading takes away all the fun from failing and a huge part of education is about failing
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 626.47 634.1 <o,f0,male> courage according to churchill is the ability to go from one defeat to another without losing enthusiasm
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 640.29 655.29 <o,f0,male> and yet we don 't tolerate mistakes and we worship grades so we collect your b pluses and your a minuses and we aggregate them into a number like three point four which is stamped on your forehead and sums up who you are
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 655.29 662.47 <o,f0,male> well in my opinion we went too far with this nonsense and grading became degrading so
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 689.01 697.9 <o,f0,male> and we do it on tablets because we believe that math like anything else should be taught hands on
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 697.9 709.85 <o,f0,male> so here 's what we do basically we developed numerous mobile apps every one of them explaining a particular concept in math so for example let 's take area
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 709.85 727.17 <o,f0,male> when you deal with a concept like area well we also provide a set of tools that the child is invited to experiment with in order to learn so if area is what interests us then one thing which is natural to do is to
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 756.42 766.95 <o,f0,male> and at some point you will discover that one thing that you can do among several legitimate transformations is the following one you can cut the figure you can rearrange the parts
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 766.95 773.23 <o,f0,male> you can glue them and then proceed to tile just like we did before
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 792.49 808.14 <o,f0,male> we don 't replace teachers by the way we believe that teachers should be empowered not replaced moving along what about the area of a triangle so after some guided trial and error the child will discover with or without help
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 828.53 845.25 <o,f0,male> now this transformation has doubled the area of the original figure and therefore we have just learned that the area of the triangle equals the area of this rectangle divided by two but we discovered it by self exploration
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 845.25 862.15 <o,f0,male> so in addition to learning some useful geometry the child has been exposed to some pretty sophisticated science strategies like reduction which is the art of
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 862.15 876.22 <o,f0,male> transforming a complex problem into a simple one or generalization which is at the heart of any scientific discipline or the fact that some properties are invariant under some transformations
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 876.22 885.46 <o,f0,male> and all this is something that a very young child can pick up using such mobile apps so presently
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 885.5 894.08 <o,f0,male> we are doing the following first of all we are decomposing the k twelve math curriculum into numerous such apps
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 894.08 911.97 <o,f0,male> and because we cannot do it on our own we 've developed a very fancy authoring tool that any author any parent or actually anyone who has an interest in math education can use this authoring tool to develop similar apps on tablets without programming
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 911.97 923.43 <o,f0,male> and finally we are putting together an adaptive ecosystem that will match different learners with different apps according to their evolving learning style
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 923.43 941.1 <o,f0,male> the driving force behind this project is my colleague shmulik london and you see just like salman did about ninety years ago the trick is to surround yourself with brilliant people because
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 945.58 951.1 <o,f0,male> a few years ago i was walking in tel aviv and i saw this graffiti on a wall
ShimonSchocken_2012G 1 ShimonSchocken_2012G 969.77 974.36 <o,f0,male> the most important thing is to be a mensch
