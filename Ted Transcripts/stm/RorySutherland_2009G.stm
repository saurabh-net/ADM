RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 16.32 26.78 <o,f0,male> my first time at ted normally as an advertising man i actually speak at ted evil which is ted 's secret sister organization the one that pays all the bills it's held every two years in burma
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 35.40 35.82 <o,f0,male> actually
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 37.29 49.23 <o,f0,male> years working in the business that what we create in advertising which is intangible value you might call it perceived value you might call it badge value subjective value intangible value of some kind gets rather a bad rap
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 49.67 57.45 <o,f0,male> if you think about it if you want to live in a world in the future where there are fewer material goods you basically have two choices you can either live in a world which is poorer
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 57.75 65.97 <o,f0,male> which people in general don't like or you can live in a world where actually intangible value constitutes a greater part of overall value
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 66.82 75.09 <o,f0,male> actually intangible value in many ways is a very very fine substitute for using up labor or limited resources in the creation of things
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 97.48 105.34 <o,f0,male> mister picky i'm just an ad man but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey merely to make it shorter now what is
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 112.68 121.54 <o,f0,male> what you should in fact do is employ all of the world 's top male and female supermodels pay them to walk the length of the train handing out free chateau petrus for the entire duration of the
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 124.15 124.96 <o,f0,female> now
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 127.60 132.27 <o,f0,male> you'll still have about three billion pounds left in change and people will ask for the trains to be slowed down
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 155.94 159.02 <o,f0,male> they cost very little to develop they work extraordinarily well
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 178.39 187.61 <o,f0,male> it actually works by giving you the impression that you've had a very good education which gives you an insane sense of unwarranted self confidence which then makes you very very successful in later life
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 217.51 227.33 <o,f0,male> because he realized that if you had two sources of carbohydrate wheat and potatoes you get less price volatility in bread and you get a far lower risk of famine because you actually had two crops to fall back on not one
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 252.17 258.56 <o,f0,male> so he tried plan b he tried the marketing solution which is he declared the potato as a royal vegetable and none but the royal family could consume it
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 258.85 267.08 <o,f0,male> and he planted it in a royal potato patch with guards who had instructions to guard over it night and day but with secret instructions not to guard it very well
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 269.99 274.26 <o,f0,male> is one pretty safe rule in life which is if something is worth guarding it's worth stealing
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 329.92 335.42 <o,f0,male> two very fundamental things which is that actually first one all value is actually relative
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 354.76 358.05 <o,f0,male> all value is subjective second point is that persuasion is
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 358.40 366.08 <o,f0,male> better than compulsion these funny signs that flash your speed at you some of the new ones on the bottom right now actually show a smiley face or a frowny face
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 450.31 457.92 <o,f0,male> actually there is a thing just as there are veblen goods where the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare there are opposite kind of things
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 458.10 465.65 <o,f0,male> where actually the value in them depends on them being ubiquitous classless and minimalistic if you think about it shakerism was a proto environmental movement
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 465.98 473.58 <o,f0,male> adam smith talks about eighteenth century america where the prohibition against visible displays of wealth was so great it was almost a block in the economy in new england
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 473.90 483.09 <o,f0,male> because even wealthy farmers could find nothing to spend their money on without incurring the displeasure of their neighbors it's perfectly possible to create these social pressures which lead to
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 483.40 496.19 <o,f0,male> more egalitarian societies what's also interesting if you look at products that have a high component of what you might call messaging value a high component of intangible value versus their intrinsic value they are often quite egalitarian
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 496.57 507.14 <o,f0,male> in terms of dress denim is perhaps the perfect example of something which replaces material value with symbolic value coca cola a bunch of you may be a load of pinkos and you may not like the coca cola company
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 525.74 535.93 <o,f0,male> basically have to change our views slightly there is a basic view that real value involves making things involves labor it involves engineering it involves limited raw materials
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 536.47 545.85 <o,f0,male> and that what we add on top is kind of false it's a fake version and there is a reason for some suspicion and uncertainly about it it patently veers toward propaganda
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 552.71 561.59 <o,f0,male> much fairer when i grew up this was basically the media environment of my childhood as translated into food you had a monopoly supplier on the left you have rupert murdoch or the bbc
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 562.97 567.29 <o,f0,male> and on your right you have a dependent public which is pathetically grateful for anything you give it
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 571.80 577.79 <o,f0,male> user is actually involved this is actually what's called in the digital world user generated content although it's called agriculture in the world
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 579.13 586.49 <o,f0,male> this is actually called a mash up where you take content that someone else has produced and you do something new with it in the world of food we call it cooking
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 596.91 605.79 <o,f0,male> cornish pastie the pie the sandwich we invented the whole lot of them we're not very good at food in general italians do great food but it's not very portable generally
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 639.16 643.12 <o,f0,male> but so much communication now is contextual that the capacity for actually nudging
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 644.04 656.48 <o,f0,male> better information b j fogg at the university of stanford makes the point that actually the mobile phone is he 's invented the phrase persuasive technologies he believes the mobile phone by being location specific contextual timely and immediate
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 656.86 666.45 <o,f0,male> is simply the greatest persuasive technology device ever invented now if we have all these tools at our disposal we simply have to ask the question and thaler and sunstein have of how we can use these more
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 667.91 676.38 <o,f0,male> you one example if you had a large red button of this kind on the wall of your home and every time you pressed it it saved fifty dollars for you put fifty dollars into your pension
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 676.84 691.06 <o,f0,male> you would save a lot more the reason is that the interface fundamentally determines the behavior okay now marketing has done a very very good job of creating opportunities for impulse buying yet we've never created the opportunity for impulse saving
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 691.80 698.46 <o,f0,male> if you did this more people would save more it's simply a question of changing the interface by which people make decisions
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 712.80 718.60 <o,f0,male> actually fundamental opportunities to change human behavior now i've got an example here from canada
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 751.38 754.53 <o,f0,male> how you could relaunch shreddies he came up with this
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 799.48 805.63 <o,f0,male> so shreddies is actually producing a new product which is something very exciting for them
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 813.79 815.97 <o,f0,male> you see that when you see the diamond
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 826.77 826.95 <o,f0,male> a
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 833.21 833.51 <o,f0,male> and
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 867.64 877.72 <o,f0,male> debate raged there were conservative elements in canada unsurprisingly who actually resented this intrusion so eventually the manufacturers actually arrived at a compromise which was the
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 894.88 897.48 <o,f0,male> if you think it's funny bear in mind there is an organization
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 911.46 919.48 <o,f0,male> except when you tell the people how expensive it is in which case they tend to enjoy the more expensive stuff more so drink your wine blind in the future
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 931.88 939.41 <o,f0,male> two quotations to more or less end with one of them is poetry is when you make new things familiar and familiar things new which isn't a bad definition of what
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 940.24 947.92 <o,f0,male> to help people appreciate what is unfamiliar but also to gain a greater appreciation and place a far higher value on those things which are already
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 957.53 969.21 <o,f0,male> so they actually reduce the need for actually spending great money on display and increase the kind of third party enjoyment you can get from the smallest simplest things in life which is magic the second one is the second g k chesterton quote of this session
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 969.66 979.55 <o,f0,male> which is we are perishing for want of wonder not for want of wonders which i think for anybody involved in technology is perfectly true and a final thing when you place a value on things like health love sex and other things
RorySutherland_2009G 1 RorySutherland_2009G 979.84 990.47 <o,f0,male> and learn to place a material value on what you've previously discounted for being merely intangible a thing not seen you realize you're much much wealthier than you ever imagined thank you very much
