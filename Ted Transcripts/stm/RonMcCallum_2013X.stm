RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 13.84 30.67 <o,f0,male> three or four years old i remember my mum reading a story to me and my two big brothers and i remember putting up my hands to feel the page of the book to feel the picture they were discussing
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 52.55 57.65 <o,f0,male> that i would be part of a technological revolution that would make that dream come true
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 58.79 64.27 <o,f0,male> i was born premature by about ten weeks which resulted in my blindness
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 64.51 66.63 <o,f0,male> some sixty four years ago
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 66.79 72.47 <o,f0,male> the condition is known as retrolental fibroplasia and it 's now very rare in the developed world
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 86.67 90.64 <o,f0,male> that i was in a country where i could participate
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 90.76 96 <o,f0,male> in the technological revolution there are thirty seven
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 96 107.91 <o,f0,male> million totally blind people on our planet but those of us who 've shared in the technological changes mainly come from north america europe japan and other developed parts of the world
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 109.6 118.2 <o,f0,male> computers have changed the lives of us all in this room and around the world but i think they 've changed the lives of we blind people more than any other group
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 118.78 129.63 <o,f0,male> and so i want to tell you about the interaction between computer based adaptive technology and the many volunteers who helped me over the years
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 130.06 132.8 <o,f0,male> to become the person i am today
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 189.62 201.72 <o,f0,male> the books were transcribed by transcribers voluntary people who punched one dot at a time so i 'd have volumes to read and that had been going on mainly by women since the late nineteen
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 205.38 207.14 <o,f0,male> when i was in high school
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 207.36 220.24 <o,f0,male> i got my first philips reel to reel tape recorder and tape recorders became my sort of pre computer medium of learning i could have family and friends read me material
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 220.28 222.24 <o,f0,male> and i could then read it back
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 222.42 234.98 <o,f0,male> as many times as i needed and it brought me into contact with volunteers and helpers for example when i studied at graduate school at queen 's university in canada
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 258.23 261.22 <o,f0,male> in law by their dedicated help
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 271.21 274.12 <o,f0,male> tape recorders were everything to me
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 274.12 278.4 <o,f0,male> in fact in my office in one thousand nine hundred and ninety i had eighteen miles
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 296.01 304.38 <o,f0,male> one of the reasons i agreed to give this talk today was that i was hoping that lois would be here so i could introduce you to her and publicly thank her
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 325.87 329.01 <o,f0,male> i saw my first
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 338.26 351.53 <o,f0,male> how very wrong i was in one thousand nine hundred and eighty seven in the month our eldest son gerard was born i got my first blind computer and it 's actually here
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 387.1 403.13 <o,f0,male> it was invented by russell smith a passionate inventor in new zealand who was trying to help blind people sadly he died in a light plane crash in two thousand and five but his memory lives on in my heart it meant for the first time i could read back
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 439.68 449.16 <o,f0,male> but by using charge coupled device flatbed scanners and speech synthesizers he developed a machine that could read any font
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 449.56 453.25 <o,f0,male> and his machine which was as big as a washing machine
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 475.22 483.07 <o,f0,male> for the first time i could read what i wanted to read by putting a book on the scanner i didn 't have to be nice to people
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 485.78 488.98 <o,f0,male> i no longer would be censored for example
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 489.49 496.43 <o,f0,male> i was too shy then and i 'm actually too shy now to ask anybody to read me out loud sexually explicit material
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 500.36 503.87 <o,f0,male> but you know i could pop a book on in the middle of the night
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 514.63 518.48 <o,f0,male> the kurzweil reader is simply a program on my laptop
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 533.44 536.8 <o,f0,male> one is another american inventor ted henter
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 536.87 539.36 <o,f0,male> ted was a motorcycle racer
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 547.31 559.41 <o,f0,male> he then turned to being a waterskier and was a champion disabled waterskier but in one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine he teamed up with bill joyce to develop a program
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 584.8 592.56 <o,f0,male> you see if i read like that i 'd fall asleep i slowed it down for you i 'm going to ask that we play it at the speed i read it can we play that one
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 609.73 612.59 <o,f0,male> you know when you 're marking student essays you want to get through
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 630.6 632.46 <o,f0,male> but you know i find
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 632.46 635.77 <o,f0,male> reading with machines a very lonely process
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 636.82 642.79 <o,f0,male> i grew up with family friends reading to me and i loved the warmth
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 643.32 653.77 <o,f0,male> and the breath and the closeness of people reading do you love being read to and one of my most enduring memories is in one thousand nine
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 659.27 673.69 <o,f0,male> harry potter and the philosopher 's stone isn 't that a great book i still love being close to someone reading to me but i wouldn 't give up the technology because it 's allowed me to lead a great life
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 675.42 681.82 <o,f0,male> of course talking books for the blind predated all this technology after all the long playing record
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 722.21 740.13 <o,f0,male> w three c has developed worldwide standards for the internet and we want all internet users or internet site owners to make their sites compatible so that we persons without vision can have a level playing field
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 740.45 744.2 <o,f0,male> there are other barriers brought about by our laws
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 753.88 755.74 <o,f0,male> or read for we blind persons
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 756.33 758.96 <o,f0,male> but those books can 't travel across borders
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 759.55 766.53 <o,f0,male> for example in spain there are a one hundred thousand accessible books in spanish in argentina there are fifty thousand
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 766.77 770.39 <o,f0,male> in no other latin american country are there more than a couple of thousand
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 770.48 774.54 <o,f0,male> but it 's not legal to transport the books from spain to latin america
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 774.68 789.75 <o,f0,male> there are hundreds of thousands of accessible books in the united states britain canada australia etc but they can 't be transported to the sixty countries in our world where english is the first and the second language and remember i was telling you about harry potter
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 790.2 805.55 <o,f0,male> well because we can 't transport books across borders there had to be separate versions read in all the different english speaking countries britain united states canada australia and new zealand all had to have separate readings of harry potter
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 805.73 817.2 <o,f0,male> and that 's why next month in morocco a meeting is taking place between all the countries it 's something that a group of countries and the world blind union are advocating a cross border treaty
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 817.2 829.39 <o,f0,male> so that if books are available under a copyright exception and the other country has a copyright exception we can transport those books across borders and give life to people particularly in developing countries blind people
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 829.66 831.77 <o,f0,male> who don 't have the books to read
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 842.43 848.18 <o,f0,male> my life has been extraordinarily blessed with marriage and children
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 848.54 850.85 <o,f0,male> and certainly interesting work to do
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 861.98 865.63 <o,f0,male> i 've indeed been a very fortunate human being
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 867.44 869.91 <o,f0,male> i wonder what the future will hold
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 870.18 873.12 <o,f0,male> the technology will advance even further
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 874.1 878.77 <o,f0,male> but i can still remember my mum saying sixty years ago remember darling
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 879.2 883.1 <o,f0,male> you 'll never be able to read the print with your fingers
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 897.84 911.56 <o,f0,male> i 'd like to thank my researcher hannah martin who is my slide clicker who clicks the slides and my wife professor mary crock who 's the light of my life is coming on to collect me i want to thank her too
RonMcCallum_2013X 1 RonMcCallum_2013X 911.56 915.25 <o,f0,male> i think i have to say goodbye now bless you thank you very
