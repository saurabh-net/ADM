ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 27.04 34.85 <o,f0,male> the truth of the matter is otherwise our holy book the koran consists of one hundred and fourteen chapters
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 39.38 44.86 <o,f0,male> the saying of in the name of god the all compassionate the all merciful
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 45 47.05 <o,f0,male> or as sir richard burton
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 47.12 50.06 <o,f0,male> not the richard burton who was married to elizabeth taylor
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 50.21 65.45 <o,f0,male> but the sir richard burton who lived a century before that and who was a worldwide traveler and translator of many works of literature translates it in the name of god the compassionating the compassionate
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 67 72.92 <o,f0,male> and in a saying of the koran which to muslims is god speaking to humanity
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 72.92 78.5 <o,f0,male> god says to his prophet muhammad whom we believe to be the last of a series of
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 78.5 97.92 <o,f0,male> prophets beginning with adam including noah including moses including abraham including jesus christ and ending with muhammad that we have not sent you o muhammad except as a rahmah except as a source of compassion to humanity
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 102.01 117.67 <o,f0,male> whose mission and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet is to make ourselves as much like the prophet and the prophet in one of his sayings said adorn yourselves with the attributes of god
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 117.67 123.81 <o,f0,male> and because god himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 124.43 139.99 <o,f0,male> in fact the koran says that god decreed upon himself compassion or reigned himself in by compassion therefore our objective and our mission must be to be sources of compassion
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 140.49 150.45 <o,f0,male> activators of compassion actors of compassion and speakers of compassion and doers of compassion that is all well and good
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 150.76 163.47 <o,f0,male> but where do we go wrong and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world for the answer to this we turn to our spiritual path
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 164.41 166.57 <o,f0,male> in every religious tradition
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 166.59 169.44 <o,f0,male> there is the outer path
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 176.42 194.8 <o,f0,male> the esoteric path of islam is more popularly known as sufism or tasawwuf in arabic and these doctors or these masters these spiritual masters of the sufi tradition refer to teachings and examples of our prophet
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 199.74 211.07 <o,f0,male> in one of the battles that the prophet waged he told his followers we are returning from the lesser war to the greater war to the greater battle
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 227.9 235.98 <o,f0,male> the sources of human problems have to do with egotism i
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 237.25 243.27 <o,f0,male> the famous sufi master rumi who is very well known to most of you
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 243.47 250.85 <o,f0,male> has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend and he knocks on the door
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 251.9 253.56 <o,f0,male> and a voice answers
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 253.65 264.09 <o,f0,male> who 's there it 's me or more grammatically correctly it is i as we might say in english the voice says go away
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 266.02 279.01 <o,f0,male> after many years of training of disciplining of search and struggle he comes back with much greater humility he knocks again on the door
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 279.76 288.72 <o,f0,male> the voice asks who is there he said it is you o heartbreaker the door swings open
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 303.61 309.35 <o,f0,male> and rumi 's stories are metaphors for the spiritual path
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 310.4 313.67 <o,f0,male> in the presence of god there is
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 313.67 316.17 <o,f0,male> no room for more than one
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 316.94 319.03 <o,f0,male> and that is the i of divinity
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 320.81 335 <o,f0,male> in a teaching called a hadith qudsi in our tradition god says that my servant or my creature my human creature does not approach me by anything
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 335.22 339.26 <o,f0,male> that is dearer to me than what i have asked them to do
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 340.65 343.87 <o,f0,male> and those of you who are employers know exactly what i mean
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 343.98 352.42 <o,f0,male> you want your employees to do what you ask them to do and if they 've done that then they can do extra but don 't ignore what you 've asked them to do
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 353.19 369.61 <o,f0,male> and god says my servant continues to get nearer to me by doing more of what i 've asked them to do extra credit we might call it until i love him or love her and when i love
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 369.61 377.11 <o,f0,male> my servant god says i become the eyes by which he or she sees
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 377.68 380.88 <o,f0,male> the ears by which he or she
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 391.43 393.73 <o,f0,male> walks and the heart
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 393.86 399.02 <o,f0,male> by which he or she understands it is this merging
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 409.56 414.79 <o,f0,male> muslims regard jesus as the master of sufism
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 422.87 431.59 <o,f0,male> when he says i am the spirit and i am the way and when the prophet muhammad said whoever has seen me has seen god
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 432.31 436.26 <o,f0,male> it is because they became so much an instrument
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 436.73 446.92 <o,f0,male> of god they became part of god 's team so that god 's will was manifest through them and they were not acting from their own selves and their own
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 454.17 462.11 <o,f0,male> all we have to do is to get our egos out of the way get our egotism out of the way
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 464.44 480.71 <o,f0,male> i 'm sure probably all of you here or certainly the very vast majority of you have had what you might call a spiritual experience a moment in your lives when for a few seconds a minute perhaps
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 487.71 495.44 <o,f0,male> and at that minute you felt at one with the universe one
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 533.59 540.1 <o,f0,male> and instead like the person in rumi 's story we say oh this is all you
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 541.69 543.21 <o,f0,male> this is all you
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 543.77 545.62 <o,f0,male> and this is all us
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 551.48 559.35 <o,f0,male> o creator o the objective the source of our being and the end of our journey
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 559.52 563.24 <o,f0,male> you are also the breaker of our hearts
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 563.99 579.5 <o,f0,male> you are the one whom we should all be towards for whose purpose we live and for whose purpose we shall die and for whose purpose we shall be resurrected again to account
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 596.88 600.77 <o,f0,male> for the koran always urges us
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 600.77 608.25 <o,f0,male> to remember to remind each other because the knowledge of truth
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 609.3 611.22 <o,f0,male> is within every human being
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 616.42 621.12 <o,f0,male> we know it all we have access to it all jung may have called it the subconscious
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 630.69 633.33 <o,f0,male> state of sleep the lesser death
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 649.44 661.07 <o,f0,male> and we see wonderful things we travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it and beyond the limitations of time as we know it
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 668.44 670.09 <o,f0,male> the name of the creator
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 671.48 675.88 <o,f0,male> whose primary name is the compassionating the compassionate
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 686.72 688.96 <o,f0,male> through which you name or access
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 689.2 691.03 <o,f0,male> the presence of divinity
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 701.5 708.56 <o,f0,male> and absolute knowledge and wisdom what hindus call satchidananda the language differs
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 710.85 712.58 <o,f0,male> but the objective is the same
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 742.17 748.09 <o,f0,male> reality in different languages there 's only one absolute reality by definition
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 749.84 755.89 <o,f0,male> one absolute being by definition because absolute is by definition single
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 756.17 758.26 <o,f0,male> and absolute and singular
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 779.83 785.99 <o,f0,male> and these should also be the primary attributes of what it means to be human
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 788.33 792.9 <o,f0,male> for what defines humanity perhaps biologically
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 793.65 795.27 <o,f0,male> is our physiology
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 796 799.71 <o,f0,male> but god defines humanity by our
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 799.76 801.36 <o,f0,male> spirituality
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 823.07 826.68 <o,f0,male> prostrate not before the human body
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 828.44 840.5 <o,f0,male> but before the human soul why because the soul the human soul embodies a piece of the divine breath
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 841.37 843.46 <o,f0,male> a piece of the divine soul
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 845.4 851.8 <o,f0,male> this is also expressed in biblical vocabulary when we are taught that we were
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 851.8 854.56 <o,f0,male> created in the divine image
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 855.29 857.24 <o,f0,male> what is the imagery of god
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 857.77 866.47 <o,f0,male> the imagery of god is absolute being absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom and absolute compassion
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 867.37 870.88 <o,f0,male> and love and therefore for us to be human
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 871.53 880.16 <o,f0,male> in the greatest sense of what it means to be human in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human means that we too
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 881.56 883.73 <o,f0,male> have to be proper stewards
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 884.53 887.12 <o,f0,male> of the breath of divinity within us
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 888.34 893.48 <o,f0,male> and seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 896.01 900.71 <o,f0,male> the attribute of wisdom of consciousness of awareness
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 901.32 907.39 <o,f0,male> and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings this
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 908.5 911.69 <o,f0,male> is what i understand from my faith tradition
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 912.29 918.07 <o,f0,male> and this is what i understand from my studies of other faith
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 918.99 921.83 <o,f0,male> and this is the common platform
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 922.18 929.41 <o,f0,male> on which we must all stand and when we stand on this platform as such i am convinced
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 929.41 939.41 <o,f0,male> that we can make a wonderful world and i believe personally that we 're on the verge
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 940.31 946.25 <o,f0,male> and that with the presence and help of people like you here we can bring about
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 948.12 950.02 <o,f0,male> the prophecy of isaiah
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 950.02 954.95 <o,f0,male> for he foretold of a period when
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 957.61 959.7 <o,f0,male> their swords into plowshares
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 961.07 967.04 <o,f0,male> and will not learn war or make war anymore
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 967.04 971.67 <o,f0,male> we have reached a stage in human history that we have no option
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 981.87 989.8 <o,f0,male> control our egos whether it is individual ego personal ego family ego national ego
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 1 ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P 993.69 997.82 <o,f0,male> and let all be for the glorification of the one
