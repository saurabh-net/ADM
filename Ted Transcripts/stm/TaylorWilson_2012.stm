TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 16.68 30.92 <o,f0,male> my name is taylor wilson i am seventeen years old and i am a nuclear physicist which may be a little hard to believe but i am and i would like to make the case that nuclear fusion will be that
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 31.37 45.57 <o,f0,male> point that the bridge that t boone pickens talked about will get us to so nuclear fusion is our energy future and the second point making the case that kids can really change the world so you may ask applause you
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 56.53 69.54 <o,f0,male> that is the inside of my nuclear fusion reactor i started building this project when i was about twelve or thirteen years old i decided i wanted to make a star now most of you are probably saying well
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 69.73 81.26 <o,f0,male> there 's no such thing as nuclear fusion i don 't see any nuclear power plants with fusion energy well it doesn 't break even it doesn 't produce more energy out than i put in but it still does some pretty cool stuff
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 81.26 98.21 <o,f0,male> and i assembled this in my garage and it now lives in the physics department of the university of nevada reno and it slams together deuterium which is just hydrogen with an extra neutron in it so this is similar to the reaction of the proton chain that 's going on inside the sun
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 98.21 108.58 <o,f0,male> and i 'm slamming it together so hard that that hydrogen fuses together and in the process it has some byproducts and i utilize those byproducts so
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 127.56 131.89 <o,f0,female> my garage applause and i
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 140.03 146.76 <o,f0,female> produce these isotopes so that 's my fusion reactor in the background there
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 146.76 150.05 <o,f0,male> that is me at the control panel of my fusion reactor
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 150.85 160.06 <o,f0,male> oh by the way i make yellowcake in my garage so my nuclear program is as advanced as the iranians so maybe i don 't want to admit to that
