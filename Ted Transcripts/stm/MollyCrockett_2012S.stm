MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 34.43 46.08 <o,f0,female> that 's right according to scientists a cheese sandwich is the solution to all your tough decisions how do i know i 'm the scientist who did the study
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 47.28 65.91 <o,f0,female> a few years ago my colleagues and i were interested in how a brain chemical called serotonin would influence people 's decisions in social situations specifically we wanted to know how serotonin would affect the way people react when they 're treated unfairly so we did an experiment we manipulated people 's serotonin levels
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 65.93 78.71 <o,f0,female> by giving them this really disgusting tasting artificial lemon flavored drink that works by taking away the raw ingredient for serotonin in the brain this is the amino acid tryptophan
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 78.71 86.64 <o,f0,female> so what we found was when tryptophan was low people were more likely to take revenge when they 're treated unfairly
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 125.15 136.88 <o,f0,female> and of course when science says cheese and chocolate help you make better decisions well that 's sure to grab people 's attention so there you have it the evolution of a headline
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 136.88 150.83 <o,f0,female> when this happened a part of me thought well what 's the big deal so the media oversimplified a few things but in the end it 's just a news story and i think a lot of scientists have this attitude
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 150.83 165.84 <o,f0,female> but the problem is that this kind of thing happens all the time and it affects not just the stories you read in the news but also the products you see on the shelves when the headlines rolled what happened was the marketers came calling
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 179.3 189.22 <o,f0,female> i think these folks meant well but had i taken them up on their offers i would have been going beyond the science and good scientists are careful not to do this
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 189.22 208.12 <o,f0,female> but nevertheless neuroscience is turning up more and more in marketing here 's one example neuro drinks a line of products including nuero bliss here which according to its label helps reduce stress enhances mood provides focused concentration and promotes a positive outlook
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 208.12 212.26 <o,f0,female> i have to say this sounds awesome
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 216.44 231.96 <o,f0,female> so when this came up in my local shop naturally i was curious about some of the research backing these claims so i went to the company 's website looking to find some controlled trials of their products but i didn 't find any
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 231.96 239.69 <o,f0,female> trial or no trial these claims are front and center on their label right next to a picture of a brain
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 239.69 250.12 <o,f0,female> and it turns out that pictures of brains have special properties a couple of researchers asked a few hundred people to read a scientific article
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 250.12 264.76 <o,f0,female> for half the people the article included a brain image and for the other half it was the same article but it didn 't have a brain image at the end you see where this is going people were asked whether they agreed with the conclusions of the article
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 264.76 281.46 <o,f0,female> so this is how much people agree with the conclusions with no image and this is how much they agree with the same article that did include a brain image so the take home message here is do you want to sell it put a brain on it
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 282 298.73 <o,f0,female> now let me pause here and take a moment to say that neuroscience has advanced a lot in the last few decades and we 're constantly discovering amazing things about the brain like just a couple of weeks ago neuroscientists at mit figured out how to break habits in rats
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 298.73 302.41 <o,f0,female> just by controlling neural activity in a specific part of their brain
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 302.42 312.17 <o,f0,female> really cool stuff but the promise of neuroscience has led to some really high expectations and some overblown unproven claims
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 312.17 327.39 <o,f0,female> so what i 'm going to do is show you how to spot a couple of classic moves dead giveaways really for what 's variously been called neuro bunk neuro bollocks or my personal favorite neuro flapdoodle
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 327.39 335.53 <o,f0,female> so the first unproven claim is that you can use brain scans to read people 's thoughts and emotions
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 335.53 342.46 <o,f0,female> here 's a study published by a team of researchers as an op ed in the new york times the headline
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 342.6 349.89 <o,f0,female> you love your iphone literally it quickly became the most emailed article on the site
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 376.06 382.12 <o,f0,female> now there 's just one problem with this line of reasoning and that 's that the insula does a lot
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 382.12 396.29 <o,f0,female> sure it is involved in positive emotions like love and compassion but it 's also involved in tons of other processes like memory language attention even anger disgust and pain
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 424.11 428.74 <o,f0,female> so chances are really really good that your insula is going off right now
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 428.74 432.74 <o,f0,female> but i won 't kid myself to think this means you love me
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 434.07 446.76 <o,f0,female> so speaking of love and the brain there 's a researcher known to some as dr love who claims that scientists have found the glue that holds society together
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 458.62 469.02 <o,f0,female> so dr love bases his argument on studies showing that when you boost people 's oxytocin this increases their trust empathy and cooperation
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 469.02 479.82 <o,f0,female> so he 's calling oxytocin the moral molecule now these studies are scientifically valid and they 've been replicated but they 're not the whole story
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 479.82 497.91 <o,f0,female> other studies have shown that boosting oxytocin increases envy it increases gloating oxytocin can bias people to favor their own group at the expense of other groups and in some cases oxytocin can even decrease cooperation
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 497.91 507.33 <o,f0,female> so based on these studies i could say oxytocin is an immoral molecule and call myself dr strangelove
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 509.93 527.85 <o,f0,female> so we 've seen neuro flapdoodle all over the headlines we see it in supermarkets on book covers what about the clinic spect imaging is a brain scanning technology that uses a radioactive tracer to track blood flow in the brain
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 527.85 537.84 <o,f0,female> for the bargain price of a few thousand dollars there are clinics in the u s that will give you one of these spect scans
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 537.94 546.43 <o,f0,female> and use the image to help diagnose your problems these scans the clinics say can help prevent alzheimer 's disease
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 546.43 566.12 <o,f0,female> solve weight and addiction issues overcome marital conflicts and treat of course a variety of mental illnesses ranging from depression to anxiety to adhd this sounds great a lot of people agree some of these clinics are pulling in tens of millions of dollars a year in business
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 566.12 577.32 <o,f0,female> there 's just one problem the broad consensus in neuroscience is that we can 't yet diagnose mental illness from a single brain scan
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 592.23 611.9 <o,f0,female> i am more excited than most people as a neuroscientist about the potential for neuroscience to treat mental illness and even maybe to make us better and smarter and if one day we can say that cheese and chocolate help us make better decisions count me in
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 611.9 629.75 <o,f0,female> but we 're not there yet we haven 't found a buy button inside the brain we can 't tell whether someone is lying or in love just by looking at their brain scans and we can 't turn sinners into saints with hormones
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 629.75 642.05 <o,f0,female> maybe someday we will but until then we have to be careful that we don 't let overblown claims detract resources and attention away from the real science that 's playing a much longer game
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 642.05 657.79 <o,f0,female> so here 's where you come in if someone tries to sell you something with a brain on it don 't just take them at their word ask the tough questions ask to see the evidence ask for the part of the story that 's not being told
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 657.79 668.89 <o,f0,female> the answers shouldn 't be simple because the brain isn 't simple but that 's not stopping us from trying to figure it out anyway thank you
