MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 21.48 24.84 <o,f0,male> thirty two a gunshot was heard ringing out
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 29.33 38.22 <o,f0,male> was walking to market that morning ran towards where the gunshot had come from and found a young man writhing in agony on the floor clearly shot
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 48.14 55.33 <o,f0,male> galois was taken to the local hospital where he died the next day in the arms of his brother and the last words he said to his brother
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 56.51 62.50 <o,f0,male> cry for me alfred i need all the courage i can muster to die at the age of twenty
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 63.64 70.48 <o,f0,male> in fact revolutionary politics for which galois was famous but a few years earlier while still at school
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 82.11 92.60 <o,f0,male> this is how he wrote most of his mathematics so the night before that duel he realized this possibly is his last chance to try and explain his great breakthrough
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 103.65 112.40 <o,f0,male> the next generation maybe the fact that he stayed up all night doing mathematics was the fact that he was such a bad shot that morning and got killed but contained inside those documents
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 112.89 120.00 <o,f0,male> was a new language a language to understand one of the most fundamental concepts of science namely symmetry
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 120.42 133.66 <o,f0,male> now symmetry is almost nature 's language it helps us to understand so many different bits of the scientific world for example molecular structure what crystals are possible we can understand through the mathematics of symmetry
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 184.85 194.28 <o,f0,male> to make predictions about the fundamental particles we might see there it seems that they are all facets of some strange symmetrical shape in a higher dimensional space
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 194.60 207.31 <o,f0,male> and i think galileo summed up very nicely the power of mathematics to understand the scientific world around us he wrote the universe cannot be read until we have learnt the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 207.62 217.49 <o,f0,male> it is written in mathematical language and the letters are triangles circles and other geometric figures without which means that it's humanly impossible to comprehend a single
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 265.46 272.65 <o,f0,male> and i said to professor kurokawa wow the architects must have really been kicking themselves when they realized that they'd made a mistake and put this one upside down
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 272.89 280.91 <o,f0,male> he said no no no it was a very deliberate act and he referred me to this lovely quote from the japanese essays in idleness from the fourteenth century in which the
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 282.17 295.64 <o,f0,male> in everything uniformity is undesirable leaving something incomplete makes it interesting and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth even when building the imperial palace they always leave one place unfinished
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 296.43 308.48 <o,f0,male> i had to chose one building in the world to be cast out on a desert island to live the rest of my life being an addict of symmetry i would probably chose the alhambra in granada this is a palace celebrating symmetry
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 319.76 332.25 <o,f0,male> but i wanted to try and enrich him i think one of the problems about school mathematics is it doesn't look at how mathematics is embedded in the world we live in so i wanted to open his eyes up to how much symmetry is running through the alhambra
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 345.27 358.81 <o,f0,male> art and so what is symmetry the alhambra somehow asks all of these questions what is symmetry when are two of these walls do they have the same symmetries can we say whether they discovered all of the symmetries in the alhambra
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 359.43 369.80 <o,f0,male> and it was galois who produced a language to be able to answer some of these questions for galois symmetry unlike for thomas mann which was something still and deathly
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 369.89 377.88 <o,f0,male> for galois symmetry was all about motion what can you do to a symmetrical object move it in some way so it looks the same as before you
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 378.67 386.57 <o,f0,male> i like to describe it as the magic trick moves what can you do to something you close your eyes i do something put it back down again it looks like it did before it started
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 387.03 397.13 <o,f0,male> so for example the walls in the alhambra i can take all of these tiles and fix them at the yellow place rotate them by ninety degrees put them all back down again and they fit perfectly down there
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 397.50 404.84 <o,f0,male> if you open your eyes again you wouldn't know that they'd moved but it's the motion that really characterizes the symmetry inside the alhambra
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 425.10 437.67 <o,f0,male> so let 's take these two symmetrical objects here let 's take the twisted six pointed starfish what can i do to the starfish which makes it look the same well there i rotated it by a sixth of a turn and still it looks like it did before i started
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 438.02 445.27 <o,f0,male> i could rotate it by a third of a turn or a half a turn or put it back down on its image or two thirds of a
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 446.52 454.73 <o,f0,male> and a fifth symmetry i can rotate it by five sixths of a turn and those are things that i can do to the symmetrical object that make it look like it did before i started
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 455.26 463.30 <o,f0,male> now for galois there was actually a sixth symmetry can anybody think what else i could do to this which would leave it like i did before i started
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 463.89 473.35 <o,f0,male> i can't flip it because i've put a little twist on it haven't i it's got no reflective symmetry but what i could do is just leave it where it is pick it up and put it down again
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 474.13 483.15 <o,f0,male> galois this was like the zeroth symmetry actually the invention of the number zero was a very modern concept seventh century a d by the indians it seems
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 484.02 492.62 <o,f0,male> to talk about nothing and this is the same idea this is a symmetrical so everything has symmetry where you just leave it where it is so this object has six symmetries
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 493.36 500.14 <o,f0,male> and what about the triangle well i can rotate by a third of a turn clockwise or a third of a turn anticlockwise
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 500.33 506.54 <o,f0,male> but now this has some reflectional symmetry i can reflect it in the line through x or the line through y or the
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 518.18 529.84 <o,f0,male> a great believer that mathematics is not a spectator sport and you have to do some mathematics in order to really understand it so here is a little question for you and i'm going to give a prize at the end of my talk for the person who gets closest to the
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 530.89 539.57 <o,f0,male> the rubik 's cube how many symmetries does a rubik 's cube have how many things can i do to this object and put it down so it still looks like a cube
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 555.78 563.91 <o,f0,male> but how they interact with each other which really characterizes the symmetry of an object if i do one magic trick move followed by another
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 564.21 576.44 <o,f0,male> the combination is a third magic trick move and here we see galois starting to develop a language to see the substance of the things unseen the sort of abstract idea of the symmetry underlying this physical
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 577.04 586.96 <o,f0,male> for example what if i turn the starfish by a sixth of a turn and then a third of a turn so i've given names the capital letters a b c d e f
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 587.10 594.67 <o,f0,male> are the names for the rotations b for example rotates the little yellow dot to the b on the starfish and so on so what if i do
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 595.26 607.47 <o,f0,male> which is a sixth of a turn followed by c which is a third of a turn well let 's do that a sixth of a turn followed by a third of a turn the combined effect is as if i had just rotated it by half a turn in one
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 608.79 616.23 <o,f0,male> so the little table here records how the algebra of these symmetries work i do one followed by another the answer is it's rotation d
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 623.33 632.72 <o,f0,male> and then the sixth of a turn of course it doesn't make any difference it still ends up at half a turn and there is some symmetry here in the way the symmetries interact with each other
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 633.18 642.24 <o,f0,male> but this is completely different to the symmetries of the triangle let 's see what happens if we do two symmetries with the triangle one after the other let 's do a rotation by a third of a turn
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 651.46 659.09 <o,f0,male> now let 's do it in a different order let 's do the reflection in x first followed by the rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 659.29 668.47 <o,f0,male> the combined effect the triangle ends up somewhere completely different it's as if it was reflected in the line through y now it matters what order you do the operations in
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 668.78 676.59 <o,f0,male> and this enables us to distinguish why the symmetries of these objects they both have six symmetries so why shouldn 't we say they have the same symmetries
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 676.86 683.89 <o,f0,male> but the way the symmetries interact enable us we've now got a language to distinguish why these symmetries are fundamentally different
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 684.13 694.75 <o,f0,male> you can try this when you go down to the pub later on take a beer mat and rotate it by a quarter of a turn then flip it and then do it in the other order and the picture will be facing in the opposite direction
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 695.28 703.47 <o,f0,male> now galois produced some laws for how these tables how symmetries interact it's almost like little sudoku tables you don't see any symmetry
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 724.97 734.69 <o,f0,male> here i've got one two three people sitting on one two three chairs the people on the chairs are very different but the number the abstract idea of the number is the same
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 760.99 768.82 <o,f0,male> the point where all the triangles meet what about the center of a triangle i can rotate by a third of a turn around the center of the triangle and everything matches up
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 780.05 790.03 <o,f0,male> now let 's move to the very different looking wall in the alhambra and we find the same symmetries here and the same interaction so there was a sixth of a turn a third of a turn where the z pieces
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 791.68 797.64 <o,f0,male> and the half a turn is halfway between the six pointed stars and although these walls look very different
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 797.94 806.15 <o,f0,male> galois has produced a language to say that in fact the symmetries underlying these are exactly the same and it's a symmetry we call six three two
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 806.57 817.97 <o,f0,male> is another example in the alhambra this is a wall a ceiling and a floor they all look very different but this language allows us to say that they are representations of the same symmetrical abstract object
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 818.26 825.51 <o,f0,male> which we call four four two nothing to do with football but because of the fact that there are two places where you can rotate by a quarter of a turn and one
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 836.34 846.53 <o,f0,male> it turns out they almost did you can prove using galois language there are actually only seventeen different symmetries that you can do in the walls in the alhambra
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 846.93 852.72 <o,f0,male> and they if you try to produce a different wall with this eighteenth one it will have to have the same symmetries as one of these
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 854.47 861.57 <o,f0,male> but these are things that we can see and the power of galois mathematical language is it also allows us to create symmetrical objects
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 862.13 870.35 <o,f0,male> the unseen world beyond the two dimensional three dimensional all the way through to the four or five or infinite dimensional space and that's where i work i create
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 897.42 908.40 <o,f0,male> show you a picture of this symmetrical object but here is the language which describes how the symmetries interact now this new symmetrical object does not have a name yet
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 909.02 918.28 <o,f0,male> now people like getting their names on things on craters on the moon or new species of animals so i'm going to give you the chance to get your name on a new symmetrical
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 918.73 929.06 <o,f0,male> which hasn't been named before and this thing species die away and moons kind of get hit by meteors and explode but this mathematical object will live forever it will make you immortal
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 930.92 937.59 <o,f0,male> this symmetrical object what you have to do is to answer the question i asked you at the beginning how many symmetries does a rubik 's cube
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 940.55 949.73 <o,f0,male> you out rather than you all shouting out i want you to count how many digits there are in that number okay if you've got it as a factorial you've got to expand the factorials
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 950.32 957.78 <o,f0,male> now if you want to play i want you to stand up okay if you think you've got an estimate for how many digits right we've already got one competitor here
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 959.24 966.37 <o,f0,male> down he wins it automatically okay excellent so we've got four here five six great excellent that should get us going all right
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 988.48 990.27 <o,f0,male> how many digits are there in your number
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 992.01 993.72 <o,f0,male> so you should have sat down earlier let 's have the other
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 996.95 1007.53 <o,f0,male> during the twenty up again okay if i told you twenty or less stand up because this one i think there were a few here the people who just last sat down okay how many digits do you have in your number
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1013.43 1015.17 <o,f0,male> twenty one okay good how many do you have in
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1016.42 1027.71 <o,f0,male> eighteen so it goes to this lady here twenty one is the closest it actually has the number of symmetries in the rubik 's cube has twenty five digits so now i need to name this object so what is your name
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1033.67 1036.61 <o,f0,male> g h
