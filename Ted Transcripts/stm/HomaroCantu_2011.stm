HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 13.7 15.73 <o,f0,male> and i 'm homaro
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 44.63 51.77 <o,f0,male> so this is all the ingredients all the flavor of you know a standard maki roll printed onto a little piece of paper
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 95.04 110.36 <o,f0,male> and then that went into a balloon frozen in liquid nitrogen to create this hollow shell of carrot cake ice cream i guess and it comes off looking like you know jupiter 's floating around your plate so yeah we 're transforming things into something that you have absolutely no reference for
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 119.35 137.43 <o,f0,male> so we take these spices that go into the pork shoulder we fashion that into ash we take the sandwich and wrap it up in a collard green put an edible label that bears no similarity to a cohiba cigar label and we put it in a dollar ninety nine ashtray and charge you about twenty bucks for it
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 157.23 168.04 <o,f0,male> so the chips are candied the ground beef is made from chocolate and the cheese is made from a shredded mango sorbet that gets shredded into liquid nitrogen to look like cheese
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 227.56 240.52 <o,f0,male> all these different doors to creativity that we never knew were there began to open and so the experiments and the food and the dishes that we created they just kept going further and further out there
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 244.4 249.29 <o,f0,male> you see a cow with its tongue hanging out what i see is a cow about to eat something delicious
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 249.29 253.03 <o,f0,male> what is that cow eating and why is it delicious
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 253.03 269.54 <o,f0,male> so the cow basically eats three basic things in their feed corn beets and barley and so what i do is i actually challenge my staff with these crazy wild ideas can we take what the cow eats remove the cow and then make some hamburgers out of that
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 269.54 273.79 <o,f0,male> and basically the reaction tends to be kind of like this
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 281.56 299.6 <o,f0,male> but a lot of these ideas they 're hard to understand they 're hard to just get automatically there 's a lot of research and a lot of failure trial and error i guess more error that goes into each and every dish so we don 't always get it right and it takes a while for us to be able to explain that to people
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 315.91 320.54 <o,f0,male> and so it actually cooks up like hamburger meat looks and tastes like hamburger meat
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 320.54 329.7 <o,f0,male> and not only that but it 's basically removing the cow from the equation so replicating food taking it into that next level is where we 're going
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 352.85 363.83 <o,f0,male> certain taste receptors on your tongue so that primarily sour taste receptors so normally things that would taste very sour or tart somehow begin to taste very sweet
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 381.85 397.59 <o,f0,male> the idea with this is that we 're going to eliminate tons of food miles wasted energy and overfishing of tuna by creating tuna or any exotic produce or item from a very far away place
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 401.87 419.37 <o,f0,male> so if miracle berries take sour things and turn them into sweet things we have this other pixie dust that we put on the watermelon and it makes it go from sweet to savory so after we do that we put it into a vacuum bag add a little bit of seaweed some spices
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 433.76 436.75 <o,f0,male> tastes and behaves like the real thing
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 458.63 478.44 <o,f0,male> so here 's the next challenge i told the staff let 's just take a bunch of wild plants think of them as food ingredients as long as they 're non poisonous to the human body go out around chicago sidewalks take it blend it cook it and then have everybody flavor trip on it at moto let 's charge them a boatload of cash for this and see what they think
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 492.39 509.28 <o,f0,male> ingredients you know plant life that we 're one unfamiliar with and two we have no reference for how to cook these things because people don 't eat them so we really had to think about new creative ways to flavor new ways to cook and to change texture and that was the main issue with this challenge
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 511.83 519.91 <o,f0,male> into the future and we leapfrog ahead so developing nations and first world nations imagine if you could take
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 519.91 538.54 <o,f0,male> these wild plants and consume them food miles would basically turn into food feet this disruptive mentality of what food is would essentially open up the encyclopedia of what raw ingredients are even if we just swapped out say one of these for flour that would eliminate so much energy and so much waste
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 538.54 545.7 <o,f0,male> and to give you a simple example here as to what we actually fed these customers there 's a bale of hay there and some crab apples
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 545.7 554.1 <o,f0,male> and basically we took hay and crab apples and made barbecue sauce out of those two ingredients people swore they were eating barbecue sauce
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 554.24 557.05 <o,f0,male> and this is free food
