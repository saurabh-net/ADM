WadeDavis_2012 1 WadeDavis_2012 107.72 114.78 <o,f0,male> my job description was deliciously vague wilderness assessment and public relations

WadeDavis_2012 1 WadeDavis_2012 191.48 207.17 <o,f0,male> you 've heard so much about the developments of the tar sands the controversy about the keystone and the enbridge pipelines but these are just elements of a tsunami of industrial development that is sweeping across all of the wild country of northern canada
WadeDavis_2012 1 WadeDavis_2012 207.33 217.95 <o,f0,male> in tahltan territory alone there are forty one major industrial proposals some with great promise some of great concern on todagin mountain

WadeDavis_2012 1 WadeDavis_2012 261.58 281.38 <o,f0,male> fracking the coal with hundreds of millions of gallons of toxic chemicals establishing perhaps as many as six thousand wellheads and eventually a network of roads and pipelines and flaring wellheads all to generate methane gas that most likely will go east to fuel the expansion

WadeDavis_2012 1 WadeDavis_2012 283.78 295.18 <o,f0,male> for over a decade the tahltan people both clans wolf and crow have resisted this assault on their homeland men women and children of all ages
