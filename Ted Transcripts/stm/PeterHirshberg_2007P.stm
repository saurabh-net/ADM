PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 34.40 42.96 <o,f0,male> so it's about time that we talked about how the computer ambushed television or why the invention of the atomic bomb unleashed forces
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 43.34 51.28 <o,f0,male> that lead to the writers strike and it's not just what these are doing to each other but it's what the audience thinks that really frames this matter
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 51.75 62.75 <o,f0,male> to get a sense of this and it's been a theme we've talked about all week i recently talked to a bunch of tweeners i wrote on cards television radio myspace internet pc and i said just arrange these from
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 63.03 71.37 <o,f0,male> what's important to you and what's not and then tell me why let 's listen to what happens when they get to the portion of the discussion on television
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 71.92 74.45 <o,f0,female> i think it's important
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 75.68 86.39 <o,f0,female> but like not necessary because you can do a lot of other stuff with your free time than watch programs which is more fun internet or tv
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 88.18 95.60 <o,f0,female> i think we the reasons one of the reasons we put computer before tv is because nowadays like we have tv shows on the computer oh yes and
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 102.57 105.08 <o,f0,female> be so stressful no
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 118.48 127.05 <o,f0,male> been an uneasy relationship between the tv business and the tech business really ever since they both turned about thirty
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 127.38 136.75 <o,f0,male> we go through periods of enthrallment followed by reactions in boardrooms in the finance community best characterized as what's the finance term
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 157.90 168.60 <o,f0,male> citicorp penney rca all getting into this big vision by the way this is about when i enter the picture i'm going to do a summer internship at time warner that summer i'm all i'm at warner that summer i'm all excited to work on convergence
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 209.13 215.86 <o,f0,male> and in just four years managed to shed about two hundred billion dollars of market capitalization
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 227.43 237.38 <o,f0,male> one reason that the media and the entertainment communities or the media community is driven so crazy by the tech community is that tech folks talk differently you know
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 237.54 246.66 <o,f0,male> for fifty years we've talked about changing the world about total transformation for fifty years it's been about hopes and fears and and promises of a better world and i got to
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 247.46 255.10 <o,f0,male> you know who else talks that way and the answer is pretty clearly it's people in religion and in politics
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 255.49 267.86 <o,f0,male> and so i realized that actually the tech world is best understood not as a business cycle but as a messianic movement we promise something great we evangelize it we're going to change the world it doesn't work out too well and
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 269.18 276.04 <o,f0,male> we actually go back to the well and start all over again as the people in new york and l a look on in absolute morbid astonishment
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 276.33 285.03 <o,f0,male> but it's this irrational view of things that drives us on to the next thing so what i'd like to ask is if the computer is becoming a principal tool of media and entertainment
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 285.36 294.14 <o,f0,male> how did we get here i mean how did a machine that was built for accounting and artillery morph into media of course the first computer was built just after world war ii to solve
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 302.73 311.36 <o,f0,male> built at mit 's lincoln lab jay forester was building this for the navy but you can't help but see that the creator of this machine had in mind
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 311.73 323.96 <o,f0,male> a machine that might actually be a potential media star so take a look at what happens when the foremost journalist of early television meets one of the foremost computer pioneers and the computer begins to express itself
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 334.95 339.60 <o,f0,male> and this is the oscilloscope of the whirlwind electronic computer would you
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 354.26 362.38 <o,f0,male> well ed this problem concerns the navy 's viking rocket this rocket goes up one hundred and thirty five miles into the
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 366.27 370.19 <o,f0,male> i would like to see the computer trace the flight path of this rocket
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 370.64 372.72 <o,f0,male> and see how it can determine at any
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 397.10 403.32 <o,f0,male> and as it reaches the peak of its trajectory the velocity you will notice has dropped off to a minimum
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 415.55 418.05 <o,f0,male> very good to me and before leaving
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 418.18 424.50 <o,f0,male> we would like to show you another kind of mathematical problem that some of the boys have worked out in their spare time
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 436.32 437.30 <o,f0,male> the mit
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 439.08 450.02 <o,f0,male> you know so much was worked out the first real time interaction the video display pointing a gun it lead to the micro computer but unfortunately
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 450.31 458.70 <o,f0,male> it was too pricey for the navy and all of this would have been lost if it weren't for a happy coincidence enter the atomic bomb
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 467.45 476.47 <o,f0,male> they adapt whirlwind to a massive air defense system deploy it all across the frozen north and spend nearly three times as much on this computer as was spent on the
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 497.08 502.03 <o,f0,male> in a mass raid high speed bombers could be in on us before we could determine their
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 503.43 503.90 <o,f0,female> and
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 512.81 525.79 <o,f0,male> we cannot afford to take that chance it is to meet this threat that the air force has been developing sage the semi automatic ground environment system to strengthen our air defenses
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 526.78 530.74 <o,f0,male> this new computer built to become the nerve center of a defense network
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 531.72 536.79 <o,f0,male> able to perform all the complex mathematical problems involved in countering a mass
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 538.16 543.00 <o,f0,male> it is provided with its own powerhouse containing large diesel driven generators
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 568.16 576.89 <o,f0,male> a really good example of that this had the first pointing device it was distributed so it worked out distributed computing and modems so all these things could talk to each other
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 577.35 584.68 <o,f0,male> about twenty percent of all the nation 's programmers were wrapped up in this thing and it led to an awful lot of what we have today
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 585.10 595.04 <o,f0,male> it also used vacuum tubes you saw how huge it was and to give you a sense for this because we've talked a lot about moore 's law and making things small at this conference so let 's talk about making things large
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 595.59 603.99 <o,f0,male> if we took whirlwind and put it in a place that you all know say century city it would fit beautifully you'd kind of have to take century city out but it could fit in there
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 605.80 612.86 <o,f0,male> let 's imagine we took the latest pentium processor the latest core two extreme which is a four core processor that intel 's working
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 613.10 620.90 <o,f0,male> it will be our laptop tomorrow to build that what we'd do with whirlwind technology is we'd have to take up roughly
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 632.02 641.66 <o,f0,male> the power would fill up the rest of los angeles that's roughly a third more nuclear power than all of france creates so the next time they tell you they're on to something clearly they're not so
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 652.78 656.97 <o,f0,male> all this and makes the first mini computer it shows up at places like mit
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 670.95 680.07 <o,f0,male> and many of the principles of gaming today were worked out dec knew a good think about wasting time it shipped every one of its computers with that game
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 688.78 698.84 <o,f0,male> a new technology has confounded radio men and movie moguls and they're quite certain that television is about to do them in in fact despair is in the air
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 699.33 707.92 <o,f0,male> and a quote that sounds largely reminiscent from everything i've been reading all week rca had david sarnoff who basically commercialized radio
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 708.26 714.23 <o,f0,male> said this i don't say that radio networks must die every effort has been made and will continue to be made
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 714.43 723.69 <o,f0,male> to find a new pattern new selling arrangements and new types of programs that may arrest the declining revenues it may yet be possible to eke out a poor existence for radio
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 724.05 736.02 <o,f0,male> but i don't know how and of course as the computer industry develops interactively producers in the emerging tv business actually hit on the same idea and they fake
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 750.20 758.79 <o,f0,female> you all know how to get your magic windows up on the set you just get them out first of all get your winky dink kits out put out your magic window and your erasing glove and rub it like
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 779.52 794.04 <o,f0,male> dawn of interactive tv and you may have noticed they wanted to sell you the winky dink kits those are the winky dink crayons i know what you're saying pete i could use any ordinary open source crayon why do i have to buy theirs i assure you that's not the case
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 794.64 807.78 <o,f0,male> turns out they told us directly that these are the only crayons you should ever use with your winky dink magic window other crayons may discolor or hurt the window this proprietary principle of vendor lock in
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 808.77 815.05 <o,f0,male> would go on to be perfected with great success as one of the enduring principles of windowing systems everywhere
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 815.85 824.99 <o,f0,male> it led to lawsuits federal investigations and lots of repercussions and that's a scandal we won 't discuss today
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 825.33 838.21 <o,f0,male> but we will discuss this scandal because this man jack berry the host of winky dink went on to become the host of twenty one one of the most important quiz shows ever and it was rigged and it became unraveled when this man
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 838.74 848.46 <o,f0,male> charles van doren was outed after an unnatural winning streak ending berry 's career and actually ending the career of a lot of people at cbs it turns out there was a lot to learn
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 872.93 885.22 <o,f0,male> the audience can become involved in the actual process of making the ad then it's happy it's like the old quiz shows they were great tv because it gave the audience a role something to do
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 886.32 889.41 <o,f0,male> they were horrified when they discovered they'd really been left out all the time
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 891.66 894.89 <o,f0,male> this was a horrible misunderstanding of tv on the part of the
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 896.22 906.74 <o,f0,male> know mcluhan talked about the global village if you substitute the word blogosphere of the internet today it is very true that his understanding is probably very enlightening now let 's listen in to
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 907.33 914.77 <o,f0,male> the global village is a world in which you don't necessarily have harmony you have extreme concern with everybody else's business
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 915.98 921.82 <o,f0,male> much involvement in everybody else's life it's a sort of anne landers column writ large and
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 923.38 936.05 <o,f0,male> doesn't necessarily mean harmony and peace and quiet but it does mean huge involvement in everybody else's affairs and so the global village is as big as a planet and as small as a
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 946.85 956.84 <o,f0,male> you know the expression of technology reflects the people and the time of the culture it was built in and when i say that code expresses our hopes and aspirations it's not just a joke about
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 957.60 964.31 <o,f0,male> it's actually what we do but for this part of the story i'd actually like to throw it to america 's leading technology correspondent john
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 978.35 993.27 <o,f0,male> in the midst of revolution in the streets and rock and roll concerts in the parks a group of researchers led by people like john mccarthy a computer scientist at the stanford artificial intelligence lab and doug engelbart a computer scientist at sri changed the world
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1022.97 1032.19 <o,f0,male> this was a remarkable place at a remarkable time and into that ferment came the microprocessor i think it was that interaction that led to personal computing
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1032.46 1040.89 <o,f0,male> they saw these tools that were controlled by the establishment as ones that could actually be liberated and put to use by these communities that they were trying to build
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1041.74 1053.11 <o,f0,male> and most importantly they had this ethos of sharing information i think these ideas are difficult to understand because when you're trapped in one paradigm the next paradigm is always like
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1053.58 1065.28 <o,f0,male> a science fiction universe it makes no sense the stories were so compelling that i decided to write a book about them the title of the book is what the dormouse said how the sixties counterculture shaped the personal computer industry
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1143.78 1156.23 <o,f0,male> any kind of picture or piece of text or data across a file system and we had no way of explaining it there was no metaphor was it a database a prototyping tool a scripted language heck it was everything
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1156.70 1167.72 <o,f0,male> so we ended up writing a marketing brochure we asked a question about how the mind works and we let our customers play the role of so many blind men filling out the elephant a few years later we
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1168.76 1179.03 <o,f0,male> we then hit on the idea of explaining to people the secret of how do you get the content you want the way you want it and the easy way here 's the apple marketing video
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1179.20 1184.35 <o,f0,male> you'll be pleased to know i'm sure that there are several ways to create a hypercard interactive video
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1184.94 1193.23 <o,f0,male> the most involved method is to go ahead and produce your own videodisc as well as build your own hypercard stacks by far the simplest method
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1193.53 1203.92 <o,f0,male> is to buy a pre made videodisc and hypercard stacks from a commercial supplier the method we illustrate in this video uses a pre made videodisc but creates custom hypercard stacks
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1210.38 1220.44 <o,f0,male> i hope you realize how subversive that is that's like a dick cheney speech you think he 's a nice balding guy but he 's just declared war on the content business find the commercial stuff
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1220.82 1228.80 <o,f0,male> mash it up tell the story your way now as long as we confine this to the education market and a personal matter between the computer and the file system that's fine
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1229.06 1239.38 <o,f0,male> but as you can see it was about to leap out and upset jack valenti and a lot of other people by the way speaking of the filing system it never occurred to us that these hyperlinks could go beyond the local area network
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1240.26 1247.12 <o,f0,male> a few years later tim berners lee worked that out it became a killer app of links and today of course we call that the world wide web
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1261.02 1267.89 <o,f0,male> he was working on a book and i was working on a video to help him kind of explain where we were all heading and how to popularize all this
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1268.14 1277.22 <o,f0,male> we were plenty aware that we were messing with media and on the surface it looks like we predicted a lot of the right things but we also missed an awful lot let 's take a look
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1297.68 1299.99 <o,f0,male> of the man made world all
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1316.84 1320.16 <o,f0,male> the digital highway arrived in america 's living rooms late in the
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1324.18 1328.55 <o,f0,male> let us recall the pioneers who made this technical marvel possible
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1329.33 1335.68 <o,f0,male> the digital highway would follow the rutted trail first blazed by alexander graham bell
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1348.80 1356.79 <o,f0,male> by the prospects of mass communication and making big bucks on advertising david sarnoff commercializes radio
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1357.08 1360.11 <o,f0,male> never had scientists been put under such pressure and
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1375.98 1380.75 <o,f0,male> thirty nine the radio corporation of america introduced television
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1381.46 1384.69 <o,f0,male> never had scientists been put under such pressure and
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1391.79 1393.95 <o,f0,male> further stimulus came with the de regulation of
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1396.98 1400.02 <o,f0,male> and the re regulation of the cable television industry
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1401.83 1407.57 <o,f0,male> to build this this cable industry now the broadcasters want some of our money i mean it's ridiculous
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1409.84 1416.56 <o,f0,male> once the unwieldy tools of accountants and other geeks escaped the backrooms to enter the media
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1417.92 1420.13 <o,f0,male> world and all its culture reduced to
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1428.39 1437.74 <o,f0,male> finally four great industrial sectors combined telecommunications entertainment computing and everything else
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1438.31 1446.46 <o,f0,male> we'll see channels for the gourmet and we'll see channels for the pet lover next on the gourmet pet channel decorating birthday cakes for
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1447.44 1450.30 <o,f0,male> all of industry was in play as investors
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1459.20 1459.74 <o,f0,male> and
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1516.64 1529.21 <o,f0,male> you know you missed we missed the internet the long tail the role of the audience open systems social networks it just goes to show how tough it is to come up with the right uses of media thomas edison had the same problem he wrote a list of
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1529.65 1538.42 <o,f0,male> what the phonograph might be good for when he invented it and kind of only one of his ideas turned out to have been the right early idea well you know where we're going on from here
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1539.03 1546.65 <o,f0,male> we come into the era of the dot com the world wide web and i don't need to tell you about that because we all went through that bubble together but
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1546.92 1555.36 <o,f0,male> when we emerge from this and what we call web two point zero things actually are quite different and i think it's the reason that that tv 's so challenging internet one was about pages
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1555.79 1565.88 <o,f0,male> now it's about people it's a customer it's an audience it's a person who 's participating it's the formidable thing that is changing entertainment now
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1566.08 1568.33 <o,f0,male> because it gave the audience a role something to do
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1569.19 1579.29 <o,f0,male> in my own company technorati we see something like sixty seven thousand blog posts an hour come in that's about two thousand seven hundred fresh connective links
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1579.82 1588.70 <o,f0,male> across about one hundred and twelve million blogs that are out there and it's no wonder that as we head into the writers strike odd things happen you know it reminds me of that old saw in hollywood
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1590.49 1601.08 <o,f0,male> a writer i now think a network boss is anyone who has a cable modem but it's not a joke this is a real headline websites attract striking writers operators of sites like
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1603.14 1610.34 <o,f0,male> could benefit from labor disputes meanwhile you have the tv bloggers going out on strike in sympathy with the television writers
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1621.28 1627.82 <o,f0,male> to show you how schizophrenic this all is here 's the head of myspace or fox interactive
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1628.22 1633.85 <o,f0,male> a news corp company being asked well with the writers strike isn't this going to hurt news corp and help you
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1635.83 1642.56 <o,f0,male> yeah i think there's an opportunity as the strike continues there's an opportunity for more people to experience video on places like myspace tv
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1643.26 1645.77 <o,f0,male> but then he remembers he works for rupert murdoch
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1654.98 1664.61 <o,f0,male> one of the great things that's going on here is the globalization of content really is happening here is a clip from the video from a piece of animation
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1664.81 1672.79 <o,f0,male> that was written by a writer in hollywood animation worked out in israel farmed out to croatia and india and it's now an international series
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1686.72 1688.88 <o,f0,male> we get word the terrorist threat is over
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1697.71 1707.02 <o,f0,male> the company that created this aniboom is an interesting example of where this is headed traditional tv animation costs say between eighty thousand and ten thousand dollars a minute
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1717.91 1725.47 <o,f0,male> what the entertainment business is struggling with the world of brands is figuring out for example nike now understands that nike plus
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1725.84 1735.07 <o,f0,male> is not just a device in it's shoe it's a network to hook its customers together and the head of marketing at nike says people are coming to our site an average of three times a week
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1743.23 1752.29 <o,f0,male> head of marketing says we 're not in the business of keeping media companies alive we're in the business of connecting with consumers and media companies realize the audience is important also
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1752.57 1767.36 <o,f0,male> here 's a man announcing the new market watch from dow jones powered one hundred percent by the user experience on the home page user generated content married up with traditional content it turns out you have a bigger audience and more interest if you hook up with them or as geoffrey moore once told me
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1767.69 1775.53 <o,f0,male> it's intellectual curiosity that's the trade that brands need in the age of the blogosphere and i think this is beginning to happen in the entertainment business
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1789.97 1790.76 <o,f0,female> the
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1796.66 1798.82 <o,f0,male> so to wrap up i'd love to throw it
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1799.69 1805.79 <o,f0,male> to marshall mcluhan who forty years ago was dealing with audiences that were going through just as much change
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1806.21 1815.34 <o,f0,male> and i think that today traditional hollywood and the writers are framing this perhaps in the way that it was being framed before but i don't need to tell you this let 's throw it back to him
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1816.13 1824.67 <o,f0,male> we are in the middle of a tremendous clash between the old and the new the medium does things
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1825.54 1828.72 <o,f0,male> and they are always completely unaware of this
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1830.96 1835.76 <o,f0,male> don't really notice the new medium that is wrapping them up they think of the old medium
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1836.52 1840.48 <o,f0,male> because the old medium is always the content of the new medium
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1841.16 1843.74 <o,f0,male> as movies tend to be the content of tv
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1860.55 1868.70 <o,f0,male> i think it's a great time of enthrallment there's been more raw dna of communications and media thrown out there content is moving from shows
PeterHirshberg_2007P 1 PeterHirshberg_2007P 1878.55 1890.48 <o,f0,male> and whereas television may have gotten beat up what's getting built is a really exciting new form of communication and we kind of have the merger of the two industries and a new way of thinking to look at it thanks very much
