StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 12.90 14.23 <o,f0,male> to know that
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 24.12 25.09 <o,f0,male> so if you
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 30.65 32.75 <o,f0,male> drug dealer in the height of the crack cocaine
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 41.79 44.93 <o,f0,male> women you know you name it jewelry bling bling it had it all
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 50.24 51.00 <o,f0,male> ten years of research
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 51.90 61.46 <o,f0,male> a unique opportunity to go inside a gang to see the actual books the financial records of the gang that the answer turns out not to be that being in the gang
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 73.08 77.32 <o,f0,male> three things i want to do first i want to explain how and why
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 78.08 80.64 <o,f0,male> crack cocaine had such a profound influence
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 81.47 82.54 <o,f0,male> inner city gangs
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 88.22 93.86 <o,f0,male> somebody like me came to be able to see the inner workings of a gang it's an interesting story i think
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 95.49 103.77 <o,f0,male> i want to tell you in a very superficial way about some of the things we found when we actually got to look at the financial records the books of the gang so before i do that
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 106.54 115.75 <o,f0,male> which is that this presentation has been rated r by the motion picture association of america it contains adult themes adult language
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 131.93 140.85 <o,f0,male> so let me start by talking about crack cocaine and how it transformed the gang and to do that you have to actually go back to a time before crack cocaine in the early eighties and look at
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 151.51 154.41 <o,f0,male> a lot of power and you got to beat people up you got a lot of
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 156.07 164.22 <o,f0,male> respect but there was no money in it ok the gang had no way to make money and they couldn't charge dues to the people in the gang because the people in the gang didn't have any money
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 175.32 187.84 <o,f0,male> great product powdered cocaine but you've got to know rich white people and most of the inner city gang members didn't know any rich white people they couldn't sell to that market you couldn't really do petty crime either it turns out petty crime 's a terrible way to make a living so as a result
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 188.82 196.64 <o,f0,male> a gang leader you had you know power it's a pretty good life but the thing was in the end you were living at home with your mother and so
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 206.86 209.17 <o,f0,male> and in the words of malcolm gladwell
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 209.71 213.31 <o,f0,male> crack cocaine was the extra chunky version of
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 214.38 214.96 <o,f0,male> the
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 218.31 221.04 <o,f0,male> have time to talk about it today but if you think about it
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 221.80 229.91 <o,f0,male> i would say that in the last twenty five years of every invention or innovation that's occurred in this country the biggest one in terms of impact on the well being
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 230.55 243.92 <o,f0,male> of people who live in the inner city was crack cocaine and for the worse not for the better but for the worse it had a huge impact on life so what was it about crack cocaine it was a brilliant way of getting the brain high
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 255.24 257.15 <o,f0,male> and it turned out there was this audience
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 257.95 264.34 <o,f0,male> didn't know it wanted crack cocaine but when it came it really did and it was a perfect drug you could sell for
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 264.94 276.08 <o,f0,male> the cocaine that went into it for a dollar sell it for five dollars highly addictive the high was very short so for fifteen minutes you get this great high and then when you come down all you want to do
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 276.54 287.02 <o,f0,male> get high again it created a wonderful market and for the people who were there running the gang it was a great way seemingly to make a lot of money at least for the people
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 288.58 296.22 <o,f0,male> this is where we enter the picture not really me i'm really a bit player in all this my co author sudhir venkatesh is the main character so
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 297.13 297.86 <o,f0,male> was a
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 308.40 321.54 <o,f0,male> he had spent following the grateful dead and in his own words he looked like a freak he 's a south asian very dark skinned south asian big man and he had hair in his words down to his ass
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 323.34 334.55 <o,f0,male> defied all kinds of boundaries was he black or white was he man or woman he was really a curious sight to be seen so he showed up at the university of chicago and the famous sociologist william julius wilson
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 340.88 347.24 <o,f0,male> and he took one look at sudhir who was going to go do some surveys for him and decided he knew exactly the place to send him which was to one of the
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 403.20 407.39 <o,f0,male> but they did say well ok let 's hear your questions
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 408.58 414.55 <o,f0,male> so i kid you not the first question on the survey that he was sent to ask was how do you
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 419.55 424.46 <o,f0,male> makes you wonder about academics ok so the choice of
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 431.31 433.91 <o,f0,male> found out is in fact that the real answer was the following
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 438.53 443.88 <o,f0,male> the survey was not in the end going to be what got sudhir off the hook he was held hostage overnight
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 456.36 457.32 <o,f0,male> home
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 459.25 462.05 <o,f0,male> and you and i probably faced with the situation
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 464.15 466.77 <o,f0,male> well i guess i'm going to write my dissertation on the grateful dead
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 476.58 484.43 <o,f0,male> hey guys i had so much fun hanging out with you last night i wonder if i could do it again tonight and that was the beginning of what turned out to be a beautiful relationship
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 485.11 491.59 <o,f0,male> that involved sudhir living in the housing project on and off for ten years hanging out in crack houses going to jail
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 500.71 514.87 <o,f0,male> but ultimately the story has a happy ending for sudhir who became one of the most respected sociologists in the country and especially for me as i sat in my office with my excel spreadsheet open waiting for sudhir to come and deliver to me the latest load
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 515.42 516.86 <o,f0,male> would get
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 521.11 524.21 <o,f0,male> one of the most unequal co authoring relationships ever
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 525.31 529.88 <o,f0,male> but i was glad to be the beneficiary of it so what do we find
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 530.77 543.84 <o,f0,male> what do we find in the gang well let me say one thing we really got access to everybody in the gang we got an inside look at the gang from the very bottom up to the very top they trusted sudhir
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 544.68 551.88 <o,f0,male> in ways that really no academic has ever or really anybody any outsider has ever earned the trust of these gangs
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 553.13 566.92 <o,f0,male> to the point where they actually opened up what was most interesting for me their books their financial records that they kept and they made them available to us and we not only could study them but we could ask them questions about what was in them so if i have to kind of summarize very quickly in the short time i have
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 567.78 575.95 <o,f0,male> what sort of the bottom line of what i take away from the gang is is that if i had to draw a parallel between the gang and any other organization
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 576.74 579.31 <o,f0,male> would be that the gang is just like mcdonald 's
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 580.38 593.71 <o,f0,male> in a lot of different respects the restaurant mcdonald 's so first in one way which isn't maybe the most interesting way but it's a good way to start is in the way it's organized the hierarchy of the gang the way it looks so here 's what the org chart of the gang looks like
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 607.72 614.03 <o,f0,male> and sudhir says it's not like these guys had a very sophisticated kind of view of
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 614.96 624.46 <o,f0,male> like what happened in american corporate life but they had seen movies like wall street and they kind of had learned a little bit about what it was like to be in the real world
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 624.77 632.49 <o,f0,male> now below that board of directors you've got essentially what are regional vp 's people who control say the south side of chicago or the west side of chicago now
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 633.28 644.34 <o,f0,male> sudhir got to know very well the guy who had the unfortunate assignment of trying to take the iowa franchise which it turned out for this black gang was not one of the more brilliant financial endeavors that
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 646.34 653.82 <o,f0,male> that really makes the gang seem like mcdonald 's is its franchisees that the guys who are running you know the local
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 654.60 663.21 <o,f0,male> gangs the four square block by four square block areas they're just like the guys in some sense who are running the mcdonald 's they are the entrepreneurs they get
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 663.51 672.34 <o,f0,male> the exclusive property rights to control the drug selling they get the name of the gang behind them for merchandising and marketing
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 684.84 690.62 <o,f0,male> these are the teenagers typically who 'd be standing out on the street corner selling the drugs extremely dangerous work
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 694.01 703.90 <o,f0,male> important to note that almost all of the weight all of the people in this organization are at the bottom ok just like mcdonald 's so in some sense the foot soldiers are a lot like the people who
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 704.43 714.78 <o,f0,male> are taking your order at mcdonald 's and indeed it's not just by chance that they're like them in fact in these neighborhoods they'd be the same people so the same kids who are working in the gang were actually at the very same time
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 715.21 722.99 <o,f0,male> they would typically be working part time at a place like mcdonald 's which already i think foreshadows the main result that i've talked about about what a crappy job
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 723.22 730.32 <o,f0,male> it was being in the gang because obviously if being in the gang were such a wonderful lucrative job why in the world would these guys moonlight
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 731.85 740.24 <o,f0,male> so what do the wages look like so you might be surprised but based on the actual you know being able to talk to them and to see their records this is what it looks like in terms of the
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 753.36 763.72 <o,f0,male> fiction it's fact there was very little money in the gang especially at the bottom now if you managed to rise up say and be that local leader the guy who 's the equivalent of the mcdonald 's franchisee
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 764.63 771.23 <o,f0,male> hundred thousand dollars a year and that in some ways was the best job you could hope to get if you were growing up in one of these neighborhoods
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 771.78 780.42 <o,f0,male> as a young black male if you managed to rise to the very top two hundred thousand or four hundred thousand dollars a year is what you'd hope to make truly you would be a great success story
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 781.71 789.01 <o,f0,male> parts of this is that indeed among the many other ramifications of crack cocaine is that the most talented individuals
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 789.47 802.96 <o,f0,male> in these communities this is what they were striving for they weren't trying to make it in legitimate ways because there were no legitimate channels out this was the best way out and it actually was the right choice probably to try to make it out
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 811.61 818.73 <o,f0,male> why is it such a bad job well the reason it's such a bad job is that there's somebody shooting at you a lot of the time so
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 819.82 825.93 <o,f0,male> the death rates we found in our gang and admittedly this was not really sort of a standard situation this was a
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 826.79 835.45 <o,f0,male> time of intense violence of a lot of gang wars as this gang actually became quite successful but there were costs and so the death rate
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 836.02 845.33 <o,f0,male> not to mention the rate of being arrested sent to prison being wounded the death rate in our sample was seven percent per person per year
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 845.70 855.60 <o,f0,male> in the gang for four years you expect to die with about a twenty five percent likelihood that is about as high as you can get so for comparison 's purposes
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 856.13 862.15 <o,f0,male> think about some other walk of life where you may expect might be extremely risky like let 's say that you were a
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 863.07 865.35 <o,f0,male> you were convicted of murder and you're sent to death row
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 866.22 871.55 <o,f0,male> turns out the death rates on death row from all causes including execution two percent a
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 881.16 886.81 <o,f0,male> those of you who believe that a death penalty 's going to have an enormous deterrent effect on crime now
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 888.01 895.67 <o,f0,male> to give you a sense of just how bad the inner city was during crack and i'm not really focusing on the negatives but really there's another story to tell you there
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 896.86 903.55 <o,f0,male> if you look at the death rates just of random young black males growing up in the inner city in the united states the death rates
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 904.29 912.15 <o,f0,male> during crack were about one percent that's extremely high and this is violent death it's unbelievable in some sense to put it into perspective if you compare this
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 913.03 920.97 <o,f0,male> to the soldiers in iraq for instance right now fighting the war zero point five percent so in some very literal way
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 921.55 931.74 <o,f0,male> the young black men who were growing up in this country were living in a war zone very much in the sense of the way that the soldiers over in iraq are fighting in a war
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 938.53 939.61 <o,f0,male> out on a street corner
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 947.34 948.88 <o,f0,female> i think there are a couple answers
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 955.96 957.87 <o,f0,male> used to be the gang was a rite of passage
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 958.22 962.28 <o,f0,male> that the young people controlled the gang that as you got older you dropped out of the gang
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 963.78 969.56 <o,f0,male> so what happened was the people who happened to be in the right place at the right time the people who happened to be leading the gang
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 970.75 973.31 <o,f0,male> in the mid to late eighties
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 973.82 974.84 <o,f0,male> became very very
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 975.72 984.17 <o,f0,male> and so the logical thing to think was that well the next generation so they're going to age out of the gang like everybody else has and the next generation is going to take over and get the
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 985.02 992.71 <o,f0,male> so there are striking similarities i think to the internet boom right the first set of people in silicon valley got very very rich and then all of my friends
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 993.26 997.47 <o,f0,male> said maybe i should go do that too and they were willing to work very cheap
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 997.99 1009.52 <o,f0,male> for stock options that never came in some sense that's what happened exactly to the set of people we were looking at is that they were willing to start at the bottom just like say
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 1009.94 1017.65 <o,f0,male> a lawyer at a law firm a first year lawyer is wiling to start at the bottom work eighty hour weeks for not that much money because they think they're going to make partner but what happened was
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 1017.89 1026.53 <o,f0,male> the rules changed and they never got to make partner indeed the same people who were running all of the major gangs in the late nineteen eighties are still running the major gangs in chicago today
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 1026.69 1033.91 <o,f0,male> they never passed on any of the wealth so everybody got stuck at that three fifty an hour job and it turned out to be a disaster
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 1034.89 1046.24 <o,f0,male> the other thing the gang was very very good at was marketing and trickery and so for instance one thing the gang would do is you know the gang leaders would have big entourages and they'd drive fancy cars
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 1046.69 1053.91 <o,f0,male> and have fancy jewelry so what sudhir eventually realized as he hung out with them more is that really they didn't own those cars they just leased them
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 1064.77 1072.62 <o,f0,male> and really they did all sorts of things to trick the young people into thinking what a great deal the gang was going to be so for instance they would give a fourteen year old kid
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 1073.07 1082.39 <o,f0,male> give him a whole you know roll of bills to hold that fourteen year old kid would say oh well you know he would say to his friends hey look at all the money i got in the gang it wasn't his money
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 1082.70 1090.24 <o,f0,male> until he spent it and then essentially he was in debt to the gang and was sort of an indentured servant for a while so i have a couple minutes let me do
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 1091.49 1093.20 <o,f0,male> i hadn't thought i'd have time to do
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 1093.77 1099.59 <o,f0,male> which is to talk about what we learned more generally about economics from the study of
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 1100.99 1113.26 <o,f0,male> so economists tend to talk in technical words often our theories fail quite miserably when we go to the data but actually what's kind of interesting is that in this setting it turned out that some of the economic theories that worked
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 1131.83 1142.65 <o,f0,male> one which is more unpleasant than the other that's what you call a compensating differential it's why we think garbage men might be paid more than people who work in parks ok so in the words of one of the members of the gang i think
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 1180.22 1188.22 <o,f0,male> game has a nash equilibrium here 's the translation you get from the gang member they're talking about the decision of why they don't go shoot
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 1201.58 1210.67 <o,f0,male> if we start shooting around there in the other gang 's territory nobody and i mean you dig it nobody going to step on their turf but we gotta be careful because they can shoot around here too and then we all
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 1223.54 1229.11 <o,f0,male> always got paid ok no matter how bad it was economically he always got himself
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 1229.56 1238.85 <o,f0,male> so we had some theories related to cash flow and lack of access to capital markets and things like that but then we asked the gang member well why is it you always get paid and your workers don't always get paid his
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 1249.86 1253.36 <o,f0,male> often pay themselves million dollar bonuses even when companies are losing a lot of money
