DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 12.80 20.69 <o,f0,male> morning my name is david rose i am a serial entrepreneur turned serial investor and by the use of pitching
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 33.06 40.02 <o,f0,male> into companies who have been pitching me with powerpoint presentations so i think it's safe to say i know a little bit about the process of pitching
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 50.04 60.55 <o,f0,male> there are obviously all kinds of things there are business models and there are financials and there are markets and there is that overall of all the things that you have to do what is the single most important thing the vc is going to be investing
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 62.85 66.29 <o,f0,male> in somebody what people people
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 66.92 77.22 <o,f0,male> that's it you are the person and so therefore the entire purpose of a vc pitch is to convince them that you are the entrepreneur in whom they are going to invest their money and make a lot of money in return
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 77.67 86.30 <o,f0,male> now how do you do this you can't just walk up and say you know hi i'm a really good guy and a good girl and you should really invest in me right so in the course of your vc pitch
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 86.46 96.72 <o,f0,male> you have a very few minutes and most of vc pitches most angel pitches about fifteen minutes most vc pitches should be less than half an hour people 's attention span after eighteen minutes begins to drop off tests have shown
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 97.02 108.00 <o,f0,male> so in that eighteen minutes or ten minutes or five minutes you have to convey a whole bunch of different characteristics you actually have to convey about ten different characteristics while you're standing up there what's the single most important thing you've got to
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 109.89 110.21 <o,f0,male> what
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 111.97 122.14 <o,f0,male> and that's a straight line we got right over there and i didn't even prompt him you're right integrity because that's the key thing i would much rather invest in somebody you know take a chance on somebody who i know is straight
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 143.57 150.33 <o,f0,male> to convey passion if you're not passionate about your own company why on earth should anyone else be passionate why should they put more money into your company if you're not passionate about
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 150.85 157.70 <o,f0,male> so integrity and passion the single most important things out there then there are a whole panoply of other things that you've got to do to wrap up in this package that you're presenting to
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 169.24 175.50 <o,f0,male> love to fund serial entrepreneurs because even if you didn't do it right the first time you've learned the lessons which are going to stand you in very good stead the next
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 185.40 194.63 <o,f0,male> next up is knowledge if you're telling me you're going to be the great developer of the map of the human genome you'd better know what a human genome is i mean i want you to have domain expertise
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 215.85 229.57 <o,f0,male> but you know not everybody has all these skills there are very few people who have the full set of skills that it takes to run a company so what else do you require well leadership you've got to be able to convince us that you either have developed a team that has all those factors in it or else you can
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 248.60 260.17 <o,f0,male> that you are going to die if you have to with your very last breath with your fingernails scratching as they drag you out you're going to keep my money alive and you're going to make more money out of it so i don't want somebody who 's going to cut and run at the first opportunity because bad things happen
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 260.50 273.43 <o,f0,male> never been an angel or a venture funded company where bad things didn't happen so i want to know that you're committed to be there to the very end you've got to have vision you've got to be able to see where this is going i don't want another me too product i want somebody who knows who can change the world out there
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 287.89 302.18 <o,f0,male> you're asking for my money not just because it's my money but because it's me you need to be coachable so i need to know that you have the ability to listen we've had a lot of experience people who are vcs or angels investing in you have had experience and they'd like to know that you want to hear that experience
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 311.52 321.60 <o,f0,male> so think about your pitch as a timeline it starts off you walk in the door they know nothing at all whatsoever about you and you can take them on an emotional all pitches or all sales presentations are emotional at some
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 322.01 329.63 <o,f0,male> you can go up you can go down right and it goes from beginning to end you walk in the door so the first thing you've got to do the overall you know arc of your presentation
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 329.89 337.44 <o,f0,male> it's got to start like a rocket you've got maybe ten seconds between ten and thirty seconds depending on how long the pitch is to get their attention
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 353.72 366.10 <o,f0,male> and then from there you've got to take them on a very solid steady upward path right from beginning to end and everything has got to be reinforcing this and you've got to get better and better and better and better and it's working up to the very end and then at the very end you've got
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 367.79 376.75 <o,f0,male> you want to be able to get them to such an emotional high that they are ready to write you a check throw money at you right there before you leave okay so how do you do that well first of all logical progression
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 377.20 384.77 <o,f0,male> any time you go backwards any time you skip a step imagine walking up a staircase where some of the treads are missing or the heights are different
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 398.13 410.36 <o,f0,male> also got to let me know that there are touchstones you want to tie in to the rest of the world out there so for example if you reference companies i've heard of or basic items in your business i want to know about them things that i can relate to
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 483.68 493.19 <o,f0,male> sales of x y or z are ten million dollars and the next slide or five slides later they're five million dollars well one may have been gross sales one may have been net sales but i want to know that all the numbers make sense together
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 505.27 514.14 <o,f0,male> the best way to do this stuff is to look at our betters look at people who have done this before so let 's look at the most successful technology executive in the business and see how a presentation goes
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 538.95 546.36 <o,f0,male> this is steve jobs so you know our great these wonderful long bullet points a whole list of things you know good no they're not the long bullet points are bad
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 546.69 553.81 <o,f0,male> what's good short short bullet points but you know what even better than short bullet points are no bullet points just give me the headline over here
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 563.14 573.31 <o,f0,male> the image a picture 's worth a thousand words you look at the image and you see that and you drop the whole thing and then you come back to me and you're focused on me and why i'm such a great guy and why you want to invest in me and why this whole thing makes sense
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 573.75 587.21 <o,f0,male> so with that said we only have a very very short time so let 's run through the things you've got to include in your presentation well first of all start out none of these big long titled slides with blah blah blah blah blah blah and i'm presenting to so and so such and such a date i know the day i know who i am i know you're presenting i don't need all that
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 597.98 607.38 <o,f0,male> and then you want to give me a quick business overview this is not a five minute pitch this is you know two sentences we build widgets for the x y z market or we sell services to help somebody do x you know whatever
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 607.78 618.22 <o,f0,male> and that is like the picture on the outside of a jigsaw puzzle box that lets me know the context it gives me the armature for the whole thing you're going to be going through and it lets me put everything else in relation to something you've already told me
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 635.34 643.86 <o,f0,male> show me a screenshot of your website you know don't do a live demo no never do a live demo do a canned demo or do something that lets me know why people are going to buy whatever it is
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 644.28 651.41 <o,f0,male> i want to know now that i know what you're selling tell me how you make money on it for every x you sell you get y you do your services of
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 727.29 734.94 <o,f0,male> then comes the ask this is where you tell me how much you actually want to get you're looking for five million at what kind of valuation two million at one hundred thousand
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 736.06 747.96 <o,f0,male> the money in so far who invested i hope you invested personally because i'm following on if you can't invest in your own thing why should i invest in it so i like to know if you have friends and family or angel investors in there or you've had more vcs before what's the capital structure up until this point
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 792.53 800.69 <o,f0,male> i'm looking actually at a special version of powerpoint over here which shows me the slides ahead the slides behind my notes from here so i can see what's going on
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 822.56 830.66 <o,f0,male> always use presenter mode or ovation or presenter tools because it lets you know exactly where you're going it helps you pace yourself it gives you a timer so we end on time and
DavidSRose_2007U 1 DavidSRose_2007U 861.84 873.03 <o,f0,male> never ever look at the screen you're making a connection with your audience over here and you always want to do a one on one connection the screen should come up visually behind you and supplement what you're doing instead of replace you and that is how to pitch
