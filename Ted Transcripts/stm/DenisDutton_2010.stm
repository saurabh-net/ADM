DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 17.38 22.15 <o,f0,male> and to talk to you about a subject dear to my heart which is beauty
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 23.45 28.16 <o,f0,male> i do the philosophy of art aesthetics actually for a living
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 28.71 35.46 <o,f0,male> i try to figure out intellectually philosophically psychologically what the experience of beauty
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 36.24 45.18 <o,f0,male> what sensibly can be said about it and how people go off the rails in trying to understand it now this is an extremely complicated subject
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 45.49 55.63 <o,f0,male> in part because the things that we call beautiful are so different i mean just think of the sheer variety a baby 's face berlioz 's harold in italy
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 56.19 58.83 <o,f0,male> movies like the wizard of oz or the plays of

DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 72.59 85.88 <o,f0,male> a jane austen novel fred astaire dancing across the screen this brief list includes human beings natural landforms works of art and skilled human actions
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 86.39 95.78 <o,f0,male> an account that explains the presence of beauty in everything on this list is not going to be easy i can however give you at least a taste
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 96.08 107.83 <o,f0,male> of what i regard as the most powerful theory of beauty we yet have and we get it not from a philosopher of art not from a postmodern art theorist or a bigwig art critic
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 109.01 114.71 <o,f0,male> this theory comes from an expert on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 117.82 118.79 <o,f0,male> and you know who i mean
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 122.72 129.27 <o,f0,male> of course a lot of people think they already know the proper answer to the question what is beauty
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 131.17 135.41 <o,f0,male> it's in the eye of the beholder it's whatever moves you personally
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 136.07 143.87 <o,f0,male> or as some people especially academics prefer beauty is in the culturally conditioned eye of the beholder
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 153.67 159.91 <o,f0,male> taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures with great ease
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 174.94 180.02 <o,f0,male> or just think about american jazz or american movies they go everywhere
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 181.31 189.44 <o,f0,male> there are many differences among the arts but there are also universal cross cultural aesthetic pleasures and values
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 190.35 194.22 <o,f0,male> how can we explain this universality
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 195.55 202.85 <o,f0,male> the best answer lies in trying to reconstruct a darwinian evolutionary history of our artistic and aesthetic tastes
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 203.56 212.75 <o,f0,male> we need to reverse engineer our present artistic tastes and preferences and explain how they came to be engraved in our minds
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 213.16 223.88 <o,f0,male> by the actions of both our prehistoric largely pleistocene environments where we became fully human but also by the social situations in which we evolved
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 224.88 236.18 <o,f0,male> this reverse engineering can also enlist help from the human record preserved in prehistory i mean fossils cave paintings and so forth
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 236.71 246.69 <o,f0,male> and it should take into account what we know of the aesthetic interests of isolated hunter gatherer bands that survived into the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 247.92 251.21 <o,f0,male> now i personally have no doubt whatsoever
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 251.65 259.82 <o,f0,male> that the experience of beauty with its emotional intensity and pleasure belongs to our evolved human psychology
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 260.41 269.61 <o,f0,male> the experience of beauty is one component in a whole series of darwinian adaptations beauty is an adaptive effect
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 269.93 278.50 <o,f0,male> which we extend and intensify in the creation and enjoyment of works of art and entertainment
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 280.42 290.57 <o,f0,male> as many of you will know evolution operates by two main primary mechanisms the first of these is natural selection that's random mutation and selective retention
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 291.24 301.04 <o,f0,male> along with our basic anatomy and physiology the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails natural selection also explains many basic revulsions
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 301.54 308.86 <o,f0,male> such as the horrid smell of rotting meat or fears such as the fear of snakes or standing close to the edge of a cliff
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 310.10 313.04 <o,f0,male> natural selection also explains pleasures
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 315.28 325.17 <o,f0,male> our liking for sweet fat and proteins which in turn explains a lot of popular foods from ripe fruits through chocolate malts and barbecued ribs
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 326.48 329.84 <o,f0,male> the other great principle of evolution is sexual selection
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 330.41 332.31 <o,f0,male> and it operates very differently
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 333.35 344.70 <o,f0,male> the peacock 's magnificent tail is the most famous example of this it did not evolve for natural survival in fact it goes against natural survival
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 345.40 355.63 <o,f0,male> no the peacock 's tail results from the mating choices made by peahens it's quite a familiar story it's women who actually push history forward
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 360.62 364.41 <o,f0,male> tail was beautiful in the eyes of the peahen he actually used that word
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 365.86 369.04 <o,f0,male> now keeping these ideas firmly in mind
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 369.43 373.88 <o,f0,male> we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 374.46 388.36 <o,f0,male> of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination even obsession in order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 389.92 395.91 <o,f0,male> beauty is nature 's way of acting at a distance so to speak
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 397.26 404.04 <o,f0,male> you can't expect to eat an adaptively beneficial landscape it would hardly do to your baby or your lover
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 404.74 414.33 <o,f0,male> so evolution 's trick is to make them beautiful to have them exert a kind of magnetism to give you the pleasure of simply looking
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 423.15 430.08 <o,f0,male> people in very different cultures all over the world tend to like a particular kind of landscape
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 430.44 438.99 <o,f0,male> a landscape that just happens to be similar to the pleistocene savannas where we evolved this landscape shows up today on calendars
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 439.23 448.77 <o,f0,male> on postcards in the design of golf courses and public parks and in in gold framed pictures that hang in living rooms from new york
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 451.08 459.52 <o,f0,male> it's a kind of hudson river school landscape featuring open spaces of low grasses interspersed with copses of trees
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 460.51 469.63 <o,f0,male> the trees by the way are often preferred if they fork near the ground that is to say if they're trees you could scramble up if you were in a tight fix
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 471.14 477.69 <o,f0,male> the landscape shows the presence of water directly in view or evidence of water in a bluish distance
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 489.09 496.32 <o,f0,male> or a road perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline that extends into the distance
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 500.74 507.16 <o,f0,male> this landscape type is regarded as beautiful even by people in countries that don't have it
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 508.35 517.06 <o,f0,male> the ideal savanna landscape is one of the clearest examples where human beings everywhere find beauty in similar visual experience
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 518.22 524.02 <o,f0,male> but someone might argue that's natural beauty how about artistic beauty
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 524.73 534.09 <o,f0,male> isn't that exhaustively cultural no i don't think it is and once again i'd like to look back to prehistory to say something about
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 535.09 544.64 <o,f0,male> it it is widely assumed that the earliest human artworks are the stupendously skillful cave paintings that we all know from lascaux and
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 548.38 556.07 <o,f0,male> about thirty two thousand years old along with a few small realistic sculptures of women and animals from the same period
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 560.68 565.17 <o,f0,male> but artistic and decorative skills are actually much older than that
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 578.42 587.23 <o,f0,male> the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts are older even than this i have in mind the so called acheulian hand axes
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 589.02 596.62 <o,f0,male> the oldest stone tools are choppers from the olduvai gorge in east africa they go back about two and a half million years
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 597.12 604.47 <o,f0,male> these crude tools were around for thousands of centuries until around one point four million years ago
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 604.82 612.40 <o,f0,male> when homo erectus started shaping single thin stone blades sometimes rounded
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 613.08 627.64 <o,f0,male> but often in what are to our eyes an arresting symmetrical pointed leaf or teardrop form these acheulian hand axes they're named after st acheul in france where finds were made in nineteenth century
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 628.12 638.58 <o,f0,male> have been unearthed in their thousands scattered across asia europe and africa almost everywhere homo erectus and homo ergaster roamed
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 639.88 650.10 <o,f0,male> now the sheer numbers of these hand axes shows that they can't have been made for butchering animals and the plot really thickens when you realize that
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 650.50 658.26 <o,f0,male> unlike other pleistocene tools the hand axes often exhibit no evidence of wear on their delicate blade edges
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 659.14 662.61 <o,f0,male> and some in any event are too big to use for butchery
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 663.47 669.42 <o,f0,male> their symmetry their attractive materials and above all their meticulous workmanship
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 670.23 674.79 <o,f0,male> are simply quite beautiful to our eyes even today
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 675.91 678.27 <o,f0,male> so what were these ancient
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 685.70 687.63 <o,f0,male> what were these artifacts for
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 688.49 694.08 <o,f0,male> the best available answer is that they were literally the earliest known works of art
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 705.52 709.34 <o,f0,male> hand axes mark an evolutionary advance in human history
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 709.88 724.04 <o,f0,male> tools fashioned to function as what darwinians call fitness signals that is to say displays that are performances like the peacock 's tail except that unlike hair and feathers the hand axes
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 724.19 727.17 <o,f0,male> are consciously cleverly crafted
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 735.34 743.05 <o,f0,male> fine motor control planning ability conscientiousness and sometimes access to rare materials
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 754.39 757.80 <o,f0,male> you know it's an old line but it has been shown to work
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 758.82 761.89 <o,f0,male> come up to my cave so i can show you my hand axes
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 764.03 770.82 <o,f0,male> except of course what's interesting about this is that we can't be sure how that idea was conveyed because the
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 781.46 785.81 <o,f0,male> this object was made by a hominid ancestor
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 786.42 789.21 <o,f0,male> homo erectus or homo ergaster
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 790.50 795.42 <o,f0,male> between fifty and one hundred thousand years before language
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 806.35 816.78 <o,f0,male> by the end of the hand axe epic homo sapiens as they were then called finally were doubtless finding new ways to amuse and amaze each other
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 817.41 824.03 <o,f0,male> who knows telling jokes storytelling dancing or hairstyling yes hairstyling i insist on that
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 825.51 837.48 <o,f0,male> for us moderns virtuoso technique is used to create imaginary worlds in fiction and in movies to express intense emotions with music painting and dance
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 837.98 846.50 <o,f0,male> but still one fundamental trait of the ancestral personality persists in our aesthetic cravings
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 847.04 854.56 <o,f0,male> the beauty we find in skilled performances from lascaux to the louvre to carnegie hall
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 855.28 861.84 <o,f0,male> human beings have a permanent innate taste for virtuoso displays in the arts
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 862.90 867.14 <o,f0,male> we find beauty in something done well
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 869.06 880.52 <o,f0,male> so the next time you pass a jewelry shop window displaying a beautifully cut teardrop shaped stone don't be so sure it's just your culture telling you that that sparkling jewel is beautiful
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 881.26 890.78 <o,f0,male> your distant ancestors loved that shape and found beauty in the skill needed to make it even before they could put their love into words
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 891.49 903.88 <o,f0,male> beauty in the eye of the beholder no it's deep in our minds it's a gift handed down from the intelligent skills and rich emotional lives of our most ancient ancestors
DenisDutton_2010 1 DenisDutton_2010 905.01 918.12 <o,f0,male> powerful reaction to images to the expression of emotion in art to the beauty of music to the night sky will be with us and our descendants for as long as the human race exists
