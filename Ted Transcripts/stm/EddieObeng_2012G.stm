EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 33.23 38.82 <o,f0,male> my alter ego is a big green boxy avatar nicknamed cyber frank
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 38.82 44 <o,f0,male> so that 's what i spend my time doing i 'd like to start if it 's possible with a test
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 44 48.72 <o,f0,male> because i do business stuff so it 's important that we focus on outcomes
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 48.72 67.78 <o,f0,male> and then i struggled because i was thinking to myself what should i talk what should i do it 's a ted audience it 's got to be stretching how am i going to make so i just hope i 've got the level of difficulty right so let 's just walk our way through this please could you work this through with me you can shout out the answer if you like the question is which of these horizontal lines is longer the answer
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 175.79 184.04 <o,f0,female> two years after its inception it makes no sense companies make their expensive executives spend ages carefully preparing forecasts and budgets
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 184.04 198.09 <o,f0,female> which are obsolete or need changing before they can be published how is that possible if you look at the visions we have the visions of how we 're going to change the world the key thing is implementation we have the vision we 've got to make it happen we 've spent decades
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 198.09 203.86 <o,f0,male> professionalizing implementation people are supposed to be good at making stuff happen however
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 223.52 237.69 <o,f0,male> average real successful project the family actually end up in makassar south sulawesi at a cost of four thousand pounds whilst leaving two of the children behind
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 262.21 268.48 <o,f0,male> this was a group of eminent economists apologizing to the queen of england when she asked the question
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 288.37 298.5 <o,f0,female> he explains that design must get big and he 's right he wisely explains this to us he says design thinking must tackle big systems for the challenges we have he 's absolutely right
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 298.72 312.99 <o,f0,female> and then i ask myself why was it ever small isn 't it weird you know if collaboration is so cool is cross functional working is so amazing why did we build these huge hierarchies what 's going
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 313.22 319.03 <o,f0,female> you see i think what 's happened perhaps is that
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 322.38 339.56 <o,f0,female> what we do know is that the world has accelerated cyberspace moves everything at the speed of light technology accelerates things exponentially so if this is now and that 's the past and we start thinking about change you know all governments are seeking change you 're here seeking change everybody 's after change it 's really cool laughter so
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 352.61 365.74 <o,f0,female> put half of them in cities then connected them all up so they can interact the density of the interaction of human beings is amazing there are charts which show all these movements of information that density of information is amazing and then we 've done a third thing
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 365.74 379.69 <o,f0,female> you know for those of you who have as an office a little desk underneath the stairs and you say well this is my little desk under the stairs no you are sitting at the headquarters of a global corporation if you 're connected to the internet
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 379.69 382.85 <o,f0,female> what 's happened is we 've changed the scale
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 386.93 393.04 <o,f0,female> every time you tweet over a third of your followers follow from a country which is not your own
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 393.04 397.16 <o,f0,female> global is the new scale we know that
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 413.57 420.3 <o,f0,female> they basically the demonstrator did something quite intriguing what he did was he got a transparent pipe
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 463.48 478.2 <o,f0,female> it 's not that interesting and then he turns the water up a bit so it starts coming back in and nothing changes so he 's changing the flow of the water but it 's just a boring green line he adds some more he adds some more and then something weird happens there 's this little flicker
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 478.2 484.75 <o,f0,female> and then as he turns it ever so slightly more the whole of that green line disappears and instead there are these
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 509.88 517.58 <o,f0,male> and it 's not the same as laminar and if we didn 't have that green ink you 'd never notice
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 517.58 534.41 <o,f0,female> and i think this is our challenge because somebody has actually increased and it 's probably you guys with all your tech and stuff the speed the scale and the density of interaction now how do we cope and deal with that well we could just call it turbulence or we could try and learn
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 537.28 547.47 <o,f0,male> know you guys grew up in the days when there were actually these things called correct answers because of the answer you gave me to the horizontal line puzzle and you believe it will last forever
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 547.48 557.1 <o,f0,male> so i 'll put a little line up here which represents learning and that 's how we used to do it we could see things understand them take the time to put them into practice out here is the world
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 557.1 570.51 <o,f0,male> now what 's happened to our pace of learning as the world has accelerated well if you work for a corporation you 'll discover it 's quite difficult to work on stuff which your boss doesn 't approve of isn 't in the strategy and anyway you 've got to go through your monthly meetings
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 570.51 587.18 <o,f0,male> if you work in an institution one day you will get them to make that decision and if you work in a market where people believe in cycles it 's even funnier because you have to wait all the way for the cycle to fail before you go there 's something wrong you with me so it 's likely that the line in terms of learning
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 587.18 593.46 <o,f0,male> is pretty flat you with me this point over here
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 593.49 607.84 <o,f0,male> the point at which the lines cross over the pace of change overtakes the pace of learning and for me that is what i was describing when i was telling you about midnight
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 607.84 620.21 <o,f0,male> so what does it do to us well it completely transforms what we have to do many mistakes we make we solve last year 's problems without thinking about the future if you try and think about it the things you 're solving now what problems are they going to bring in the future
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 620.21 638.87 <o,f0,male> if you haven 't understood the world you 're living in it 's almost impossible to be absolutely certain that what you 're going to deliver fits i 'll give you an example a quick one creativity and ideas i mentioned that earlier all the ceos around me my clients they want innovation so they seek innovation they say to people take risks and be creative but unfortunately the words get transformed as they travel through the air
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 687.12 693.65 <o,f0,male> so what i want to leave you then is with the explanation of why i actually traveled sixty thousand miles from my desk
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 693.65 709.15 <o,f0,male> when i realized the power of this new world i quit my safe teaching job and set up a virtual business school the first in the world in order to teach people how to make this happen and i used some of my learnings about some of the rules which i 'd learned on myself
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 709.15 720.89 <o,f0,male> if you 're interested worldaftermidnight com you 'll find out more but i 've applied them to myself for over a decade and i 'm still here and i still have my house and the most important thing is i hope i 've done enough
EddieObeng_2012G 1 EddieObeng_2012G 720.97 737.73 <o,f0,male> to inject a little green ink into your lives so that when you go away and you 're making your next absolutely sensible and rational decision you 'll take some time to think hmm i wonder whether this also makes sense in our new world after midnight thank you very much
