IsabelBehnckeIzquierdo_2011U 1 IsabelBehnckeIzquierdo_2011U 59.75 65.99 <o,f0,female> now chimpanzees are well known for their aggression
IsabelBehnckeIzquierdo_2011U 1 IsabelBehnckeIzquierdo_2011U 76.21 90.7 <o,f0,female> but bonobos show us the other side of the coin while chimpanzees are dominated by big scary guys bonobo society is run by empowered females
IsabelBehnckeIzquierdo_2011U 1 IsabelBehnckeIzquierdo_2011U 102.39 121.43 <o,f0,female> but unfortunately bonobos are the least understood of the great apes they live in the depths of the congolese jungle and it has been very difficult to study them the congo is a paradox a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty

IsabelBehnckeIzquierdo_2011U 1 IsabelBehnckeIzquierdo_2011U 135.95 154.08 <o,f0,female> not surprisingly this destruction also endangers bonobo survival bushmeat trades and forest loss means we couldn 't fill a small stadium with all the bonobos that are left in the world and we 're not even sure of that to be honest

IsabelBehnckeIzquierdo_2011U 1 IsabelBehnckeIzquierdo_2011U 340.87 348.85 <o,f0,female> so these are just small tasters into the insights that bonobo give us to our past and present
