NancyLublin_2012U 1 NancyLublin_2012U 16.39 30.56 <o,f0,female> most of you this is a device to buy sell play games watch videos i think it might be a lifeline i think actually it might be able to save more lives than penicillin
NancyLublin_2012U 1 NancyLublin_2012U 30.56 36.75 <o,f0,female> texting i know i say texting and a lot of you think sexting a lot of you think about the lewd photos
NancyLublin_2012U 1 NancyLublin_2012U 36.75 46.48 <o,f0,female> that you see hopefully not your kids sending to somebody else or trying to translate the abbreviations lol lmao hmu i can help you with those later
NancyLublin_2012U 1 NancyLublin_2012U 46.48 55.66 <o,f0,female> but the parents in the room know that texting is actually the best way to communicate with your kids it might be the only way to communicate with your kids
NancyLublin_2012U 1 NancyLublin_2012U 89.52 106.01 <o,f0,female> for minority and urban youth i know this because at dosomething org which is the largest organization for teenagers and social change in america about six months ago we pivoted and started focusing on text messaging we 're now texting out to about two hundred thousand kids a week
NancyLublin_2012U 1 NancyLublin_2012U 106.01 115.56 <o,f0,female> about doing our campaigns to make their schools more green or to work on homeless issues and things like that we 're finding it eleven times more powerful than email
NancyLublin_2012U 1 NancyLublin_2012U 130.2 137.16 <o,f0,female> i was cutting my parents found out and so i stopped but i just started again an hour ago
NancyLublin_2012U 1 NancyLublin_2012U 137.16 139.56 <o,f0,female> or
NancyLublin_2012U 1 NancyLublin_2012U 139.56 145.53 <o,f0,female> he won 't stop raping me he told me not to tell anyone it 's my dad are you there
NancyLublin_2012U 1 NancyLublin_2012U 145.53 159.85 <o,f0,female> that last one 's an actual text message that we received and yeah we 're there i will not forget the day we got that text message and so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hotline
NancyLublin_2012U 1 NancyLublin_2012U 185.24 186.88 <o,f0,female> that 's great
NancyLublin_2012U 1 NancyLublin_2012U 187.02 189.19 <o,f0,female> but the thing that really makes this awesome
NancyLublin_2012U 1 NancyLublin_2012U 189.41 195.51 <o,f0,female> is the data because i 'm not really comfortable just helping that girl with counseling and referrals
NancyLublin_2012U 1 NancyLublin_2012U 195.63 198.01 <o,f0,female> i want to prevent this shit from happening
NancyLublin_2012U 1 NancyLublin_2012U 198.25 206.11 <o,f0,female> so think about a cop there 's something in new york city the police did it it used to be just guess work police work
NancyLublin_2012U 1 NancyLublin_2012U 206.17 221.19 <o,f0,female> and then they started crime mapping and so they started following and watching petty thefts summonses all kinds of things charting the future essentially and they found things like when you see crystal meth on the street if you
NancyLublin_2012U 1 NancyLublin_2012U 221.19 234.06 <o,f0,female> add police presence you can curb the otherwise inevitable spate of assaults and robberies that would happen in fact the year after the nypd put compstat in place the murder rate
NancyLublin_2012U 1 NancyLublin_2012U 234.06 240.38 <o,f0,female> fell sixty percent so think about the data from a crisis text line there is
NancyLublin_2012U 1 NancyLublin_2012U 240.38 255.91 <o,f0,female> no census on bullying and dating abuse and eating disorders and cutting and rape no census maybe there 's some studies some longitudinal studies that cost lots of money and took lots of time or maybe there 's some anecdotal evidence
NancyLublin_2012U 1 NancyLublin_2012U 270.09 278.1 <o,f0,female> you could see the immediate impact of legislation or a hateful speech that somebody gives in a school assembly and see what happens as a result
NancyLublin_2012U 1 NancyLublin_2012U 278.1 296.76 <o,f0,female> this is really to me the power of texting and the power of data because while people are talking about data making it possible for facebook to mine my friend from the third grade or target to know when it 's time for me to buy more diapers or some dude to build a better baseball team
NancyLublin_2012U 1 NancyLublin_2012U 296.76 305.17 <o,f0,female> i 'm actually really excited about the power of data and the power of texting to help that kid go to school to help that girl stop cutting in the bathroom
NancyLublin_2012U 1 NancyLublin_2012U 305.3 308.73 <o,f0,female> and absolutely to help that girl whose father 's raping her
NancyLublin_2012U 1 NancyLublin_2012U 308.73 310.97 <o,f0,female> thank you
