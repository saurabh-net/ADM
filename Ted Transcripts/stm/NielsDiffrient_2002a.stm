NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 13.96 20.44 <o,f0,male> five years old i fell in love with airplanes now i'm talking about the
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 36.03 49.71 <o,f0,male> had high leather boots jodhpurs an old leather jacket a wonderful helmet and those marvelous goggles and inevitably a white scarf
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 50.53 58.20 <o,f0,male> to flow in the wind he'd always walk up to his airplane in a kind of
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 64.10 67.22 <o,f0,female> cigarette away grab the girl
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 70.93 78.74 <o,f0,male> mount his airplane maybe for the last time of course i always wondered what would happen if he'd kissed the airplane first
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 87.39 89.43 <o,f0,male> but this was real romance to me
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 104.26 112.27 <o,f0,male> so as a youngster i tried to get close to this by drawing airplanes constantly drawing
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 112.76 120.33 <o,f0,male> airplanes it's the way i got a part of this romance and of course in a way when i say romance
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 120.91 134.16 <o,f0,male> i mean in part the aesthetics of that whole situation i think the word is the holistic experience revolving around a product the product
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 134.87 141.81 <o,f0,male> was that airplane but it built a romance even the parts of the airplane
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 142.65 147.35 <o,f0,male> had french names the fuselage the
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 150.25 161.68 <o,f0,male> you know from a romance language so that it was something that just got into your spirit it did mine and i decided i had to get closer than just drawing
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 175.26 182.81 <o,f0,male> the appearance drawings were not enough you couldn't transfer those to the model itself
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 183.41 192.75 <o,f0,male> if you wanted it to fly you had to learn the discipline of flying you had to learn about aeronautics
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 209.65 218.00 <o,f0,male> i had to give up the approach of drawing the fantasy shapes and convert it to technical drawings
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 218.46 224.94 <o,f0,male> the shape of the wing the shape of the fuselage and so on and build an airplane over these drawings
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 225.34 234.38 <o,f0,male> that i knew followed some of the principles of flying and in so doing i could produce a model that would fly
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 234.56 246.49 <o,f0,male> stay in the air and it had once it was in the air some of this romance that i was in love with well the act of drawing airplanes led me to
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 247.52 254.98 <o,f0,male> when i had the opportunity to choose a course in school led me to sign up for aeronautical engineering
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 256.11 264.53 <o,f0,male> and when i was sitting in classes in which no one asked me to draw an airplane to my surprise
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 265.14 273.20 <o,f0,male> i had to learn mathematics and mechanics and all this sort of thing i'd wile away my time drawing airplanes in the class
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 273.96 286.15 <o,f0,male> one day a young man looked over my shoulder he said you draw very well you should be in the art department and i said why he said well for one thing there are more girls there
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 290.20 293.55 <o,f0,male> so my romance was temporarily shifted
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 294.69 302.88 <o,f0,male> and i went in to art because they appreciated drawing studied painting didn't do very well at that went through
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 303.57 312.09 <o,f0,male> design some architecture eventually hired myself out as a designer and for the following twenty five years
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 312.79 322.56 <o,f0,male> living in italy living in america i doled out a piece of this romance to anybody who 'd pay for it
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 324.07 327.77 <o,f0,male> sense this aesthetic feeling for
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 329.44 338.20 <o,f0,male> revolving around a designed object it exists any of you who rode the automobiles
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 339.16 351.47 <o,f0,male> was it yesterday at the track you know the romance revolving around those high performance cars well in twenty five years
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 352.52 360.08 <o,f0,male> i was mostly putting out pieces of this romance and not getting a lot back in because design on call
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 360.70 371.14 <o,f0,male> doesn't always connect you with a circumstance in which you can produce things of this nature so after twenty five years i began to feel as though i was running dry
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 372.34 380.63 <o,f0,male> and i quit and i started up a very small operation went from forty people to one
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 381.92 389.61 <o,f0,male> in an effort to rediscover my innocence i wanted to get back where the romance was
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 391.02 399.59 <o,f0,male> i couldn't choose airplanes because they had gotten sort of unromantic at that point even though i'd done a lot of airplane work
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 399.96 409.49 <o,f0,male> on the interiors so i chose furniture and i chose chairs specifically because i knew something about them
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 410.27 420.05 <o,f0,male> designed a lot of chairs over the years for tractors and trucks and submarines all kinds of things
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 420.52 423.51 <o,f0,male> but not office chairs so i started doing that
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 424.48 435.14 <o,f0,male> and i found that there were ways to duplicate the same approach that i used to use on the airplane only this time
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 449.92 457.48 <o,f0,male> for a chair you have to learn a lot about how to deal with the body and what the body needs wants
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 466.24 475.12 <o,f0,male> i ended up designing the chair i'm going to show you i should say one more thing when i was doing those model airplanes
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 475.96 482.80 <o,f0,male> i did everything i conceived the kind of airplane i basically engineered it
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 483.61 490.03 <o,f0,male> i built it and i flew it and that's the way i work now
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 494.89 506.03 <o,f0,male> when i started this chair it was not a preconceived notion design nowadays if you mean it you don't start with styling sketches
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 506.79 519.16 <o,f0,male> i started with a lot of loose ideas roughly eight or nine years ago and the loose ideas had something to with what i knew happened with people in the office
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 520.91 529.02 <o,f0,male> people who worked and used task seating a great many of them sitting in front of a computer all day long
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 529.82 538.64 <o,f0,male> and i felt the one thing they don't need is a chair that interferes with their main reason for sitting there
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 539.34 546.01 <o,f0,male> so i took the approach that the chair should do as much for them as humanly possible
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 546.41 554.22 <o,f0,male> or as mechanistically possible so that they didn't have to fuss with it so my idea was that
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 568.16 578.26 <o,f0,male> now that may not mean a lot to some of you but you know most good chairs do recline because it's beneficial to open up this joint between your legs
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 578.61 587.36 <o,f0,male> and your upper body for better breathing and better flow so that if you sit down on my chair
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 589.94 593.13 <o,f0,male> tall or six foot six it always
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 593.96 606.63 <o,f0,male> deals with your weight and transfers the amount of force required to recline in a way that you don't have to look for something to adjust
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 608.07 618.39 <o,f0,male> i'll tell you right up front this is a trade off there are drawbacks to this one is you can't accommodate everybody
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 629.86 639.58 <o,f0,male> but the compromise i felt was in my favor because most people don't adjust their chairs they will sit in them forever i had somebody
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 640.26 650.94 <o,f0,male> bus out to the racetrack tell me about his sister calling him he said she had one of the new better chairs she said oh i love it she said but it's too high so he
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 655.16 664.38 <o,f0,male> come over and look at it he came over and looked at it he reached down he pulled a lever and the chair sank down she said oh it's wonderful how did you do that
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 665.66 675.92 <o,f0,male> showed her the lever well that's typical of a lot of us working in chairs and why should you get a twenty page manual about how to run a chair
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 678.18 685.78 <o,f0,male> i had one for a wristwatch once twenty pages anyway i felt that it was important that you didn't have to
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 686.20 694.82 <o,f0,male> make an adjustment in order to get this kind of action the other thing i felt was that armrests had never really been
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 696.60 704.08 <o,f0,male> properly approached from the standpoint of how much of how much of an aide they could be to your work life
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 704.74 712.00 <o,f0,male> but i felt it was too much to ask to have to adjust each individual arm rest in order to get it where you wanted
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 712.57 723.87 <o,f0,male> so i spent a long time i said i worked on eight or nine years on it and each of these things went along sort of in parallel but incrementally were a problem of their own
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 724.53 733.22 <o,f0,male> i worked a long time on figuring out how to move the arms over a much greater arc that is up and down
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 734.11 741.91 <o,f0,male> and make them a lot easier so that you didn't have to use a button and so after many trials many failures
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 742.15 752.26 <o,f0,male> we came up with a very simple arrangement in which we could just move one arm or the other and they go up easily and stop where you want
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 753.99 767.87 <o,f0,male> you can put them down essentially out of the way no arms at all or you can pull them up where you want them and this was another thing that i felt while not nearly as romantic as cary grant
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 768.66 778.59 <o,f0,male> nevertheless begins to grab a little bit of aesthetic operation aesthetic performance into a product
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 779.26 792.13 <o,f0,male> the next area that was of interest to me was the fact that reclining was a very important factor and the more you can recline in a way the better it is
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 792.27 801.64 <o,f0,male> the more the angle between here and here opens up and nowadays with a screen in front of you you don't want to have your eye drop too far in the recline
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 801.88 809.67 <o,f0,male> so we keep it at more or less the same level but you transfer weight off your tailbones
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 833.54 846.01 <o,f0,male> all the weight of your upper torso your arms your head goes right down through your back your spine into those bones when you sit and that's a lot of load
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 846.48 856.01 <o,f0,male> just relieving your arms with armrests takes twenty percent of that load off now that if your spine is not held in a good position
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 856.32 864.12 <o,f0,male> will help bend your spine the wrong way and so on so to unload that
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 864.62 867.20 <o,f0,female> great weight
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 868.48 878.28 <o,f0,male> indeed exists you can recline when you recline you take away a lot of that load off your bottom end and transfer it to your back
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 879.06 888.72 <o,f0,male> the same time as i say you open up this joint and breathability is good but to do that if you have any
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 889.94 898.71 <o,f0,male> amount of recline it gets to the point where you need a headrest because nearly always
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 910.58 923.94 <o,f0,male> you have to use muscle force to hold your head there so that's where a headrest comes in now headrest is a challenge because you want it to adjust enough so that it will fit
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 925.21 929.71 <o,f0,male> you know a tall guy and a short girl so here we are
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 930.70 933.57 <o,f0,male> got five inches of adjustment here
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 934.60 944.77 <o,f0,male> in order to get the headrest in the right place but then i knew from experience and looking around in offices where there were chairs with headrests
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 945.96 955.23 <o,f0,male> nobody would ever bother to reach back and turn a knob and adjust the headrest to put it in position and you need it in a different position when you're upright
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 955.47 963.42 <o,f0,male> then when you're reclined so i knew that had to be solved and had to be automatic so if you watch this chair as i recline
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 963.83 971.34 <o,f0,male> the headrest comes up to meet my neck ideally you want to put the head support in
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 971.79 976.48 <o,f0,female> cranial area right there so that
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 978.57 981.93 <o,f0,female> part of it took a long time to work out
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 991.99 1000.79 <o,f0,male> and put gel in the cushions and in the armrests to absorb point load distributes the loading
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 1001.10 1013.38 <o,f0,male> so you don't get hard spots you cant hit your elbow on bottom and i did want to demonstrate the fact that the chair can accommodate people
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 1014.17 1018.38 <o,f0,male> while you're sitting in it you can adjust it down for the five footer
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 1019.40 1021.06 <o,f0,male> or you can adjust it
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 1022.18 1026.46 <o,f0,male> for the six foot six guy
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 1027.73 1029.72 <o,f0,male> all within the scope
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 1030.24 1031.97 <o,f0,male> of a few simple adjustments
