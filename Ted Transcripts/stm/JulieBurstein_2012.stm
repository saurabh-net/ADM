JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 15.95 19.26 <o,f0,female> a small clay pot that i made in college
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 22.33 26.03 <o,f0,female> that began in japan centuries ago as a way
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 30.2 33.13 <o,f0,female> this one is more than four hundred years old
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 33.49 37.68 <o,f0,female> each one was pinched or carved out of a ball of clay
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 38.18 41.72 <o,f0,female> and it was the imperfections that people cherished
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 43.34 45.36 <o,f0,female> everyday pots like this
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 49.3 53.38 <o,f0,female> to fire i just took this out of the kiln last week and the kiln itself
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 59.46 61.56 <o,f0,female> you do it outside and you take
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 67.43 76.74 <o,f0,female> and as soon as you see that the glaze has melted inside you can see that faint sheen you turn the kiln off and you reach in with these long metal tongs
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 89.37 94.23 <o,f0,female> but here in the united states we ramp up the drama a little bit and we drop
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 108.55 111.59 <o,f0,female> i love raku because it allows
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 117 118.7 <o,f0,female> and choose a glaze
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 130.99 134.57 <o,f0,female> to room temperature in the space of just a minute
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 138.63 149.64 <o,f0,female> for the process of creativity i find in so many things that tension between what i can control and what i have to let go happens all the time
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 149.74 152.74 <o,f0,female> whether i 'm creating a new radio show
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 157.45 159.57 <o,f0,female> when i sat down to write a book
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 159.57 166.28 <o,f0,female> about creativity i realized that the steps were reversed i had to let go at the very beginning
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 169.11 171.65 <o,f0,female> in the stories of hundreds of
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 175.44 177.97 <o,f0,female> and as i listened to these stories
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 184.97 186.65 <o,f0,female> more often than you might think
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 204.68 206.65 <o,f0,female> the best way to learn about anything
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 222.81 226.47 <o,f0,female> the first embrace is something that we think oh this is very easy
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 234.83 243.78 <o,f0,female> speak about needing to be open to embrace experience and that 's hard to do when you have a lighted rectangle in your pocket
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 248.54 254.3 <o,f0,female> the filmmaker mira nair speaks about growing up in a small town in india
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 254.81 259.96 <o,f0,female> its name is bhubaneswar and here 's a picture of one of the temples in her town
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 263.79 277.02 <o,f0,female> we played cricket all the time we kind of grew up in the rubble the major thing that inspired me that led me on this path that made me a filmmaker eventually was traveling folk theater that would come through the town
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 277.02 285.39 <o,f0,female> and i would go off and see these great battles of good and evil by two people in a school field with no props but with a lot of
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 285.39 304.33 <o,f0,female> you know passion and hashish as well and it was amazing you know the folk tales of mahabharata and ramayana the two holy books the epics that everything comes out of in india they say after seeing that jatra the folk theater i knew i wanted to get on you know and perform
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 331.95 337.44 <o,f0,female> so being open for that experience that might change you is the first thing we need to embrace
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 349.52 358.13 <o,f0,female> the novelist richard ford speaks about a childhood challenge that continues to be something he wrestles with today
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 358.27 360.32 <o,f0,female> he 's severely dyslexic
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 367.66 384.86 <o,f0,male> and still to this day can 't read silently much faster than i can read aloud but there were a lot of benefits to being dyslexic for me because when i finally did reconcile myself to how slow i was going to have to do it then i think i came very slowly
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 384.86 403.08 <o,f0,male> into an appreciation of all of those qualities of language and of sentences that are not just the cognitive aspects of language the syncopations the sounds of words what words look like where paragraphs break where lines break i mean i wasn 't so badly dyslexic that i was disabled from reading i just had to do it really slowly
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 403.08 408.12 <o,f0,male> and as i did lingering on those sentences as i had to linger
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 408.26 414.2 <o,f0,male> i fell heir to language 's other qualities which i think has helped me write sentences
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 428.04 429.9 <o,f0,female> overcome dyslexia
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 431.81 435.44 <o,f0,female> he had to learn from it he had to learn to hear the music in language
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 446.83 450.24 <o,f0,female> helps them focus on finding their own voice
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 451.38 453.37 <o,f0,female> the sculptor richard serra
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 454.3 457.84 <o,f0,female> talks about how as a young artist he thought he was a painter
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 459.04 462.34 <o,f0,female> and he lived in florence after graduate school
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 462.47 467.72 <o,f0,female> while he was there he traveled to madrid where he went to the prado to see this picture
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 471.82 473.86 <o,f0,female> it 's from one thousand six
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 476.75 480.77 <o,f0,female> and it 's the picture of a little princess and her ladies in waiting
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 481.04 485.52 <o,f0,female> and if you look over that little blonde princess 's shoulder you 'll see a mirror
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 486.04 487.7 <o,f0,female> and reflected in it
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 487.84 489.91 <o,f0,female> the king and queen of spain
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 490.38 493.84 <o,f0,female> who would be standing where you might stand to look at the picture
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 497.66 499.41 <o,f0,female> in this painting too
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 499.56 501.09 <o,f0,female> he 's standing on the left
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 524.21 529.99 <o,f0,male> randomness and i wasn 't getting anywhere so i went back and dumped all my paintings in the arno and i thought i 'm going to just start playing around
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 534.77 540.17 <o,f0,female> he went and saw this painting by a guy who 'd been dead for three hundred years and realized
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 557.25 561.27 <o,f0,female> he moved to new york city and he put together a list of verbs
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 561.44 564.79 <o,f0,female> to roll to crease to fold
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 575.28 577.32 <o,f0,female> he would do the same thing
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 578.15 580.39 <o,f0,female> and when he got to the direction
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 586.77 589.61 <o,f0,female> richard serra had to let go of painting
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 589.67 593.05 <o,f0,female> in order to embark on this playful exploration
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 593.46 596.24 <o,f0,female> that led him to the work that he 's known for today
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 614.07 617.56 <o,f0,female> so experience and challenge
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 617.95 623.15 <o,f0,female> and limitations are all things we need to embrace for creativity to flourish
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 623.7 625.23 <o,f0,female> there 's a fourth embrace
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 626.28 629.36 <o,f0,female> and it 's the hardest it 's the embrace of loss
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 629.85 633.66 <o,f0,female> the oldest and most constant of human experiences
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 633.87 640.01 <o,f0,female> in order to create we have to stand in that space between what we see in the world and what we hope for
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 640.88 643.46 <o,f0,female> looking squarely at rejection
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 651.99 655.16 <o,f0,female> educator parker palmer calls it the tragic
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 659.98 665.89 <o,f0,female> and my friend dick nodel likes to say you can hold that tension like a violin string
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 666.27 668.2 <o,f0,female> and make something beautiful
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 674.04 684.97 <o,f0,female> who at the beginning of his career was known for his street photography for capturing a moment on the street and also for his beautiful photographs of landscapes of tuscany
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 693.72 697.82 <o,f0,female> with a straight view downtown to the world trade center
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 698.1 701.97 <o,f0,female> and he photographed those buildings in every sort of light
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 703.71 705.28 <o,f0,female> you know where this story
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 725.27 730.83 <o,f0,male> and i raised my camera to take a peek just to see if there was something to see and some
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 744.1 751.79 <o,f0,male> and when i asked her why no pictures she said it 's a crime scene no photographs allowed and i asked her what would happen if i was a member of the press
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 751.79 758.48 <o,f0,male> and she told me oh look back there and back a block was the press corps tied up
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 758.64 760.88 <o,f0,male> in a little penned in area
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 761.16 764.69 <o,f0,male> and i said well when do they go in and she said probably never
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 765.06 769.06 <o,f0,male> and as i walked away from that i had this crystallization
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 769.2 772.91 <o,f0,male> probably from the blow because it was an insult in a way i thought
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 776.35 784.64 <o,f0,male> we need a record and i thought i 'm gonna make that record i 'll find a way to get in because i don 't want to see this history disappear
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 791.98 794.31 <o,f0,female> for nine months almost every day
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 795.12 802.78 <o,f0,female> looking at these photographs today brings back the smell of smoke that lingered on my clothes when i went home to my family at night
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 802.91 805.13 <o,f0,female> my office was just a few blocks away
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 809.94 814.74 <o,f0,female> and we wondered was it difficult for joel meyerowitz to make such beauty
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 815.18 816.84 <o,f0,female> out of such devastation
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 830.41 843.31 <o,f0,male> after the fact into this residue and like many other ruins you go to the ruins of the colosseum or the ruins of a cathedral someplace and they take on a new meaning when you watch the weather
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 843.63 853.02 <o,f0,male> i mean there were afternoons i was down there and the light goes pink and there 's a mist in the air and you 're standing in the rubble and i found myself
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 853.08 854.8 <o,f0,male> recognizing both
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 855.58 861.41 <o,f0,male> the inherent beauty of nature and the fact that nature as time is erasing
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 861.41 863.74 <o,f0,male> this wound
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 863.74 872.09 <o,f0,male> time is unstoppable and it transforms the event it gets further and further away from the day and light and seasons
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 907.73 910.17 <o,f0,male> you have to take a picture
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 919.3 928.74 <o,f0,female> when i saw joel meyerowitz recently i told him how much i admired his passionate obstinacy his determination to push through all the bureaucratic red tape
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 954.42 960.92 <o,f0,female> he 's right we all wrestle with experience and challenge limits and loss
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 961.54 963.66 <o,f0,female> creativity is essential to all of us
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 964.06 966.57 <o,f0,female> whether we 're scientists or teachers
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 972.95 978.72 <o,f0,female> image of a japanese tea bowl this one is at the freer gallery in washington d c
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 978.83 984.06 <o,f0,female> it 's more than a hundred years old and you can still see the fingermarks where the potter pinched it
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 985.23 990.39 <o,f0,female> but as you can also see this one did break at some point in its hundred years
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 997.96 1000.94 <o,f0,female> using gold lacquer to repair it
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 1001.6 1004.23 <o,f0,female> this bowl is more beautiful now
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 1004.81 1008.69 <o,f0,female> having been broken than it was when it was first made
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 1013.94 1017.05 <o,f0,female> of the cycle of creation and destruction
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 1017.65 1020.06 <o,f0,female> of control and letting go
JulieBurstein_2012 1 JulieBurstein_2012 1020.48 1024.09 <o,f0,female> of picking up the pieces and making something new
