JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 16.10 27.32 <o,f0,male> for a moment what i need to do is project something on the screen of your imagination we're in seventeenth century japan on the west coast
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 28.03 40.07 <o,f0,male> and a little wizened monk is hurrying along near midnight to the crest of a small hill he arrives on the small hill dripping with water
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 41.99 48.36 <o,f0,male> stands there and he looks across at the island sado and he scans across the ocean and he looks at the
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 51.44 55.30 <o,f0,male> he says to himself very quietly
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 65.70 75.38 <o,f0,male> was a brilliant man he said more with less than any human that i have ever read or talked to
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 76.86 87.42 <o,f0,male> basho in seventeen syllables juxtaposed a turbulent ocean driven by a storm now past
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 88.71 98.70 <o,f0,male> and captured the almost impossible beauty of our home galaxy with
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 99.69 108.22 <o,f0,male> millions of stars probably hundreds and hundreds who knows how many planets maybe even an ocean that we will probably call sylvia
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 134.66 138.38 <o,f0,male> if you would know the pine tree go to the pine tree
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 146.23 159.82 <o,f0,male> sylvia has said we must use every capacity we have in order to know the oceans if we would know the oceans we must go to the oceans and what i'd like to talk to you today about a little bit
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 160.43 174.65 <o,f0,male> is really transforming the relationship or the interplay between humans and oceans with a new capability that is not at all routine yet i hope it will be
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 176.19 182.81 <o,f0,male> there are a few key points one of them is the oceans are central to the quality of life on earth
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 184.39 194.88 <o,f0,male> another is that there are bold new ways of studying oceans that we have not used well yet and the last is that these bold new ways that we are exploring
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 195.18 204.04 <o,f0,male> as a community will transform the way we look at our planet our oceans and eventually how we manage probably the entire
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 204.24 207.15 <o,f0,male> planet for what it's worth
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 208.01 222.23 <o,f0,male> so what scientists do when they begin is to start with the system they define what the system is the system isn't chesapeake bay it's not the caro arc it's not even the entire pacific it's the whole planet the entire planet continents and oceans
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 232.45 238.82 <o,f0,male> of living on a planet that's driven by only two processes two sources of energy one of which is solar
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 250.38 259.65 <o,f0,male> mountain ranges plate tectonics moves the continents around forms ore deposits volcanoes erupt that's the planet that we live on
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 260.08 267.00 <o,f0,male> it's immensely complex now i don't expect all of you to see all the details here but what i want you to see is this is about ten percent
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 268.62 275.63 <o,f0,male> of the processes that operate within the oceans almost continuously and have for the last four billion years
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 275.95 284.75 <o,f0,male> this is a system that's been around a very long time and these have all co evolved what do i mean by that they interact with one another constantly
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 285.60 293.05 <o,f0,male> all of them interact with one another so the complexity of this system that we're looking at the one driven by the sun
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 293.99 301.36 <o,f0,male> upper portion mostly and the lower portion is partly driven by the input from heat below and by other processes
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 301.98 313.43 <o,f0,male> this is very very important because this is the system this is the crucible out of which life on the planet came and it's now time for us to understand it we must understand it
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 326.66 338.90 <o,f0,male> look at this complexity here this is only one variable if you can see the complexity you can see how tiny little eddies and large eddies
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 339.04 348.58 <o,f0,male> and the motion this is just sea surface temperature but it's immensely complicated now a layer in the other two or three hundred processes that are all interacting
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 349.02 356.86 <o,f0,male> partly as a function of temperature partly as a function of all the other factors and you've got a really complicated system that's our challenge is to understand
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 365.52 375.88 <o,f0,male> of order a billion people on the planet currently are undernourished or starving and part of the issue is for cody
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 376.80 384.54 <o,f0,male> who 's here sixteen years old and i have permission to relay this number when he
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 395.97 403.90 <o,f0,male> we can't solve all the problems by looking only at the oceans but if we don't understand the fundamental life support system of this planet
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 404.23 412.48 <o,f0,male> much more thoroughly than we do now then the stresses that we will face and that cody will face and even nancy who 's going to live til she's
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 413.64 417.20 <o,f0,male> have really problems coping
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 418.18 422.02 <o,f0,male> all right let 's talk about another perspective on the importance of
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 479.83 491.70 <o,f0,male> this the tectonic plates the age of the ocean tectonic plates gives rise to a totally new phenomenon that we have heard about in this conference
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 492.38 502.00 <o,f0,male> and i share with you some very high definition video that we collected in real time seconds after this video was taken people in
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 502.68 512.33 <o,f0,male> beijing people in sydney people in amsterdam people in washington d c were watching this now you've heard of hydrothermal vents but the other discovery
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 512.70 521.78 <o,f0,male> is that deep below the sea floor there is vast reservoir of microbial activity which we have only just discovered and which we have almost no way to
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 523.65 534.33 <o,f0,male> some people have estimated that the biomass tied up in these microbes living in the pours and the cracks of the sea floor and below
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 534.70 544.95 <o,f0,male> rival the total amount of living biomass at the surface of the planet it's an astonishing insight and we have only found out about this recently this is very very exciting
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 545.52 551.75 <o,f0,male> it may be the next rainforest in terms of pharmaceuticals we know little or nothing about
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 554.84 555.13 <o,f0,male> well
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 584.63 587.95 <o,f0,male> and now we have an entire suite of tools that are really pretty
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 593.30 606.17 <o,f0,male> but they don't quite cut it they don't quite give us what we need and the program that i wanted to talk to you about just a little bit here was funded and it involves autonomous vehicles like the one running across the base of this image
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 607.21 618.98 <o,f0,male> modeling on the right hand side there's a complex computational model on the left hand side there's a new type of mooring which i'll show you in just a second and on the basis of
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 619.57 628.50 <o,f0,male> several points the oceans are complex and they're central to the life on earth they are changing rapidly but not predictably and the models that we need to predict the future
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 628.72 634.08 <o,f0,male> do not have enough data to refine them the computational power is amazing
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 634.36 646.43 <o,f0,male> but without data those models will never ever be predicted and that's what we really need for a variety of reasons they're dangerous but we feel that ooi this ocean observatory initiative which
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 646.48 652.80 <o,f0,male> the national science foundation has begun to found has the potential to really transform things and
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 675.91 685.74 <o,f0,male> and this is what the system involves a number of sites in the southern hemisphere shown in those circles and in the northern hemisphere there are four sites i won 't talk a lot about
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 686.16 694.03 <o,f0,male> most of them right here but the one on the west coast that's in the box is called the regional scale nodes and it was once called neptune
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 707.41 721.30 <o,f0,male> those tiny little threads smaller than the hair on your head in diameter and this particular set here can transmit something of the order of three to five terabits per second this is phenomenal bandwidth
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 722.17 733.38 <o,f0,male> and this is what the planet looks like we are already laced up as if we're in a fiber optic corset if you like this is what it looks like and the cables go really continent to continent
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 733.91 743.88 <o,f0,male> it's a very powerful system and most of our communications consist of it so this is the system that i'm talking about off the west coast is coincident with the tectonic plate the juan de fuca tectonic plate
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 744.33 752.13 <o,f0,male> and it's going to deliver abundant power and unprecedented bandwidth across this entire volume in the overlying ocean
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 752.42 759.78 <o,f0,male> on the sea floor and below the sea floor bandwidth and power and a wide variety of processes that will be operating
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 760.30 768.58 <o,f0,male> this is what one of those primary nodes looks like and it's like a sub station with power and bandwidth that can spread out over an area the size of seattle
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 769.32 778.64 <o,f0,male> and the kind of science that can be done will be determined by a variety of scientists who want to be involved and can bring the instrumentation to the table they will bring it
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 779.04 787.78 <o,f0,male> and link it in it'll be in a sense like having time on a telescope except you'll have your own port climate change ocean acidification dissolved
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 788.46 797.10 <o,f0,male> oxygen carbon cycle coastal upwelling fishing dynamics the full spectrum of earth science and ocean science
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 805.47 818.67 <o,f0,male> down the information they need about anything that has taken place and this is just the first of these in conjunction with our canadian colleagues we've set this up now i want to take you into the caldera on the left hand side there is a large
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 850.16 860.90 <o,f0,male> massive amounts of data flowing ashore all available to anyone who has any interest in using it this is going to be much more powerful than having a single ship in a single location
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 861.33 872.62 <o,f0,male> then move to a new location we're flying across the caldera floor there is a number of robotic systems there's cameras that can be turned on and off at your will
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 872.77 879.21 <o,f0,male> if those are your experiments the kinds of systems that will be down there the kinds of instruments that will be on the sea floor
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 880.39 889.87 <o,f0,male> if you can read them there there's cameras there's pressure sensors fluorometers there's seismometers it's a full spectrum of tools now that mound right there
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 890.34 900.57 <o,f0,male> actually looks like this this is what it actually looks like and this is the kind of activity that we can see with high definition video because the bandwidth
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 901.09 912.37 <o,f0,male> of these cables is so huge that we could have five to ten stereo hd systems running continuously and again directed through robotic techniques
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 912.53 916.13 <o,f0,male> from land very very powerful
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 917.22 928.74 <o,f0,male> and these are the things that we're funded to do today so what can we actually do tomorrow we're about to ride the wave of technological opportunity there are emerging technologies throughout
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 929.22 938.75 <o,f0,male> the field around oceanography which we will incorporate into oceanography and through that convergence we will transform oceanography into something even more magical
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 950.53 964.25 <o,f0,male> this is a small generator it's smaller than a postage stamp and it can generate power just by being attached to your shirt as you move just as you move it generates power there are many kinds of things that can be used in the ocean continuously
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 966.16 975.08 <o,f0,male> many of you know a good deal more about this type of thing than i but stereo imaging at four times the definition that we have in hd will be routine within five years
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 975.49 976.93 <o,f0,male> and this is the magic one
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 978.09 986.22 <o,f0,male> as a result of the human genome process we are in a situation where events that take place in the ocean like an erupting volcano or something of that sort
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 998.12 1010.21 <o,f0,male> so in the volume of the ocean we will know not just the physics and the chemistry but the base of the food chain will be transparent to us with data on a continuous basis
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 1011.04 1020.76 <o,f0,male> grid computing the power of grid computers is going to be just amazing here we will soon be using grid computing to do pretty much everything like adjust the data and everything
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 1021.84 1032.95 <o,f0,male> that goes with the data the power generation will come from the ocean itself and the next generation fiber will be simply magic it's far beyond what we currently have
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 1033.69 1045.63 <o,f0,male> so the presence of the power and the bandwidth in the environment will allow all of these new technologies to converge in a manner that is just unprecedented so within five to seven years i see us having
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 1046.06 1055.57 <o,f0,male> a capacity to be completely present throughout the ocean and have all of that connected to the internet so we can reach many many folks
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 1064.85 1074.03 <o,f0,male> massive amounts of these new microbes we've never seen before come out of the sea floor we have a way of addressing that a new way of addressing that
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 1105.95 1109.89 <o,f0,male> the laboratory within twenty four hours of the eruption this is doable all
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 1114.71 1123.43 <o,f0,male> a laboratory many of you heard what happened on nine seven some doctors in new york city removed the gallbladder of a woman in france
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 1124.54 1135.84 <o,f0,male> we could do work on the sea floor that would be stunning and it would be on live tv if we have interesting things to show so we can bring an entirely new telepresence to the world
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 1149.91 1157.03 <o,f0,male> as i go here i just want to show what we can bring into classrooms and indeed what we can bring into your pocket
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 1160.46 1164.43 <o,f0,male> many of you don't think of this yet but the ocean will be in your pocket
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 1164.71 1170.22 <o,f0,male> it won 't be long it won 't be long so let me leave you then
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 1171.53 1175.51 <o,f0,male> with a few words from another poet if you'll forgive me
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 1188.99 1194.20 <o,f0,male> in little gidding he says speaking i think for the human race but certainly for the ted conference and
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 1196.41 1205.94 <o,f0,male> we shall not cease from exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 1215.71 1225.14 <o,f0,male> at the source of the longest river the voice of a hidden waterfall not known because not looked for
JohnDelaney_2010Z 1 JohnDelaney_2010Z 1225.75 1231.93 <o,f0,male> but heard half heard in the stillness beneath the waves of the
