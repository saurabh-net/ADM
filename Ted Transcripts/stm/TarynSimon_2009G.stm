TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 17.78 18.90 <o,f0,female> ninety percent of
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 20.55 27.55 <o,f0,female> is in fact not photographic it involves a campaign of letter writing research and phone calls
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 27.87 37.66 <o,f0,female> to access my subjects which can range from hamas leaders in gaza to a hibernating black bear in its cave in west virginia
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 38.62 47.00 <o,f0,female> and oddly the most kind of notable letter of rejection i ever recieved came from walt disney world a seemingly innocuous site
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 48.12 56.77 <o,f0,female> and it read i'm just going to read a key sentence especially during these violent times i personally believe that the magical spell
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 57.14 66.54 <o,f0,female> cast upon guests who visit our theme parks is particularly important to protect and helps to provide them with an important fantasy they can escape to
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 67.36 79.82 <o,f0,female> photography threatens fantasy they didn't want to let my camera in because it confronts constructed realities myths and beliefs and provides what appears to be evidence of a truth
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 80.26 89.08 <o,f0,female> but there are multiple truths attached to every image depending on the creator 's intention the viewer and the context in which it is presented
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 90.30 98.99 <o,f0,female> over a five year period following september eleventh when the american media and government were seeking hidden and unknown sites beyond its borders
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 99.40 109.49 <o,f0,female> most notably weapons of mass destruction i chose to look inward at that which was integral to america 's foundation mythology and daily functioning
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 109.99 121.35 <o,f0,female> i wanted to confront the boundaries of the citizen self imposed and real and confront the divide between privileged and public access to knowledge
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 121.96 129.70 <o,f0,female> it was a critical moment in american history and global history where one felt they didn't have access to accurate information
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 130.04 138.75 <o,f0,female> and i wanted to see the center with my own eyes but what i came away with is a photograph and it's just another place from which to observe
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 139.12 147.01 <o,f0,female> and the understanding that there are no absolute all knowing insiders and the outsider can never really reach the core
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 148.64 161.59 <o,f0,female> i'm going to run through some of the photographs in this series it's titled an american index of the hidden and unfamiliar and it's comprised of nearly seventy images in this context i'll just show you a few
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 162.20 168.45 <o,f0,female> this is a nuclear waste storage and encapsulation facility at hanford site in washington state
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 168.68 178.76 <o,f0,female> where there are over nineteen hundred stainless steel capsules containing nuclear waste submerged in water a human standing in front of an unprotected capsule would die instantly
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 179.10 186.93 <o,f0,female> and i found one section amongst all of these that actually resembled the outline of the united states of america which you can see here
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 187.49 199.03 <o,f0,female> and a big part of the work that is sort of absent in this context is text so i create these two poles every image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 199.57 213.87 <o,f0,female> and what i'm most interested in is the invisible space between a text and its accompanying image and how the image is transformed by the text and the text by the image so at best the image is meant to float away into
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 214.51 222.10 <o,f0,female> abstraction and multiple truths and fantasy and then the text functions as this cruel anchor that kind of nails it to the ground
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 223.18 227.53 <o,f0,female> in this context i'm just going to read an abridged version of those texts
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 228.13 237.71 <o,f0,female> this is a cryopreservation unit and it holds the bodies of the wife and mother of cryonics pioneer robert ettinger who hoped to be awoken one day to extended life

TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 246.75 251.54 <o,f0,female> this is a twenty one year old palestinian woman undergoing hymenoplasty
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 262.45 270.17 <o,f0,female> essentially reconstructs a ruptured hymen allowing her to bleed upon having sexual intercourse to simulate the loss of virginity
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 272.02 277.45 <o,f0,female> this is a jury simulation deliberation room and you can see beyond that two way mirror jury
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 278.45 294.34 <o,f0,female> standing in a room behind the mirror and they observe deliberations after mock trial proceedings so that they can better advise their clients how to adjust their trial strategy to have the outcome that they're hoping for this process costs sixty thousand dollars
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 296.26 303.76 <o,f0,female> this is a u s customs and border protection room a contraband room at john f kennedy international airport
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 304.09 314.63 <o,f0,female> on that table you can see forty eight hours worth of seized goods from passengers entering in to the united states there is a pig 's head and african cane rats
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 315.02 329.49 <o,f0,female> and part of my photographic work is i'm not just documenting what's there i do take certain liberties and intervene and in this i really wanted it to resemble an early still life painting so i spent some time with the smells and
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 330.51 337.75 <o,f0,female> items this is the exhibited art on the walls of the cia in langley virginia their original headquarters building
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 338.20 344.06 <o,f0,female> and the cia has had a long history with both covert and public cultural diplomacy efforts
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 344.40 358.98 <o,f0,female> and it's speculated that some of their interest in the arts was designed to counter soviet communism and promote what it considered to be pro american thoughts and aesthetics and one of the art forms that elicited the interest of the agency and had thus come under question is
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 363.39 377.27 <o,f0,female> this is the forensic anthropology research facility and on a six acre plot there are approximately seventy five cadavers at any given time that are being studied by forensic anthropologists and researchers
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 377.60 387.88 <o,f0,female> who are interested in monitoring a rate of corpse decomposition and in this particular photograph the body of a young boy has been used to reenact a crime scene
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 389.68 400.91 <o,f0,female> this is the only federally funded site where it is legal to cultivate cannabis for scientific research in the united states it's a research crop marijuana grow room
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 415.80 421.15 <o,f0,female> and you can't completely understand how information is being distributed
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 422.45 434.39 <o,f0,female> these are transatlantic submarine communication cables that travel across the floor of the atlantic ocean connecting north america to europe they carry over sixty million simultaneous voice conversations
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 434.85 449.01 <o,f0,female> and in a lot of the government and technology sites there was just this very apparent vulnerability this one is almost humorous because it feels like i could just snip all of that conversation in one easy cut but stuff did feel like it could have been
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 456.68 467.05 <o,f0,female> this is a braille edition of playboy magazine and this is a division of the library of congress produces a free national library service
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 467.43 476.14 <o,f0,female> for the blind and visually impaired and the publications they chose to publish are based on reader popularity and playboy is always in the top few
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 478.89 482.57 <o,f0,female> be surprised they don't do the photographs it's just the text

TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 519.70 526.45 <o,f0,female> and the film was shot on seventy two millimeter government issue film and that red dot is a marking on the government issue film
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 528.09 545.08 <o,f0,female> all living white tigers in north america are the result of selective inbreeding that would be mother to son father to daughter sister to brother to allow for the genetic conditions that create a salable white tiger meaning white fur ice blue eyes a pink nose
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 545.68 559.95 <o,f0,female> and the majority of these white tigers are not born in a salable state and are killed at birth it's a very violent process that is little known and the white tiger is obviously celebrated in several forms of entertainment

TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 587.38 597.66 <o,f0,female> and you can see the photoetched brass detailing and the painted acrylic facade in the context of the film this is a deep space battle station of the galactic empire

TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 630.22 643.95 <o,f0,female> they constructed a wall around the world church of god to mimic the set up of mosques in afghanistan or iraq and i worked with mehta vihar who creates virtual simulations for the army for tactical practice
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 644.22 654.00 <o,f0,female> and we put that wall around the world church of god and also used the characters and vehicles and explosions that are offered for the

TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 693.39 703.47 <o,f0,female> now i'm going to move on to another project i did it's titled the innocents and for the men in these photographs photography had been used to create a fantasy
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 710.76 719.25 <o,f0,female> i traveled across the united states photographing men and women who had been wrongfully convicted of crimes they did not commit violent crimes
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 719.95 728.85 <o,f0,female> i investigate photography 's ability to blur truth and fiction and its influence on memory which can lead to severe even lethal consequences
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 729.24 742.74 <o,f0,female> for the men in these photographs the primary cause of their wrongful conviction was mistaken identification a victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcement 's use of images
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 743.59 752.98 <o,f0,female> but through exposure to composite sketches polaroids mugshots and line ups eyewitness testimony can change i'll give you an example from a case
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 753.41 764.75 <o,f0,female> a woman was raped and presented with a series of photographs from which to identify her attacker she saw some similarities in one of the photographs but couldn't quite make a positive identification
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 765.14 776.73 <o,f0,female> days later she is presented with another photo array of all new photographs except that one photograph that she had some draw to from the earlier array is repeated in the second array
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 776.99 783.88 <o,f0,female> and a positive identification is made because the photograph replaced the memory if there ever was an actual memory
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 799.55 811.50 <o,f0,female> fredrick day who is photographed at his alibi location where thirteen witnesses placed him at the time of the crime he was convicted by an all white jury of rape kidnapping and vehicle theft
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 811.96 820.88 <o,f0,female> and he served ten years of a life sentence now dna exonerated fredrick and it also implicated another man who was serving time in prison
TarynSimon_2009G 1 TarynSimon_2009G 821.22 828.79 <o,f0,female> but the victim refused to press charges because she claimed that law enforcement had permanently altered her memory through the use of fredrick 's photograph
