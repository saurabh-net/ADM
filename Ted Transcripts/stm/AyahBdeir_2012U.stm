AyahBdeir_2012U 1 AyahBdeir_2012U 26.27 40.71 <o,f0,female> very quickly concrete blocks became the most used construction unit in the world they enabled us to to build things that were larger than us buildings bridges one brick at a time essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time
AyahBdeir_2012U 1 AyahBdeir_2012U 46.89 59.77 <o,f0,female> it was called the automatic binding brick and in a few short years lego bricks took place in every household it 's estimated that over four hundred billion bricks have been produced or seventy five bricks for every person on the planet
AyahBdeir_2012U 1 AyahBdeir_2012U 74.06 90.06 <o,f0,female> meanwhile the exact same year at bell labs the next revolution was about to be announced the next building block the transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static bricks piled on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive
AyahBdeir_2012U 1 AyahBdeir_2012U 90.06 96.73 <o,f0,female> like the concrete block the transistor allows you to build much larger more complex circuits one brick at a time
AyahBdeir_2012U 1 AyahBdeir_2012U 96.81 98.46 <o,f0,female> but there 's a main difference
AyahBdeir_2012U 1 AyahBdeir_2012U 98.5 107.57 <o,f0,female> the transistor was only for experts i personally don 't accept this that the building block of our time is reserved for experts so i decided to change that
AyahBdeir_2012U 1 AyahBdeir_2012U 107.98 116.74 <o,f0,female> eight years ago when i was at the media lab i started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers
AyahBdeir_2012U 1 AyahBdeir_2012U 117.26 121.46 <o,f0,female> a few years ago i started developing littlebits let me show you how they work
AyahBdeir_2012U 1 AyahBdeir_2012U 127.77 129.94 <o,f0,female> with each one specific function
AyahBdeir_2012U 1 AyahBdeir_2012U 130.33 133.42 <o,f0,female> they 're pre engineered to be light
AyahBdeir_2012U 1 AyahBdeir_2012U 137.3 145.89 <o,f0,female> and the best part about it is they snap together with magnets so you can 't put them the wrong way
AyahBdeir_2012U 1 AyahBdeir_2012U 145.98 158.5 <o,f0,female> the bricks are color coded green is output blue is power pink is input and orange is wire so all you need to do is snap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circuits
AyahBdeir_2012U 1 AyahBdeir_2012U 158.91 161.72 <o,f0,female> you put a blue to a green you can make light
AyahBdeir_2012U 1 AyahBdeir_2012U 162.19 164.93 <o,f0,female> you can put a knob in between
AyahBdeir_2012U 1 AyahBdeir_2012U 178.19 180.08 <o,f0,female> and now you 've made a little blinker
AyahBdeir_2012U 1 AyahBdeir_2012U 268.06 272.65 <o,f0,female> here 's an example of a project they made a motion activated confetti canon ball
AyahBdeir_2012U 1 AyahBdeir_2012U 283.72 285.33 <o,f0,female> that 's afraid of the dark
AyahBdeir_2012U 1 AyahBdeir_2012U 306.07 311.1 <o,f0,female> of contributors because this world that we live in this interactive world is ours
AyahBdeir_2012U 1 AyahBdeir_2012U 311.13 314.15 <o,f0,female> so go ahead and start inventing thank
