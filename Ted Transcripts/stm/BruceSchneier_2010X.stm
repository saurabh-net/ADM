BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 15.86 33.47 <o,f0,female> security is two different things it 's a feeling and it 's a reality and they 're different you could feel secure even if you 're not and you can be secure even if you don 't feel it really we have two separate concepts mapped onto the same word
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 33.47 48.66 <o,f0,female> and what i want to do in this talk is to split them apart figuring out when they diverge and how they converge and language is actually a problem here there aren 't a lot of good words for the concepts we 're going to talk about
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 48.66 57.29 <o,f0,female> so if you look at security from economic terms it 's a trade off every time you get some security
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 57.34 73.14 <o,f0,female> you 're always trading off something whether this is a personal decision whether you 're going to install a burglar alarm in your home or a national decision where you 're going to invade some foreign country you 're going to trade off something either money or time convenience capabilities maybe fundamental liberties
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 73.14 92.57 <o,f0,female> and the question to ask when you look at a security anything is not whether this makes us safer but whether it 's worth the trade off you 've heard in the past several years the world is safer because saddam hussein is not in power that might be true but it 's not terribly relevant the question is was it worth it
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 92.93 101.18 <o,f0,female> and you can make your own decision and then you 'll decide whether the invasion was worth it that 's how you think about security in terms of the trade off
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 104.92 118.1 <o,f0,female> some of us have a burglar alarm system at home and some of us don 't and it 'll depend on where we live whether we live alone or have a family how much cool stuff we have how much we 're willing to accept the risk of theft
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 118.7 132.08 <o,f0,female> in politics also there are different opinions a lot of times these trade offs are about more than just security and i think that 's really important now people have a natural intuition about these trade offs
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 132.38 134.2 <o,f0,female> we make them every day
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 138.08 140.5 <o,f0,female> or you in your car when you drove here
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 148.28 155.95 <o,f0,female> multiple times a day we often won 't even notice them they 're just part of being alive we all do it every species does it
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 156.22 165.5 <o,f0,female> imagine a rabbit in a field eating grass and the rabbit 's going to see a fox that rabbit will make a security trade off should i stay or should i flee
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 166.19 173.9 <o,f0,female> and if you think about it the rabbits that are good at making that trade off will tend to live and reproduce and the rabbits that are bad
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 176.75 178.47 <o,f0,female> so you 'd think that
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 179.31 183.57 <o,f0,female> us as a successful species on the planet you me everybody
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 186.97 190.37 <o,f0,female> yet it seems again and again that we 're hopelessly bad at it
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 191.85 196.14 <o,f0,female> and i think that 's a fundamentally interesting question i 'll give you the short answer
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 196.22 200.26 <o,f0,female> the answer is we respond to the feeling of security and not the reality
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 201.59 204.38 <o,f0,female> now most of the time that works
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 210.56 220.9 <o,f0,female> certainly that 's true for most of human prehistory we 've developed this ability because it makes evolutionary sense
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 236.58 253.52 <o,f0,female> now there are several biases in risk perception a lot of good experiments in this and you can see certain biases that come up again and again so i 'll give you four we tend to exaggerate spectacular and rare risks and downplay common risks so flying versus driving
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 254.22 255.98 <o,f0,male> the unknown
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 261.22 269.87 <o,f0,female> one example would be people fear kidnapping by strangers when the data supports kidnapping by relatives is much more common this is for children
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 270.56 278.93 <o,f0,female> third personified risks are perceived to be greater than anonymous risks so bin laden is scarier because he has a name
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 279.91 292.42 <o,f0,female> and the fourth is people underestimate risks in situations they do control and overestimate them in situations they don 't control so once you take up skydiving or smoking
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 292.46 294.34 <o,f0,female> you downplay the risks
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 294.77 300.7 <o,f0,female> if a risk is thrust upon you terrorism was a good example you 'll overplay it because you don 't feel like it 's in your control
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 300.84 308.17 <o,f0,female> there are a bunch of other of these biases these cognitive biases that affect our risk decisions
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 308.58 310.67 <o,f0,female> there 's the availability heuristic
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 310.82 318.61 <o,f0,female> which basically means we estimate the probability of something by how easy it is to bring instances of it to mind
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 319.57 329.88 <o,f0,female> so you can imagine how that works if you hear a lot about tiger attacks there must be a lot of tigers around you don 't hear about lion attacks there aren 't a lot of lions around this works until you invent newspapers
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 330.66 343.88 <o,f0,female> because what newspapers do is they repeat again and again rare risks i tell people if it 's in the news don 't worry about it because by definition news is something that almost never happens
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 353.44 357.55 <o,f0,female> we 're also a species of storytellers we respond to stories more than data
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 357.89 360.64 <o,f0,female> and there 's some basic innumeracy going on
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 360.7 380.22 <o,f0,female> i mean the joke one two three many is kind of right we 're really good at small numbers one mango two mangoes three mangoes ten thousand mangoes one hundred thousand mangoes it 's still more mangoes you can eat before they rot so one half one quarter one fifth we 're good at that one in a million one in a billion they 're both almost never
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 381.25 390.66 <o,f0,female> so we have trouble with the risks that aren 't very common and what these cognitive biases do is they act as filters between us and reality
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 391.04 396.36 <o,f0,female> and the result is that feeling and reality get out of whack they get different
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 406.77 409.34 <o,f0,female> i write a lot about security theater
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 409.55 414.14 <o,f0,female> which are products that make people feel secure but don 't actually do anything
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 423.36 428.83 <o,f0,female> so back to economics if economics if the market drives security
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 429.31 433.57 <o,f0,female> and if people make trade offs based on the feeling of security
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 433.94 441.01 <o,f0,female> then the smart thing for companies to do for the economic incentives are to make people feel secure
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 442.08 453.37 <o,f0,female> and there are two ways to do this one you can make people actually secure and hope they notice or two you can make people just feel secure and hope they don 't notice
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 455.52 459.06 <o,f0,female> so what makes people notice
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 466.47 469.04 <o,f0,female> but if you know stuff you 're more likely
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 469.89 483.28 <o,f0,female> to have your feelings match reality enough real world examples helps now we all know the crime rate in our neighborhood because we live there and we get a feeling about it that basically matches reality
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 484.77 489.38 <o,f0,female> security theater 's exposed when it 's obvious that it 's not working properly
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 490.97 494.08 <o,f0,female> okay so what makes people not notice
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 494.17 496.02 <o,f0,female> well a poor understanding
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 496.43 503.83 <o,f0,female> if you don 't understand the risks you don 't understand the costs you 're likely to get the trade off wrong and your feeling doesn 't match reality
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 504.19 506.28 <o,f0,female> not enough examples
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 510.68 514.45 <o,f0,female> if for example terrorism almost never happens
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 517.61 519.35 <o,f0,female> of counter terrorist measures
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 530.84 538.04 <o,f0,female> also feelings that are clouding the issues the cognitive biases i talked about earlier fears folk beliefs
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 538.52 541.29 <o,f0,female> basically an inadequate model of reality
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 543.13 545.15 <o,f0,female> so let me complicate things
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 545.15 550.04 <o,f0,female> i have feeling and reality i want to add a third element i want to add model
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 550.66 556.37 <o,f0,female> feeling and model in our head reality is the outside world it doesn 't change it 's real
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 562.21 568.51 <o,f0,female> that 's basically the difference in a primitive and simple world there 's really no reason for a model
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 570.07 573.77 <o,f0,female> because feeling is close to reality you don 't need a model
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 574.33 576.86 <o,f0,female> but in a modern and complex world
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 577.25 580.99 <o,f0,female> you need models to understand a lot of the risks we face
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 592.16 597.13 <o,f0,female> it 's of course limited by science by technology
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 598.09 602.61 <o,f0,female> we couldn 't have a germ theory of disease before we invented the microscope to see them
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 607.91 611.26 <o,f0,female> but it has the ability to override our feelings
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 617.25 629.25 <o,f0,female> culture teachers elders a couple years ago i was in south africa on safari the tracker i was with grew up in kruger national park he had some very complex models of how to survive
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 629.25 640.9 <o,f0,female> and it depended on if you were attacked by a lion or a leopard or a rhino or an elephant and when you had to run away and when you couldn 't run away and when you had to climb a tree when you could never climb a tree i would have died in a day
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 641.57 645.9 <o,f0,female> but he was born there and he understood how to survive
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 646.25 650.14 <o,f0,female> i was born in new york city i could have taken him to new york and he would have died in a day
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 658.04 660.32 <o,f0,female> models can come from the media
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 660.65 662.5 <o,f0,female> from our elected officials
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 668.39 673.41 <o,f0,female> airline safety car safety models can come from industry
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 684.29 689.5 <o,f0,female> health models are a great example think of cancer of bird flu swine flu sars
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 694.61 698.98 <o,f0,female> come from models given to us really by science filtered through the media
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 700.83 702.89 <o,f0,female> so models can change
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 703.29 708.63 <o,f0,female> models are not static as we become more comfortable in our environments
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 708.67 712.52 <o,f0,female> our model can move closer to our feelings
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 713.36 727.39 <o,f0,female> so an example might be if you go back one hundred years ago when electricity was first becoming common there were a lot of fears about it i mean there were people who were afraid to push doorbells because there was electricity in there and that was dangerous
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 734.76 738.8 <o,f0,female> our model of security around electricity
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 738.87 741.39 <o,f0,female> is something we were born into
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 751.74 755.02 <o,f0,female> how your parents approach internet security versus how you do
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 755.37 757.01 <o,f0,female> versus how our kids will
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 758.04 760.73 <o,f0,female> models eventually fade into the background
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 765.72 771.14 <o,f0,female> so as your model is close to reality and it converges with feelings you often don 't know it 's there
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 793.21 805.33 <o,f0,female> so there was that feeling of lack of control and those two things made the risk more than it was as the novelty wore off the months went by there was some amount of tolerance people got used to it
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 811.59 815.11 <o,f0,female> people thought the doctors should have solved this already
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 822.04 823.65 <o,f0,female> and acceptance
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 829.01 836.56 <o,f0,female> and when the vaccine appeared last winter there were a lot of people a surprising number who refused to get it
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 845.56 848.78 <o,f0,female> with no new information with no new input
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 850.12 852.36 <o,f0,female> this kind of thing happens a lot
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 857.96 862.81 <o,f0,female> i have a very relativistic view of security i think it depends on the observer
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 862.98 872.67 <o,f0,female> and most security decisions have a variety of people involved and stakeholders with specific
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 873.45 878.11 <o,f0,female> trade offs will try to influence the decision and i call that their agenda
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 879.43 893.54 <o,f0,female> and you see agenda this is marketing this is politics trying to convince you to have one model versus another trying to convince you to ignore a model and trust your feelings marginalizing people with models you don 't like
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 894.51 896.24 <o,f0,female> this is not uncommon
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 901.95 910.88 <o,f0,female> in the history of the past fifty years the smoking risk shows how a model changes and it also shows how an industry fights against a model it doesn 't like
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 911.74 917.04 <o,f0,female> compare that to the secondhand smoke debate probably about twenty years behind
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 931.73 933.92 <o,f0,female> all examples of models changing
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 936.33 939.9 <o,f0,female> what we learn is that changing models is hard
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 939.93 945.58 <o,f0,female> models are hard to dislodge if they equal your feelings you don 't even know you have a model
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 946.96 953.1 <o,f0,female> and there 's another cognitive bias i 'll call confirmation bias where we tend to accept data
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 953.53 957.57 <o,f0,female> that confirms our beliefs and reject data that contradicts our beliefs
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 974.32 981.36 <o,f0,female> at models that span eighty years we can do to the next harvest we can often do until our kids grow up
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 981.59 984.08 <o,f0,female> but eighty years we 're just not good at
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 984.73 987.29 <o,f0,female> so it 's a very hard model to accept
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 1003.5 1006.21 <o,f0,female> strong feelings can create a model
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 1015.9 1019.13 <o,f0,female> personal health scare a health scare in the news
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 1019.95 1023.3 <o,f0,female> you 'll see these called flashbulb events by psychiatrists
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 1023.96 1028.27 <o,f0,female> they can create a model instantaneously because they 're very emotive
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 1029.28 1033.25 <o,f0,female> so in the technological world we don 't have experience
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 1033.33 1040.43 <o,f0,female> to judge models and we rely on others we rely on proxies i mean this works as long as it 's to correct others
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 1041 1042.8 <o,f0,female> we rely on
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 1042.99 1046.17 <o,f0,female> government agencies to tell us what pharmaceuticals
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 1046.7 1052.13 <o,f0,female> are safe i flew here yesterday i didn 't check the airplane
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 1063.12 1066.81 <o,f0,female> but because we 're pretty sure the building codes here are good
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 1089.87 1100.39 <o,f0,female> now when these go out of whack you have two options one you can fix people 's feelings directly appeal to feelings it 's manipulation but it can work
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 1100.93 1105.44 <o,f0,female> the second more honest way is to actually fix the model
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 1106.53 1113.19 <o,f0,female> change happens slowly the smoking debate took forty years and that was an easy
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 1114.98 1116.93 <o,f0,female> some of this stuff is hard
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 1117.25 1132.34 <o,f0,female> i mean really though information seems like our best hope and i lied remember i said feeling model reality i said reality doesn 't change it actually does we live in a technological world reality changes all the time
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 1132.64 1140.42 <o,f0,female> so we might have for the first time in our species feeling chases model model chases reality reality 's moving they might never catch up
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 1162.88 1171.65 <o,f0,female> put poison in it closed it up put it back on the shelf someone else bought it and died this terrified people there were a couple of copycat attacks
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 1171.65 1186.74 <o,f0,female> there wasn 't any real risk but people were scared and this is how the tamper proof drug industry was invented those tamper proof caps that came from this it 's complete security theater as a homework assignment think of ten ways to get around it i 'll give you one a syringe
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 1187.6 1190.21 <o,f0,female> but it made people feel better
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 1190.48 1194.4 <o,f0,female> it made their feeling of security more match the reality
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 1208.95 1210.86 <o,f0,female> i said well that 's kind of neat
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 1211.58 1218.67 <o,f0,female> i wonder how rampant baby snatching is out of hospitals i go home i look it up it basically never happens
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 1220.31 1227.41 <o,f0,female> but if you think about it if you are a hospital and you need to take a baby away from its mother out of the room to run some tests
BruceSchneier_2010X 1 BruceSchneier_2010X 1227.43 1231.24 <o,f0,female> you better have some good security theater or she 's going to rip your arm off
