RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 48.36 53.03 <o,f0,male> and the client was saying no it 's ten thousand a day
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 67.61 79.13 <o,f0,male> it 's like every year it 's the last minute that we can do something about the war with iran it 's like if we don 't act now it 's too late forever for ten years now
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 99.87 114.46 <o,f0,male> so i went to sleep and that was it for me and later on in the night i woke up because i 'm always waking up in the night and i went by the computer and i see all these red dots you know on facebook which i 've never seen before
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 129.27 132.82 <o,f0,male> which is what
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 132.82 148.23 <o,f0,male> because you have to understand in israel we don 't talk with people from iran we don 't know people from iran it 's like on facebook you have friends only from it 's like your neighbors are your friends on facebook
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 148.52 157.68 <o,f0,male> and now people from iran are talking to me so i start answering this girl and she 's telling me she saw the poster and
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 225.24 241.64 <o,f0,male> give me a picture i will make you a poster and that 's how it started and that 's how really it 's unleashed because suddenly people from facebook friends and others just understand that they can be part of it it 's not just one dude making one poster it 's
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 241.64 250.35 <o,f0,male> we can be part of it so they start sending me pictures and ask me make me a poster post it tell the iranians we from israel love you too
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 250.35 259.06 <o,f0,male> it became you know at some point it was really really intense i mean so many pictures so i asked friends
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 259.06 271.07 <o,f0,male> to come graphic designers most of them to make posters with me because i didn 't have the time it was a huge amount of pictures so for a few days that 's how my living room was
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 271.07 280.42 <o,f0,male> and we received israeli posters israeli images but also lots of comments lots of messages from iran
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 280.42 292.37 <o,f0,male> and we took these messages and we made posters out of it because i know people they don 't read they see images if it 's an image they may read it so here are a few of them
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 303.95 314.88 <o,f0,male> on an israeli flag to enter her school every morning and now that she sees the posters that we 're sending she starts she said that she changed her mind and now
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 314.88 327.02 <o,f0,male> she loves that blue she loves that star and she loves that flag talking about the israeli flag and she wished that we 'd meet and come to visit one another and just a few days after i posted the first poster
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 347.59 356.74 <o,f0,male> and now it 's communication it 's a two way story it 's israelis and iranians sending the same message one to each other
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 374.85 386.31 <o,f0,male> and then it became news because when you 're seeing the middle east you see only the bad news and suddenly there is something that was happening
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 402.94 418.33 <o,f0,male> so she said everybody in palestine in where israel who is everybody everybody they said syria syria lebanon lebanon at some point he just said forty million people are going to see you today
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 427.17 439.27 <o,f0,male> something crazy also happened every time a country started talking about it like germany america wherever a page on facebook popped up with
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 439.27 450.88 <o,f0,male> the same logo with the same stories so at the beginning we had iran loves israel which is an iranian sitting in tehran saying okay israel loves iran
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 450.88 466.61 <o,f0,male> i give you iran loves israel you have palestine loves israel you have lebanon that just a few days ago and this whole list of pages on facebook dedicated to the same message to people sending their love one to each other
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 468.91 483.2 <o,f0,male> the moment i really understood that something was happening a friend of mine told me google the word israel and those were the first images on those days that popped up from google
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 483.2 501.9 <o,f0,male> when you were typing israel or iran we really changed how people see the middle east because you 're not in the middle east you 're somewhere over there and then you want to see the middle east so you go on google and you say israel and they give you the bad stuff and for a few days you got those images
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 501.9 517.27 <o,f0,male> today the israel loves iran page is this number eighty thousand eight hundred and thirty one and two million people last week went on the page and shared liked i don 't know commented on one of the photos so for
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 517.39 523.07 <o,f0,male> five months now that 's what we are doing me michal a few of my friends
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 570.28 574.48 <o,f0,male> and we 're understanding
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 574.48 577.49 <o,f0,male> and you show compassion and you become friends
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 581.27 589.03 <o,f0,male> and at some point you become friends on facebook and you become friends in life you can go and travel and meet people
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 589.03 592.47 <o,f0,male> and i was in munich a few weeks ago
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 592.47 597.95 <o,f0,male> i went there to open an exposition about iran and i met there with people
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 597.95 612.54 <o,f0,male> from the page that told me okay you 're going to be in europe i 'm coming i 'm coming from france from holland from germany of course and from israel people came and we just met there for the first time in real life i met with people that
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 612.55 632.22 <o,f0,male> are supposed to be my enemies for the first time and we just shake hands and have a coffee and a nice discussion and we talk about food and basketball and that was the end of it remember that image from the beginning at some point we met in real life and we became friends
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 632.22 635.87 <o,f0,female> and
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 654.66 670.74 <o,f0,male> to come to israel and she gets on the plane and arrives at ben gurion and says okay not that big a deal so a few weeks ago the stress is getting higher
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 670.74 674.06 <o,f0,male> so we start this new campaign called
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 674.06 683.08 <o,f0,male> not ready to die in your war i mean it 's plus minus the same message but we wanted really to add some aggressivity to it
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 683.08 701.45 <o,f0,male> and again something amazing happened something that we didn 't have on the first wave of the campaign now people from iran the same ones who were shy at the first campaign and just sent you know their foot and half their faces now they 're sending their faces and they 're saying okay
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 701.45 704.94 <o,f0,male> no problem we 're into it we are with you
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 709.26 718.2 <o,f0,male> just read where those guys are from and for every guy from israel you 've got someone from iran
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 726.25 728.06 <o,f0,male> just people sending their pictures
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 746.16 750.43 <o,f0,female> so
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 757.93 766.8 <o,f0,male> so you may ask yourself who is this dude
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 766.8 779.32 <o,f0,male> my name is ronny edry and i 'm forty one i 'm an israeli i 'm a father of two i 'm a husband and i 'm a graphic designer i 'm teaching graphic design
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 789.9 809.74 <o,f0,male> i was in the army i was in the paratroopers for three years and i know how it looks from the ground i know how it can look really bad so to me this is the courageous thing to do to try to reach the other side before it 's too late
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 814.97 830.55 <o,f0,male> sometimes but maybe with effort we can avoid it maybe as people because especially in israel we 're in a democracy we have the freedom of speech and maybe that little thing can change something
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 830.55 835.73 <o,f0,male> and really we can be our own ambassadors we can just
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 835.73 839.2 <o,f0,male> send a message and hope for the best
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 854.19 868.07 <o,f0,male> change something just raise that exactly and i 'm just going to take a picture of it and i 'm just going to post it on facebook with kind of israelis for peace or something
RonnyEdry_2012X 1 RonnyEdry_2012X 869.58 878.85 <o,f0,male> oh my god don 't cry thank you guys
