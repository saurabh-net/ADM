PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 61.91 67.74 <o,f0,male> by writing critical articles or inspiring books
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 67.97 75.56 <o,f0,male> by starting up sustainable businesses and you all have chosen your own instruments
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 75.89 82.7 <o,f0,male> to fulfill this mission of creating a better world some chose the microscope
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 120.27 124.79 <o,f0,male> ladies and gentlemen
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 139.19 144.7 <o,f0,male> i did not choose to take up
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 144.93 159.32 <o,f0,male> the pen the brush the camera i chose this instrument i chose the gun for you
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 159.35 167.08 <o,f0,male> and you heard already being so close to this gun may make you feel uneasy
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 167.08 184.25 <o,f0,male> it may even feel scary a real gun at a few feet 's distance let us stop for a moment and feel this uneasiness you could even hear it let us cherish the fact
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 199.24 216.84 <o,f0,male> it means soldiers are not needed to patrol our streets guns are not a part of our lives in many countries it is a different story in many countries
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 216.85 235.8 <o,f0,male> people are confronted with guns they are oppressed they are intimidated by warlords by terrorists by criminals weapons can do a lot of harm they are the cause of much distress
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 236.21 254.08 <o,f0,male> why then am i standing before you with this weapon why did i choose the gun as my instrument today i want to tell you why today i want to tell you why i chose the gun to create a better world
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 266.65 271.71 <o,f0,male> in the east of the netherlands the city where i was born
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 272.33 274.72 <o,f0,male> my father
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 275.27 278.82 <o,f0,male> was a hardworking baker
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 278.82 297.47 <o,f0,male> but when he had finished work in the bakery he often told me and my brother stories and most of the time he told me this story i 'm going to share with you now the story of what happened when he was a conscripted soldier
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 297.58 317.56 <o,f0,male> in the dutch armed forces at the beginning of the second world war the nazis invaded the netherlands their grim plans were evident they meant to rule by means of repression diplomacy had failed to stop the germans
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 317.78 319.86 <o,f0,male> only brute force
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 345.72 347.63 <o,f0,male> on the bank of the river waal
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 360.25 368.85 <o,f0,male> he fired nothing happened he fired again no german soldier fell to the ground
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 368.85 378.46 <o,f0,male> my father had been given an old gun that could not even reach the opposite riverbank
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 378.46 381.66 <o,f0,male> hitler 's troops marched on
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 393.62 403.57 <o,f0,male> he could have done something but with an old gun not even the best marksman in the armed forces could have hit the mark
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 403.57 421.99 <o,f0,male> so this story stayed with me then in high school i was gripped by the stories of the allied soldiers soldiers who left the safety of their own homes and risked their lives to liberate a country
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 421.99 432.15 <o,f0,male> and a people that they didn 't know they liberated my birth town it was then that i decided
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 432.36 443.58 <o,f0,male> i would take up the gun out of respect and gratitude for those men and women who came to liberate us
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 443.58 454.99 <o,f0,male> from the awareness that sometimes only the gun can stand between good and evil and that
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 469.7 476.77 <o,f0,male> to defend democratic values to stand up for the freedom we have
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 477.13 483.81 <o,f0,male> to talk here today in amsterdam about how we can make the world a better place
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 491.59 495.07 <o,f0,male> i do not like guns
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 495.07 513.62 <o,f0,male> and once you have been under fire yourself it brings home even more clearly that a gun is not some macho instrument to brag about i stand here today to tell you about the use of the gun as an instrument
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 513.72 525.05 <o,f0,male> of peace and stability the gun may be one of the most important instruments of peace and stability that we have in this world
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 525.12 528.89 <o,f0,male> now this may sound contradictory to you
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 572.75 581.28 <o,f0,male> since the end of the cold war statistics show that we are living in a relatively peaceful era
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 581.28 596.42 <o,f0,male> why why has violence decreased has the human mind changed well we were talking on the human mind this morning did we simply lose our beastly impulses for revenge
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 596.45 604.99 <o,f0,male> for violent rituals for pure rage or is there something else
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 605 608.37 <o,f0,male> in his latest book harvard professor steven pinker
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 651.15 658.6 <o,f0,male> such a state monopoly on violence first of all serves as a reassurance
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 658.6 666.19 <o,f0,male> it removes the incentive for an arms race between potentially hostile groups in our societies
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 666.58 682.26 <o,f0,male> secondly the presence of penalties that outweigh the benefits of using violence tips the balance even further abstaining from violence becomes more profitable than starting a war
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 701.15 717.46 <o,f0,male> with trade there 's mutual interdependency and mutual gain between parties and when there is mutual gain both sides stand to lose more than they would gain if they started a war
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 727.27 733 <o,f0,male> this ladies and gentlemen is the rationale behind the existence
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 733.02 749.7 <o,f0,male> of my armed forces the armed forces implement the state monopoly on violence we do this in a legitimized way only after our democracy has asked us to do so
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 749.7 763.46 <o,f0,male> it is this legitimate controlled use of the gun that has contributed greatly to the statistics of war conflict and violence around the globe
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 771.87 788.82 <o,f0,male> my soldiers use the gun as an instrument of peace and this is exactly why failed states are so dangerous failed states have no legitimized democratically controlled use of force
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 789.42 796.03 <o,f0,male> failed states do not know of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 796.03 810.02 <o,f0,male> that is why failed states can drag down a whole region into chaos and conflict that is why spreading the concept of the constitutional state is such an important aspect
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 810.06 829.1 <o,f0,male> of our foreign missions that is why we are trying to build a judicial system right now in afghanistan that is why we train police officers we train judges we train public prosecutors around the world and that is why
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 829.13 832.34 <o,f0,male> and in the netherlands we are very unique in that
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 845.23 855 <o,f0,male> ladies and gentlemen looking at this gun we are confronted with the ugly side of the human mind
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 855 873.77 <o,f0,male> every day i hope that politicians diplomats development workers can turn conflict into peace and threat into hope and i hope that one day armies can be disbanded
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 873.77 879.74 <o,f0,male> and humans will find a way of living together without violence and oppression
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 879.74 891.99 <o,f0,male> but until that day comes we will have to make ideals and human failure meet somewhere in the middle
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 892.02 904.21 <o,f0,male> until that day comes i stand for my father who tried to shoot the nazis with an old gun i stand for my men and women
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 904.42 914.26 <o,f0,male> who are prepared to risk their lives for a less violent world for all of us i stand for this soldier
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 914.66 922.5 <o,f0,male> who suffered partial hearing loss and sustained permanent injuries to her leg which was hit
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 922.58 925.63 <o,f0,male> by a rocket on a mission in afghanistan
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 927.92 929.44 <o,f0,male> ladies and gentlemen
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 929.54 934 <o,f0,male> until the day comes when we can do away with the gun
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 945.21 948.28 <o,f0,male> often behind the scenes
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 948.28 954.09 <o,f0,male> it takes good equipment and well trained dedicated soldiers
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 965.02 974.31 <o,f0,male> instead of the bad gun my father was given i hope you will support our soldiers when they are out there
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 974.31 976.63 <o,f0,male> when they come home
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 976.63 992.35 <o,f0,male> and when they are injured and need our care they put their lives on the line for us for you and we cannot let them down i hope you will respect
PetervanUhm_2011X 1 PetervanUhm_2011X 992.49 1010.18 <o,f0,male> my soldiers this soldier with this gun because she wants a better world because she makes an active contribution to the better world just like all of us here today thank you very much
