ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 18 24.42 <o,f0,male> this is a hand lettered sign that appeared in a mom and pop bakery in my old neighborhood in brooklyn a few years ago
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 24.56 35.8 <o,f0,male> the store owned one of those machines that can print on plates of sugar and kids could bring in drawings and have the store print a sugar plate for the top of their birthday
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 52.85 61.78 <o,f0,male> and it 's a copyright violation and policing copyright violations for children 's birthday cakes was such a hassle
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 72.04 75.67 <o,f0,male> you have to use one of our prefab images
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 80.88 83.06 <o,f0,male> one is called sopa the other is called
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 108.54 115.94 <o,f0,male> of copyright compliance to the point where people simply get out of the business of offering it as a capability
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 133.14 136.31 <o,f0,male> now the domain name system is the thing that turns human readable names like
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 155.87 160.76 <o,f0,male> and you 'd think that would be a pretty big problem for a law but congress seems not to have let that bother them
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 171.59 178.42 <o,f0,male> so the policing layer around the problem becomes the real threat
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 204.29 209.44 <o,f0,male> if you were making a tv show it didn 't have to be better than all other tv shows ever made
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 210.17 215.29 <o,f0,male> it only had to be better than the two other shows that were on at the same
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 234.28 238.21 <o,f0,male> this is like having a license to print money and a barrel of free
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 267.99 272.13 <o,f0,male> we do like to consume but every time one of these new tools came
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 272.25 276.03 <o,f0,male> it turned out we also like to produce and we like to share
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 276.59 284.75 <o,f0,male> and this freaked the media businesses out it freaked them out every time jack valenti who was the head lobbyist for the motion picture association of america
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 284.93 297.09 <o,f0,male> once likened the ferocious video cassette recorder to jack the ripper and poor helpless hollywood to a woman at home alone that was the level of rhetoric
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 298.04 302.99 <o,f0,male> and so the media industries begged insisted demanded that congress do something
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 335.22 337.64 <o,f0,male> but this taping business fine
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 359.84 372.76 <o,f0,male> on the idea of legal versus illegal distinctions for copying because it was clear that if congress was acting in their framework they might actually increase the rights of citizens to participate in our own media
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 388.44 392.97 <o,f0,male> was that it was legal to sell you uncopyable digital material
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 393.28 407.42 <o,f0,male> except that there 's no such things as uncopyable digital material it would be as ed felton once famously said like handing out water that wasn 't wet bits are copyable that 's what computers do that is a side effect of their ordinary operation
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 407.43 427.07 <o,f0,male> so in order to fake the ability to sell uncopyable bits the dmca also made it legal to force you to use systems that broke the copying function of your devices every dvd player and game player and television and computer you brought home no matter what you thought you were getting when you bought
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 452.5 461.08 <o,f0,male> on the legal system of distinguishing between legal and illegal copying and simply tried to prevent copying through technical
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 478.06 486.87 <o,f0,male> the mixtape the fanzine that was nothing compared to what we 're seeing now with the internet we are in a world where most
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 510.42 524.43 <o,f0,male> but where the dmca was surgical we want to go down into your computer we want to go down into your television set down into your game machine and prevent it from doing what they said it would do at the store pipa and sopa are nuclear
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 545.5 550.72 <o,f0,male> and because the biggest producers of content on the internet are not
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 556.97 558.51 <o,f0,male> because in the end
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 567.87 574 <o,f0,male> so what pipa and sopa risk doing is taking a centuries old legal concept
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 574.26 577.07 <o,f0,male> innocent until proven guilty and reversing
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 579.47 581.13 <o,f0,male> you can 't share
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 581.55 584.41 <o,f0,male> until you show us
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 584.59 587.54 <o,f0,male> that you 're not sharing something we don
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 601.65 607.08 <o,f0,male> to police a user that will crush a service with a hundred million
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 610.13 615.17 <o,f0,male> imagine this sign everywhere except imagine it doesn 't say college bakery
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 648.39 654.17 <o,f0,male> and the people who provide those capabilities to us the youtubes the facebooks the twitters
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 675.17 677.52 <o,f0,male> call your representative call your senator
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 685.47 692.74 <o,f0,male> what you see is that they have cumulatively received millions and millions of dollars from the traditional media
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 700.35 702.97 <o,f0,male> and you can ask not to be treated like a thief
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 708.73 718.22 <o,f0,male> and if you 're not an american citizen you can contact american citizens that you know and encourage them to do the same because this seems like a national issue but it is not
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 750.97 757.86 <o,f0,male> because the whole business of actually suggesting that someone is breaking the law and then gathering evidence and proving
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 758.01 760.12 <o,f0,male> that that turns out to be really inconvenient
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 789.11 790.65 <o,f0,male> we convince
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 790.98 796.87 <o,f0,male> congress that the way to deal with copyright violation is the way copyright
ClayShirky_2012S 1 ClayShirky_2012S 807.7 815.6 <o,f0,male> that 's the way to handle this in the meantime the hard thing to do is to be ready because that 's the real message
