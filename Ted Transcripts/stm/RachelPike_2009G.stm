RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 16.46 30.78 <o,f0,female> i'd like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog they are both two branches of the same field of atmospheric science
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 39.29 49.51 <o,f0,female> that report was written by six hundred and twenty scientists from forty countries they wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic and all of those pages were reviewed by another four hundred plus scientists and reviewers
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 75.96 84.75 <o,f0,female> and in each one of these research areas of which there are even more there are phd students like me and we study incredibly narrow topics things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 130.18 140.80 <o,f0,female> our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each on minute timescales and it takes weeks to perform our integrations and we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what's happening
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 141.27 150.09 <o,f0,female> we also fly all over the world looking for this thing i recently joined a field campaign in malaysia there are others we found a global atmospheric watchtower there in the middle of the
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 182.61 193.02 <o,f0,female> we hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering we have to get special flight clearance and as you come around the banks in these valleys the forces can get up to two gs and the scientists have to be completely harnessed in in order to make measurements while
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 193.87 202.40 <o,f0,female> so as you can imagine the inside of this aircraft doesn't look like any plane you would take on vacation it's a flying laboratory that we took to make measurements in the region of this molecule
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 203.43 212.30 <o,f0,female> we do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule and when one student like me has some sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule they write one scientific paper on the subject
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 223.15 232.11 <o,f0,female> an assessment like the ipcc although we have others and each one of the eleven chapters of the ipcc has six to ten subsections so you can imagine the scale of the
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 233.40 243.86 <o,f0,female> each one of those assessments that we write we always tag on a summary and the summary is written for a non scientific audience and we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers in order to make headlines like these
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 244.85 246.57 <o,f0,female> thank you very much
