ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 16.87 24.77 <o,f0,male> just right left right left yeah i mean we've been doing it for two million years so it's kind of arrogant to assume that i've got something to say
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 27.07 35.60 <o,f0,male> better a long time ago but the cool thing about running as i've discovered is that something bizarre happens in this activity all the time case in point
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 36.03 44.75 <o,f0,male> a couple months ago if you saw the new york city marathon i guarantee you you saw something that no one has ever seen before an ethiopian woman named derartu
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 45.41 54.33 <o,f0,male> turns up at the starting line she's thirty seven years old she hasn't won a marathon of any kind in eight years and a few months previous she almost died in childbirth
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 65.72 76.61 <o,f0,male> except bad news for derartu tulu some other people had the same idea including the olympic gold medalist and paula radcliffe who is a monster the fastest woman marathoner in history
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 85.11 89.45 <o,f0,male> the gun goes off and she's not even an underdog she's under the underdogs
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 90.01 97.62 <o,f0,male> but the under underdog hangs tough and twenty two miles into a twenty six mile race there is derartu tulu up there with the lead pack
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 98.68 100.85 <o,f0,male> now this is when something really bizarre happens
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 101.40 110.11 <o,f0,male> paula radcliffe the one person who is sure to snatch the big paycheck out of derartu tulu 's under underdog hands suddenly grabs her leg and starts to fall back
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 119.00 123.78 <o,f0,male> ruins the script instead of taking off she falls back and she grabs paula radcliffe says come on
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 138.57 139.07 <o,f0,male> go
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 146.88 155.46 <o,f0,male> except derartu tulu ruins the script again instead of losing she blazes past the lead pack and wins wins the new york city marathon goes home with a big fat check
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 156.93 163.63 <o,f0,male> it's a heartwarming story but if you drill a little bit deeper you've got to sort of wonder about what exactly was going on there
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 163.99 172.22 <o,f0,male> you have two outliers in one organism it's not a coincidence when you have someone who is more competitive and more compassionate than anybody else in the race
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 183.51 195.26 <o,f0,male> can be found down in the copper canyons of mexico where there's a tribe a reclusive tribe called the tarahumara indians now the tarahumara are remarkable for three things number one is
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 195.68 205.93 <o,f0,male> they have been living essentially unchanged for the past four hundred years when the conquistadors arrived in north america you had two choices you either fight back and engage or you could take off
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 206.28 214.82 <o,f0,male> the mayans and aztecs engaged which is why there are very few mayans and aztecs the tarahumara had a different strategy they took off and hid in this
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 227.65 235.84 <o,f0,male> the second thing remarkable about the tarahumara is deep into old age seventy to eighty years old these guys aren't running marathons
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 236.06 248.81 <o,f0,male> they're running mega marathons they're not doing twenty six miles they're doing one hundred one hundred and fifty miles at a time and apparently without injury without problems the last thing that's remarkable about the tarahumara is that all the things that
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 268.11 272.45 <o,f0,male> so what's the connection again we're talking about outliers there's got to be some kind of cause and effect there
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 273.06 287.36 <o,f0,male> well there are teams of scientists at harvard and the university of utah that are bending their brains to try to figure out what the tarahumara have known forever they're trying to solve those same kinds of mysteries and once again a mystery wrapped inside of a mystery
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 303.60 310.80 <o,f0,male> the human brain exploded in size australopithecus had a tiny little pea brain suddenly humans show up homo erectus big old melon head
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 311.24 320.20 <o,f0,male> to have a brain of that size you need to have a source of condensed caloric energy in other words early humans are eating dead animals no argument that's a fact
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 321.92 328.40 <o,f0,male> is the first edged weapons only appeared about two hundred thousand years ago so somehow for nearly two million years
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 328.83 336.88 <o,f0,male> we are killing animals without any weapons now we're not using our strength because we are the biggest sissies in the jungle every other animal is stronger than we are
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 337.07 345.02 <o,f0,male> they have fangs they have claws they have nimbleness they have speed we think usain bolt is fast usain bolt can get his ass kicked by a squirrel we're not
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 345.94 349.07 <o,f0,male> that would be an olympic event turn a squirrel loose whoever catches the squirrel you get a gold medal
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 351.24 355.22 <o,f0,male> no weapons no speed no strength no fangs no claws how were we killing these animals
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 381.08 387.19 <o,f0,male> but you get to the marathon we were just talking about you guys have only been allowed to run the marathon for twenty years because prior to the nineteen eighties
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 406.50 408.45 <o,f0,male> and i've yet to see any
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 434.64 442.73 <o,f0,male> runner like ann trason or nikki kimball or jenn shelton you put them in a race of fifty or one hundred miles against anybody in the world and it's a coin toss who 's
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 444.50 453.33 <o,f0,male> a couple years ago emily baer signed up for a race called the hardrock one hundred which tells you all you need to know about the race they give you forty eight hours to finish this race
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 477.23 485.77 <o,f0,male> if you start running the marathon at age nineteen you will get progressively faster year by year until you reach your peak at age twenty seven and then after that you succumb to the
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 487.17 498.93 <o,f0,male> rigors of time and you'll get slower and slower until eventually you're back to running the same speed you were at age nineteen so about seven years eight years to reach your peak and then gradually you fall off your peak until you go back to the starting point
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 499.95 505.73 <o,f0,male> you would think it might take eight years to go back to the same speed maybe ten years no it's forty five years
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 506.09 516.00 <o,f0,male> sixty year old men and women are running as fast as they were at age nineteen now i defy you to come up with any other physical activity and please don't say golf something that actually is hard
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 517.66 524.06 <o,f0,male> where geriatrics are performing as well as they did as teenagers so you have these three mysteries
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 525.03 528.34 <o,f0,male> is there one piece in the puzzle which might wrap all these things up
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 538.20 548.20 <o,f0,male> but i'll submit this to you if you put one piece in the middle of this jigsaw puzzle suddenly it all starts to form a coherent picture if you wonder why is it the tarahumara don't fight and don't die of heart disease
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 548.54 558.13 <o,f0,male> why a poor ethiopian woman named derartu tulu can be the most compassionate and yet the most competitive and why we somehow were able to find food without weapons
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 567.92 577.53 <o,f0,male> we evolved as a hunting pack animal because the one advantage we have in the wilderness again it's not our fangs and our claws and our speed the only thing we do really really well
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 577.99 584.20 <o,f0,male> is sweat we're really good at being sweaty and smelly better than any other mammal on earth we can sweat really well
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 585.09 593.78 <o,f0,male> but the advantage of that little bit of social discomfort is the fact that when it comes to running under hot heat for long distances
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 594.16 603.29 <o,f0,male> we're superb we're the best on the planet you take a horse on a hot day and after five or six miles that horse has a choice it's either going to breathe or it's going to cool off
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 603.64 612.31 <o,f0,male> but it ain't doing both we can so what if we evolved as hunting pack animals what if the only natural advantage we had in the world
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 612.66 620.45 <o,f0,male> was the fact that we could get together as a group go out there on that african savannah pick out an antelope and go out as a pack and run that thing to death
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 646.53 654.62 <o,f0,male> those expert trackers have got to be part of the pack they can't be ten miles behind you need to have the women and the adolescents there because the two times in your life you most benefit
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 695.05 699.24 <o,f0,male> in other words is a culture remarkably similar to the tarahumara
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 699.76 703.32 <o,f0,male> a tribe that has remained unchanged since the stone age
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 704.08 705.95 <o,f0,male> it's a really compelling argument that maybe the
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 727.21 735.15 <o,f0,male> how do we spoil it well how do we spoil anything we try to cash in on it we try to can it and package it and make it better and sell it to people
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 735.44 742.46 <o,f0,male> and what happened was we started creating these fancy cushioned things which make running better called running shoes
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 773.75 784.65 <o,f0,male> any kind of myths any kind of tall tales running is always associated with freedom and vitality and youthfulness and eternal vigor it's only in our lifetime that running has become associated with fear and pain
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 804.59 815.24 <o,f0,male> i didn't do yoga i'm not ready humans ran and ran all the time we are here today we have our digital technology all of our science comes from the fact that our ancestors
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 815.67 825.23 <o,f0,male> able to do something extraordinary every day which was just rely on their naked feet and legs to run long distances so how do we get back to that again well i would submit to you the first thing is
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 825.83 834.28 <o,f0,male> get rid of all packaging all the sales all the marketing get rid of all the stinking running shoes stop focusing on urban marathons which if you do
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 834.78 846.71 <o,f0,male> four hours you suck if you do three fifty nine point five nine you're awesome because you qualified for another race we need to get back to that sense of playfulness and joyfulness and i would say nakedness that has made the
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 848.26 850.47 <o,f0,male> the healthiest and serene cultures in our time
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 858.58 872.08 <o,f0,male> a little too extreme about this imagine a world where everybody could go out their door and engage in the kind of exercise that's going to make them more relaxed more serene more healthy
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 881.95 891.67 <o,f0,male> and what the tarahumara have always been i don't say let 's go back to the copper canyons and live on corn and maiz which is the tarahumara 's preferred diet but maybe there's somewhere in between
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 892.36 900.01 <o,f0,male> and if we find that thing maybe there is a big fat nobel prize out there because if somebody could find a way to restore
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 912.05 921.50 <o,f0,male> so what i've been seeing today is there is a growing subculture of barefoot runners people who got rid of their shoes and what they have found uniformly is you get rid of
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 1 ChristopherMcDougall_2010X 922.17 931.03 <o,f0,male> you get rid of the stress you get rid of the injuries and the ailments and what you find is something the tarahumara have know for a very long time that this can be a whole lot of
