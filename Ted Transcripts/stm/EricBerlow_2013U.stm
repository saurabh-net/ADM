EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 17.62 33.82 <o,f0,male> and we met a couple years ago when we discovered that we had both given a short ted talk about the ecology of war and we realized that we were connected by the ideas we shared before we ever met and then we thought you know there are thousands of other talks out there especially tedx talks that are popping up all over the world
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 33.82 39.83 <o,f0,male> how are they connected and what does that global conversation look like so sean 's going to tell you a little bit about how we did that
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 55.51 71.45 <o,f0,male> and so of course if you 're going to do this kind of stuff you need a lot of data so the data that you 've got is a great thing called youtube and we can go down and basically pull all the open information from youtube all the comments all the views who 's watching it where are they watching it what are they saying in the comments
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 71.45 79.55 <o,f0,male> but we can also pull up using speech to text translation we can pull the entire transcript and that works even for people with kind of funny accents like myself
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 90.73 98.53 <o,f0,male> and we take those key concepts and they sort of form this mathematical structure of an idea and we call that the meme ome
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 98.53 106.88 <o,f0,male> and the meme ome you know quite simply is the mathematics that underlies an idea and we can do some pretty interesting analysis with it which i want to share with you now
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 106.88 116.73 <o,f0,male> so each idea has its own meme ome and each idea is unique with that but of course ideas they borrow from each other they kind of steal sometimes and they certainly build on each other
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 116.73 130.11 <o,f0,male> and we can go through mathematically and take the meme ome from one talk and compare it to the meme ome from every other talk and if there 's a similarity between the two of them we can create a link and represent that as a graph just like eric and i are connected
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 130.11 134.26 <o,f0,male> so that 's theory that 's great let 's see how it works in actual practice
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 134.26 144.28 <o,f0,male> so what we 've got here now is the global footprint of all the tedx talks over the last four years exploding out around the world from new york all the way down to little old new zealand in the corner
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 144.28 160.04 <o,f0,male> and what we did on this is we analyzed the top twenty five percent of these and we started to see where the connections occurred where they connected with each other cameron russell talking about image and beauty connected over into europe we 've got a bigger conversation about israel and palestine radiating outwards from the middle east
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 160.04 167.57 <o,f0,male> and we 've got something a little broader like big data with a truly global footprint reminiscent of a conversation that is happening everywhere
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 167.57 185.52 <o,f0,male> so from this we kind of run up against the limits of what we can actually do with a geographic projection but luckily computer technology allows us to go out into multidimensional space so we can take in our network projection and apply a physics engine to this and the similar talks kind of smash together and the different ones fly apart and what we 're left with is something quite beautiful
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 227.67 244.57 <o,f0,male> so as we go in here what we start to see apply the physics engine again we see what 's one conversation is actually composed of many smaller ones the structure starts to emerge where we see a kind of fractal behavior of the words and the language that we use to describe the things that are important to us all around this world
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 244.57 263.25 <o,f0,male> so you 've got food economy and local food at the top you 've got greenhouse gases solar and nuclear waste what you 're getting is a range of smaller conversations each connected to each other through the ideas and the language they share creating a broader concept of the environment and of course from here we can go and zoom in and see well what are young people looking at
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 263.25 269.72 <o,f0,male> and they 're looking at energy technology and nuclear fusion this is their kind of resonance for the conversation around the environment
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 269.72 277.4 <o,f0,male> if we split along gender lines we can see females resonating heavily with food economy but also out there in hope and optimism
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 295.08 313.66 <o,f0,male> now often when we 're faced with this amount of content we do a couple of things to simplify it we might just say well what are the most popular talks out there and a few rise to the surface there 's a talk about gratitude there 's another one about personal health and nutrition and of course there 's got to be one about porn right
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 313.66 325.42 <o,f0,male> and so then we might say well gratitude that was last year what 's trending now what 's the popular talk now and we can see that the new emerging top trending topic is about digital privacy
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 325.42 336.69 <o,f0,male> so this is great it simplifies things but there 's so much creative content that 's just buried at the bottom and i hate that how do we bubble stuff up to the surface that 's maybe really creative and interesting
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 336.69 340.61 <o,f0,male> well we can go back to the network structure of ideas to do that
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 341.02 356.76 <o,f0,male> remember it 's that network structure that is creating these emergent topics and let 's say we could take two of them like cities and genetics and say well are there any talks that creatively bridge these two really different disciplines and that 's essentially this kind of creative remix is one of the hallmarks of innovation
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 356.76 362.8 <o,f0,male> well here 's one by jessica green about the microbial ecology of buildings it 's literally defining a new field
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 362.8 370.55 <o,f0,male> and we could go back to those topics and say well what talks are central to those conversations in the cities cluster one of the most central was one by
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 373.68 389.65 <o,f0,male> and in the genetics cluster we have a talk about synthetic biology by craig venter these are talks that are linking many talks within their discipline we could go the other direction and say well what are talks that are broadly synthesizing a lot of different kinds of fields we used a measure of ecological diversity to get this
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 389.65 402.14 <o,f0,male> like a talk by steven pinker on the history of violence very synthetic and then of course there are talks that are so unique they 're kind of out in the stratosphere in their own special place and we call that the colleen flanagan index
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 402.25 412.07 <o,f0,male> and if you don 't know colleen she 's an artist and i asked her well what 's it like out there in the stratosphere of our idea space and apparently it smells like bacon i wouldn 't know
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 412.08 427.96 <o,f0,male> so we 're using these network motifs to find talks that are unique ones that are creatively synthesizing a lot of different fields ones that are central to their topic and ones that are really creatively bridging disparate fields okay we never would have found those with our obsession with what 's trending now
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 427.96 434.75 <o,f0,male> and all of this comes from the architecture of complexity or the patterns of how things are connected
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 438.01 440.47 <o,f0,male> that 's massively complex
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 440.48 444.66 <o,f0,male> and we 've been using algorithms to kind of filter it down so we can navigate through it
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 444.66 448.94 <o,f0,male> and those algorithms whilst being kind of useful are also very very narrow
