BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 44.47 46.55 <o,f0,male> people remember pictures long after they've
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 62.76 64.63 <o,f0,male> in a tough neighborhood
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 67.53 69.32 <o,f0,male> wednesday afternoon i was walking down
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 81.64 82.15 <o,f0,male> the
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 87.44 89.39 <o,f0,male> never seen anything like that before
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 92.03 95.81 <o,f0,male> the art room and i said what is that and he said ceramics and who are you
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 102.68 104.75 <o,f0,male> to sign a piece of paper that says you can
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 106.81 109.33 <o,f0,male> so for the remaining two years of my high school
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 130.01 131.54 <o,f0,male> and i don't want it on my conscience
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 132.27 133.29 <o,f0,male> school and i'm taking you with
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 134.56 138.64 <o,f0,male> he drove me out to the university of pittsburgh where i filled out a college application
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 148.57 152.47 <o,f0,male> the guy who came from the neighborhood
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 152.60 159.64 <o,f0,male> who got into the place on probation don't give up on the poor kids because you never know what's going to happen to those children
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 160.48 161.60 <o,f0,male> in life
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 162.68 164.38 <o,f0,male> i'm going to show you for a couple of minutes
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 167.40 168.10 <o,f0,male> i
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 173.20 174.55 <o,f0,male> one is called bidwell training
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 174.77 178.52 <o,f0,male> center it is a vocational school for ex steel workers and
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 180.65 180.79 <o,f0,male> the
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 213.99 215.01 <o,f0,male> in very close
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 223.43 223.57 <o,f0,male> as
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 225.29 228.60 <o,f0,male> and last year i spoke at his memorial service
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 234.07 237.01 <o,f0,male> i went out and hired a student of frank lloyd wright
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 257.51 260.68 <o,f0,male> built in a tough neighborhood where people have been given up for
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 264.69 266.11 <o,f0,male> the life of
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 269.77 274.54 <o,f0,male> look like the solution and not the problem as you can
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 282.96 283.16 <o,f0,male> it
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 292.45 294.32 <o,f0,male> their courtyard i noticed that they had a
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 313.28 313.74 <o,f0,male> life
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 321.61 323.31 <o,f0,male> before you ever give them a speech
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 325.14 325.47 <o,f0,male> and
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 355.62 356.51 <o,f0,male> in my view
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 358.05 359.07 <o,f0,male> is this kind of
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 364.44 365.81 <o,f0,male> we also
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 366.95 369.68 <o,f0,male> created a boardroom
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 370.03 376.80 <o,f0,male> and i hired a japanese cabinetmaker from kyoto japan and commissioned him to do sixty pieces of furniture for our
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 382.63 386.08 <o,f0,male> custom furniture for rich people and i got sixty pieces out of it for my
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 387.47 389.11 <o,f0,male> because i felt that welfare
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 392.69 396.46 <o,f0,male> to come to a school where there was handcrafted furniture
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 398.18 405.55 <o,f0,male> because it sets a tone and an attitude about how you feel about people long before you give them the speech
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 406.45 408.25 <o,f0,male> even have flowers in the hallway
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 409.08 410.32 <o,f0,male> and they're not plastic those
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 423.96 431.67 <o,f0,male> and we were particularly touched by the flowers and we were curious as to how the flowers got there i said well i got in my car and i went out to the
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 441.03 446.00 <o,f0,male> what you need to know is that the children and the adults deserve flowers in their life
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 455.86 458.14 <o,f0,male> we believe in hope and human possibilities
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 460.75 463.18 <o,f0,male> and so the next thing you'll see
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 464.28 464.80 <o,f0,male> a a million
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 481.14 493.79 <o,f0,male> heard about my desire to build a new building because i had a cardboard box and i put it in a garbage bag and i walking all over pittsburgh trying to raise money for this site and he called me into his office which is the equivalent of going to see the wizard of
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 495.33 498.42 <o,f0,male> john heinz had six hundred million dollars and at the time i had about
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 499.94 504.58 <o,f0,male> he said but we've heard about you we've heard about your work with the kids and the ex steel workers
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 505.80 514.67 <o,f0,male> and we're inclined to want to support your desire to build a new building and you could do us a great service if you would add a culinary program
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 515.43 522.45 <o,f0,male> to your program because back then we were building a trades program he said that way we could fulfilll our affirmative action goals
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 527.45 535.49 <o,f0,male> go into a field that i don't know much about but i promise you that if you'll support my school i'll get it built and in a couple of years i'll come back
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 536.34 539.01 <o,f0,male> and weigh out that program that you desire
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 542.57 544.30 <o,f0,male> said well what would your reaction be
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 548.78 552.16 <o,f0,male> i said senator it appears that we're going into the food training business
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 560.26 561.91 <o,f0,male> and john heinz did give me a million
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 562.39 573.14 <o,f0,male> and most importantly he loaned me the head of research for the heinz company and we kind of borrowed the curriculum from the culinary institute of america which in their mind is kind of the harvard
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 591.29 594.47 <o,f0,male> in this million dollar kitchen that happens to be our cafeteria
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 596.51 601.34 <o,f0,male> pastry day why because the students made puff pastry and that's what the school ate every day
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 602.88 606.58 <o,f0,male> the concept was that i wanted to take the stigma
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 608.73 616.14 <o,f0,male> good food 's not for rich people good food 's for everybody on the planet and there's no excuse why we can't all be eating it so at
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 617.68 620.97 <o,f0,male> we subsidize a gourmet lunch program for welfare
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 628.99 631.32 <o,f0,male> i wanted to let them know every day
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 641.28 642.36 <o,f0,male> black kids and white
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 645.76 646.13 <o,f0,male> and
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 666.45 678.56 <o,f0,male> no sophistication no class no dignity no history what we've discovered is the only thing wrong with poor people is they don't have any money
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 679.32 681.02 <o,f0,male> happens to be a curable condition
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 681.85 685.80 <o,f0,male> it's all in the way that you think about people that often determines
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 688.22 690.86 <o,f0,male> by a student after seven months in the program
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 691.78 694.59 <o,f0,male> done by a very brilliant young woman who was taught by our
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 696.75 699.05 <o,f0,male> actually eaten seven of those baskets and they're very
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 703.70 710.08 <o,f0,male> that's our dining room it looks like your average high school cafeteria in your average town
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 712.02 712.91 <o,f0,male> this is my
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 724.74 727.62 <o,f0,male> we train medical technicians for the medical industry
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 728.92 741.47 <o,f0,male> and we train chemical technicians for companies like bayer and calgon carbon and fisher scientific and exxon and i will guarantee you that if you come to my center in pittsburgh
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 743.71 747.77 <o,f0,male> welfare mothers doing analytical chemistry with logarithmic calculators
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 748.45 749.09 <o,f0,male> ten months from
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 755.66 759.12 <o,f0,male> people can't learn world class technology what we've discovered
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 760.48 761.17 <o,f0,male> you have to give
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 786.33 786.77 <o,f0,male> and i have
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 787.04 790.81 <o,f0,male> children with high school diplomas that they can't read
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 797.17 798.77 <o,f0,male> in the twenty one st century
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 800.43 804.14 <o,f0,male> that we graduate children from schools who can't read the diplomas that they
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 806.16 810.75 <o,f0,male> the reason is that the system gets reimbursed for the kids they spit out at the other end
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 811.79 812.92 <o,f0,male> not the children
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 814.94 819.61 <o,f0,male> i can take these children and in twenty weeks demonstrated aptitude
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 853.93 857.16 <o,f0,male> four hundred kids from the pittsburgh public school system that
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 859.98 862.40 <o,f0,male> for arts education and these are children
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 865.15 868.31 <o,f0,male> last year i put eighty eight percent of those kids in college and i've averaged over
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 869.67 872.74 <o,f0,male> for fifteen years we've made a fascinating
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 874.63 874.82 <o,f0,male> and
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 885.04 885.34 <o,f0,male> that
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 890.85 891.92 <o,f0,male> i figured that if
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 892.16 896.35 <o,f0,male> treat children like human beings it increases the likelihood they're going to behave that way
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 897.16 898.88 <o,f0,male> and why we can't institute
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 901.21 904.33 <o,f0,male> in every school and in every city
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 909.34 910.39 <o,f0,male> let me show you what
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 933.53 933.87 <o,f0,male> in fact
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 934.84 944.28 <o,f0,male> i brought in a mosaic artist from the vatican an african american woman who had studied the old vatican mosaic techniques and let me show you what
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 956.78 957.19 <o,f0,male> sunlight
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 964.93 966.28 <o,f0,male> teach photography
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 972.17 972.80 <o,f0,male> four
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 979.48 982.37 <o,f0,male> we have a world class gallery because we believe that
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 984.89 986.31 <o,f0,male> so i designed this thing
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 986.89 988.19 <o,f0,male> we have smoked salmon at the
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 991.47 999.79 <o,f0,male> and i even have figured out a way to get their parents to come i couldn't buy a parent fifteen years ago so i hired a guy who got off
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1006.74 1007.09 <o,f0,male> i
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1017.28 1022.29 <o,f0,male> i can't get these parents to come to the school he said i 'll get them to
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1026.91 1029.44 <o,f0,male> art opening but you probably didn't have
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1040.31 1040.74 <o,f0,male> one
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1047.21 1050.01 <o,f0,male> children at the manchester craftsmen 's guild because
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1051.70 1053.50 <o,f0,male> there is no statistical difference
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1054.95 1056.53 <o,f0,male> between the white parents
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1086.86 1087.45 <o,f0,male> have to
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1098.29 1099.09 <o,f0,male> i even
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1099.79 1100.65 <o,f0,male> stuck
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1106.10 1107.32 <o,f0,male> just got this slide
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1110.77 1113.50 <o,f0,male> i gave this little slide show at a place
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1115.39 1120.15 <o,f0,male> and i did all right and the woman came out of the audience she said that was a great story and i was very
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1122.49 1128.80 <o,f0,male> criticism is your computers are getting a little bit old and i said well what do you do for a living
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1141.61 1150.80 <o,f0,male> you that hp and a furniture company called steelcase have adopted us as a demonstration model for all of their technology and all
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1159.62 1163.59 <o,f0,male> you so it's kind of the world debut of our digital imaging center
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1172.96 1176.44 <o,f0,male> i only have a couple more slides and this is where the story gets kind
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1177.72 1180.56 <o,f0,male> so i just want you to listen up for a couple more minutes and
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1192.71 1201.01 <o,f0,male> and a guy named dizzy gillespie showed up to play there because he knew this man over here marty ashby
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1201.92 1205.14 <o,f0,male> and i stood on that stage with dizzy gillespie on sound
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1205.92 1219.22 <o,f0,male> on a wednesday afternoon and i said dizzy why would you come to a black run center in the middle of an industrial park with a high crime rate that doesn't even have a reputation in music he said because i heard you built the center and i didn't believe that you
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1220.52 1222.31 <o,f0,male> i wanted to see for myself and
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1224.82 1227.57 <o,f0,male> i have i want to give you a gift i said you 're the gift he said no sir
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1240.44 1244.95 <o,f0,male> and i recorded dizzy and he died a year later
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1253.95 1254.18 <o,f0,male> and
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1270.27 1272.65 <o,f0,male> and a band called the count basie orchestra
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1276.53 1277.79 <o,f0,male> guy named gary burton
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1284.41 1288.74 <o,f0,male> all have come to this center in the middle of an industrial park
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1299.10 1300.27 <o,f0,male> the greatest artists
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1305.82 1308.19 <o,f0,male> but not before his last recording was
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1335.30 1342.44 <o,f0,male> when the basie band came the band got so excited about the school they voted to give me the rights to the music
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1362.11 1363.33 <o,f0,male> jazz orchestra dropped
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1364.31 1367.77 <o,f0,male> and we recorded them and got nominated for a second grammy back to back
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1372.09 1372.33 <o,f0,male> hot

BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1477.55 1485.07 <o,f0,male> and so i had another cardboard box built and i walked back out on the streets again and that's the building and that's the model
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1485.23 1492.07 <o,f0,male> and on the right 's the high tech greenhouse and in the middle 's the medical technology building and i'm very pleased to tell you that the

BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1559.15 1560.49 <o,f0,male> in all two hundred and forty
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1563.45 1565.52 <o,f0,male> and our partners are zuma canyon orchids
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1587.09 1589.42 <o,f0,male> which he readily agreed and we got the funding
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1596.30 1598.35 <o,f0,male> this is what i want to do when i grow up
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1600.77 1605.48 <o,f0,male> the brown building is the one you guys have been looking at and i'll tell you where i made my
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1607.86 1609.25 <o,f0,male> i had a chance to buy this
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1609.40 1612.66 <o,f0,male> whole industrial park which is less than one thousand feet from the riverfront
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1613.52 1615.74 <o,f0,male> for four million dollars and i didn't do it
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1616.93 1620.14 <o,f0,male> and i built the first building and guess what happened
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1620.55 1624.74 <o,f0,male> i appreciated the real estate values beyond everybody 's expectations
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1625.47 1628.26 <o,f0,male> and the owners of the park turned me down for eight
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1630.29 1632.33 <o,f0,male> and said mister strickland
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1655.97 1657.24 <o,f0,male> this is in a place called
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1659.39 1660.94 <o,f0,male> the reason this picture 's in here
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1662.09 1670.83 <o,f0,male> i did this slide show a couple years ago at a big economics summit and there was a fellow in the audience who came up to me he said man that's a great story i want one
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1673.56 1674.86 <o,f0,male> what do you do for a living he says
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1677.28 1677.89 <o,f0,male> willie brown
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1681.01 1681.94 <o,f0,male> and so i kind of
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1682.85 1688.40 <o,f0,male> the flattery and the praise and put it out of my mind and that weekend i was going back home
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1689.69 1692.21 <o,f0,male> and herbie hancock was playing at our center that
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1704.70 1706.03 <o,f0,male> and he said as god is
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1708.06 1712.38 <o,f0,male> i've had a center like this in my mind for twenty five years and you've built it and now i really
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1716.09 1716.21 <o,f0,male> he
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1718.87 1720.31 <o,f0,male> chance you know willie brown
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1723.31 1726.96 <o,f0,male> as a matter of fact he did know willie brown and willie brown and herbie and i
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1728.15 1730.44 <o,f0,male> four years ago and we started drawing out that center on the
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1732.46 1734.13 <o,f0,male> willie brown said as sure as
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1742.38 1745.47 <o,f0,male> he got me five acres of land on san francisco bay
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1746.49 1752.05 <o,f0,male> we got an architect and we got a general contractor and we got herbie on the board
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1752.71 1759.02 <o,f0,male> and our friends from hp and our friends from steelcase and our friends from cisco and our friends from wells fargo and
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1760.58 1763.17 <o,f0,male> and along the way i met this real short
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1766.01 1767.82 <o,f0,male> slide show in the silicon valley
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1768.70 1770.48 <o,f0,male> to me afterwards he said
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1770.65 1772.52 <o,f0,male> man that's a fabulous story
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1773.77 1780.29 <o,f0,male> i want to help you and i said well thank you very much for that what do you do for a living he said well

BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1791.19 1793.08 <o,f0,male> jar of water sitting on that piano
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1793.99 1803.64 <o,f0,male> but i had the presence of mind to go back and talk to one of the techie kids at my center i said hey man what is ebay he said well that's the electronic commerce network
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1807.03 1815.43 <o,f0,male> and he left me his card so i called him up on the phone and i said mister skoll i've come to have a much deeper appreciation of who you are
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1827.76 1829.37 <o,f0,male> jeff and i did become friends
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1830.49 1832.28 <o,f0,male> and he 's organized a team of
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1834.53 1835.59 <o,f0,male> and we're going to build this
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1838.01 1840.30 <o,f0,male> and i went down into the neighborhood
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1841.76 1843.80 <o,f0,male> called bayview hunters point and i said
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1844.46 1847.72 <o,f0,male> the mayor sent me down to work with you
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1848.39 1851.77 <o,f0,male> and i want to build a center with you but i'm not going to build you anything if you
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1857.56 1857.85 <o,f0,male> and so
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1858.92 1860.56 <o,f0,male> two hundred very angry
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1870.02 1874.83 <o,f0,male> and i started showing these pictures and after about ten pictures they all settled down
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1881.35 1884.06 <o,f0,male> of the room a woman stood up and she said in thirty five
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1888.68 1889.36 <o,f0,male> come down here
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1894.01 1898.00 <o,f0,male> and she turned that audience around on a pin and i
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1903.55 1905.46 <o,f0,male> i think we can get in the ground this year
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1906.78 1908.63 <o,f0,male> the first replication of the center
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1917.30 1917.56 <o,f0,male> and
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1920.70 1922.60 <o,f0,male> said i want to help you man
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1925.17 1926.72 <o,f0,male> let 's do one in l a
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1927.91 1928.77 <o,f0,male> and so he 's
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1929.49 1934.28 <o,f0,male> people and i've fallen in love with him as i have with herbie and with
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1936.54 1938.39 <o,f0,male> said where did the idea
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1939.47 1941.35 <o,f0,male> for centers like this come from
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1945.14 1949.56 <o,f0,male> because mister ross used to bring in your albums when i was sixteen years old
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1951.47 1953.17 <o,f0,male> when the world was all dark
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1964.89 1966.38 <o,f0,male> that's not true
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1982.04 1984.39 <o,f0,male> i believe in your hopes and your dreams
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1985.89 1988.61 <o,f0,male> i believe in your intelligence and i believe in your
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1991.10 1991.94 <o,f0,male> and i'm tired of
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1993.90 1997.86 <o,f0,male> going into town after town with people standing around on corners with
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 1999.99 2000.80 <o,f0,male> eyes used to be
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 2001.69 2003.17 <o,f0,male> their spirits damaged
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 2005.59 2008.58 <o,f0,male> we won 't make it as a country unless we can turn this thing around
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 2010.18 2015.58 <o,f0,male> and pennsylvania it costs sixty thousand dollars to keep people in jail most of whom look like me
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 2016.96 2019.86 <o,f0,male> forty thousand dollars to build the university of pittsburgh medical school
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 2020.66 2023.94 <o,f0,male> it's twenty thousand dollars cheaper to
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 2042.21 2044.13 <o,f0,male> very decent people
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 2060.47 2063.07 <o,f0,male> i think we can build these all over the country
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 2067.30 2070.91 <o,f0,male> and i believe we can turn this whole story around to one of celebration
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 2074.32 2078.75 <o,f0,male> in my business it's very difficult work you're always fighting upstream like
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 2079.95 2082.09 <o,f0,male> never enough money too much
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 2083.81 2090.47 <o,f0,male> and so there is a tendency to have an occupational depression that accompanies my work and so i've figured out
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 2092.80 2094.49 <o,f0,male> the solution to the depression
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 2095.73 2096.69 <o,f0,male> you make a friend
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 2104.07 2104.75 <o,f0,male> made a few
BillStrickland_2002 1 BillStrickland_2002 2105.77 2105.95 <o,f0,male> and
