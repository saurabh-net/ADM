RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 30.54 32.38 <o,f0,male> that 's a boeing seven hundred and seven
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 32.4 44.84 <o,f0,male> only sixty years later it travels at eighty percent of the speed of sound and we don 't travel any faster today because commercial supersonic air travel turned out to be a bust
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 44.84 58.03 <o,f0,male> so i started wondering and pondering could it be that the best years of american economic growth are behind us and that leads to the suggestion maybe economic growth is almost over
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 58.45 75.14 <o,f0,male> some of the reasons for this are not really very controversial there are four headwinds that are just hitting the american economy in the face they 're demographics education debt and inequality they 're powerful enough to cut growth in half
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 75.31 89.11 <o,f0,male> so we need a lot of innovation to offset this decline and here 's my theme because of the headwinds if innovation continues to be as powerful as it has been in the last one hundred and fifty years growth is cut in half
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 89.15 91.67 <o,f0,male> if innovation is less
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 91.72 98.65 <o,f0,male> powerful invents less great wonderful things then growth is going to be even lower than half of history
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 98.65 101.94 <o,f0,male> now here 's eight centuries of economic growth
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 101.94 108.64 <o,f0,male> the vertical axis is just percent per year of growth zero percent a year one percent a year two percent a year
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 108.64 123.22 <o,f0,male> the white line is for the u k and then the u s takes over as the leading nation in the year one thousand nine hundred when the line switches to red you 'll notice that for the first four centuries there 's hardly any growth at all just zero point two percent then growth gets better and better
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 123.22 134.58 <o,f0,male> it maxes out in the one thousand nine hundred and thirty s forty s and fifty s and then it starts slowing down and here 's a cautionary note that last downward notch in the red line is not actual data
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 134.58 148.04 <o,f0,male> that is a forecast that i made six years ago that growth would slow down to one point three percent but you know what the actual facts are you know what the growth in per person income has been in the united states in the last six years negative
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 149.2 168.14 <o,f0,male> this led to a fantasy what if i try to fit a curved line to this historical record i can make the curved line end anywhere i wanted but i decided i would end it at zero point two just like the u k growth for the first four centuries
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 168.28 185.33 <o,f0,male> now the history that we 've achieved is that we 've grown at two point zero percent per year over the whole period one thousand eight hundred and ninety one to two thousand and seven and remember it 's been a little bit negative since two thousand and seven but if growth slows down
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 196.83 200.97 <o,f0,male> now we 're going to change and look at the level of per capita income
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 200.97 214 <o,f0,male> the vertical axis now is thousands of dollars in today 's prices you 'll notice that in one thousand eight hundred and ninety one over on the left we were at about five thousand dollars today we 're at about forty four thousand dollars of total output per member of the population
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 214 230.72 <o,f0,male> now what if we could achieve that historic two percent growth for the next seventy years well it 's a matter of arithmetic two percent growth quadruples your standard of living in seventy years that means we 'd go from forty four thousand to one hundred and eighty thousand well we 're not going to do that
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 231.18 248.54 <o,f0,male> and the reason is the headwinds the first headwind is demographics it 's a truism that your standard of living rises faster than productivity rises faster than output per hour if hours per person increased and we got that gift back in the seventy s and eighty s when women entered the labor force
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 248.54 255.52 <o,f0,male> but now it 's turned around now hours per person are shrinking first because of the retirement of the baby boomers
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 255.52 267.66 <o,f0,male> and second because there 's been a very significant dropping out of the labor force of prime age adult males who are in the bottom half of the educational distribution
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 267.66 281.08 <o,f0,male> the next headwind is education we 've got problems all over our educational system despite race to the top in college we 've got cost inflation in higher education that dwarfs cost inflation in medical care
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 281.08 288.29 <o,f0,male> we have in higher education a trillion dollars of student debt and our college completion rate
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 288.29 294.19 <o,f0,male> is fifteen points fifteen percentage points below canada
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 298.37 302.32 <o,f0,male> economy grew from two thousand to two thousand and seven
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 302.32 321.82 <o,f0,male> on the back of consumers massively overborrowing consumers paying off that debt is one of the main reasons why our economic recovery is so sluggish today and everybody of course knows that the federal government debt is growing as a share of gdp at a very rapid rate and the only way that 's going to stop is some combination
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 321.82 328.61 <o,f0,male> of faster growth in taxes or slower growth in entitlements also called transfer payments
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 328.61 339.41 <o,f0,male> and that gets us down from the one point five where we 've reached for education down to one point three and then we have inequality over the fifteen years before the financial crisis
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 339.41 356.6 <o,f0,male> the growth rate of the bottom ninety nine percent of the income distribution was half a point slower than the averages we 've been talking about before all the rest went to the top one percent so that brings us down to zero point eight and that zero point eight is the big challenge
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 356.6 370.07 <o,f0,male> are we going to grow at zero point eight if so that 's going to require that our inventions are as important as the ones that happened over the last one hundred and fifty years so let 's see what some of those inventions were
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 370.22 389.13 <o,f0,male> if you wanted to read in one thousand eight hundred and seventy five at night you needed to have an oil or a gas lamp they created pollution they created odors they were hard to control the light was dim and they were a fire hazard by one thousand nine hundred and twenty nine electric light was everywhere
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 389.13 395.82 <o,f0,male> we had the vertical city the invention of the elevator central manhattan became possible
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 395.95 412.72 <o,f0,male> and then in addition to that at the same time hand tools were replaced by massive electric tools and hand powered electric tools all achieved by electricity electricity was also very helpful in liberating women
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 413.17 430.13 <o,f0,male> women back in the late nineteenth century spent two days a week doing the laundry they did it on a scrub board then they had to hang the clothes out to dry then they had to bring them in the whole thing took two days out of the seven day week and then we had the electric washing machine
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 430.13 436.16 <o,f0,male> and by one thousand nine hundred and fifty they were everywhere but the women still had to shop every day
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 436.57 441.18 <o,f0,male> but no they didn 't because electricity brought us the electric refrigerator
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 441.18 457.48 <o,f0,male> back in the late nineteenth century the only source of heat in most homes was a big fireplace in the kitchen that was used for cooking and heating the bedrooms were cold they were unheated but by one thousand nine hundred and twenty nine certainly by one thousand nine hundred and fifty we had central heating everywhere
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 470.61 473.32 <o,f0,male> which dropped without restraint
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 473.32 481.73 <o,f0,male> twenty five to fifty pounds of manure on the streets every day together with a gallon of urine that comes out at five to ten tons
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 481.73 494.11 <o,f0,male> daily per square mile in cities those horses also ate up fully one quarter of american agricultural land that 's the percentage of american agricultural land it took
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 494.25 512.9 <o,f0,male> to feed the horses of course when the motor vehicle was invented and it became almost ubiquitous by one thousand nine hundred and twenty nine that agricultural land could be used for human consumption or for export and here 's an interesting ratio starting from zero in one thousand nine hundred only thirty years later
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 512.9 521.07 <o,f0,male> the ratio of motor vehicles to the number of households in the united states reached ninety percent in just thirty years
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 531.76 547.18 <o,f0,male> had to be carried in buckets and pails in from the outside it 's a historical fact that in one thousand eight hundred and eighty five the average north carolina housewife walked one hundred and forty eight miles a year carrying thirty five tons of water but by
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 557.36 569.68 <o,f0,male> and as a result one of the great scourges of the late nineteenth century waterborne diseases like cholera began to disappear and an amazing fact for techno optimists
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 569.68 586.37 <o,f0,male> is that in the first half of the twentieth century the rate of improvement of life expectancy was three times faster than it was in the second half of the nineteenth century so it 's a truism that things can 't be more than one hundred percent of themselves
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 586.37 593.68 <o,f0,male> and i 'll just give you a few examples we went from one percent to ninety percent of the speed of sound electrification central heat
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 593.68 606.65 <o,f0,male> ownership of motor cars they all went from zero to one hundred percent urban environments make people more productive than on the farm we went from twenty five percent urban to seventy five percent by the early postwar years
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 607.86 615.77 <o,f0,male> what about the electronic revolution here 's an early computer it 's amazing the mainframe computer was invented in one thousand nine hundred and forty two
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 615.77 621.85 <o,f0,male> by one thousand nine hundred and sixty we had telephone bills bank statements were being produced by computers
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 621.85 637.64 <o,f0,male> the earliest cell phones the earliest personal computers were invented in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s brought us bill gates dos atm machines to replace bank tellers bar code scanning to cut down on labor in the retail sector
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 637.64 646.62 <o,f0,male> fast forward through the ninety s we had the dotcom revolution and a temporary rise in productivity growth but i 'm now going to give you an experiment
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 646.62 650.12 <o,f0,male> you have to choose either option a or option b
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 684.15 701.52 <o,f0,male> the problem we face is that all these great inventions we have to match them in the future and my prediction that we 're not going to match them brings us down from the original two percent growth down to zero point two the fanciful curve that i drew you at the beginning
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 701.52 710.63 <o,f0,male> so here we are back to the horse and buggy i 'd like to award an oscar to the inventors of the twentieth century
RobertGordon_2013 1 RobertGordon_2013 710.63 724.53 <o,f0,male> the people from alexander graham bell to thomas edison to the wright brothers i 'd like to call them all up here and they 're going to call back to you your challenge is can you match what we achieved thank you
