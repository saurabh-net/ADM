ShereenElFeki_2009G 1 ShereenElFeki_2009G 17.89 24.82 <o,f0,female> hello everyone because this is my first time at ted i've decided to bring along an old friend to help break the ice
ShereenElFeki_2009G 1 ShereenElFeki_2009G 27.80 38.74 <o,f0,female> yes that's right this is barbie she's fifty years old and she's looking as young as ever but i'd also like to introduce you to what may be an unfamiliar face
ShereenElFeki_2009G 1 ShereenElFeki_2009G 40.38 48.37 <o,f0,female> this is fulla fulla is the arab world 's answer to barbie now according the proponents of the clash of civilizations
ShereenElFeki_2009G 1 ShereenElFeki_2009G 59.38 66.99 <o,f0,female> it's just not going to be pretty my experience however in the islamic world is very different where i work in the arab region
ShereenElFeki_2009G 1 ShereenElFeki_2009G 75.56 82.68 <o,f0,female> i want to show you two examples the first is four shbab it means for youth and it's a new arab tv channel
ShereenElFeki_2009G 1 ShereenElFeki_2009G 85.11 85.90 <o,f0,male> from across the
ShereenElFeki_2009G 1 ShereenElFeki_2009G 89.11 89.68 <o,f0,male> not
ShereenElFeki_2009G 1 ShereenElFeki_2009G 94.08 96.04 <o,f0,female> is
ShereenElFeki_2009G 1 ShereenElFeki_2009G 146.66 159.59 <o,f0,female> he reckons the best way to get that message across is to use the enormously popular medium of music videos four shbab was set up as an alternative to existing arab music channels and they look something like this
ShereenElFeki_2009G 1 ShereenElFeki_2009G 167.18 172.19 <o,f0,female> that by the way is haifa wehbe she's a lebanese pop star and pan arab pin up girl
ShereenElFeki_2009G 1 ShereenElFeki_2009G 173.56 183.96 <o,f0,female> in the world of four shbab it's not about bump and grind but it's not about fire and brimstone either it's videos are intended to show a kinder gentler face of islam
ShereenElFeki_2009G 1 ShereenElFeki_2009G 184.24 192.61 <o,f0,female> for young people to deal with life 's challenges now my second example is for a slightly younger crowd and it's called the ninety nine
ShereenElFeki_2009G 1 ShereenElFeki_2009G 193.67 206.91 <o,f0,female> now these are the world 's first islamic superheros they were created by a kuwaiti psychologist called nayef al mutawa and his desire is to rescue islam from images of intolerance all in a child friendly format
ShereenElFeki_2009G 1 ShereenElFeki_2009G 208.16 216.51 <o,f0,female> the ninety nine the characters are meant to embody the ninety nine attributes of allah justice wisdom mercy among others
ShereenElFeki_2009G 1 ShereenElFeki_2009G 217.02 226.62 <o,f0,female> so for example there is the character of noora she is meant to have the power to look inside people and see the good and bad in everyone
ShereenElFeki_2009G 1 ShereenElFeki_2009G 227.98 239.62 <o,f0,female> another character called jami has the ability to create fantastic inventions now the ninety nine is not just a comic book it's now a theme park there is an animated series in the works
ShereenElFeki_2009G 1 ShereenElFeki_2009G 251.46 261.47 <o,f0,female> the ninety nine and four shbab are just two of many examples of this sort of islamic cross cultural hybridization we're not talking here about a clash of civilizations
ShereenElFeki_2009G 1 ShereenElFeki_2009G 261.90 270.79 <o,f0,female> nor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash i like to think of it as a mesh of civilizations in which the strands of different cultures are intertwined
ShereenElFeki_2009G 1 ShereenElFeki_2009G 289.58 298.14 <o,f0,female> we made you into nations and tribes so that you could learn from one another and to my mind those are pretty wise words no matter what your creed
