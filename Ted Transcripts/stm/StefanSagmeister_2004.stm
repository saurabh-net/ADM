StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 12.48 14.05 <o,f0,male> about fifteen years ago
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 16.25 17.78 <o,f0,male> went to visit a friend in hong kong
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 20.67 23.09 <o,f0,male> at the time i was very superstitious
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 24.02 28.85 <o,f0,male> so upon landing this was still at the old hong kong airport that's kai tak
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 29.40 33.15 <o,f0,male> was smack in the middle of the city i thought
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 33.54 37.97 <o,f0,male> if i see something good i'm going to have a great time here in my two weeks
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 38.43 40.35 <o,f0,male> and if i see something negative
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 41.17 44.06 <o,f0,male> i'm going to be miserable indeed
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 48.94 50.10 <o,f0,male> got to a full stop
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 50.96 53.49 <o,f0,male> in front of this little billboard
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 56.99 60.22 <o,f0,male> to see some of the design companies in hong kong in my stay there
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 61.12 62.68 <o,f0,male> and it turned out that
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 63.38 66.50 <o,f0,male> i just went to see you know what they are doing in hong kong
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 72.75 75.77 <o,f0,male> i flew back to austria packed my bags
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 77.62 81.24 <o,f0,male> and another week later i was again on my way to hong kong
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 82.03 83.29 <o,f0,male> still superstitions
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 83.91 87.96 <o,f0,male> and thinking well if that winner billboard is still up
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 88.48 92.92 <o,f0,male> i'm going to have a good time working here but if it's gone
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 93.74 96.35 <o,f0,male> it's going to be really miserable and stressful
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 97.81 101.44 <o,f0,male> so it turned out that not only was the billboard still up
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 101.83 103.72 <o,f0,male> but they had put this one right next to it
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 106.69 111.92 <o,f0,male> on the other hand it also taught me where superstition gets me because i really had a terrible time
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 117.10 118.82 <o,f0,male> however i did have
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 120.93 125.36 <o,f0,male> a number of real moments of happiness in my life
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 126.40 129.27 <o,f0,male> you know i think what the conference brochure
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 130.60 132.21 <o,f0,male> refers to as moments that
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 132.98 133.88 <o,f0,male> take your breath away
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 136.04 138.51 <o,f0,male> since i'm a big list maker i actually
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 142.41 151.23 <o,f0,male> now you don't have to go through the trouble of reading them and i won 't read them for you i know that it's incredibly boring to hear about other people 's
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 154.37 155.01 <o,f0,male> i did do
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 159.18 161.63 <o,f0,male> is i actually looked at them
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 178.20 186.19 <o,f0,male> two different possibilities there's one from a consumer 's point of view where i was happy while experiencing design and i'll just give you one example
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 190.88 195.83 <o,f0,male> my brother had this great yamaha motorcycle that he was willing to borrow to me freely
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 212.62 214.35 <o,f0,male> i remember it as a true
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 215.05 217.90 <o,f0,male> moment of happiness you know of course they are
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 219.68 224.68 <o,f0,male> this combination of at least two of them being you know design objects
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 225.79 229.73 <o,f0,male> and you know there's a scale of happiness when you talk about in design
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 230.18 238.48 <o,f0,male> the motorcycle incident would definitely be you know situated somewhere here right in there between delight and bliss
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 239.18 240.05 <o,f0,male> now there is the
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 243.20 247.49 <o,f0,male> from a designer 's standpoint if you're happy while actually doing it
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 249.96 255.32 <o,f0,male> one way to see how happy designers are when they're designing could be to look at the
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 255.59 258.22 <o,f0,male> authors photos on the back of their monographs
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 264.62 267.92 <o,f0,male> as well as the mexicans are very happy
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 268.90 270.79 <o,f0,male> while somewhat the spaniards
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 271.92 273.27 <o,f0,male> and i think particularly
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 277.12 280.10 <o,f0,male> be doing all that
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 287.18 292.21 <o,f0,male> last november a museum opened in tokyo called the mori museum
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 292.64 295.52 <o,f0,male> in a skyscraper up on the fifty sixth floor
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 301.03 307.52 <o,f0,male> and i went very eagerly to see it because well also with an eye on this conference
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 309.45 310.78 <o,f0,male> they interestingly
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 312.86 314.84 <o,f0,male> exhibit off into four different
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 325.07 326.94 <o,f0,male> in different forms
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 328.36 332.44 <o,f0,male> this apple by yoko ono that of course later on was you know
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 333.38 335.15 <o,f0,male> made into the label for the beatles
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 336.87 338.04 <o,f0,male> under nirvana
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 341.39 344.77 <o,f0,male> a little an interesting theory about abstraction this is
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 346.49 352.39 <o,f0,male> actually an yves kline painting and the theory was that if you abstract an image
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 352.64 354.33 <o,f0,male> you really you know open
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 355.03 358.41 <o,f0,male> as much room for the unrepresentable and
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 359.73 362.35 <o,f0,male> you know are able to involve the viewer more
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 370.69 371.19 <o,f0,male> silk
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 373.64 377.80 <o,f0,male> and lastly under harmony they had this thirteenth century
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 378.73 378.98 <o,f0,male> from
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 380.79 383.94 <o,f0,male> now what i took away from the exhibit was that
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 385.07 386.28 <o,f0,male> maybe with the exception
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 388.27 389.01 <o,f0,male> most of
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 396.11 406.93 <o,f0,male> and i felt a little bit cheated because the visualization that's a really easy thing to do and you know my studio we've done it all the time this is you know
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 407.52 414.71 <o,f0,male> a book a happy dog and you take it out it's an aggressive dog it's a happy david byrne and an angry david
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 417.38 422.97 <o,f0,male> or a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face you know that's not a big deal
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 423.82 424.88 <o,f0,male> to accomplish
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 426.42 427.45 <o,f0,male> gotten to the point
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 428.93 433.89 <o,f0,male> you know within advertising or within the movie industry happy has gotten such a bad
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 437.82 441.18 <o,f0,male> want to do something with the subject and still appear authentic
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 441.80 443.90 <o,f0,male> you almost would have to you know
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 444.53 446.38 <o,f0,male> do it from a cynical point of view
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 451.67 457.59 <o,f0,male> a couple of weeks ago designed a box set for the talking heads where the happiness
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 466.70 469.37 <o,f0,male> much much more difficult is
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 470.50 472.79 <o,f0,male> this where the designs actually can
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 474.20 475.42 <o,f0,male> evoke happiness and
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 476.85 480.30 <o,f0,male> show you three that actually did this for me
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 484.38 487.20 <o,f0,male> done by a young artist in new york who calls himself
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 488.17 492.00 <o,f0,male> everybody who has ridden the new york subway system will be familiar
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 496.67 505.82 <o,f0,male> printed his own version of these signs met every wednesday at a subway stop with twenty of his friends they divided up the different subway lines
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 518.61 527.09 <o,f0,male> now the way this works in the system is that nobody ever looks at these signs so you're you're really
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 527.88 537.47 <o,f0,male> in the subway and you kind of stare at something and it takes you a while until it actually you realize that this says something different than what it normally says
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 539.57 542.26 <o,f0,male> mean that 's at least how it made me happy
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 567.03 568.49 <o,f0,male> and also gave this
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 569.74 576.78 <o,f0,male> from the mta to everybody sort of like pretending that it's an art project financed by the metropolitan transit authority
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 579.14 582.49 <o,f0,male> new york project this is at p s one
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 582.90 587.32 <o,f0,male> a sculpture that's basically a square room by james turrell that has a retractable
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 588.05 589.14 <o,f0,male> ceiling opens up
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 590.32 598.76 <o,f0,male> dusk and dawn every day you don't see the horizon you're just in there watching the incredible subtle changes of color in the sky
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 600.88 601.73 <o,f0,male> the room is
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 603.38 604.58 <o,f0,male> something to be seen
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 607.40 609.10 <o,f0,male> demeanor changes when they go
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 610.08 612.29 <o,f0,male> and for sure i haven't looked
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 618.78 621.66 <o,f0,male> than those three projects that i'm showing here
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 622.66 628.40 <o,f0,male> i would definitely say that observing vik muniz cloud a couple of years ago in manhattan
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 628.88 630.45 <o,f0,male> for sure made me happy as well
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 631.46 639.55 <o,f0,male> but my last project is again from a young designer in new york he 's from korea originally and he took it upon himself to print
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 641.63 643.10 <o,f0,male> fifty five thousand
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 643.90 653.09 <o,f0,male> speech bubbles empty speech bubbles stickers large ones and small ones and he goes around new york and just puts them empty as they are on posters
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 655.22 656.97 <o,f0,male> people go and fill them in
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 660.85 663.23 <o,f0,male> this one says please let me die in peace
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 670.09 679.94 <o,f0,male> i think that was the most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good this is on a musician poster that says
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 680.15 687.90 <o,f0,male> i am concerned that my cd will not sell more than two hundred thousand units and that as a result my recoupable advance
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 688.19 695.36 <o,f0,male> from my label will be taken from me after which my contract will be cancelled and i'll be back doing journey covers on bleecker street
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 714.15 723.57 <o,f0,male> i think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved wins jee gets to have his project the public gets
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 724.34 733.23 <o,f0,male> sweeter environment and different public gets a place to express themself and the advertisers finally get somebody to look at their ads
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 741.21 744.98 <o,f0,male> was a question of course that was on my mind for a while
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 746.29 752.28 <o,f0,male> you know can i do more of the things that i like doing in design and less of the ones
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 752.88 754.95 <o,f0,male> that i don't like to be doing
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 756.84 763.84 <o,f0,male> brought me back to my list making you know just to see what i actually like about my job you know one
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 764.74 766.41 <o,f0,male> just working without pressure
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 768.74 772.15 <o,f0,male> without being frazzled or as nancy said before like
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 783.23 786.81 <o,f0,male> this is you know related to it getting out of the studio
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 787.91 792.39 <o,f0,male> then of course trying to you know work on things where the content is actually important for me
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 794.26 797.30 <o,f0,male> being able to enjoy the end results
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 801.12 803.86 <o,f0,male> i found another list in one of my diaries
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 813.33 816.35 <o,f0,male> just about at that time an austrian magazine called and asked
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 826.35 828.99 <o,f0,male> the whole thing just fell together so i just
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 829.65 830.87 <o,f0,male> one of the things
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 855.10 862.21 <o,f0,male> french company asked us to design five billboards for them again we could supply the content for it
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 871.83 872.82 <o,f0,male> me and myself
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 874.65 875.91 <o,f0,male> this one so it 's trying
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 885.30 886.41 <o,f0,male> did one more of
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 888.03 890.70 <o,f0,male> this is again for a magazine dividing pages
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 892.55 895.02 <o,f0,male> this is having this is the same thing
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 895.19 898.21 <o,f0,male> it's just you know photographed from the side this is from the front
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 899.01 903.72 <o,f0,male> then it 's guts again it's the same thing guts is just the same room
StefanSagmeister_2004 1 StefanSagmeister_2004 912.15 913.95 <o,f0,male> it's for with the light on
