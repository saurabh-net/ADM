JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 25.08 26.66 <o,f0,male> the first guy we'll call him adam
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 27.20 29.87 <o,f0,male> is transfixed by the beauty of the perfect human form
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 30.95 37.02 <o,f0,male> second guy we'll call him bill is transfixed by embarrassment at staring at the thing there in the center
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 45.40 50.94 <o,f0,male> i don't need a show of hands because we all have the same political stereotypes we all know that it's bill
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 51.97 61.51 <o,f0,male> in this case the stereotype corresponds to reality it really is a fact that liberals are much higher than conservatives on a major personality trait called openness to experience
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 73.50 80.50 <o,f0,male> if you know about this trait you can understand a lot of puzzles about human behavior you can understand why artists are so different from accountants you can actually predict
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 80.81 91.06 <o,f0,male> what kinds of books they like to read what kinds of places they like to travel to and what kinds of food they like to eat once you understand this trait you can understand why anybody would eat at applebee 's but not anybody that you
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 97.97 109.91 <o,f0,male> this trait also tells us a lot about politics the main researcher of this trait robert mccrae says that open individuals have an affinity for liberal progressive left wing political views they like a society which is open and changing
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 115.01 120.14 <o,f0,male> this trait also tells us a lot about the kinds of groups people join so here 's the description of a group i found on the web
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 120.69 130.76 <o,f0,male> what kinds of people would join a global community welcoming people from every discipline and culture who seek a deeper understanding of the world and who hope to turn that understanding into a better future for us all this is from some guy named ted
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 134.46 139.21 <o,f0,male> if openness predicts who becomes liberal and openness predicts who becomes a tedster
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 140.15 142.09 <o,f0,male> might we predict that most tedsters are liberal
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 153.16 161.04 <o,f0,male> so right now please raise your hand down in the simulcast rooms too let 's let everybody see who 's here please raise your hand if you would say that you are liberal or left of center
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 168.08 172.90 <o,f0,male> ok about a two dozen and please raise your hand if you'd say you are right of center or conservative
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 174.46 177.97 <o,f0,male> one two three four five about eight or ten
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 180.84 182.01 <o,f0,male> this is a bit of a problem
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 183.52 191.00 <o,f0,male> because if our goal is to understand the world to seek a deeper understanding of the world our general lack of moral diversity here is going to make it harder because
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 191.18 199.57 <o,f0,male> when people all share values when people all share morals they become a team and once you engage the psychology of teams it shuts down open minded thinking
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 205.40 210.07 <o,f0,male> as it did in two thousand and four and as it almost did in two thousand we comfort ourselves
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 211.52 218.81 <o,f0,male> we try to explain why half of america voted for the other team we think they must be blinded by religion or
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 219.71 220.93 <o,f0,male> by simple stupidity
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 236.70 250.83 <o,f0,male> of america votes republican because they are blinded in this way then my message to you is that you're trapped in a moral matrix in a particular moral matrix and by the matrix i mean literally the matrix like the movie the matrix but i'm here today to give you a choice
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 251.59 255.68 <o,f0,male> you can either take the blue pill and stick to your comforting delusions
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 265.66 273.07 <o,f0,male> ok i assume that answers my question i was going to ask you which one you picked but no need you're all high in openness to experience and besides it looks like it might even taste good and you're all
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 281.75 286.37 <o,f0,male> the worst idea in all of psychology is the idea that the mind is a blank slate at birth
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 294.67 308.66 <o,f0,male> to make it really easy for them to learn certain things and hard to learn others the best definition of innateness i've ever seen this just clarifies so many things for me is from the brain scientist gary marcus he says the initial organization of the brain does not depend that much on experience
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 309.09 319.08 <o,f0,male> nature provides a first draft which experience then revises built in doesn't mean unmalleable it means organized in advance of experience ok so what's on the first draft of the moral mind
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 320.02 327.58 <o,f0,male> to find out my colleague craig joseph and i read through the literature on anthropology on culture variation in morality and also on evolutionary psychology
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 337.88 351.27 <o,f0,male> the first one is harm care we're all mammals here we all have a lot of neural and hormonal programming that makes us really bond with others care for others feel compassion for others especially the weak and vulnerable it gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 372.32 386.50 <o,f0,male> that second foundation underlies the other thirty percent of the moral statements i've heard here at ted the third foundation is in group loyalty you do find groups in the animal kingdom you do find cooperative groups but these groups are always either very small or they're all siblings it's only among humans
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 386.67 394.70 <o,f0,male> that you find very large groups of people who are able to cooperate join together into groups but in this case groups that are united to fight other groups
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 394.96 405.26 <o,f0,male> this probably comes from our long history of tribal living of tribal psychology and this tribal psychology is so deeply pleasurable that even when we don't have tribes we go ahead and make them because it's fun
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 409.68 421.04 <o,f0,male> sports is to war as pornography is to sex we get to exercise some ancient ancient drives the fourth foundation is authority respect here you see submissive gestures from two members of very closely related species
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 421.33 430.49 <o,f0,male> but authority in humans is not so closely based on power and brutality as it is in other primates it's based on more voluntary deference and even elements of love at times
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 431.67 435.87 <o,f0,male> the fifth foundation is purity sanctity this painting is called the allegory of chastity
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 436.30 441.93 <o,f0,male> but purity 's not just about suppressing female sexuality it's about any kind of ideology any kind of idea
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 460.06 468.51 <o,f0,male> i believe these are the five best candidates for what's written on the first draft of the moral mind i think this is what we come with at least a preparedness to learn all of these things
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 469.30 472.12 <o,f0,male> but as my son max grows up in a liberal college town
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 472.67 476.28 <o,f0,male> how is this first draft going to get revised and how will it end up being different
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 476.88 479.70 <o,f0,male> from a kid born sixty miles south of us in lynchburg virginia
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 479.98 485.06 <o,f0,male> to think about culture variation let 's try a different metaphor if there really are five systems at work in the mind
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 488.93 499.48 <o,f0,male> like one of those audio equalizers that has five channels where you can set it to a different setting on every channel and my colleagues brian nosek and jesse graham and i made a questionnaire which we put up on the web at
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 518.34 529.60 <o,f0,male> so as you see people care about harm and care issues they give high endorsement of these sorts of statements all across the board but as you also see liberals care about it a little more than conservatives the line slopes down same story for fairness
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 542.06 549.03 <o,f0,male> we can say that liberals have a kind of a two channel or two foundation morality conservatives have more of a five foundation or five channel morality
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 557.22 568.23 <o,f0,male> latin america the middle east the east asia and south asia notice also that on all of these graphs the slope is steeper on in group authority purity which shows that within any country
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 568.84 575.34 <o,f0,male> the disagreement isn't over harm and fairness everybody i mean we debate over what's fair but everybody agrees that harm and fairness matter
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 576.22 580.62 <o,f0,male> moral arguments within cultures are especially about issues of in group authority purity
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 581.45 590.51 <o,f0,male> this effect is so robust that we find it no matter how we ask the question in one recent study we asked people to suppose you're about to get a dog you picked a particular breed you learned some new information about the breed
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 591.08 599.38 <o,f0,female> you learn that this particular breed is independent minded and relates to its owner as a friend and an equal well if you are a liberal you say hey that's great because liberals like to say fetch please
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 621.85 635.52 <o,f0,male> so you might say ok there are these differences between liberals and conservatives but what makes those three other foundations moral aren't those just the foundations of xenophobia and authoritarianism and puritanism what makes them moral the answer i think is contained in this incredible triptych from hieronymus bosch
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 635.95 645.40 <o,f0,male> the garden of earthly delights in the first panel we see the moment of creation all is ordered all is beautiful all the people and animals are doing what they're supposed to
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 659.08 667.01 <o,f0,male> the sixties inevitably gives way to the seventies where the cuttings of the apertures hurt a little bit more of course bosch called this
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 668.58 671.73 <o,f0,male> so this triptych these three panels
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 672.78 676.17 <o,f0,male> timeless truth that order tends to decay
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 676.57 685.99 <o,f0,male> the truth of social entropy but lest you think this is just some part of the christian imagination where christians have this weird problem with pleasure here 's the same story the same progression
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 695.46 704.19 <o,f0,male> and then on each round of the game they can put money into a common pot and then the experimenter doubles what's in there and then it's all divided among the players so it's a really nice analog
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 704.40 712.30 <o,f0,male> for all sorts of environmental issues where we're asking people to make a sacrifice and they themselves don't really benefit from their own sacrifice but you really want everybody else to sacrifice
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 712.52 719.76 <o,f0,male> but everybody has a temptation to a free ride and what happens is that at first people start off reasonably cooperative and this is all played anonymously
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 744.51 752.16 <o,f0,male> and as soon as people heard about the punishment issue going on cooperation shoots up it shoots up and it keeps going up there's a lot of research showing
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 752.34 760.29 <o,f0,male> that to solve cooperative problems it really helps it's not enough to just appeal to people 's good motives it really helps to have some sort of punishment even if it's just shame or embarrassment or gossip
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 775.68 788.59 <o,f0,male> some people think that religion is an adaptation evolved both by cultural and biological evolution to make groups to cohere in part for the purpose of trusting each other and then being more effective at competing with other groups i think that's probably right although this is a controversial issue
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 802.21 816.61 <o,f0,male> water and wind and a lot of time and you get the grand canyon it's not that complicated this is what's really complicated that there were people living in places like the grand canyon cooperating with each other or on the savannahs of africa or on the frozen shores of alaska and then some of these villages grew into the mighty cities
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 816.99 824.94 <o,f0,female> babylon and rome and tenochtitlan how did this happen this is an absolute miracle much harder to explain than the grand canyon the answer i think is that
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 825.01 825.99 <o,f0,male> they used every tool in the
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 827.04 835.20 <o,f0,male> it took all of our moral psychology to create these cooperative groups yes you do need to be concerned about harm you do need a psychology of justice but it really helps to organize a group
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 835.36 844.99 <o,f0,male> if you can have sub groups and if those sub groups have some internal structure and if you have some ideology that tells people to suppress their carnality to pursue higher nobler ends
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 867.34 876.92 <o,f0,male> so liberals speak for the weak and oppressed they want change and justice even at the risk of chaos this guy 's shirt says stop bitching start a revolution if you're high in openness to experience revolution is good it's change it's
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 884.64 897.19 <o,f0,male> the great conservative insight is that order is really hard to achieve it's really precious and it's really easy to lose so as edmund burke said the restraints on men as well as their liberties are to be reckoned among their rights this was after the chaos of the french revolution
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 897.58 907.77 <o,f0,male> so once you see this once you see that liberals and conservatives both have something to contribute that they form a balance on change versus stability then i think the way is open to step outside the moral matrix
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 909.09 916.80 <o,f0,male> this is the great insight that all the asian religions have attained think about yin and yang yin and yang aren't enemies yin and yang don't hate each other
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 927.73 940.30 <o,f0,male> this image actually is both of those gods sharing the same body you have the markings of vishnu on the left so we could think of vishnu as the conservative god you have the markings of shiva on the right shiva 's the liberal god and they work together
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 954.09 956.78 <o,f0,male> the struggle between for and against is the mind 's worst disease
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 968.47 974.17 <o,f0,male> do you accept stepping out of the battle of good and evil can you be not for or against anything
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 975.04 976.83 <o,f0,male> so what's the point what should you do
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 978.59 991.68 <o,f0,male> if you take the greatest insights from ancient asian philosophies and religions and you combine them with the latest research on moral psychology i think you come to these conclusions that our righteous minds were designed by evolution to unite us into teams
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 997.87 1002.57 <o,f0,male> what should you do am i telling you to not strive am i telling you to embrace seng ts 'an and stop
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 1003.23 1007.87 <o,f0,male> stop with this struggle of for and against no absolutely not i'm not saying that
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 1023.67 1026.31 <o,f0,male> in her story about sergio
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 1028.36 1029.79 <o,f0,male> you can't just go charging in
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 1030.62 1032.01 <o,f0,male> saying you 're wrong and i'm right
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 1042.94 1054.51 <o,f0,male> much better way to do it is to first understand who we are understand our moral psychology understand that we all think we're right and then step out even if it's just for a moment step out check in with
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 1082.08 1086.74 <o,f0,male> so i think the point the point of my talk and i think the point the point of ted
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 1087.70 1089.99 <o,f0,male> is that this is a group that is passionately engaged
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 1090.42 1092.36 <o,f0,male> in the pursuit of changing the world for the better
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 1092.90 1099.10 <o,f0,male> people here are passionately engaged in trying to make the world a better place but there is also a passionate commitment to the truth
JonathanHaidt_2008 1 JonathanHaidt_2008 1100.32 1107.53 <o,f0,male> so i think that the answer is to use that passionate commitment to the truth to try to turn it into a better future for us all
