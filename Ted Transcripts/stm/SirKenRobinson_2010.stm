SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 17.01 31.26 <o,f0,male> i was here four years ago and i remember at the time that the talks weren't put online i think they were given to tedsters in a box a box set of dvds which they put on their shelves where they are now
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 34.93 41.77 <o,f0,male> and actually chris called me a week after i'd given my talk and he said we 're going to start putting them online can we put yours online and i said sure
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 43.79 50.01 <o,f0,male> and four years later as i said it's been seen by four well it's been downloaded four million times
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 51.74 57.79 <o,f0,male> could multiply that by twenty or something to get the number of people who 've seen it and as chris says there is a hunger
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 75.21 77.51 <o,f0,male> so this whole event has been an elaborate build up
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 79.06 80.38 <o,f0,male> to me doing another one for you so here
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 87.15 100.21 <o,f0,male> spoke at the ted conference i spoke at four years ago and talked about the climate crisis and i referenced that at the end of my last talk so i want to pick up from there because i only had eighteen minutes frankly
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 123.26 132.04 <o,f0,male> but i believe there's a second climate crisis which is as severe which has the same origins and
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 132.51 142.88 <o,f0,male> we have to deal with with the same urgency and i mean by this and you may say by the way look i'm good i have one climate crisis i don't really need the second one
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 143.92 150.43 <o,f0,male> but this is a crisis of not natural resources though i believe that's true but a crisis of human resources
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 151.03 159.80 <o,f0,male> i believe fundamentally as many speakers have said during the past few days that we make very poor use of our talents
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 170.64 179.49 <o,f0,male> don't think they're really good at anything actually i kind of divide the world into two groups now jeremy bentham the great utilitarian philosopher
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 193.16 194.27 <o,f0,male> well i do
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 200.02 207.71 <o,f0,male> i meet all kinds of people who don't enjoy what they do they simply go through their lives getting on with it
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 208.52 215.80 <o,f0,male> they get no great pleasure from what they do they endure it rather than enjoy it and wait for the weekend
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 216.64 226.79 <o,f0,male> but i also meet people who love what they do and couldn't imagine doing anything else if you said to them don 't do this anymore they'd wonder what you were talking about because it isn't what they do
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 235.96 243.54 <o,f0,male> it's not true of enough people in fact on the contrary i think it's certainly a minority of people and i think there are many
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 274.08 285.03 <o,f0,male> every education system in the world is being reformed at the moment and it's not enough reform is no use anymore because that's simply improving a broken model
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 285.58 297.85 <o,f0,male> what we need and the word 's been used many times during the course of the past few days is not evolution but a revolution in education this has to be transformed into something else
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 303.45 311.12 <o,f0,male> one of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education innovation is hard
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 321.29 327.77 <o,f0,male> the great problem for reform or transformation is the tyranny of common sense
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 328.30 336.99 <o,f0,male> things that people think well it can't be done any other way because that's the way it's done i came across a great quote recently from abraham lincoln who i thought you'd be pleased to have quoted at this point
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 356.15 358.43 <o,f0,male> we suppress it you know this is our policy so
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 368.86 370.47 <o,f0,male> but he said this
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 371.11 381.44 <o,f0,male> the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present the occasion is piled high with difficulty
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 382.08 389.10 <o,f0,male> and we must rise with the occasion i love that not rise to it rise with it
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 390.70 397.65 <o,f0,male> as our case is new so we must think anew and act anew
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 398.39 406.87 <o,f0,male> we must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country i love that word disenthrall
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 418.58 428.50 <o,f0,male> to meet the circumstances of this century but to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries but our minds are still hypnotized by them and we have to disenthrall ourselves of some of them
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 429.11 437.27 <o,f0,male> now doing this is easier said than done it's very hard to know by the way what it is you take for granted and the reason is that you take it for granted
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 448.33 455.89 <o,f0,male> any people here under the age of twenty five great now those over twenty five could you put your hands up if you're wearing a wristwatch
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 457.26 468.42 <o,f0,male> now that's a great deal of us isn't it ask a room full of teenagers the same thing teenagers do not wear wristwatches i don't mean they can't or they're not allowed to they just often choose not to
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 468.96 477.20 <o,f0,male> and the reason is you see that we were brought up in a pre digital culture those of us over twenty five and so for us if you want to know the time you have to wear something to tell it
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 478.03 487.31 <o,f0,male> kids now live in a world which is digitized and the time for them is everywhere they see no reason to do this and by the way you don't need to do it either it's just that you've always done it
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 496.01 497.95 <o,f0,male> a single function device
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 503.61 504.49 <o,f0,male> is that and i
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 505.83 507.59 <o,f0,male> it tells the date as well it
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 515.53 523.03 <o,f0,male> you see there are things we're enthralled to in education let me give you a couple of examples one of them is the idea of linearity
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 523.65 530.83 <o,f0,male> that it starts here and you go through a track and if you do everything right you will end up set for the rest of your life
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 540.94 555.10 <o,f0,male> we create our lives symbiotically as we explore our talents in relation to the circumstances they help to create for us but you know we have become obsessed with this linear narrative and probably the pinnacle for education is getting into college
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 564.32 575.53 <o,f0,male> maybe they go later not right away and i was up in san francisco a while ago doing a book signing there was this guy buying a book he was in his thirties and i said what do you do and he said i 'm a
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 590.63 604.48 <o,f0,male> i wanted to be a fireman and he said when i got to the senior year of school my teachers didn't take it seriously this one teacher didn't take it seriously he said i was throwing my life away if that's all i chose to do with it
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 632.52 633.78 <o,f0,male> he said he was in a car
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 634.59 638.49 <o,f0,male> and i pulled him out gave him cpr and i saved his wife 's life as well
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 650.01 659.38 <o,f0,male> you know to me human communities depend upon a diversity of talent not a singular conception of ability and at the heart of our
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 662.90 671.18 <o,f0,male> at the heart of the challenge is to reconstitute our sense of ability and of intelligence this linearity thing is a problem
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 671.61 682.04 <o,f0,male> when i arrived in l a about nine years ago i came across a policy statement very well intentioned which said college begins in kindergarten
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 684.34 684.78 <o,f0,male> no it
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 690.09 693.59 <o,f0,male> it doesn 't if we had time i could go into this but we don
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 701.39 705.38 <o,f0,male> a friend of mine once said you know a three year old is not half a six year old
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 713.45 713.78 <o,f0,male> three
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 714.17 723.47 <o,f0,male> but as we just heard in this last session there's such competition now to get to kindergarten to get to the right kindergarten that people are being interviewed for it
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 724.27 724.95 <o,f0,male> at three
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 727.38 730.46 <o,f0,male> kids sitting in front of unimpressed panels you know with their resumes
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 733.59 734.89 <o,f0,male> flipping through and saying well this is it
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 741.05 743.41 <o,f0,male> been around for thirty six months and this is
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 751.21 752.17 <o,f0,male> achieved nothing commit
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 771.14 777.82 <o,f0,male> this is something jamie oliver talked about the other day you know there are two models of quality assurance in catering one is fast food where everything
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 779.21 788.42 <o,f0,male> the other are things like zagat and michelin restaurants where everything is not standardized they're customized to local circumstances and we have sold ourselves into a fast food model of education
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 788.75 794.72 <o,f0,male> and it's impoverishing our spirit and our energies as much as fast food is depleting our physical bodies
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 801.29 808.88 <o,f0,male> i think we have to recognize a couple of things here one is that human talent is tremendously diverse people have very different aptitudes i worked out recently that i was given
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 810.40 814.34 <o,f0,male> as a kid at about the same time eric clapton got his first guitar
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 816.16 818.23 <o,f0,male> you know it worked out for eric that's all i'm saying
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 821.65 823.84 <o,f0,male> it did not for me i could not get this thing to work
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 825.47 827.70 <o,f0,male> no matter how often or how hard i blew into it it just
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 833.43 841.51 <o,f0,male> it's not only about that it's about passion often people are good at things they don't really care for it's about passion and what excites
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 841.72 849.29 <o,f0,male> our spirit and our energy and if you're doing the thing that you love to do that you're good at time takes a different course entirely
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 849.68 859.48 <o,f0,male> my wife 's just finished writing a novel and i think it's a great book but she disappears for hours on end you know this if you're doing something you love
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 867.07 877.14 <o,f0,male> and the reason so many people are opting out of education is because it doesn't feed their spirit it doesn't feed their energy or their passion so i think we have to change metaphors
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 877.72 891.74 <o,f0,male> we have to go from what is essentially an industrial model of education a manufacturing model which is based on linearity and conformity and batching people we have to move to a model that is based more on principles of agriculture
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 892.43 899.28 <o,f0,male> we have to recognize that human flourishing is not a mechanical process it's an organic process
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 899.70 908.34 <o,f0,male> and you cannot predict the outcome of human development all you can do like a farmer is create the conditions under which they will begin to flourish
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 908.70 917.26 <o,f0,male> so when we look at reforming education and transforming it it isn't like cloning a system there are great ones like kipps it's a great system there are many
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 930.42 940.61 <o,f0,male> it's not about scaling a new solution it's about creating a movement in education in which people develop their own solutions but with external support based on a personalized curriculum
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 941.71 950.28 <o,f0,male> in this room there are people who represent extraordinary resources in business in multimedia in the internet these technologies
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 959.30 965.78 <o,f0,male> because it's vital not just to ourselves but to the future of our children but we have to change from the industrial model to
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 965.98 975.42 <o,f0,male> an agricultural model where each school can be flourishing tomorrow that's where children experience life or at home if that's where they choose to be educated with their families or their friends
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 976.13 987.17 <o,f0,male> a lot of talk about dreams over the course of this few days and i wanted to just very quickly i was very struck by natalie merchant 's songs last night recovering old poems
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 987.58 994.79 <o,f0,male> i wanted to read you a quick very short poem from w b yeats who 's someone you may know he wrote this to his love
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 1008.09 1013.41 <o,f0,male> i the heavens embroidered cloths enwrought with gold and silver light
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 1015.27 1020.51 <o,f0,male> blue and the dim and the dark cloths of night and light and the
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 1022.29 1024.24 <o,f0,male> i would spread the cloths under your feet
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 1026.84 1029.71 <o,f0,male> being poor have only my dreams
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 1030.30 1032.64 <o,f0,male> i have spread my dreams under your feet
SirKenRobinson_2010 1 SirKenRobinson_2010 1041.16 1046.24 <o,f0,male> our children spread their dreams beneath our feet and we should tread softly
