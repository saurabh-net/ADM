JuliaSweeney_2010 1 JuliaSweeney_2010 17.86 29.49 <o,f0,female> and when she was eight last year she was doing a report for school or she had some homework about frogs and we were at this restaurant and she said so basically frogs
JuliaSweeney_2010 1 JuliaSweeney_2010 30.61 34.22 <o,f0,female> lay eggs and the eggs turn into tadpoles and tadpoles turn into frogs
JuliaSweeney_2010 1 JuliaSweeney_2010 34.58 36.06 <o,f0,female> and i said yeah you know i'm not really
JuliaSweeney_2010 1 JuliaSweeney_2010 38.14 43.26 <o,f0,female> it's the females i think that lay the eggs and then the males fertilize them and then they become tadpoles and
JuliaSweeney_2010 1 JuliaSweeney_2010 46.03 52.63 <o,f0,female> and i said yeah and she goes and what's this fertilizing so i kind of said oh it's this extra ingredient you know that you need to
JuliaSweeney_2010 1 JuliaSweeney_2010 57.21 60.62 <o,f0,female> and she said oh so is that true for humans too

JuliaSweeney_2010 1 JuliaSweeney_2010 76.83 77.41 <o,f0,female> and she said
JuliaSweeney_2010 1 JuliaSweeney_2010 78.49 84.26 <o,f0,female> where do where do human women where do women lay their eggs and i said
JuliaSweeney_2010 1 JuliaSweeney_2010 84.85 86.98 <o,f0,female> well funny you should ask
JuliaSweeney_2010 1 JuliaSweeney_2010 88.39 90.64 <o,f0,female> we have evolved to have our own
JuliaSweeney_2010 1 JuliaSweeney_2010 95.36 101.09 <o,f0,female> and we lay our eggs there we don't have to worry about other eggs or anything like that it's our own pond and
JuliaSweeney_2010 1 JuliaSweeney_2010 112.05 117.22 <o,f0,female> coming out and you go through the woman 's vagina and so we're just eating and her jaw just drops and
