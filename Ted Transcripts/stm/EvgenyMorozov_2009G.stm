EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 13.40 20.87 <o,f0,male> good morning i think as a grumpy eastern european i was brought in to play the pessimist this morning so bear with
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 21.40 30.77 <o,f0,male> well i come from the former soviet republic of belarus which as some of you may know is not exactly an oasis of liberal democracy
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 31.95 40.34 <o,f0,male> so that's why i've always been fascinated with how technology could actually reshape and open up authoritarian societies like ours
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 41.01 53.11 <o,f0,male> so i'm graduating college and feeling very idealistic i decided to join the ngo which actually was using new media to promote democracy and media reform in much of the former soviet union
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 54.12 65.64 <o,f0,male> to my surprise i discovered that dictatorships do not crumble so easily in fact some of them actually survived through the challenge and some got even more
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 67.21 76.52 <o,f0,male> so this is when i ran out of my idealism and decided to quit my ngo job and actually study how the internet could impede democratization
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 90.21 96.40 <o,f0,male> united states who somehow thought that new media would be able to do what missiles
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 97.11 104.19 <o,f0,male> that is promote democracy in difficult places where everything else has already been tried and failed
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 104.76 111.97 <o,f0,male> and i think by two thousand and nine this news has finally reached britain so i should probably add gordon brown to this list as well
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 113.17 120.37 <o,f0,male> however there is an underlying argument about logistics which has driven so much of this debate
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 121.96 131.60 <o,f0,male> close enough you'll actually see that much of this is about economics the cybertopians say much like fax machines and xerox machines
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 133.60 141.20 <o,f0,male> blogs and social networks have radically transformed the economics of protest so people would inevitably rebel
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 142.38 153.03 <o,f0,male> put it very simply the assumption so far has been that if you give people enough connectivity if you give them enough devices democracy will inevitably follow
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 155.88 162.93 <o,f0,male> i never really bought into this argument in part because i never saw three american presidents agree on anything else in the past
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 168.24 172.96 <o,f0,male> even beyond that if you think about the logic underlying it is something i call
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 174.76 183.43 <o,f0,male> we assume that every single iranian or chinese who happens to have and love his ipod will also love liberal democracy
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 184.29 190.12 <o,f0,male> and again i think this is kind of false but i think a much bigger problem
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 191.91 200.43 <o,f0,male> this logic that we should be dropping ipods not bombs i mean it would make a fascinating title for thomas friedman 's new book
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 201.63 214.84 <o,f0,male> but this is rarely a good sign right so the bigger problem with this logic is that it confuses the intended versus the actual uses of technology
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 216.35 221.91 <o,f0,male> think that new media of the internet could somehow help us avert genocide
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 222.35 231.07 <o,f0,male> should look no further than rwanda where in the nineties it was actually two radio stations which were responsible for fueling much of the ethnic hatred in the first place
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 232.02 244.75 <o,f0,male> but even beyond that coming back to the internet what you can actually see is that certain governments have mastered the use of cyberspace for propaganda purposes right and they are building what i call the
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 246.05 256.42 <o,f0,male> the combination of spin on the one hand and the internet on the other so governments from russia to china to iran are actually hiring training and paying bloggers
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 256.73 270.59 <o,f0,male> in order to leave ideological comments and create a lot of ideological blog posts to comment on sensitive political issues right so you may wonder why on earth are they doing it why are they engaging with cyberspace
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 271.36 278.39 <o,f0,male> my theory is that it's happening because censorship actually is less effective than you think it is in many of those places
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 279.24 288.65 <o,f0,male> the moment you put something critical in a blog even if you manage to ban it immediately it will still spread around thousands and thousands of other
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 298.51 308.61 <o,f0,male> so the only way to control this message is actually to try to spin it and accuse anyone who has written something critical of being for example a cia agent
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 309.14 319.17 <o,f0,male> and again this is happening quite often just to give you an example of how it works in china for example there was a big case in february two thousand and nine
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 321.65 331.25 <o,f0,male> and for those of you who didn't know i'll just give a little summary so what happened is that a twenty four year old man a chinese man died in prison custody
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 345.26 353.83 <o,f0,male> which was not an explanation which sat well with many chinese bloggers so they immediately began posting a lot of critical comments
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 354.20 362.50 <o,f0,male> in fact qq com which is a popular chinese website had thirty five thousand comments on this issue within hours
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 377.37 386.83 <o,f0,male> so five hundred people applied and four were selected to actually go and tour the facility in question and thus inspect it and then blog about it
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 387.68 396.60 <o,f0,male> within days the entire incident was forgotten which would have never happened if they simply tried to block the content people would keep talking about it for weeks
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 408.70 415.95 <o,f0,male> it happens when governments are actually reaching out to their critics and letting them engage with each other online
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 417.05 425.08 <o,f0,male> think that somehow this is going to harm these dictatorships but in many cases it only strengthens them and you may wonder why
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 425.36 434.02 <o,f0,male> i'll just give you a very short list of reasons why authoritarian deliberation may actually help the dictators and first it's quite simple
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 434.33 443.49 <o,f0,male> most of them operate in a complete information vacuum they don't really have the data they need in order to identify emerging threats facing the regime
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 443.89 451.05 <o,f0,male> so encouraging people to actually go online and share information and data on blogs and wikis is great because otherwise
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 451.37 461.21 <o,f0,male> low level apparatchiks and bureaucrats will continue concealing what's actually happening in the country right so from this perspective having blogs and wikis produce knowledge has been great
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 479.86 493.33 <o,f0,male> and finally the purpose of any authoritarian deliberation efforts is usually to increase the legitimacy of the regimes both at home and abroad so inviting people to all sorts of public forums having them participate in decision making
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 494.84 501.76 <o,f0,male> it's actually great because what happens is that then you can actually point to this initiative and say well we are having a democracy we are having
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 539.73 547.11 <o,f0,male> actually see that many of the networks and blogs and twitter and facebook were actually operational they may have become slower
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 547.42 556.64 <o,f0,male> but the activists could still access it and actually argue that having access to them is actually great for many authoritarian states and it's great simply because
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 557.60 567.18 <o,f0,male> they can gather open source intelligence in the past it would take you weeks if not months to identify how iranian activists connect to each other
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 580.21 587.08 <o,f0,male> i think the biggest conceptual pitfall that cybertopians made is when it comes to digital natives people who have grown up
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 587.89 598.70 <o,f0,male> we often hear about cyber activism how people are getting more active because of the internet rarely hear about cyber hedonism for example how people are becoming passive why because they somehow assume
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 599.02 612.64 <o,f0,male> that the internet is going to be the catalyst of change that will push young people into the streets while in fact it may actually be the new opium for the masses which will keep the same people in their rooms downloading pornography that's not a option being considered too strongly
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 613.27 621.13 <o,f0,male> so for every digital renegade that is revolting in the streets of tehran there may as well be two digital captives who are actually rebelling only in the world of warcraft
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 638.43 645.06 <o,f0,male> the internet actually broadens their sex life is three times more than in the united states so it does play a social role
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 645.67 653.70 <o,f0,male> however it may not necessarily lead to political engagement so the way i tend to think of it is like a hierarchy of cyberneeds in space a total rip off from
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 654.59 663.70 <o,f0,male> but the point here is that when we get the remote russian village on line what will get people to the internet is not going to be the reports from human rights watch
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 664.22 677.64 <o,f0,male> going to be pornography sex in the city or maybe watching funny videos of cats so this is something you have to recognize so what should we do about it well i say we have to stop thinking about the number of ipods per capita
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 678.15 686.23 <o,f0,male> and start thinking about ways in which we can empower intellectuals dissidents ngos and then the members of civil society
