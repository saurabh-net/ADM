CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 17.19 28.95 <o,f0,male> that i'm the dumbest guy in the room because i couldn't get through school i struggled with school but what i knew at a very early age was that i loved money and i loved business and i loved this entrepreneurial thing and i was raised to be an entrepreneur
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 29.27 39.60 <o,f0,male> and what i've been really passionate about ever since and i've never spoken about this ever until now so this is the first time anyone 's ever heard it except my wife three days ago because she said what are you talking about and i told
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 40.48 47.33 <o,f0,male> is that i think we miss an opportunity to find these kids who have the entrepreneurial traits and to groom them
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 47.92 56.04 <o,f0,male> show them that being an entrepreneur is actually a cool thing it's not something that is a bad thing and is vilified which is what happens in a lot of society
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 56.94 63.56 <o,f0,male> kids when we grow up have dreams and we have passions and we have visions and somehow we get those things crushed
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 73.72 81.12 <o,f0,male> two years ago i was the highest rated lecturer at mit 's entrepreneurial master 's program and it was a speaking event in front of groups of entrepreneurs from around the world
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 81.46 94.82 <o,f0,male> when i was in grade two i won a city wide speaking competition but nobody had ever said hey this kid 's a good speaker he can't focus but he loves walking around and getting people energized no one said get him a coach in speaking they said get me a tutor in what i
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 112.16 120.84 <o,f0,male> be an entrepreneur entrepreneurs are people because we have a lot of them in this room who have these ideas and these passions or see these needs in the world and decide to stand up and do it
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 145.93 152.12 <o,f0,male> we have an obligation as parents and a society to start teaching our kids to fish instead of giving them the fish
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 152.55 163.18 <o,f0,male> the old parable if you give a man a fish you feed him for a day if you teach a man to fish you feed him for a lifetime if we can teach our kids to become entrepreneurial the ones that show those traits to be like we teach the ones who have science
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 163.66 172.12 <o,f0,male> gifts to go on in science what if we saw the ones who had entrepreneurial traits and taught them to be entrepreneurs we could have all these kids spreading businesses instead of waiting for government handouts
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 172.76 177.50 <o,f0,male> what we do is we sit and teach our kids all the things they shouldn 't do don't hit don't bite don't swear
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 177.96 187.65 <o,f0,male> right now we teach our kids to go after really good jobs you know and the school system teaches them to go after things like being a doctor and being a lawyer and being an accountant and a dentist and a teacher and a pilot
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 188.09 198.63 <o,f0,male> and the media says that it's really cool if we could go out and be a model or a singer or a sports hero like sidney crosby our mba programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 217.18 225.97 <o,f0,male> even in popular literature the only book i've ever found and this should be on all of your reading lists the only book i've ever found that makes the entrepreneur into the hero is atlas shrugged
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 236.95 245.15 <o,f0,male> and we all decided to start these things because it's really the only place we fit we didn't fit in the normal work we couldn't work for somebody else because we're too stubborn and we have all these other traits
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 245.77 259.66 <o,f0,male> kids could be entrepreneurs as well i'm a big part of a couple organizations globally called the entrepreneurs organization and the young presidents organization i just came back from speaking in barcelona at the ypo global conference and everyone that i met over there who 's an entrepreneur
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 288.89 299.01 <o,f0,male> go on and on kids you can see these signs in kids and what we're doing is we're giving them ritalin and saying don 't be an entrepreneurial type fit into this other system and try to become a student
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 299.88 314.14 <o,f0,male> aren't students we fast track we figure out the game i stole essays i cheated on exams i hired kids to do my accounting assignments in university for thirteen consecutive assignments but as an entrepreneur you don't do accounting you hire accountants so i just figured that out earlier
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 318.07 327.87 <o,f0,male> at least i can admit i cheated in university most of you won 't i'm also quoted and i told the person who wrote the textbook i'm now quoted in that exact same university textbook in every canadian
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 356.15 364.88 <o,f0,male> heard those things about is it nurture or is it nature right is it thing one or thing two what is it well i don't think it's either i think it can be both i was groomed as an entrepreneur
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 365.07 373.21 <o,f0,male> when i was growing up as a young kid i had no choice because i was taught at a very early young age when my dad realized i wasn't going to fit in to everything else that was being taught to me in school
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 373.55 383.21 <o,f0,male> that he could teach me to figure out business at an early age he groomed us the three of us to hate the thought of having a job and to love the fact of creating companies that we could employ other people
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 383.46 393.18 <o,f0,male> my first little business venture i was seven years old i was in winnipeg and i was lying in my bedroom with one of those long extension cords and i was calling all the dry cleaners in winnipeg to find out how much would the dry cleaners pay me
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 393.42 399.42 <o,f0,male> for coat hangers and my mom came into the room and she said where are you going to get the coat hangers to sell to the dry cleaners
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 409.04 418.54 <o,f0,male> i was going door to door in the neighborhood to collect coat hangers to put in the basement to sell because i saw her a few weeks before that you could get paid they used to pay you two cents per coat hanger
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 418.86 424.62 <o,f0,male> so i was just like well there's all kinds of coat hangers and so i'll just go get them and i knew she wouldn't want me to go get them so i just did
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 426.56 440.11 <o,f0,male> and i learned that you could actually negotiate with people this one person offered me three cents and i got him up to three and a half i even knew at a seven year old age that i could actually get a fractional percent of a cent and people would pay that because it multiplied up at seven years old i figured it out i got three and a half cents
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 440.45 449.89 <o,f0,male> for a thousand coat hangers i sold license plate protectors door to door my dad actually made me go find someone who would sell me these things at wholesale and at nine years old i walked around the city of sudbury
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 468.92 478.13 <o,f0,male> but you have two cars and they don't have license plate protectors and he said i know and i said the car here 's got one license plate that's all crumpled up and he said yes that's my wife 's car and i said why don't we just test one
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 478.40 486.98 <o,f0,male> on the front of your wife 's car and see if it lasts longer so i knew there were two cars with two license plates on each if i couldn't sell all four i could at least get one i learned that at a young age
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 487.27 500.08 <o,f0,male> i did comic book arbitrage when i was about ten years old i sold comic books out of our cottage on georgian bay and i would go biking up to the end of the beach and buy all the comics from the poor kids and then i would go back to the other end of the beach and sell them to the rich kids
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 508.04 515.03 <o,f0,male> so that's obvious right it's like a recession so there's a recession there's still thirteen trillion dollars circulating in the u s economy go get some of
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 532.44 541.48 <o,f0,male> so not only would he get me one but i had to get two and then he wanted me to hire someone to deliver half the papers which i did and then i realized that collecting tips was where you made all the money so i would collect the tips
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 541.89 551.34 <o,f0,male> and get payment so i would go and collect for all the papers he could just deliver them because then i realized i could make the money by this point i was definitely not going to be an employee
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 553.32 559.53 <o,f0,male> my dad owned an automotive and industrial repair shop and he had all these old automotive parts lying around and they had this old brass and copper
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 577.16 583.11 <o,f0,male> i got paid and i thought that was kind of cool strangely enough thirty years later we're building one eight hundred got junk and making money
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 594.90 602.36 <o,f0,male> make these chairs and i had these little pillows that i would sew up and you could stuff pins in them because people used to sew and they needed a pin cushion
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 604.45 612.51 <o,f0,male> but what i realized was that you had to have options so i actually spray painted a whole bunch of them brown and then when i went to the door it wasn 't do you want to buy one it was which color would you like
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 623.32 631.77 <o,f0,male> right like cutting lawns is brutal but because i had to cut lawns all summer for all of our neighbors and get paid to do that i realized that recurring revenue
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 632.15 640.70 <o,f0,male> from one client is amazing that if i land this client once and every week i get paid by that person that's way better than trying to sell one
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 650.69 658.98 <o,f0,male> i would caddy i would go to the golf course and caddy for people but i realized that there was this one hill on our golf course the thirteenth hole that had this huge hill and people could never get their bags up
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 659.51 669.16 <o,f0,male> so i would sit there with a lawn chair and just carry up all the people who didn't have caddies i would carry their golf bags up to the top and they'd pay me a dollar meanwhile my friends were working for five hours
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 669.74 677.09 <o,f0,male> some guy 's bag around and get paid ten bucks i'm like that 's stupid because you have to work for five hours that doesn't make any sense you just figure out a way to make more money faster
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 677.72 690.41 <o,f0,male> every week i would go to the corner store and buy all these pops then i would go up and deliver them to these seventy year old women playing bridge and they'd give me their orders for the following week and then i'd just deliver pop and i'd just charge twice and i had this captured market you didn't need contracts
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 699.02 707.36 <o,f0,male> i went and got golf balls from golf courses but everybody else was looking in the bush and looking in the ditches for golf balls i'm like screw that they're all in the pond
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 707.68 715.64 <o,f0,male> and nobody 's going into the pond so i would go into the ponds and crawl around and pick them up with my toes you just pick them up with both feet you can't do it on stage and
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 726.78 734.11 <o,f0,male> i packaged them up three ways i had the pinnacles and ddhs and the really cool ones back then those sold for two dollars each and then i had all the good ones that didn't look crappy
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 743.47 751.40 <o,f0,male> to all the kids in high school this is what really kind of gets everybody hating you is because you're trying to extract money from all your friends all the time but it paid the bills
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 751.96 759.91 <o,f0,male> so i sold lots and lots of sunglasses and then when the school shut me down the school actually called me into the office and told me i couldn't do it so i went to the gas stations and i sold
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 760.55 771.11 <o,f0,male> lots of them to the gas stations and had the gas stations sell them to their customers that was cool because then i had retail outlets and i think i was fourteen and then i paid my entire way through first year university
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 771.81 783.62 <o,f0,male> by selling wine skins door to door you know that you can hold a forty oz bottle of rum and two bottles of coke in a wineskin so what right yeah but you know what you stuff that down your shorts when you go into a football game you can get booze in for free everybody bought them
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 791.92 800.70 <o,f0,male> you know we teach our kids and we buy them games but why don't we get them games if they're entrepreneurial kids that kind of nurture the traits that you need to be entrepreneurs why don't you teach them
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 801.11 813.47 <o,f0,male> not to waste money i remember being told to walk out in the middle of a street in banff alberta because i'd thrown a penny out on the street and my dad said go pick it up he said i work too damn hard for my money i'm not going to see you ever waste a penny and i remember that lesson to this day
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 824.42 834.41 <o,f0,male> breeding kids at a young age to expect a regular paycheck that's wrong for me if you want to raise entrepreneurs what i do with my kids now i've got two nine and seven is i teach them to walk around the house and the yard looking for
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 834.80 845.15 <o,f0,male> that needs to get done come to me and tell me what it is or i'll come to them and say here 's what i need done and then you know what we do we negotiate they go around looking for what it is but then we negotiate on what they're going to get paid
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 863.58 872.46 <o,f0,male> the fifty percent that goes in their house account every six months goes to the bank they walk up with me every year all the money in the bank goes to their broker both my nine and seven year old have a stock broker already
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 874.13 882.42 <o,f0,male> but i'm teaching them to force that savings habit it drives me crazy that thirty year olds are saying maybe i'll start contributing to my rsp now shit you've missed twenty five years
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 895.84 907.66 <o,f0,male> a red shirt a blue tie a kangaroo and a laptop and have them tell a story about those four things my kids do that all the time it teaches them to sell it teaches them creativity it teaches them to think on their feet just do that kind of stuff and have fun with it
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 908.36 916.49 <o,f0,male> get kids to stand up in front of groups and talk even if it's just stand up in front of their friends and do plays and have speeches those are entrepreneurial traits that you want to be nurturing
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 916.85 927.49 <o,f0,male> show the kids what bad customers or bad employees look like show them the grumpy employees when you see grumpy customer service point that out to them say by the way that guys a crappy employee and say these ones are good ones
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 930.17 941.34 <o,f0,male> if you go into a restaurant and you have bad customer service show them what bad customer service looks like we've all these lessons in front of us but we don't take those opportunities we teach kids to go get a tutor
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 959.51 968.84 <o,f0,male> pull up the photos teach them how to do that kind of stuff and make money then the money they get fifty percent goes in their house account fifty percent goes in their toy account my kids love this stuff
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 981.07 989.67 <o,f0,male> two traits that i want you to also look out for that we don't kind of get out of their system don't medicate kids for attention deficit disorder unless it is really really freaking bad
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 991.73 1000.36 <o,f0,male> the same with the whole things on mania and stress and depression unless it is so clinically brutal man bipolar disorder is nicknamed the ceo disease when steve jurvetson
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 1000.78 1010.53 <o,f0,male> and jim clark and jim barksdale have all got it and they built netscape imagine if they were given ritalin we wouldn't have have that stuff right al gore would have really invented the internet
CameronHerold_2009X 1 CameronHerold_2009X 1027.74 1039.32 <o,f0,male> a video that was done by one of the companies that i mentor these guys grasshopper it's about kids it's about entrepreneurship hopefully this inspires you to take what you've heard from me and do something with it to change the world
