EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 19.29 29.5 <o,f0,male> wake up in the morning you get dressed put on your shoes you head out into the world you plan on coming back
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 29.5 47.39 <o,f0,male> getting undressed going to bed waking up doing it again and that anticipation that rhythm helps give us a structure to how we organize ourselves and our lives and gives it a measure of predictability
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 47.39 65.28 <o,f0,male> living in new york city as i do it 's almost as if with so many people doing so many things at the same time in such close quarters it 's almost like life is dealing you extra hands out of that deck
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 65.28 74.58 <o,f0,male> you 're never there 's just juxtapositions are possible that just aren 't you don 't think they 're going to happen
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 74.58 85.07 <o,f0,male> and you never think you 're going to be the guy who 's walking down the street and because you choose to go down one side or the other the rest of your life is changed forever
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 85.07 90.93 <o,f0,male> and one night i 'm riding the uptown local train
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 90.93 101.29 <o,f0,male> i get on i tend to be a little bit vigilant when i get on the subway i 'm not one of the people zoning out with headphones or a book
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 133 145.8 <o,f0,male> and at the next stop a guy gets on the car and he has this sort of visiting professor look to him he 's got the overstuffed leather satchel and the rectangular file
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 145.8 149.56 <o,f0,male> case and a laptop bag and the tweed jacket with the leather patches
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 149.56 153.18 <o,f0,male> and laughter he looks at them
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 153.18 167.14 <o,f0,male> and then in a blink of an eye he kneels down in front of them and he starts to say you know listen here 's how you can do it look if you do this and he takes the laces out of their hand and instantly he starts tying these knots
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 167.14 180.31 <o,f0,male> and even better than they were doing it remarkably and it turns out they are medical students on their way to a lecture about the latest suturing techniques and he 's the guy giving the lecture
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 192.61 202.54 <o,f0,male> it 's going to be you 're going to have all this information coming at you there 's going to be organs getting in the way it 's going to be slippery and it
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 202.75 220.92 <o,f0,male> it 's just very important that you be able to do these beyond second nature each hand left hand right hand you have to be able to do them without seeing your fingers and at that moment when i heard that i just got catapulted out of the subway car into a night
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 220.92 228.69 <o,f0,male> when i had been getting a ride in an ambulance from the sidewalk where i had been stabbed
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 228.7 243.41 <o,f0,male> to the trauma room of st vincent 's hospital in manhattan and what had happened was a gang had come in from brooklyn as part of an initiation for three of their members they had to kill somebody and i happened
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 253.32 258.97 <o,f0,male> things when i was at notre dame i was on the boxing team so i put my hands up
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 259.01 266.35 <o,f0,male> right away instinctively the guy on the right had a knife with a ten inch blade and he went in
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 266.35 273.05 <o,f0,male> under my elbow and it went up and cut my inferior vena cava
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 273.05 288.22 <o,f0,male> if you know anything about anatomy that 's not a good thing to get cut and everything of course on the way up and then i still had my hands up he pulled it out and went for my neck and sunk it in up to the hilt in my neck
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 288.22 297.14 <o,f0,male> and i got one straight right punch and knocked the middle guy out the other guy was still working on me collapsing my other lung
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 297.14 314.31 <o,f0,male> and i managed to by hitting that guy to get a minute i ran down the street and collapsed and the ambulance guys intubated me on the sidewalk and let the trauma room know they had an incoming and one of the
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 314.31 320.64 <o,f0,male> side effects of having major massive blood loss is you get tunnel vision
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 320.64 332.97 <o,f0,male> so i remember being on the stretcher and having a little nickel sized cone of vision and i was moving my head around and we got to st vincent 's and we 're racing down this hallway and i see the lights going
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 332.97 334.53 <o,f0,male> and
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 334.53 353.38 <o,f0,male> it 's a peculiar effect of memories like that they don 't really go to the usual place that memories go they kind of have this vault where they 're stored in high def and george lucas did all the sound effects
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 357.81 369.12 <o,f0,male> it 's not like any other kind of memories and i get into the trauma room and they 're waiting for me and the lights are there and
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 369.12 382.77 <o,f0,male> i 'd been able to breathe a little more now because the blood has left had been filling up my lungs and i was having a very hard time breathing but now it 's kind of gone into the stretcher and i said
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 382.77 397.53 <o,f0,male> is there anything i can do to help and laughter the nurse kind of had a hysterical laugh and i 'm turning my head trying to see everybody and i had this weird memory of being in college and raising
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 399.13 414.73 <o,f0,male> raising money for the flood victims of bangladesh and then i look over and my anesthesiologist is clamping the mask on me and i think he looks bangladeshi laughter and i just have those two facts and i just think this could work somehow
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 426.28 435.92 <o,f0,male> did their work and the surgeon took out about a third of my intestines my cecum organs i didn 't know that i had
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 435.92 446.68 <o,f0,male> and he later told me one of the last things he did while he was in there was to remove my appendix for me which i thought was great you know just a little tidy thing there at the end
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 459.74 469.67 <o,f0,male> so he was there when i woke up and it was waking up was like breaking through the ice into a frozen lake of pain
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 469.67 483.4 <o,f0,male> it was that enveloping and there was only one spot that didn 't hurt worse than anything i 'd ever felt and it was my instep and he was holding the arch of my foot
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 499.04 511.46 <o,f0,male> and he said you know we didn 't cut your hair i thought you might have gotten strength from your hair like samson and you 're going to need all the strength you can get
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 511.46 519.06 <o,f0,male> and in those days my hair was down to my waist i drove a motorcycle i was unmarried i owned a bar
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 519.06 527.9 <o,f0,male> so those were different times laughter but i had three days of life support
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 527.9 539.31 <o,f0,male> and everybody was expecting due to just the massive amount of what they had had to do that i wasn 't going to make it so
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 560.73 576.5 <o,f0,male> and he does that and they all look and there was no infection and they bend over me and they 're poking and prodding and they 're like there 's no hematomas blah blah look at the color and they 're talking amongst themselves and i 'm like this restored automobile that he 's just
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 606.2 615.18 <o,f0,male> i went back to him and i was sort of asking him you know what am i gonna do
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 615.18 633.63 <o,f0,male> and i think kind of as a surgeon he basically said kid i saved your life like now you can do whatever you want like you gotta get on with that it 's like i gave you a new car and you 're complaining about not finding parking like just go out and you know do your best but
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 633.63 637.88 <o,f0,male> you 're alive that 's what it 's about
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 637.88 654 <o,f0,male> and then i hear bing bong and the subway doors are closing and my stop is next and i look at these kids and i go i think to myself i 'm going to lift my shirt up and
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 668.37 688.32 <o,f0,male> and i feel my index finger in the first scar that i ever got from my umbilical cord and then around that is traced the last scar that i got from my surgeon
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 688.32 702.65 <o,f0,male> and i think that that chance encounter with those kids on the street with their knives led me to my surgical team
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 702.65 707.7 <o,f0,male> and their training
EdGavagan_2012P 1 EdGavagan_2012P 715.11 717.66 <o,f0,male> thank you applause applause thank you
