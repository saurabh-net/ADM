JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 17.45 22.09 <o,f0,male> is about righting writing wrongs no the sound 's not faulty righting writing wrongs
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 22.62 24.42 <o,f0,male> the middle east is huge
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 50.13 62.12 <o,f0,male> now is the time for us to laugh at ourselves before others can laugh with us this is the story of the rise and rise of stand up comedy in the middle east a stand up uprising if you will
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 63.07 70.17 <o,f0,male> working in london as tv maker and writer i quickly realized that comedy connects audiences
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 70.56 79.36 <o,f0,male> now the best breeding ground for good comic writing is the stand up comedy circuit where they just happen to say that you kill when you do well and you bomb when you do badly
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 79.96 82.65 <o,f0,male> an unfortunate connection for us maybe but it reminds me that
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 83.64 90.99 <o,f0,male> to thank one man for over the past decade working tirelessly to support comedians all around the world specifically
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 97.36 107.05 <o,f0,male> like my good friends dean and maysoon at the bottom of the screen who two years after nine eleven started a festival to change the way middle easterners are perceived in the world
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 107.33 116.86 <o,f0,male> it's still going strong with positive press to die for also three guys working for years in los angeles an iranian a palestinian and an egyptian
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 119.67 122.39 <o,f0,male> comedy act and wherever they went
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 123.32 124.28 <o,f0,male> they killed
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 125.89 135.77 <o,f0,male> now i didn't start this fire but i did pour petrol on it i moved to dubai as the head of original content for a western tv network my job was to connect the brand with a middle eastern audience
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 138.96 140.91 <o,f0,male> the american head of programming
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 141.67 144.01 <o,f0,male> wanted new local arabic comedy
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 145.57 146.98 <o,f0,male> in a thick arabic accent my brain
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 149.35 156.17 <o,f0,male> now i had friends in the u s who had started a successful new tribe
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 157.34 164.07 <o,f0,male> and i had every intention of taking them from being outliers in the middle east and pushing them over the tipping point towards success
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 165.93 177.37 <o,f0,male> now as with any new idea it wasn't easy i had four phases to this plan first we'd need to buy content from the west and air it then i'd bring my friends and we'd show local amateurs how it's done we would film that and air it
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 187.15 195.68 <o,f0,male> so i retreated back to my cave and continued to support and produce comedy and let my friends use my couch as a regional operations hub
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 196.26 198.88 <o,f0,male> now fast forward two years to early two thousand and seven
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 200.49 202.68 <o,f0,male> earth rotated as did our management
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 203.98 208.66 <o,f0,male> and as if by divine intervention things came
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 214.15 217.77 <o,f0,male> axis guys recorded a comedy central special that aired in the states
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 218.06 219.43 <o,f0,male> and it was getting great hits on
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 220.93 224.52 <o,f0,male> our new french ceo believed in the power of positive pr
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 224.68 230.43 <o,f0,male> and ideas du bon marche let 's just say value for money
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 231.98 244.79 <o,f0,male> i produced in dubai a show for ahmed ahmed to showcase his new axis special to a packed room i invited our new ceo and as soon as he realized we had a room packed full of laughing infidels his reaction was very simple let 's make this
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 246.82 259.77 <o,f0,male> and one more thing no don't f it up so i quickly went to work with a great team around me i happened to find a funny guy to present it in arabic who is originally korean
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 260.93 269.98 <o,f0,male> perfect fit for the axis of evil this is all true now while preparing for the tour i had to remind the guys to be culturally sensitive i used the three bs of stand up
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 270.17 279.05 <o,f0,male> don'ts as i call them in the middle east blue content keep it clean beliefs not religion and the third b bolitics
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 279.68 283.11 <o,f0,male> stay away from bolitics in the middle east oh course you might
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 295.75 304.86 <o,f0,male> the axis successful in five countries in just under a month we had thousands of fanatical fans come and see them live we had millions see them on tv and on tv news
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 305.45 313.34 <o,f0,male> in jordan we had his majesty the king come and see them in fact they were so successful that you could buy a pirated copy of their dvd even before it was
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 316.53 316.94 <o,f0,male> so
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 318.75 324.58 <o,f0,male> we auditioned amateurs we filmed that process and aired a documentary i called it three guys and
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 325.89 328.08 <o,f0,male> it really is his name
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 331.15 344.97 <o,f0,male> and all this tv and internet exposure has led to a great many recruits to our cause in dubai this year we've just had the first all women 's homegrown stand up show and notice two of them are wearing headscarves and yes even they can laugh
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 346.48 347.51 <o,f0,male> dubai to me is like
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 352.51 357.10 <o,f0,male> twenty years ago no one had heard of it look at it now
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 357.49 368.67 <o,f0,male> with an inspirational leader i think this year the opening of the tallest tower in the world is like adding a finger to that hand that points at all those who spread fallacious stories about us
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 373.23 373.74 <o,f0,male> now
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 374.67 382.37 <o,f0,male> in three short years we've come a long way with stand up comedy shows happening even in saudi arabia these comics are now going to the new york festival
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 382.75 394.10 <o,f0,male> and the lebanese brilliant lebanese nemr abou nassar we featured in our first tour has just been performing in l a s legendary comedy clubs so clearly from the inside we are doing our best to change our image and it's exploding
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 395.73 402.73 <o,f0,male> so as for the outsiders looking in watch the cnn report on the second anman comedy festival
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 403.02 411.17 <o,f0,male> the reporter did a great job and i thank her but somebody forgot to send the positive pr email to the person operating the automatic news ticker that appears at the bottom
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 411.58 419.48 <o,f0,male> for example when dean talks the ticker says u s suspect gave actionable intel well if you're used to listening to comedians
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 419.99 422.61 <o,f0,male> then i'm not surprised
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 422.87 430.43 <o,f0,male> sadly this leads me to another three bs that represents how the media in the west talks about us as bombers billionaires and
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 432.95 433.60 <o,f0,male> enough
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 451.48 459.26 <o,f0,male> here are three questions that i like to use to test the truthiness of our representation in any media story one
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 460.07 465.28 <o,f0,male> is the middle east being shown in a current time and correct context
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 472.61 477.58 <o,f0,male> do the middle eastern characters laugh or smile without showing the whites of their eyes
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 481.83 482.54 <o,f0,male> is the middle
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 483.77 485.28 <o,f0,male> being played by one
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 489.29 495.02 <o,f0,male> there are wrongs that need to be righted we've started in our region my challenge to the rest of the world
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 495.91 505.13 <o,f0,male> please start using positive middle eastern images in your stories for inspiration go to one of our festivals go online drop us a line let 's change the narrative together
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 506.39 513.98 <o,f0,male> and let 's start righting writing wrongs i'd like to end before going back to the middle east with a quote from one of the greatest sheikhs
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 514.54 520.86 <o,f0,male> to put quill to parchment as my father likes to call him asheikh azubare as my mother would say shakespeare
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 1 JamilAbuWardeh_2010G 521.75 527.65 <o,f0,male> and now we go in content to liberty and not to banishment thank you
