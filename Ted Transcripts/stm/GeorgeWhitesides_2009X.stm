GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 15.97 16.10 <o,f0,female> the
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 16.33 29.23 <o,f0,male> problem that i want to talk with you about is really the problem of how does one supply healthcare in a world in which cost is everything how do you do that
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 30.47 42.31 <o,f0,male> the basic paradigm we want to suggest to you i want to suggest to you is one in which you say that in order to treat disease you have to first know what you're treating that's diagnostics and then you have to do something
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 42.69 50.25 <o,f0,male> so the program that we're involved in is something which we call diagnostics for all or zero cost diagnostics how do you provide
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 59.22 67.40 <o,f0,male> the rigors of military medicine are not so dissimilar from the third world poor resources a rigorous environment
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 68.19 76.76 <o,f0,male> a series of problems in light weight and things of this kind and also not so different from the home healthcare and diagnostic system world
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 77.28 89.62 <o,f0,male> so the technology that i want to talk about is for the third world for the developing world but it has i think much broader application because information is so important in the healthcare system
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 90.34 101.99 <o,f0,male> so you see two examples here one is a lab that is actually a fairly high end laboratory in africa the second is basically an entrepreneur who is set up and doing who knows what
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 102.15 110.15 <o,f0,male> in a table in a market i don't know what kind of healthcare is delivered there but it's not really what is probably most efficient
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 111.66 112.44 <o,f0,male> what is our
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 113.60 114.26 <o,f0,male> approach
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 115.67 124.91 <o,f0,male> the way in which one typically approaches a problem of lowering cost starting from the perspective of the united states is to take our solution
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 125.35 133.97 <o,f0,male> and then to try to cut cost out of it no matter how you do that you're not going to start with one hundred thousand dollar instrument and bring it down to no cost it isn't going to work
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 134.79 147.25 <o,f0,male> so the approach that we took was the other way around to ask what is the cheapest possible stuff that you could make a diagnostic system out of and get useful information add function and what we've chosen is paper
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 147.65 159.58 <o,f0,male> what you see here is a prototypic device it's about a centimeter on the side it's about the size of a fingernail the lines around the edges are a polymer it's made of paper
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 160.19 173.62 <o,f0,male> and paper of course wicks fluid as you know paper cloth drop wine on the table cloth and the wine wicks all over everything put it on your shirt it ruins the shirt that's what a hydrophilic surface does
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 174.21 188.18 <o,f0,male> so in this device the idea is that you drip the bottom end of it in a drop of in this case urine the fluid wicks its way into those chambers at the top the brown color indicates the amount of glucose in the urine
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 188.51 196.91 <o,f0,male> the blue color indicates the amount of protein in the urine and the combination of those two is a first order shot at a number of useful things that you
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 197.13 203.87 <o,f0,male> want so this is an example of a device made from a simple piece of paper now how simple can you make the production
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 204.51 214.09 <o,f0,male> why do we choose paper there is an example of the same thing on a finger showing you basically what it looks like one reason for using paper is that it's everywhere
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 214.30 223.51 <o,f0,male> we have made these kinds of devices using napkins and toilet paper and wraps and all kinds of stuff so the production capability is
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 236.05 248.55 <o,f0,male> and then finally a point that you don't think of so much in developed world medicine it eliminates sharps and what sharps means in needles things that stick if you've taken a sample of someone 's blood
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 248.97 262.68 <o,f0,male> and the someone might have hepatitis c you don't want to make a mistake and stick it in you it just you don't want to do that so how do you dispose of that it's a problem everywhere and here you simply burn it so it's a sort of a practical approach to starting on things
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 264.80 275.53 <o,f0,male> now you say if paper is a good idea other people have surely though of it and the answer is of course yes those half of you roughly who are women
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 287.15 293.83 <o,f0,male> in that particular test urine either containing a hormone called hcg does or does not flow across
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 294.11 302.14 <o,f0,male> a piece of paper and there are two bars one bar indicates that the test is working and if the second bar shows up you're pregnant
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 302.60 313.13 <o,f0,male> this is a terrific kind of test in a binary world and the nice thing about pregnancy is either you are pregnant or you're not pregnant you're not partially pregnant or thinking about being pregnant or something of that sort
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 313.85 319.93 <o,f0,male> so it works very well there but it doesn't work very well when you need more quantitative information there are also dipsticks
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 320.18 330.10 <o,f0,male> but if you look at the dipsticks they're for another kind of urine analysis there are an awful lot of colors and things like that what do you actually do about that in a difficult circumstance
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 331.88 332.22 <o,f0,male> so
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 332.46 340.04 <o,f0,male> the approach that we started with is to ask is it really practical to make things of this sort and
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 340.24 350.59 <o,f0,male> that problem is now in a purely engineering way solved and the procedure that we have is simply to start with paper you run it through a new kind of printer called a wax printer
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 350.92 364.50 <o,f0,male> the wax printer does what looks like printing it is printing you put that on you warm it a little bit the wax prints through so it absorbs into the paper and you end up with the device that you want the printers cost eight hundred bucks now
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 365.48 373.99 <o,f0,male> make we estimate that if you were to run them twenty four hours a day they'd make about ten million tests a year so it's a solved problem that particular problem is solved
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 374.45 383.63 <o,f0,male> and there is an example of the kind of thing that you see that's on a piece of eight by twelve paper that takes about two seconds to make and so i regard that as done
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 384.24 393.93 <o,f0,male> a very important issue here which is that because it's a printer a color printer it prints colors that's what color printers do i'll show you in a moment that's actually quite useful
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 395.93 402.00 <o,f0,male> now the next question that you would like to ask is what would you like to measure what would you like to analyze and
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 402.21 411.92 <o,f0,male> the thing which you'd most like to analyze we're a fair distance from it's what's called fever of undiagnosed origin someone comes into the clinic
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 412.41 425.60 <o,f0,male> they have a fever they feel bad what do they have do they have t b do they have aids do they have a common cold the triage problem that's a hard problem for reasons that i won 't go through there are an awful lot of things that you'd like to distinguish among
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 426.23 437.90 <o,f0,male> but then there are a series of things aids hepatitis malaria tb others and simpler ones such as guidance of treatment now even that is more complicated than you think
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 438.31 447.00 <o,f0,male> a friend of mine works in trans cultural psychiatry and he is interested in the question of why people do and don't take their meds
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 447.64 454.41 <o,f0,male> so dapsone or something like that you have to take it for a while there is a wonderful story of talking to a villager in india
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 468.58 480.35 <o,f0,male> the truth because in a different culture the dog is a surrogate for you you know today this month since the rainy season there are lots of opportunities for misunderstanding
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 481.08 489.13 <o,f0,male> and so an issue here is to in some cases to figure out how to deal with matters that seem uninteresting like compliance
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 490.49 504.18 <o,f0,male> now take a look at what a typical test looks like prick a finger you get some blood about fifty microliters that's about all you're going to get because you can't use the usual sort of systems
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 504.88 512.81 <o,f0,male> you can't manipulate it very well although i'll show something about that in a moment so you take the drop of blood no further manipulations you put it on a little device
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 513.36 521.39 <o,f0,male> the device filters out the blood cells lets the serum go through and you get a series of colors down in the bottom there
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 521.96 532.91 <o,f0,male> and the colors indicate disease or normal but even that is complicated because to you to me colors might indicate normal but after all we're all
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 533.55 544.46 <o,f0,male> suffering from probably an excess of education what you do about something which requires quantitative analysis and so the solution that we and many other people are thinking about
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 545.12 553.78 <o,f0,male> and at this point there is a dramatic flourish and out comes the universal solution to everything these days which is a cell phone in this particular case a camera phone
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 554.22 562.05 <o,f0,male> they are everywhere six billion a month in india and the idea is that what one does is to
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 562.87 573.84 <o,f0,male> take the device you dip it you develop the color you take a picture the picture goes to a central laboratory you don't have to send out a doctor you send out somebody who can just take the sample
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 574.61 585.58 <o,f0,male> the clinic either a doctor or ideally a computer in this case does the analysis turns out to work actually quite well particularly when your color printer has printed the color bars that indicate how things work
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 586.04 602.16 <o,f0,male> so my view of the health care worker of the future is not a doctor but an eighteen year old otherwise unemployed who has two things he has a backpack full of these tests and a lancet to occasionally take a blood sample and an ak forty seven and these are the things that get him through his day
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 605.45 616.44 <o,f0,male> there is another very interesting connection here and that is that what one wants to do is to pass through useful information over what is generally a pretty awful telephone system
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 616.87 628.05 <o,f0,male> it turns out there is an enormous amount of information already available on that subject which is the mars rover problem how do you get back an accurate view of the color on mars if you have a really
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 628.39 642.12 <o,f0,male> terrible bandwidth to do it with and the answer is not complicated but it's one which i don't want to go through here other than to say that the communication systems for doing this are really pretty well understood also a fact which you may not know
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 642.64 652.65 <o,f0,male> is that the compute capability of this thing is not so different from the compute capability of your desktop computer this is a fantastic device which is only beginning to be tapped
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 652.90 662.68 <o,f0,male> i don't know whether the idea of one computer one child makes any sense here is the computer of the future because this screen is already there and they're ubiquitous
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 664.23 672.45 <o,f0,male> now let me show you just a little bit about advanced devices and we'll start by posing a little problem what you see here is another centimeter sized device
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 673.12 680.63 <o,f0,male> and the different colors are different colors of dye and you notice something which might strike you as a little bit interesting which is
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 698.93 711.25 <o,f0,male> and the answer is that what you do and the details are not terribly important here is to make something more elaborate you take several different layers of paper each one containing its own little fluid system
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 711.60 718.67 <o,f0,male> and you separate them by pieces of literally double sided carpet tape the stuff you use to stick the carpets onto the floor
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 719.13 726.71 <o,f0,male> and the fluid will flow from one layer into the next it distributes itself flows through further holes distributes itself
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 727.13 735.23 <o,f0,male> and what you see at the lower right hand side there is a sample in which a single sample of blood has been put on the top
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 735.78 745.19 <o,f0,male> and it has gone through and distributed itself into these sixteen holes on the bottom in a piece of paper basically it looks like a chip two pieces of paper
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 746.14 754.62 <o,f0,male> and in this particular case we were just interested in the replicability of that but that is in principle the way you solve the fever of unexplained origin problem
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 754.98 760.75 <o,f0,male> because each one of those spots then becomes a test for a particular set of markers of disease
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 761.27 775.60 <o,f0,male> and this will work in due course and here is an example of a slightly more complicated device there is the chip you dip in a corner the fluid goes into the center it distributes itself out into these various wells or holes and turns color
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 776.20 783.72 <o,f0,male> and all done with paper and carpet tape so i think it's as low cost as we're likely to be able to come up and make things
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 784.75 797.31 <o,f0,male> now i have one last two last little stories to tell you in finishing off this business this is one one of the things that one does occasionally need to do is to separate blood cells from serum
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 798.18 804.32 <o,f0,male> and the question was here we do it by taking a sample we put it in a centrifuge
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 804.75 812.36 <o,f0,male> we spin it and you get blood cells out terrific what happens if you don't have an electricity and a centrifuge and whatever
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 813.14 819.61 <o,f0,male> and we thought for a while of how you might do this and the way in fact you do it is what's shown here you get an eggbeater
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 820.09 826.96 <o,f0,male> which is everywhere and you saw off a blade and then you take tubing and you stick it on that you put the blood in you spin it somebody
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 828.66 841.29 <o,f0,male> really really well and we said that we did the physics of eggbeaters and self aligning tubes and all the rest of that kind of thing sent it off to a journal we were very proud of this particularly the title which was eggbeater as centrifuge
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 841.97 849.34 <o,f0,male> and we sent it off and by return mail it came back i called up the editor and i said what 's going on how is this possible
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 849.62 858.18 <o,f0,male> the editor said with enormous disdain i read this and we're not going to publish it because we only publish science
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 859.55 870.49 <o,f0,male> and it's an important issue because it means that we have to as a society think about what we value and if it's just papers and phys rev letters we've got a problem
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 871.07 884.62 <o,f0,male> here is another example of something which is this is a little spectrophotometer it measures the absorption of light in a sample the neat thing about this is you have light source that flickers on and off at about one thousand hertz
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 885.03 891.07 <o,f0,male> another light source that detects that light at one thousand hertz and so you can run this system in broad daylight
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 891.47 897.84 <o,f0,male> it performs about equivalently to a system that's in the order of one hundred thousand dollars
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 916.11 929.19 <o,f0,male> we thought about this as a kind of engineering problem and we've asked what is the scientific unifying idea here and we've decided that we should think about this not so much in terms of cost but in terms of simplicity
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 956.80 968.45 <o,f0,male> and i want to give you the answer of this deep scientific thought so in a sense you get what you pay for thank you very much
