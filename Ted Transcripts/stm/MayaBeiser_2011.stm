MayaBeiser_2011 1 MayaBeiser_2011 448.14 457.78 <o,f0,female> thank you imagining a solo cello concert one would most likely think of johann sebastian bach unaccompanied cello suites
MayaBeiser_2011 1 MayaBeiser_2011 458.61 463.05 <o,f0,female> as a child studying these eternal masterpieces
MayaBeiser_2011 1 MayaBeiser_2011 474.3 483.14 <o,f0,female> late at night after hours of practicing i would listen to janis joplin and billie holiday as the sounds of tango music would be creeping from my parents
MayaBeiser_2011 1 MayaBeiser_2011 483.51 485.55 <o,f0,female> stereo
MayaBeiser_2011 1 MayaBeiser_2011 485.55 489.84 <o,f0,female> it all became music to me i didn 't hear the boundaries
MayaBeiser_2011 1 MayaBeiser_2011 490.09 498.32 <o,f0,female> i still start every day practicing playing bach his music never ceases to sound fresh and surprising to me
MayaBeiser_2011 1 MayaBeiser_2011 498.32 513.48 <o,f0,female> but as i was moving away from the traditional classical repertoire and trying to find new ways of musical expression i realized that with today 's technological resources there 's no reason to limit what can be produced
MayaBeiser_2011 1 MayaBeiser_2011 513.62 522.49 <o,f0,female> at one time from a single string instrument the power and coherency that comes from one person hearing perceiving and playing all the voices
MayaBeiser_2011 1 MayaBeiser_2011 522.49 526.17 <o,f0,female> makes a very different experience
MayaBeiser_2011 1 MayaBeiser_2011 535.06 542.48 <o,f0,female> the excitement from using multi tracking the way i did in the piece you will hear next comes from
MayaBeiser_2011 1 MayaBeiser_2011 542.74 552.03 <o,f0,female> the attempt to build and create a whole universe with many diverse layers all generated from a single source
MayaBeiser_2011 1 MayaBeiser_2011 552.22 557.75 <o,f0,female> my cello and my voice are layered to create this large sonic canvas
MayaBeiser_2011 1 MayaBeiser_2011 558.41 567.7 <o,f0,female> when composers write music for me i ask them to forget what they know about the cello i hope to arrive at new territories to discover sounds i have never heard before
MayaBeiser_2011 1 MayaBeiser_2011 568.14 577.98 <o,f0,female> i want to create endless possibilities with this cello i become the medium through which the music is being channeled and in the process when all is right
MayaBeiser_2011 1 MayaBeiser_2011 578.24 583 <o,f0,female> the music is transformed and so am i
