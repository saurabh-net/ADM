TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 18.81 37.14 <o,f0,male> and as it advances many of us assume that these advances make us more intelligent make us smarter and more connected to the world and what i 'd like to argue is that that 's not necessarily the case as progress is simply a word for change and with change you gain something but you also lose something
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 37.14 42.82 <o,f0,male> and to really illustrate this point what i 'd like to do is to show you how technology has dealt with
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 42.82 48.6 <o,f0,male> a very simple a very common an everyday question and that question is this
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 64.82 67.85 <o,f0,male> the way you would do it is by using a device
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 67.9 69.99 <o,f0,male> that 's called an astrolabe
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 70.4 86.42 <o,f0,male> so an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today 's world but at the time in the thirteenth century it was the gadget of the day it was the world 's first popular computer and it was a device that in fact is a model of the sky
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 86.61 98.68 <o,f0,male> so the different parts of the astrolabe in this particular type the rete corresponds to the positions of the stars the plate corresponds to a coordinate system and the mater has some scales and puts it all together
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 98.68 107.65 <o,f0,male> if you were an educated child you would know how to not only use the astrolabe you would also know how to make an astrolabe and we know this because
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 119.6 133.03 <o,f0,male> and in this book little lewis would know the big idea and the central idea that makes this computer work is this thing called stereographic projection and basically the concept is how do you
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 133.03 140.71 <o,f0,male> represent the three dimensional image of the night sky that surrounds us onto a flat portable two dimensional surface
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 140.71 148.64 <o,f0,male> the idea is actually relatively simple imagine that that earth is at the center of the universe and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 148.64 164.31 <o,f0,male> each point on the surface of the sphere is mapped through the bottom pole onto a flat surface where it is then recorded so the north star corresponds to the center of the device the ecliptic which is the path of the sun moon and planets correspond to an offset circle
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 164.31 168.23 <o,f0,male> the bright stars correspond to little daggers on the rete
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 168.23 174.89 <o,f0,male> and the altitude corresponds to the plate system now the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 174.89 189.16 <o,f0,male> the real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems so they fit perfectly there is the position of the sun moon and planets on the movable rete and then there is their location on the sky as seen from a certain latitude on the back plate
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 189.65 194.27 <o,f0,male> okay so how would you use this device
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 204.74 213.01 <o,f0,male> pretty impressive isn 't it and so this astrolabe is on loan from us from the oxford school of museum of history and
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 213.2 217.59 <o,f0,male> you can see the different components this is the mater the scales on the back
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 217.59 230.15 <o,f0,male> this is the rete okay do you see that that 's the movable part of the sky and in the back you can see a spider web pattern and that spider web pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 230.15 240.11 <o,f0,male> this is a rule device and on the back are some other devices measuring tools and scales to be able to make some calculations
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 256.54 272.98 <o,f0,male> but a real one would cost about as much as my house and the house next to it and actually every house on the block on both sides of the street maybe a school thrown in and some you know a church they are just incredibly expensive but let me show you how to work this device so let 's go to step one
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 273.27 291.29 <o,f0,male> first thing that you do is you select a star in the night sky if you 're telling time at night so tonight if it 's clear you 'll be able to see the summer triangle and there is a bright star called deneb so let 's select deneb second is you measure the altitude of deneb so step two i hold the device up and then i sight
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 292.09 295.7 <o,f0,male> its altitude there so i can see it clearly now
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 295.7 305.32 <o,f0,male> and then i measure its altitude so it 's about twenty six degrees you can 't see it from over there step three is identify the star on the front
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 305.32 320.26 <o,f0,male> of the device deneb is there i can tell step four is i then move the rete move the sky so the altitude of the star corresponds to the scale on the back okay so when that happens
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 320.26 334.41 <o,f0,male> everything lines up i have here a model of the sky that corresponds to the real sky okay so it is in a sense holding a model of the universe in my hands and then finally i take a rule
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 334.87 339.61 <o,f0,male> and move the rule to a date line which then tells me the time here
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 339.94 342.68 <o,f0,male> right so that 's how the device is used
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 361.86 365.77 <o,f0,male> the way little lewis would tell the time is by a picture of the sky
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 365.77 376.11 <o,f0,male> he would know where things would fit in the sky he would not only know what time it was he would also know where the sun would rise and how it would move across the sky
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 376.11 387.41 <o,f0,male> he would know what time the sun would rise and what time it would set and he would know that for essentially every celestial object in the heavens so in computer graphics and computer
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 387.41 392.27 <o,f0,male> user interface design there is a term called affordances
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 392.27 409.17 <o,f0,male> so affordances are the qualities of an object that allow us to perform an action with it and what the astrolabe does is it allows us it affords us to connect to the night sky to look up into the night sky and be much more to see the visible and the invisible together
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 409.32 411.78 <o,f0,male> so that 's just one use
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 431.54 434.74 <o,f0,male> and it would take a full university course to illustrate it
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 434.74 449.83 <o,f0,male> astrolabes have an incredible history they are over two thousand years old the concept of stereographic projection originated in three hundred and thirty b c and the astrolabes come in many different sizes and shapes and forms there is portable ones there is large display ones
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 449.83 459.99 <o,f0,male> and i think what is common to all astrolabes is that they are beautiful works of art there is a quality of craftsmanship and precision that is just astonishing and remarkable
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 459.99 470.39 <o,f0,male> astrolabes like every technology do evolve over time so the earliest retes for example were very simple and primitive and advancing retes became cultural emblems this is
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 470.39 484.88 <o,f0,male> one from oxford and i find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern is completely symmetrical and it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical or random sky how cool is that this is just amazing so would little lewis have an astrolabe
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 484.88 496.28 <o,f0,male> probably not one made of brass he would have one made out of wood or paper and the vast majority of this first computer was a portable device that you could keep in the back of your pocket
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 496.35 510.25 <o,f0,male> so what does the astrolabe inspire well i think the first thing is that it reminds us just how resourceful people were our forebears were years and years ago it 's just an incredible device
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 510.25 526.92 <o,f0,male> every technology advances every technology is transformed and moved by others and what we gain with a new technology of course is precision and accuracy but what we lose i think is an accurate a felt sense of the sky a sense of context
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 526.92 533.63 <o,f0,male> knowing the sky knowing your relationship with the sky is the center
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 533.63 537.45 <o,f0,male> of the real answer to knowing what time it is
