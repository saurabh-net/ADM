TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 17.41 27.80 <o,f0,male> new york city between harlem and the bronx growing up as a boy we were taught that men had to be tough had to be strong had to be courageous dominating no
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 28.08 31.07 <o,f0,male> pain no emotions with the exception of
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 31.77 36.63 <o,f0,male> anger and definitely no fear that men are in charge which means women are not
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 39.26 47.17 <o,f0,male> and you should just follow and do what we say that men are superior women are inferior that men are strong women
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 49.19 49.90 <o,f0,male> that women
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 53.37 59.08 <o,f0,male> men and objects particularly sexual objects
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 59.53 63.54 <o,f0,male> later come to know that to be the collective socialization of men
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 66.52 67.85 <o,f0,male> the man box
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 81.01 83.71 <o,f0,male> being a man but at the same time
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 89.61 98.58 <o,f0,male> really need to begin to challenge look at it and really get in the process of deconstructing redefining what we come to know
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 117.07 124.36 <o,f0,male> when they were about five and six four and five jay could come to me come to me crying
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 124.63 132.96 <o,f0,male> it didn't matter what she was crying about she could get on my knee she could snot my sleeve up just cry cry it out daddy 's got you that's all that's important
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 134.13 137.90 <o,f0,male> kendall on the other hand and like i said he 's only fifteen months older than her
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 138.45 139.62 <o,f0,male> he came to me crying
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 148.55 152.26 <o,f0,male> by the time he got to me i was already saying things like why
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 157.34 166.69 <o,f0,male> tell me what's wrong i can't understand you why are you crying and out of my own frustration of my role and responsibility of building
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 197.99 200.86 <o,f0,male> wrong with me what am i doing why would i
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 212.07 218.42 <o,f0,male> my brother henry he died tragically when we were teenagers we lived in new york city as i said we lived in the bronx at the time
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 225.29 229.91 <o,f0,male> city and as we were preparing to come back from the
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 230.91 232.96 <o,f0,male> the cars stopped at the bathroom
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 240.88 242.68 <o,f0,male> my father and i stayed in
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 243.85 245.56 <o,f0,male> and no sooner than the women got out
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 251.13 251.40 <o,f0,male> me
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 252.15 255.25 <o,f0,male> but he knew he wasn't going to make it back to the city and it was better me
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 255.36 265.50 <o,f0,male> than to allow himself to express these feelings and emotions in front of the women and this is a man who ten minutes ago had just put his teenage son
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 268.01 270.17 <o,f0,male> something i just can't even imagine the
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 272.32 276.86 <o,f0,male> that sticks with me the most is that he was apologizing to me
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 278.45 279.30 <o,f0,male> in front of me
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 280.05 283.24 <o,f0,male> and at the same time he was also giving me props lifting me up
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 287.07 290.68 <o,f0,male> i come to also look at this as this fear that we
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 293.36 296.71 <o,f0,male> paralyzed holding us hostage to this man box
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 297.73 301.34 <o,f0,male> i can remember speaking to a twelve year old boy a football player
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 302.12 304.29 <o,f0,male> and i asked him i said how would you feel
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 305.74 309.27 <o,f0,male> all the players your coach told you you were playing like
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 311.18 314.44 <o,f0,male> say something like i'd be sad i'd be mad i'd be angry or something like
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 314.57 318.47 <o,f0,male> that no the boy said to me the boy said to me
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 318.95 320.64 <o,f0,male> it would destroy me
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 321.58 322.61 <o,f0,male> and i said to myself
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 324.95 328.24 <o,f0,male> if it would destroy him to be called a girl
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 329.21 331.51 <o,f0,male> what are we then teaching him
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 332.67 333.99 <o,f0,male> about girls
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 338.91 342.68 <o,f0,male> it took me back to a time when i was about twelve years old
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 344.02 350.02 <o,f0,male> in tenement buildings in the inner city at this time we're living in the bronx and in the building next to where i lived there was a
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 365.22 376.38 <o,f0,male> and he did spend a lot of time up to no good he was a troubled kid his mother had died from a heroin overdose he was being raised by his grandmother his father wasn't on the set his grandmother had two jobs
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 376.68 377.08 <o,f0,male> home
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 389.21 390.62 <o,f0,male> he was having sex
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 391.45 392.63 <o,f0,male> we all looked up to
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 393.13 401.68 <o,f0,male> so one day i'm out in front of the house doing something just playing around doing something i don't know what he looks out his window he calls me upstairs he said hey anthony they called my anthony growing up as a kid
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 403.86 406.02 <o,f0,male> johnny call you go so i run right
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 407.79 416.85 <o,f0,male> as he opens the door he says to me do you want some now i immediately knew what he meant because for me growing up at that time and our relationship with this man box do you
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 419.41 420.69 <o,f0,male> or drugs
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 420.98 422.00 <o,f0,male> and we weren't doing
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 427.40 428.15 <o,f0,male> in jeopardy
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 430.00 432.60 <o,f0,male> i never had sex we don't talk about that
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 433.01 440.67 <o,f0,male> as men you only tell your dearest closest friend sworn to secrecy for life the first time you had sex for everybody else we go around like we've been having sex
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 453.46 456.23 <o,f0,male> especially sexual objects anyway
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 456.92 464.01 <o,f0,male> i couldn't tell him any of that so like my mother would say make a long story short i just simply said to johnny yes he told me to go in his room i go in his room
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 465.17 468.74 <o,f0,male> is a girl from the neighborhood named sheila she's sixteen years old she's
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 470.75 478.51 <o,f0,male> what i know today to be mentally ill higher functioning at times than others we had a whole choice 's worth of inappropriate names
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 480.77 487.44 <o,f0,male> just gotten through having sex with her well actually he raped her but he would say he had sex with her because while sheila never said
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 488.15 496.42 <o,f0,male> no she also never said yes so he was offering me the opportunity to do the same so when i go in the room i close the door folks i'm petrified
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 497.24 510.68 <o,f0,male> i stand with my back to the door so johnny can't bust in the room and see that i'm not doing anything and i stand there long enough that i could have actually done something so now i'm no longer trying to figure out what i'm going to do i'm trying to figure out how i'm going to get out of this room so in my twelve years
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 512.12 518.05 <o,f0,male> i zip my pants down i walk out into the room and lo and behold to me while i was in
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 519.53 522.07 <o,f0,male> room with sheila johnny was back at the window calling guys
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 522.96 528.51 <o,f0,male> so now there's a living room full of guys it was like the waiting room in the doctor 's office and they asked me how was
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 529.72 531.25 <o,f0,male> and i say to them it was good
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 532.28 534.78 <o,f0,male> and i zip my pants up in front of them and i
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 536.35 546.78 <o,f0,male> now i say this all with remorse and i was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time but i was conflicted because while i was feeling remorse i was excited because i didn't get caught but i knew i felt bad about what was happening
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 547.55 556.53 <o,f0,male> this fear getting outside the man box totally enveloped me it was way more important to me about me and my man box
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 557.64 562.25 <o,f0,male> than about sheila and what was happening to her
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 562.38 571.12 <o,f0,male> see collectively we as men are taught to have less value in women to view them as property and the objects of men we see that as an equation that equals violence against women
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 572.23 574.07 <o,f0,male> we as men good men the
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 575.89 583.33 <o,f0,male> we operate on the foundation of this whole collective socialization we kind of see ourselves separate but we're very much a part of it you see
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 583.74 595.40 <o,f0,male> we have to come to understand that less value property and objectification is the foundation and the violence can't happen without it so we're very much a part of the solution as well as the problem
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 595.48 604.06 <o,f0,male> the center for disease control says that men 's violence against women is at epidemic proportions is the number one health concern for women in this country and abroad
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 604.68 606.34 <o,f0,male> so quickly i'd like to just say
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 607.68 609.21 <o,f0,male> this is the love of my life my
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 610.42 612.03 <o,f0,male> the world i envision for her
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 612.33 620.80 <o,f0,male> how do i want men to be acting and behaving i need you on board i need you with me i need you working with me and me working with you on how we raise our
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 621.70 627.99 <o,f0,male> teach them to be men that it's okay to not be dominating that it's okay to have feelings and emotions
TonyPorter_2010W 1 TonyPorter_2010W 639.09 640.90 <o,f0,male> is tied to your liberation as a
