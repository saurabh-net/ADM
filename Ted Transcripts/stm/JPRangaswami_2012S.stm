JPRangaswami_2012S 1 JPRangaswami_2012S 18.27 20.69 <o,f0,male> and i love information
JPRangaswami_2012S 1 JPRangaswami_2012S 22.34 27.28 <o,f0,male> my children usually tell me that one of those passions is a little more apparent than the other
JPRangaswami_2012S 1 JPRangaswami_2012S 38.26 51.81 <o,f0,male> the journey of learning that took place from that point and one idea i want to leave you with today is what would would happen differently in your life if you saw information the way you saw food
JPRangaswami_2012S 1 JPRangaswami_2012S 51.81 66.42 <o,f0,male> i was born in calcutta a family where my father and his father before him were journalists and they wrote magazines in the english language that was the family business and as a result of that
JPRangaswami_2012S 1 JPRangaswami_2012S 66.71 73.1 <o,f0,male> i grew up with books everywhere around the house and i mean books everywhere around the house
JPRangaswami_2012S 1 JPRangaswami_2012S 104.1 106.36 <o,f0,male> brought up in bengal
JPRangaswami_2012S 1 JPRangaswami_2012S 151.06 156.84 <o,f0,male> experimental robot which got electrocuted and found a life
JPRangaswami_2012S 1 JPRangaswami_2012S 187.41 198.15 <o,f0,male> i started doing some research then and this was the twenty five year journey and started finding out that actually human beings as primates have far smaller
JPRangaswami_2012S 1 JPRangaswami_2012S 198.24 210.37 <o,f0,male> stomachs than should be the size for our body weight and far larger brains and as i went to research that even further i got to a point
JPRangaswami_2012S 1 JPRangaswami_2012S 210.61 218.37 <o,f0,male> i discovered something called the expensive tissue hypothesis that actually for a given body mass of
JPRangaswami_2012S 1 JPRangaswami_2012S 233.6 253.54 <o,f0,male> and what transpired was that people had put forward a hypothesis that was apparently coming up with some fabulous results by about one thousand nine hundred and ninety five it 's a lady named leslie aiello and the paper then suggested that you traded one for the other if you wanted your brain for a particular body mass to be large
JPRangaswami_2012S 1 JPRangaswami_2012S 253.54 256.53 <o,f0,male> you had to live with a smaller gut
JPRangaswami_2012S 1 JPRangaswami_2012S 256.53 261.61 <o,f0,male> that then set me off completely to say okay these two are connected
JPRangaswami_2012S 1 JPRangaswami_2012S 261.67 273.63 <o,f0,male> so i looked at the cultivation of information as if it were food and said so we were hunter gathers of information we moved from that to becoming farmers and cultivators of information
JPRangaswami_2012S 1 JPRangaswami_2012S 273.63 278.06 <o,f0,male> does that really explain what we 're seeing with the intellectual property battles nowadays
JPRangaswami_2012S 1 JPRangaswami_2012S 293.88 296.71 <o,f0,male> so there was always going to be a tension within that
JPRangaswami_2012S 1 JPRangaswami_2012S 296.71 305.67 <o,f0,male> and everything i saw in the cultivation said there were huge fights amongst the foodies between the cultivators and the hunter gatherers and this is happening here
JPRangaswami_2012S 1 JPRangaswami_2012S 305.67 317.89 <o,f0,male> when i moved to preparation this same thing was true expect that there were two schools one group of people said you can distill your information you can extract value separate it and serve it up
JPRangaswami_2012S 1 JPRangaswami_2012S 317.89 325.87 <o,f0,male> while another group turned around and said no no you can ferment it you bring it all together and mash it up and the value emerges that way
JPRangaswami_2012S 1 JPRangaswami_2012S 325.87 328.49 <o,f0,male> the same is again true with information
JPRangaswami_2012S 1 JPRangaswami_2012S 328.49 348.21 <o,f0,male> but consumption was where it started getting really enjoyable because what i began to see then was there were so many different ways people would consume this they 'd buy it from the shop as raw ingredients do you cook it do you have it served to you do you go to a restaurant the same is true every time as i started thinking about information
JPRangaswami_2012S 1 JPRangaswami_2012S 348.21 354.53 <o,f0,male> the analogies were getting crazy that information had sell by dates that people had
JPRangaswami_2012S 1 JPRangaswami_2012S 354.62 367.68 <o,f0,male> misused information that wasn 't dated properly and could really make an effect on the stock market on corporate values etc and by this time i was hooked and this is about twenty three years into this process
JPRangaswami_2012S 1 JPRangaswami_2012S 392.02 401.18 <o,f0,male> which brings me to the final element of this clay shirky once stated that there is no such animal as information overload there is only filter failure
JPRangaswami_2012S 1 JPRangaswami_2012S 401.18 412.44 <o,f0,male> i put it to you that information if viewed from the point of food is never a production issue you never speak of food overload fundamentally it 's a consumption issue
JPRangaswami_2012S 1 JPRangaswami_2012S 412.44 416.52 <o,f0,male> and we have to start thinking about how we create
JPRangaswami_2012S 1 JPRangaswami_2012S 416.52 435.87 <o,f0,male> diets within ourselves exercise within ourselves to have the faculties to be able to deal with information to have the labeling to be able to do it responsibly in fact when i saw supersize me i starting thinking of saying what would happen if an individual had thirty one days nonstop fox news
JPRangaswami_2012S 1 JPRangaswami_2012S 444.76 449.25 <o,f0,male> diseases toxins a need to balance your diet
