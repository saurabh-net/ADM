AlanSiegel_2010 1 AlanSiegel_2010 30.84 39.17 <o,f0,male> which has a dramatically negative impact on our life if you're a veteran coming back from iraq or vietnam you
AlanSiegel_2010 1 AlanSiegel_2010 39.32 53.40 <o,f0,male> face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits if you're trying to get a small business loan you face a blizzard of paperwork what are we going to do about it i define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity transparency and empathy
AlanSiegel_2010 1 AlanSiegel_2010 54.01 64.61 <o,f0,male> building humanity into communications i've been simplifying things for thirty years i come out of the advertising and design business my focus is understanding
AlanSiegel_2010 1 AlanSiegel_2010 65.26 73.58 <o,f0,male> you people and how you interact with the government to get your benefits how you interact with corporations to decide whom you're going to do business with
AlanSiegel_2010 1 AlanSiegel_2010 74.21 80.32 <o,f0,male> and how you view brands so very quickly when president obama said
AlanSiegel_2010 1 AlanSiegel_2010 80.83 90.19 <o,f0,male> i don't see why we can't have a one page plain english consumer credit agreement so i locked myself in a room figured out the content
AlanSiegel_2010 1 AlanSiegel_2010 101.51 108.72 <o,f0,male> i went one step further and said why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers and just have a paper document let 's go online
AlanSiegel_2010 1 AlanSiegel_2010 110.79 118.57 <o,f0,male> people might need help in computation working with the harvard business school you'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment
AlanSiegel_2010 1 AlanSiegel_2010 119.03 133.50 <o,f0,male> if you spent sixty two dollars for a meal the longer you take to pay out that loan you see over a period of time using the minimum payment it's ninety nine dollars and seventeen cents how about that do you think your bank is going to show that to people
AlanSiegel_2010 1 AlanSiegel_2010 133.90 141.76 <o,f0,male> but it's going to work it's more effective than just computational aids and what about terms like over the limit
AlanSiegel_2010 1 AlanSiegel_2010 142.41 148.06 <o,f0,male> perhaps a stealth thing define it in context tell people what it means when you put it in plain english
AlanSiegel_2010 1 AlanSiegel_2010 157.60 163.77 <o,f0,male> changing the content and one of the things i'm most proud of is this agreement for ibm it's a grid it's
AlanSiegel_2010 1 AlanSiegel_2010 164.80 173.03 <o,f0,male> at such and such a date ibm has responsibilities you have responsibilities received very favorably by business
AlanSiegel_2010 1 AlanSiegel_2010 182.52 189.24 <o,f0,male> running through this typical letter that they had i ran it through my simplicity lab it's pretty unintelligible all the
AlanSiegel_2010 1 AlanSiegel_2010 190.26 200.17 <o,f0,male> the document in red are not intelligible we looked at doing over one thousand letters that cover seventy percent of irs transactions in plain english they have been tested in the laboratory
AlanSiegel_2010 1 AlanSiegel_2010 200.50 208.35 <o,f0,male> when i run it through my lab this heat mapping shows everything that is intelligible and the irs has introduced the program
AlanSiegel_2010 1 AlanSiegel_2010 213.85 226.32 <o,f0,male> are a couple of things going on right now that i want to bring to your attention there is a lot of discussion now about a consumer financial protection agency and how to mandate simplicity we see all this complexity
AlanSiegel_2010 1 AlanSiegel_2010 236.57 245.40 <o,f0,male> no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate there is no way we should do business with companies that
AlanSiegel_2010 1 AlanSiegel_2010 247.75 255.01 <o,f0,male> so how are we going to change the world make clarity transparency and simplicity a national priority
