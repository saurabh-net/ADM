ArthurBenjamin_2009 1 ArthurBenjamin_2009 20.49 24.92 <o,f0,female> i would have a suggestion for him that i think would vastly improve the
ArthurBenjamin_2009 1 ArthurBenjamin_2009 36.60 44.28 <o,f0,female> and algebra and everything we learn after that is building up towards one subject and at top of that pyramid
ArthurBenjamin_2009 1 ArthurBenjamin_2009 44.71 51.72 <o,f0,female> it's calculus and i'm here to say that i think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid
ArthurBenjamin_2009 1 ArthurBenjamin_2009 52.17 61.46 <o,f0,female> the correct summit that all of our students every high school graduate should know should be statistics probability and statistics
ArthurBenjamin_2009 1 ArthurBenjamin_2009 64.28 73.05 <o,f0,female> don't get me wrong calculus is an important subject it's one of the great products of the human mind the laws of nature are written in the language of calculus
ArthurBenjamin_2009 1 ArthurBenjamin_2009 73.38 81.11 <o,f0,female> and every student who studies math science engineering economics they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college
ArthurBenjamin_2009 1 ArthurBenjamin_2009 81.43 88.56 <o,f0,female> but i'm here to say as a professor of mathematics that very few people actually use calculus in a
ArthurBenjamin_2009 1 ArthurBenjamin_2009 96.44 103.71 <o,f0,female> and should use on daily basis right it's risk it's reward it's randomness it's understanding data
ArthurBenjamin_2009 1 ArthurBenjamin_2009 117.28 117.83 <o,f0,female> if it's
ArthurBenjamin_2009 1 ArthurBenjamin_2009 119.11 130.00 <o,f0,female> it can be a lot of fun i mean probability and statistics it's the mathematics of games and gambling it's analyzing trends it's predicting the future
ArthurBenjamin_2009 1 ArthurBenjamin_2009 130.60 143.85 <o,f0,female> look the world has changed from analog to digital and it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change from analog to digital from the more classical continuous
ArthurBenjamin_2009 1 ArthurBenjamin_2009 144.68 154.35 <o,f0,female> to the more modern discrete mathematics the mathematics of uncertainty of randomness of data and that being probability and statistics
ArthurBenjamin_2009 1 ArthurBenjamin_2009 154.65 169.19 <o,f0,female> in summary instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus i think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean means and i mean it thank you very much
