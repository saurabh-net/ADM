AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 16.06 18.24 <o,f0,female> always wanted to become
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 18.34 29.02 <o,f0,female> a walking laboratory of social engagement to resonate other people 's feelings thoughts intentions motivations in the act of being with them
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 29.02 46.38 <o,f0,female> as a scientist i always wanted to measure that resonance that sense of the other that happens so quickly in the blink of an eye we intuit other people 's feelings we know the meaning of their actions even before they happen
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 46.38 60.13 <o,f0,female> we 're always in this stance of being the object of somebody else 's subjectivity we do that all the time we just can 't shake it off it 's so important that the very tools that we use to understand ourselves to understand the world around
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 82.16 85.16 <o,f0,female> autism was devastating they had
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 90.58 96.13 <o,f0,female> they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 115.36 123.51 <o,f0,female> so they may be looking at a light in the ceiling or they may be isolated in the corner
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 123.94 130.15 <o,f0,female> or they might be engaged in these repetitive movements in self stimulatory movements that
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 151.32 169.02 <o,f0,female> of thousands of years of evolution you see babies are born in a state of utter fragility without the caregiver they wouldn 't survive so it stands to reason that nature would endow them with these mechanisms of survival they orient to the caregiver
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 169.56 172.52 <o,f0,female> from the first days and weeks of life
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 172.99 177.01 <o,f0,female> babies prefer to hear human sounds rather than just sounds in the
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 194.32 196.44 <o,f0,female> well
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 207.97 211.31 <o,f0,female> the social mind the social brain
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 213.72 218.32 <o,f0,female> think about autism as something that
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 225.9 231.16 <o,f0,female> as babies engage with caregivers they soon realize that
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 248.69 259.34 <o,f0,female> in order to get things they want they also learn to follow other people 's gaze because whatever people are looking at is what they are thinking about
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 261.78 265.94 <o,f0,female> and soon enough they start to learn about the meaning of things
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 280.09 286.72 <o,f0,female> this body of meanings but meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 286.72 291.37 <o,f0,female> those are meanings that are acquired as part of their shared experiences with
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 294.54 297.33 <o,f0,female> this is a little
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 297.68 300.73 <o,f0,female> fifteen month old little girl
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 300.75 304.2 <o,f0,female> and she has autism and
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 309.19 325.96 <o,f0,female> and she 's quite oblivious to me imagine if i did that to you and i came two inches from your face you 'd do probably two things wouldn 't you you would recoil you would call the police laughter you would do something because it 's literally impossible to penetrate somebody 's physical space
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 325.96 336.87 <o,f0,female> and not get a reaction we do so remember intuitively effortlessly this is our body wisdom it 's not something that is mediated by our language our body just knows that
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 339.76 342.53 <o,f0,female> and we 've known that for a long time and this is not something that happens to humans only
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 349.9 357.29 <o,f0,female> and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you and that is considered to be a signal
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 360.29 364.28 <o,f0,female> so something that in other species are survival
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 364.28 383.15 <o,f0,female> mechanisms without them they wouldn 't basically live we bring into the context of human beings and this is what we need to simply act act socially now she is oblivious to me and i am so close to her and you think maybe she can see you maybe she can hear you well a few minutes later
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 383.18 388.69 <o,f0,female> she goes to the corner of the room and she finds a tiny little piece of candy an m
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 451.12 458.42 <o,f0,female> autism is the most strongly genetic condition of all developmental disorders
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 458.42 476.42 <o,f0,female> and it 's a brain disorder it 's a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born we now know that there is a very broad spectrum of autism there are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled but there are those that are gifted
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 476.42 484.61 <o,f0,female> there are those individuals who don 't talk at all there are those individuals who talk too much there are those individuals that if you observe them in their school
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 485.1 501.56 <o,f0,female> you see them running the periphery fence of the school all day if you let them to those individuals who cannot stop coming to you and trying to engage you repeatedly relentlessly but often in an awkward fashion without that immediate resonance well
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 501.6 504.31 <o,f0,female> this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 520.27 534.08 <o,f0,female> the societal cost of this condition is huge in the u s alone maybe thirty five to eighty billion dollars and you know what most of those funds are associated with adolescents and particularly adults who are severely disabled
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 534.29 538.62 <o,f0,female> individuals who need wrap around services services that are very very intensive
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 538.72 543.11 <o,f0,female> and those services can cost in excess of sixty to eighty thousand dollars a year
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 543.56 548.83 <o,f0,female> those are individuals who did not benefit from early treatment because now we know
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 586.32 589.71 <o,f0,female> but it diminishes considerably
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 589.71 594.87 <o,f0,female> and yet the median age of diagnosis in this country is still about five years
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 594.87 614.64 <o,f0,female> and in disadvantaged populations the populations that don 't have access to clinical services rural populations minorities the age of diagnosis is later still which is almost as if i were to tell you that we are condemning those communities to have individuals with autism whose condition is going to be more severe
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 618.17 624.06 <o,f0,female> the science is there but no science is of relevance if it doesn 't
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 643.13 648.95 <o,f0,female> for the family and for the community at large so this is our view of autism
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 649.24 662.2 <o,f0,female> there are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism in fact we believe that there are going to be something between three hundred and six hundred genes associated with autism and genetic anomalies much more than just genes
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 662.2 669.7 <o,f0,female> and we actually have a bit of a question here because if there are so many different causes of autism
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 670.09 676.07 <o,f0,female> how do you go from those liabilities to the actual syndrome because people like myself
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 676.47 693.49 <o,f0,female> when we walk into a playroom we recognize a child as having autism so how do you go from multiple causes to a syndrome that has some homogeneity and the answer is what lies in between which is development and in fact
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 693.64 696.98 <o,f0,female> we are very interested in those first two years of
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 738.11 747.81 <o,f0,female> it 's hard to do that so we had to create the technologies we had to basically step inside a body we had to see the world through her eyes
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 747.81 760 <o,f0,female> and so in the past many years we 've been building these new technologies that are based on eye tracking we can see moment by moment what children are engaging with
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 760 769.13 <o,f0,female> well this is my colleague warren jones with whom we 've been building these methods these studies for the past twelve years and you see there
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 786.74 792.52 <o,f0,female> what we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory but in order for us to do that
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 792.85 808.92 <o,f0,female> we had to create these very sophisticated measures measures of how people how little babies how newborns engage with the world moment by moment what is important and what is not well
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 809.16 816.67 <o,f0,female> we created those measures and here what you see is what we call a funnel of attention you 're watching a video
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 816.77 824.32 <o,f0,female> those frames are separated by about a second through the eyes of thirty five typically developing two year olds
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 850.27 854.81 <o,f0,female> door opening and shutting
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 866.95 869.85 <o,f0,female> and their brains are being specialized in something
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 874.63 876.79 <o,f0,female> we took a construct
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 913.02 922.21 <o,f0,female> they start over here they love people 's eyes and it remains quite stable it sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 922.21 926.52 <o,f0,female> now let 's see what 's happening with babies who became autistic
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 926.52 940.22 <o,f0,female> it 's something very different it starts way up here but then it 's a free fall it 's very much like they brought into this world the reflex that orients them to people but it has no traction
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 965.86 971 <o,f0,female> by how social those babies are and what we see in the first six months of life
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 971.19 990.65 <o,f0,female> is that those two groups can be segregated very easily and using these kinds of measures and many others what we found out is that our science could in fact identify this condition early on we didn 't have to wait for the behaviors of autism to emerge
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 1048.32 1051.1 <o,f0,female> if we also did not
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 1051.57 1056.85 <o,f0,female> an infrastructure for intervention for treatment we need to be able
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 1057.24 1062.44 <o,f0,female> to work with the families to support the families to manage those first years with them
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 1062.64 1076.91 <o,f0,female> we need to be able to really go from universal screening to universal access to treatment because those treatments are going to change these children 's and those families lives
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 1089.09 1097.72 <o,f0,female> one feels really rejuvenated there is a sense that the science that one worked on can actually have
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 1100.73 1103.49 <o,f0,female> those experiences that
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 1103.81 1110.98 <o,f0,female> really started in my journey in this field i thought at the time that this was an intractable condition no longer
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 1111 1120.86 <o,f0,female> we can do a great deal of things and the idea is not to cure autism that 's not the idea what we want is to make sure
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 1141.48 1145.13 <o,f0,female> and they can work extremely well in some areas of strength
AmiKlin_2011X 1 AmiKlin_2011X 1157.72 1162.88 <o,f0,female> if you 're working for example in technology and there are those individuals who have
