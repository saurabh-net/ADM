HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 13.69 14.06 <o,f0,female> here
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 15.94 21.95 <o,f0,male> to enlist you in helping reshape the story
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 22.56 30.83 <o,f0,male> about how humans and other critters get things done here is the old story we have already heard a little bit about it
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 36.00 39.82 <o,f0,male> in which only the fiercest survive
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 40.85 47.22 <o,f0,male> businesses and nations succeed only by defeating
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 55.45 57.33 <o,f0,male> is about your side winning
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 58.25 70.18 <o,f0,male> at all costs but i think we can see the very beginnings of a new story beginning to emerge it's a narrative
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 70.72 72.17 <o,f0,male> spread across
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 72.72 77.57 <o,f0,male> a number of different disciplines in which
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 80.13 87.65 <o,f0,male> and complex interdependencies play a more important role and the
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 111.71 114.88 <o,f0,male> that when i finished the book i kept thinking about it
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 115.96 118.75 <o,f0,male> in fact if you look back
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 120.78 129.13 <o,f0,male> human communication media and the ways in which we organize socially have been co evolving for quite a long time
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 129.95 141.78 <o,f0,male> humans have lived for much much longer than the approximately ten thousand years of settled agricultural civilization in small
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 142.28 152.53 <o,f0,male> family groups nomadic hunters bring down rabbits gathering food the form of wealth in those days was enough food to stay alive
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 153.46 158.92 <o,f0,male> but at some point they banded together to hunt bigger game
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 160.22 164.61 <o,f0,male> and we don't know exactly how they did this although
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 164.84 174.90 <o,f0,male> they must have solved some collective action problems it only makes sense that you can't hunt mastodons while you're fighting with the other groups
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 175.38 185.25 <o,f0,male> and again we have no way of knowing but it's clear that a new form of wealth must have emerged more protein than a hunter 's family
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 185.49 194.35 <o,f0,male> could eat before it rotted so that raised a social question that i believe must have driven new social forms did the people who
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 194.91 204.57 <o,f0,male> that mastodon meat owe something to the hunters and their families and if so how did they make arrangements again we can't know but
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 205.48 218.30 <o,f0,male> we can be pretty sure that some form of symbolic communication must have been involved of course with agriculture came the first big civilizations the first cities built of mud
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 218.66 228.48 <o,f0,male> and brick the first empires and it was the administers of these empires who begin hiring people to keep track of the wheat
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 228.82 237.04 <o,f0,male> and sheep and wine that was owed and the taxes that was owed on them by making marks marks on clay at that time
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 237.93 251.30 <o,f0,male> not too much longer after that the alphabet was invented and this powerful tool was really reserved for thousands of years for the elite administrators
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 252.61 253.76 <o,f0,female> who kept track
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 255.82 258.21 <o,f0,male> of accounts for the empires
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 258.51 270.01 <o,f0,male> and then another communication technology enabled new media the printing press came along and within decades millions of people became
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 272.11 278.92 <o,f0,male> literate populations new forms of collective action emerged in the spheres of knowledge
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 281.11 289.11 <o,f0,male> and politics we saw scientific revolutions the protestant reformation constitutional democracies
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 289.70 299.60 <o,f0,male> possible where they had not been possible before not created by the printing press but enabled by the collective action that emerges from literacy
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 300.27 308.94 <o,f0,male> and again new forms of wealth emerged now commerce is ancient markets are as old as the crossroads
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 309.24 316.65 <o,f0,male> but capitalism as we know it is only a few hundred years old enabled by cooperative arrangements
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 316.91 324.92 <o,f0,male> and technologies such as the joint stock ownership company shared liability insurance double entry book keeping
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 326.32 329.27 <o,f0,male> now of course the enabling technologies
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 329.92 343.57 <o,f0,male> are based on the internet and in the many to many era every desktop is now a printing press a broadcasting station a community or a marketplace
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 345.02 353.38 <o,f0,male> evolution is speeding up more recently that power is untethering and leaping off the desktops
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 353.67 363.87 <o,f0,male> and very very quickly we are going to see a significant proportion if not the majority human race walking around holding
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 364.78 374.24 <o,f0,male> carrying or wearing supercomputers linked at speeds greater than what we consider to be broadband today
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 374.58 383.63 <o,f0,male> now when i started looking into collective action the considerable literature on it is based on what sociologists call social dilemmas
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 383.89 392.19 <o,f0,male> there are a couple of mythic narratives of social dilemmas i'm going to talk about two of them the prisoner 's dilemma and the tragedy of the commons
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 392.68 400.45 <o,f0,male> now when i talked about this with kevin kelly he assured me that everybody in this audience pretty much knows the details of the prisoner 's dilemma
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 400.77 407.63 <o,f0,male> so i'm just going to go over that very very quickly if you have more questions about it ask kevin kelly later
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 410.53 419.80 <o,f0,male> the prisoner 's dilemma is actually a story that's overlaid on a mathematical matrix that came out of the game theory in the early years of thinking about
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 420.27 429.16 <o,f0,male> nuclear war two players who couldn't trust each other let me just say that every unsecured transaction is a good example of the prisoner 's dilemma
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 429.70 438.87 <o,f0,male> person with the goods person with the money because they can't trust each other are not going to exchange neither one wants to be the first one
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 439.80 446.75 <o,f0,male> or they're going to get the sucker 's payoff but both lose of course because they don't get what they want if they could only
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 447.13 454.95 <o,f0,male> agree if they could only turn a prisoner 's dilemma into a different payoff matrix called an assurance game they could proceed
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 464.11 471.59 <o,f0,male> if we are here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors how does cooperation exist at all he
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 482.89 490.78 <o,f0,male> the first tournament and even after everyone knew it won it won the second tournament that's known as tit for tat
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 493.65 496.90 <o,f0,female> another economic game that may not be
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 497.06 510.29 <o,f0,male> as well known as the prisoner 's dilemma is the ultimatum game and it's also a very interesting probe of our assumptions about the way people make economic transactions here 's how the game is played
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 510.84 524.97 <o,f0,male> there are two players they've never played the game before they will not play the game again they don't know each other and they are in fact in separate rooms first player is offered a hundred dollars and is asked to propose a split
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 525.94 534.72 <o,f0,male> fifty fifty ninety ten whatever that player wants to propose the second player either accepts the
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 535.47 543.97 <o,f0,male> both players are paid and the game is over or rejects the split neither player is paid and the game is over
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 544.32 556.67 <o,f0,male> now the fundamental basis of neoclassical economics would tell you it's irrational to reject a dollar because someone you don't know in another room is going to get ninety
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 557.32 570.89 <o,f0,male> yet in thousands of trials with american and european and japanese students a significant percentage would reject any offer that's not close to fifty fifty and although
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 571.20 584.95 <o,f0,male> they were screened and didn't know about the game and had never played the game before proposers seemed to innately know this because the average proposal was surprisingly close to fifty fifty
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 585.27 598.20 <o,f0,male> now the interesting part comes in more recently when anthropologists began taking this game to other cultures and discovered to their surprise that slash and burn agriculturalists in the amazon
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 598.96 610.27 <o,f0,male> or nomadic pasturalists in central asia or a dozen different cultures each had radically different ideas of what is fair which suggests that
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 620.38 621.92 <o,f0,male> can be influenced by
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 622.36 630.53 <o,f0,male> our social institutions whether we know that or not the other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 631.05 642.26 <o,f0,male> garrett hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late nineteen sixties he used the example of a common grazing area in which each person
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 642.80 651.14 <o,f0,male> by simply maximizing their own flock led to overgrazing and the depletion of the resource he had the rather gloomy conclusion that humans will
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 670.91 680.63 <o,f0,male> it really true that humans will always despoil commons so she went out and looked at what data she could find she looked at thousands of cases
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 680.84 693.65 <o,f0,male> of humans sharing watersheds forestry resources fisheries and discovered that yes in case after case humans destroyed the commons that they depended on
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 693.89 702.97 <o,f0,male> but she also found many instances in which people escaped the prisoner 's dilemma in fact the tragedy of the commons
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 703.31 711.10 <o,f0,male> is a multi player prisoner 's dilemma and she said that people are only prisoners if they consider themselves to be
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 711.59 722.33 <o,f0,male> they escape by creating institutions for collective action and she discovered i think most interestingly that among those institutions that worked
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 722.67 730.79 <o,f0,male> there were a number of common design principles and those principles seem to be missing from those institutions that don't work
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 743.01 750.32 <o,f0,male> is really no longer any major debate over the fact that cooperative arrangements have moved from
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 751.89 758.56 <o,f0,male> to a central role in biology from the level of the cell to the level of the ecology
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 759.09 772.98 <o,f0,male> and again our notions of individuals as economic beings have been overturned rational self interest is not always the dominating factor in fact people
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 773.73 787.15 <o,f0,male> will act to punish cheaters even at a cost to themselves and most recently neurophysiological measures have shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 798.72 801.50 <o,f0,male> the glue that holds societies together
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 802.57 810.96 <o,f0,male> now i've been talking about how new forms of communication and new media in the past have helped create new economic forms
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 811.47 825.57 <o,f0,male> commerce is ancient markets are very old capitalism is fairly recent socialism emerged as a reaction to that and yet we see very little talk about how the next form may be emerging
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 825.97 835.62 <o,f0,male> jim surowiecki briefly mentioned yochai benkler 's paper about open source pointing to a new form of production peer to peer production
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 835.95 844.97 <o,f0,male> i simply want you to keep in mind that if in the past new forms of cooperation enabled by new technologies create new forms of wealth
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 845.32 852.75 <o,f0,male> we may be moving into yet another economic form that is significantly different from previous ones
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 853.42 860.79 <o,f0,male> very briefly let 's look at some businesses ibm as you know hp sun some of them most
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 861.54 871.61 <o,f0,male> fierce competitors in the it world are open sourcing their software are providing portfolios of patents for the commons
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 872.41 884.34 <o,f0,male> eli lilly in again the fiercely competitive pharmaceutical world has created a market for solutions for pharmaceutical problems toyota
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 897.58 908.38 <o,f0,male> now none of these companies are doing this out of altruism they're doing it because they're learning that a certain kind of sharing is in their self interest
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 909.22 917.72 <o,f0,male> open sourced production has shown us that world class software like linux and mozilla can be created
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 918.01 926.50 <o,f0,male> with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firm nor the incentives of the marketplace as we've know them
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 927.93 929.74 <o,f0,male> google enriches itself
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 930.45 940.43 <o,f0,male> by enriching thousands of bloggers through adsense amazon has opened its applications programming interface to sixty thousand developers
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 941.16 949.50 <o,f0,male> countless amazon shops they're enriching others not out of altruism but as a way of enriching themselves
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 950.61 960.42 <o,f0,male> solved the prisoner 's dilemma and created a market where none would have existed by creating a feedback mechanism that turns a prisoner 's dilemma
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 961.24 975.19 <o,f0,male> into an assurance game instead of neither of us can trust each other so we have to make suboptimal moves it 's you prove to me that you are trustworthy and i will cooperate wikipedia
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 981.03 990.63 <o,f0,male> a million and a half articles in two hundred languages in just a couple of years we have seen that thinkcycle has enabled
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 992.39 999.85 <o,f0,male> in developing countries to put up problems to be solved by design students around the world
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 1011.24 1019.28 <o,f0,male> bittorrent turns every downloader into an uploader making the system more efficient the more it is used
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 1020.09 1030.27 <o,f0,male> millions of people have contributed their desktop computers when they are not using them to link together through the internet into supercomputing collectives
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 1030.69 1041.00 <o,f0,male> that help solve the protein folding problem for medical researchers that's folding at home at stanford to crack codes to search for life in outer space
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 1042.63 1056.07 <o,f0,male> i don't think we know enough yet i don't think we've even begun to discover what the basic principles are but i think we can begin to think about them and i don't have enough time to talk about all of them but think about self interest
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 1056.52 1062.26 <o,f0,male> this is all about self interest that adds up to more in el salvador both sides
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 1062.42 1072.17 <o,f0,male> that withdrew from their civil war took moves that had been proven to mirror a prisoner 's dilemma strategy in the us in the philippines in kenya
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 1072.83 1082.69 <o,f0,male> around the world citizens have self organized political protests and get out the vote campaigns using mobile devices and sms
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 1083.25 1091.07 <o,f0,male> is an apollo project of cooperation possible a transdisciplinary study of cooperation i believe
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 1092.03 1100.46 <o,f0,male> that the pay off would be very big i think we need to begin developing maps of this territory so that we can talk about it across disciplines
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 1100.84 1107.80 <o,f0,male> and i am not saying that understanding cooperation is going to cause us to be better people
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 1108.31 1116.44 <o,f0,male> and sometimes people cooperate to do bad things but i will remind you that a few hundred years ago people saw their loved ones die
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 1116.69 1122.99 <o,f0,male> from diseases they thought were caused by sin or foreigners or evil spirits
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 1136.89 1145.44 <o,f0,male> what forms of suffering could be alleviated what forms of wealth could be created if we knew a little bit more about cooperation
HowardRheingold_2005 1 HowardRheingold_2005 1145.89 1155.64 <o,f0,male> i don't think that this transdisciplinary discourse is automatically going to happen it's going to require effort so i enlist you
