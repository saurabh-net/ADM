StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 17.17 25.01 <o,f0,male> go browsing a very old magazine i found this observation test about the story
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 26.83 35.85 <o,f0,male> the artist that drew this observation test did some errors had some mistakes there are more or less twelve mistakes some of them are very easy
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 38.92 43.31 <o,f0,male> lamp and clockwork key on the ark some of them are about the animals the number
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 52.28 57.60 <o,f0,male> and this problem is where are the plants so now we have god that is going to
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 60.48 64.63 <o,f0,male> or at least for a very long period and no one is taking care of plants
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 66.02 75.72 <o,f0,male> to take two of every kind of bird of every kind of animal of every kind of creature that moves but no mention about plants why
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 76.42 86.07 <o,f0,male> in another part of the same story all the living creatures are just the living creatures that came out from the ark so birds livestock and
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 102.53 115.19 <o,f0,male> nice code that is coming from a renaissance book here we have the description of the order of nature it's a nice description because it's starting from left you have the stones
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 115.94 122.79 <o,f0,male> immediately after the stones the plants that are just able to live we have the animals that are able to live and to
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 123.82 138.35 <o,f0,male> and on the top of the pyramid there is the man this is not the common man the homo studiosus the studying man this is quite comforting for people like me i'm a professor
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 139.20 149.56 <o,f0,male> to be over there on the top of creation but it's something completely wrong you know very well about professors but it's also wrong about plants
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 150.51 158.50 <o,f0,male> because plants are not just able to live they are able to sense they are much more sophisticated in sensing than animals
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 158.85 171.94 <o,f0,male> just to give you an example every single root apex is able to detect and to monitor concurrently and continuously at least fifteen different chemical and physical parameters
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 172.38 181.81 <o,f0,male> and they also are able to show and to exhibit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be described just with the term of intelligence
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 182.13 189.30 <o,f0,male> well but this is something this underestimation of plants is something that is always with us
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 197.80 204.52 <o,f0,male> some of the most beautiful movies about plant behavior now when he speaks about plants everything is
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 206.11 215.99 <o,f0,male> when he speaks about animals tends to remove the fact that plants exist the blue whale the biggest creature that exists on the planet that
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 217.57 227.65 <o,f0,male> completely wrong the blue whale it's a dwarf if compared with the real biggest creature that exists on the planet that is this wonderful
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 234.53 242.33 <o,f0,male> this is a living organism that has a mass of at least two thousand tons now the story that plants
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 242.94 256.34 <o,f0,male> some low level organisms has been formalized many times ago by aristotle that in de anima that is a very influential book for western civilization wrote that
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 256.93 265.87 <o,f0,male> the plants are on the edge between living and not living they have just a kind of very low level soul it's called the
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 268.25 272.75 <o,f0,male> because they lack movement and so they don't need to sense
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 273.30 285.80 <o,f0,male> let 's see okay some of the movements of the plants are very well known this is a very fast movement this is a dionaea a venus fly trap hunting snails sorry for the snail
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 286.51 298.45 <o,f0,male> this has been something that has been refused for centuries despite the evidence no one could say that the plants were able to eat an animal because it was against the order of nature
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 298.89 307.47 <o,f0,male> but plants are also able to show a lot of movement some of them are very well known like the flowering it's just a question
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 308.50 315.12 <o,f0,male> to use some techniques like the time lapse some of them are much more sophisticated look at this young
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 316.11 323.83 <o,f0,male> that is moving to catch the light every time and it's really so graceful it's like a dancing
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 324.99 330.97 <o,f0,male> they are also able to play they are really playing these are young
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 332.63 339.51 <o,f0,male> and what they are doing cannot be described with any other terms than playing they are training
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 341.28 349.55 <o,f0,male> as many young animals do to the adult life where they will be called to track the sun all the day
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 349.92 362.09 <o,f0,male> they are able to respond to gravity of course so the shoots are growing against the vector of gravity and the roots toward the vector of gravity but they are also able to sleep
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 362.46 376.56 <o,f0,male> this is one mimosa pudica so during the night they curl the leaves and reduce the movement and during the day you have the opening of the leaves there is much more movement this is interesting because
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 391.69 395.99 <o,f0,male> in animals and it's much more easy even ethically it's a kind of
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 405.48 414.23 <o,f0,male> they communicate with other plants they are able to distinguish kin and non kin they communicate with plants and other species
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 414.64 427.49 <o,f0,male> and they communicate with animals by producing chemical volatiles for example during the pollination now with the pollination it's a very serious issue for plants because they move the pollen from one flower to the other
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 427.87 435.25 <o,f0,male> they can not move from one flower to the other so they need a vector and this vector it's normally an animal
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 435.90 448.15 <o,f0,male> many insects have been used by plants as vectors for the transport of the pollination but not just insects even birds reptiles and mammals like bats rats
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 449.27 457.46 <o,f0,male> normally used for the transportation of the pollen this is a serious business we have the plants that are giving to the animals a kind of
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 467.64 475.52 <o,f0,male> like in the case of orchids that promise sex and nectar and give in change nothing for the transportation of the pollen
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 490.89 497.26 <o,f0,male> big man charles darwin publishes a wonderful astonishing book that
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 498.46 506.80 <o,f0,male> the title is the power of movement in plants no one was allowed to speak about movement in plants before charles darwin in his book
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 509.34 519.37 <o,f0,male> was the first professor of plant physiology in the world in cambridge they took into consideration every single movement for five hundred pages and in the last paragraph of
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 521.06 527.47 <o,f0,male> it's a kind of stylistic mark because normally charles darwin stored in the last paragraph of a book
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 527.65 535.80 <o,f0,male> the most important message he wrote that it 's hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 537.03 542.40 <o,f0,male> acts like the brain of one of the lower animals this is not a metaphor
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 559.97 572.15 <o,f0,male> so you can recognize this kind of movement the same movement that worms snakes and every animal that moving on the ground without legs is able to display
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 572.86 583.92 <o,f0,male> and it's not an easy movement because to have this kind of movement you need to move different regions of the root and to synchronize these different regions without having a brain
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 584.46 591.81 <o,f0,male> so we studied the root apex and we found that there is a specific region that is here depicted
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 593.03 599.14 <o,f0,male> call it a transition zone and this region it's a very small region it's less than one
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 600.54 610.07 <o,f0,male> and in this small region you have the highest consumption of oxygen in the plants and more important you have these kinds of signals here
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 610.74 621.38 <o,f0,male> the signals that you are seeing here are action potential are the same signals that the neurons of my brain of our brain use to exchange information
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 622.03 628.79 <o,f0,male> now we know that a root apex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of feature
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 629.35 636.52 <o,f0,male> we know how big the root apex of a small plant like a plant of rye we have almost fourteen million
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 638.02 648.44 <o,f0,male> we have eleven and a half million root apex and a total length of six hundred or more kilometers and a very high surface area now let 's
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 649.71 660.59 <o,f0,male> that each single root apex is working in network with all the others here were have on the left the internet and on the right the root apparatus
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 661.03 674.11 <o,f0,male> they work in the same way they are a network of small computing machines working in networks and why are they so similar because they evolved for the same reason
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 674.63 683.58 <o,f0,male> to survive predation they work in the same way so you can remove ninety percent of the root apparatus and the plants
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 684.40 694.71 <o,f0,male> to work you can remove ninety percent of the internet and it is to work so a suggestion for the people working with networks
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 695.45 703.90 <o,f0,male> plants are able to give you good suggestions about how to evolve networks and
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 704.95 712.61 <o,f0,male> another possibility is a technological possibility let 's imagine that we can build
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 722.63 729.41 <o,f0,male> or the animals in producing a robot we have the animaloid the normal robots
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 730.55 738.58 <o,f0,male> by animals insectoid so on we have the androids that are inspired by man but why have we not
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 739.07 748.06 <o,f0,male> any plantoid well if you want to fly it's good that you look at birds to be inspired by birds but if you want
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 748.45 760.18 <o,f0,male> to explore soils or if you want to colonize new territory to best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants that are masters in doing this
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 771.46 779.99 <o,f0,male> something that's half living and half machine it's much more easy to work with plants than with animals they have computing power
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 780.34 787.47 <o,f0,male> they have electrical signals the connection with the machine is much more easy much more even
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 789.25 795.44 <o,f0,male> possible and these are three possibilities that we are working on
StefanoMancuso_2010G 1 StefanoMancuso_2010G 806.74 815.32 <o,f0,male> well thank you for your attention and before i finish i would like to reassure that no snails were harmed in making
