NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 222.75 225.05 <o,f0,female> to start well
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 230.11 236.83 <o,f0,female> my own upbringing in music and family and all of that but i 'm even more excited
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 236.83 255.03 <o,f0,female> for you people to hear about donnell 's amazing family and maybe even a little bit about how we met and all that sort of thing but for those of you that may not be familiar with my upbringing
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 255.03 263.67 <o,f0,female> i 'm from cape breton island nova scotia eastern canada which is a very very musical island
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 300.72 305.88 <o,f0,female> and my dad taught me to play fiddle when i was nine
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 305.88 316.01 <o,f0,female> my uncle is a very well known cape breton fiddler his name 's buddy macmaster and just a wonderful guy and we have
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 316.01 331.58 <o,f0,female> a great tradition at home called square dancing and we had parties great parties at our house and the neighbors houses and you talk about kitchen ceilidhs well ceilidh first of all is gaelic for party but
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 348.85 353.14 <o,f0,female> so ten chances to one the fellow who walked in the door could play it
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 363.08 373.39 <o,f0,female> it was a wonderful wonderful way to grow up and that is where my beginnings in music come from my surroundings my family just my bloodline in itself
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 389.47 399.67 <o,f0,female> i 've actually known donnell for probably twelve years now and i 'm going to get into a little bit of i guess how
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 421.28 424.76 <o,f0,male> you i 'm kind of new to the ted experience and i 'm glad to be here but
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 471.59 475.3 <o,f0,male> so out went the television
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 500.12 517.39 <o,f0,male> come from within or go from within because we didn 't watch television we didn 't listen to a lot of radio we went to church and to school sometimes and farmed and played music so we were able i think at a very critical age to develop our own style our own self
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 517.39 521.49 <o,f0,male> and my mother plays my father plays
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 521.49 537.55 <o,f0,male> and the style that came from the ottawa valley in ontario we call it french canadian style but it originated in logging camps years ago hundreds of men would go up for the winter to the camps in northern ontario and in quebec
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 537.55 542.04 <o,f0,male> and they were all different cultures and
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 542.04 559 <o,f0,male> the irish the french scottish german they 'd all meet and of course at night they 'd play cards and step dance and play fiddles and over the course of many years the ottawa valley fiddling kind of evolved and the ottawa valley step dancing evolved
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 559 564.23 <o,f0,male> so that 's i kind of started out with that style and i quickly
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 583.73 591.98 <o,f0,female> well it 's just so interesting that donnell 's upbringing was very similar to mine
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 626.17 636.65 <o,f0,female> little did i think our children would be playing instruments you know playing music yeah twelve years er twenty years later little did she think her kids would be getting married
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 636.65 642.24 <o,f0,female> but anyway so then i got a phone call
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 664.68 666.74 <o,f0,female> he asked me out for supper
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 677.6 681.38 <o,f0,female> then we dated for two years broke up for ten got back together and got married
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 701.81 708.31 <o,f0,male> burials as a body was carried out from the wake site to the burial site the procession was led by a piper or a fiddle player
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 1019.95 1027.02 <o,f0,female> we 're laughing like because our styles are totally different as you can hear
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 1027.28 1038.55 <o,f0,female> and so you know donnell and i are actually in the process of writing new pieces of music together that we can play but we don 't have any of those ready we just started yesterday
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 1326.71 1338.31 <o,f0,male> before mom 's family had a piano in cape breton she learned to play the rhythms on a piece of board and the fiddlers would all congregate to play on the cold winter 's evenings and mom would be banging on this board
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 1338.31 1343.35 <o,f0,male> so when they bought a piano they bought it in toronto and had it
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 1343.35 1360.38 <o,f0,male> taken by train and brought in on a horse a horse and sleigh to the house it became the only piano in the region and mom said she could basically play as soon as the piano arrived she could play it because she had learned all these rhythms anyway we found the piano last
NatalieMacMaster_2003 1 NatalieMacMaster_2003 1457.47 1471.08 <o,f0,male> you had to wait until they were finished so of course what we would do is we 'd get on the piano and you wouldn 't even get off to eat because you wouldn 't want to give it up to your brother or sister and they 'd wait and wait and wait and it 'd be midnight and you 'd be still sitting there on the piano but it was their way to get us to practice
