ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 18.05 20.96 <o,f0,female> i was raised by native hawaiian elders
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 21.27 25.77 <o,f0,female> three old women who took care of me while my parents worked
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 27.59 29.79 <o,f0,female> the year is one thousand nine hundred and sixty three
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 38.67 48.42 <o,f0,female> and the shifting of the tides it 's a stretch of beach we know so well the smooth stones on the sand
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 52.51 54.93 <o,f0,female> if you saw these women on the street
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 55.02 60.01 <o,f0,female> in their faded clothes you might dismiss them as poor and simple
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 60.51 62.14 <o,f0,female> that would be a mistake
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 63.64 67.19 <o,f0,female> these women are descendants of polynesian navigators
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 67.46 70.23 <o,f0,female> trained in the old ways
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 70.59 72.24 <o,f0,female> by their elders
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 72.34 74.58 <o,f0,female> and now they 're passing it on to me
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 75.14 83.15 <o,f0,female> they teach me the names of the winds and the rains of astronomy according to a genealogy of stars
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 83.86 89.24 <o,f0,female> there 's a new moon on the horizon hawaiians say it 's a good night for fishing
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 90.03 91.75 <o,f0,female> they begin to chant
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 124.66 126.32 <o,f0,female> they sit in a circle
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 126.43 128.4 <o,f0,female> and ask me to come to join them
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 129.77 132.22 <o,f0,female> they want to teach me about my destiny
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 133.33 135.89 <o,f0,female> i thought every seven year old went through
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 144.7 146.69 <o,f0,female> people will forget their wisdom
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 147.81 153.08 <o,f0,female> it will take elders voices from the far corners of the world
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 153.45 155.72 <o,f0,female> to call the world into balance
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 157.33 159.39 <o,f0,female> you will go far away
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 160 163.85 <o,f0,female> it will sometimes be a lonely road we will not be there
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 164.43 168.94 <o,f0,female> but you will look into the eyes of seeming strangers
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 192.38 194.55 <o,f0,female> the year is two thousand and seven
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 195.31 198.49 <o,f0,female> i 'm on a remote island in micronesia
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 202.04 203.78 <o,f0,female> by one mile wide
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 212.59 216.37 <o,f0,female> he 's also considered the greatest wave finder in the world
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 217.76 221.59 <o,f0,female> there are fewer than a handful of palu left on this island
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 222.55 224.97 <o,f0,female> their tradition is so extraordinary
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 225.38 227.42 <o,f0,female> that these mariners sailed
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 227.52 232.78 <o,f0,female> three million square miles across the pacific without the use of instruments
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 233.37 242.58 <o,f0,female> they could synthesize patterns in nature using the rising and setting of stars the sequence and direction of waves
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 242.75 255.59 <o,f0,female> the flight patterns of certain birds even the slightest hint of color on the underbelly of a cloud would inform them and help them navigate with the keenest accuracy
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 258.28 267.42 <o,f0,female> when western scientists would join mau on the canoe and watch him go into the hull it appeared that an old man was going to rest
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 267.57 279.12 <o,f0,female> in fact the hull of the canoe is the womb of the vessel it is the most accurate place to feel the rhythm and sequence and direction of waves
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 286.81 290.6 <o,f0,female> it 's what he had been trained to do since he was five years old
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 291.57 294.7 <o,f0,female> now science may dismiss this methodology
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 296.2 299.11 <o,f0,female> but polynesian navigators use it today
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 299.32 301.84 <o,f0,female> because it provides them
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 302.64 307.67 <o,f0,female> an accurate determination of the angle and direction of their vessel
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 308.63 324.89 <o,f0,female> the palu also had an uncanny ability to forecast weather conditions days in advance sometimes i 'd be with mau on a cloud covered night and we 'd sit at the easternmost coast of the island and he would look out
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 335.81 347.56 <o,f0,female> their achievements intellectually and scientifically are extraordinary and they are so relevant for these times that we are in when we are riding out storms
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 348.02 353.27 <o,f0,female> we are in such a critical moment of our collective history
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 356.05 360.75 <o,f0,female> they have been compared to astronauts
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 360.98 368.3 <o,f0,female> these elder navigators who sail vast open oceans in double hulled canoes
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 368.32 371.84 <o,f0,female> thousands of miles from a small island
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 372.85 374.5 <o,f0,female> their canoes
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 394.65 397.62 <o,f0,female> we cannot afford to lose it
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 398.79 400.79 <o,f0,female> the year is two thousand and ten
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 402.58 405.6 <o,f0,female> just as the women in hawaii
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 405.81 409.53 <o,f0,female> that raised me predicted the world is in trouble
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 411.99 416.33 <o,f0,female> we live in a society bloated with data
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 416.82 419.11 <o,f0,female> yet starved for wisdom
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 419.98 422.3 <o,f0,female> we 're connected twenty four seven
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 426.78 433.76 <o,f0,female> fear depression and loneliness is at an all time high we must course
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 438.45 440.82 <o,f0,female> your society worships the jester
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 441.67 445.6 <o,f0,female> while the king stands in plain clothes
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 449.95 454.75 <o,f0,female> the link between the past and the future is fragile
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 455.9 461.9 <o,f0,female> this i know intimately because even as i travel throughout the world
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 462.18 465.33 <o,f0,female> to listen to these stories and record them
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 476.78 479.34 <o,f0,female> by the fact that i no longer
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 480.03 482.76 <o,f0,female> remember the names of the winds
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 498.39 502.26 <o,f0,female> and i am reminded
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 502.48 510.69 <o,f0,female> that throughout the world there are cultures with vast sums of knowledge in them
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 512.06 515.17 <o,f0,female> as potent as the micronesian navigators
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 516.02 520.91 <o,f0,female> that are going dismissed that this is a testament to brilliant
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 520.93 524.97 <o,f0,female> brilliant technology and science and wisdom
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 525.34 532.85 <o,f0,female> that is vanishing rapidly because when an elder dies a library is burned and throughout the world libraries are ablaze
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 542.97 546.47 <o,f0,female> and i realize through a lesson that he shared
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 547.22 551.29 <o,f0,female> that we continue to find our way and this is what he said
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 551.78 554.61 <o,f0,female> the island is the canoe
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 554.71 558.96 <o,f0,female> the canoe the island and what he meant was
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 560.82 563.87 <o,f0,female> if you are voyaging and far from home
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 564.7 568.62 <o,f0,female> your very survival depends on everyone aboard
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 569.86 574.05 <o,f0,female> you cannot make the voyage alone you were never meant to
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 574.05 580.8 <o,f0,female> this whole notion of every man for himself is completely unsustainable it always
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 592.06 593.76 <o,f0,female> true navigation
ElizabethLindsey_2010W 1 ElizabethLindsey_2010W 593.87 595.88 <o,f0,female> begins in the human heart
