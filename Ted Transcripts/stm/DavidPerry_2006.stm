DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 16.08 24.52 <o,f0,male> in northern ireland right up in the very very north end of it there where it's absolutely freezing cold this is me running around in the back garden mid summer
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 25.25 31.87 <o,f0,male> i couldn't pick a career in ireland the obvious choice is the military but to be honest it actually kind of sucks
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 34.17 43.44 <o,f0,male> my mother wanted me to be a dentist but the problem was that people kept blowing everything up so i actually went to school in belfast which was where all the action happened
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 43.94 49.35 <o,f0,male> and this was a pretty common sight the school i went to was pretty boring they forced us to learn things like latin
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 49.99 63.53 <o,f0,male> the school teachers weren't having much fun the sports were very dirty or very painful so i cleverly chose rowing which i got very good at and i was actually rowing for my school here until this fateful day and i flipped over right in front of the entire school
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 73.35 79.78 <o,f0,male> and they left the programming manuals laying around and so students like myself with nothing to do we would learn how to program it
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 80.36 89.00 <o,f0,male> also around this time at home this was the computer that people were buying it was called the sinclair zx eighty this was a one k computer and you'd buy your programs on cassette tape
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 90.39 102.32 <o,f0,male> one second because i heard that there's a prerequisite to speak here at ted you have to have a picture of yourself from the old days with big hair so i brought a picture with big hair i just want to get that out of the way so after the sinclair zx eighty
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 103.58 113.85 <o,f0,male> came along the very cleverly named sinclair zx eighty one and you see the picture at the bottom there's a picture of a guy doing homework with his son that's what they thought they had built it for
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 124.99 132.48 <o,f0,male> this is the guy that invented it sir clive sinclair and he 's showing his machine you had this same thing in america it was called the timex sinclair one thousand
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 133.05 144.31 <o,f0,male> to play a game in those days you had to have an imagination to believe that you were really playing battlestar galactica the graphics were just horrible you had to have an even better imagination to play this game death rider
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 144.54 155.39 <o,f0,male> but of course the scientists couldn't help themselves they started making their own video games this is one of my favorite ones here where they have rabbit breeding so males choose the lucky rabbit
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 156.30 164.46 <o,f0,male> was around this time we went from one k to sixteen k which was quite the leap and if you're wondering how much sixteen k is this ebay logo here is sixteen k
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 164.79 171.22 <o,f0,male> and in that amount of memory someone programmed a full flight simulation program and that's what it looked like
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 171.79 179.91 <o,f0,male> i spent ages flying this flight simulator and i honestly believed i could fly airplanes by the end of it here 's clive sinclair now launching his
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 180.38 187.84 <o,f0,male> color computer he 's recognized as being the father of video games in europe he 's a multi millionaire and i think that's why he 's smiling in this photograph
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 188.48 195.36 <o,f0,male> so i went on for the next twenty years or so making a lot of different games some of the highlights were things like the terminator aladdin
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 195.74 208.46 <o,f0,male> the teenage mutant hero turtles because i was from the united kingdom they thought the word ninja was a little too mean for children so they decided to call it hero instead i personally preferred the spanish version which was tortugas ninja
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 212.29 224.47 <o,f0,male> then the last game i did was based on trying to get the video game industry in hollywood to actually work together on something instead of licensing from each other to actually work now chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 225.80 232.47 <o,f0,male> that the video game industry in two thousand and five became a twenty nine billion dollar business it grows every year last year was the biggest year
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 233.16 244.35 <o,f0,male> by two thousand and eight we're going to kick the butt of the music industry by two thousand and ten we're going to hit forty two billion forty three percent of gamers are female so there's a lot more female gamers than people are really aware
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 244.95 255.11 <o,f0,male> the average age of gamers well obviously it's for children right well no actually it's thirty years old and interestingly the people who buy the most games are thirty seven so thirty seven is our target audience
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 256.16 263.99 <o,f0,male> all video games are violent of course the newspapers love to beat on this but eighty three percent of games don't have any mature content whatsoever
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 264.74 277.35 <o,f0,male> so it's just not true online gaming statistics i brought some stuff on world of warcraft it's five point five million players it makes about eighty million bucks a month in subscriptions it costs fifty bucks just to install it on your computer
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 277.74 288.46 <o,f0,male> making the publisher about another two hundred and seventy five million the game costs about eighty million dollars to make so basically it pays for itself in about a month a player in a game called project entropia
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 289.23 296.54 <o,f0,male> actually bought his own island for twenty six thousand five hundred dollars you have to remember that this is not a real island he didn't actually buy anything just some data
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 297.04 304.74 <o,f0,male> but he got great terms on it this purchase included mining and hunting rights ownership of all land on the island and a castle with no furniture included
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 305.86 313.79 <o,f0,male> this market is now estimated at over eight hundred million dollars annually and what's interesting about it is the market was actually created by the gamers themselves
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 314.18 320.48 <o,f0,male> they found clever ways to trade items and to sell their accounts to each other so that they could make money while they were playing their games
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 341.59 348.96 <o,f0,male> it turns out they're actually in hollywood bowl in los angeles listening to the l a philharmonic playing video game music
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 349.48 356.30 <o,f0,male> that's what the show looks like you would expect it to be cheesy but it's not it's very very epic and a very beautiful concert and the people that went there absolutely loved it
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 357.15 367.38 <o,f0,male> you think these people are doing they're actually bringing their computers so they can play games against each other and this is happening in every city around the world this is happening in your local cities too you're probably just not aware of it
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 377.67 386.40 <o,f0,male> i want you to do is to try to understand it we're on this curve and the graphics are getting so ridiculously better and i'm going to show you up to maybe two thousand and seven
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 399.83 400.02 <o,f0,male> so
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 560.17 569.83 <o,f0,male> you need to be really an incredible artist and once we get enough of those guys we're going to want more fantasy artists that can create places we've never been to before or characters that we've just never seen before
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 570.34 579.16 <o,f0,male> so the obvious thing for me to talk about today is graphics and audio but if you were to go to a game developers conference what they're all talking about is emotion purpose meaning understanding and feeling
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 579.66 585.36 <o,f0,male> hear about talks like can a video game make you cry and these are the kind of topics we really actually care about
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 585.87 592.55 <o,f0,male> i came across a student who 's absolutely excellent at expressing himself and this student agreed that he would
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 603.23 615.22 <o,f0,male> i like many of you live somewhere between reality and video games some part of me a true living breathing person has become programmed electronic and virtual
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 615.53 623.96 <o,f0,male> the boundary of my brain that divides real from fantasy has finally begun to crumble i'm a video game addict and this is my story
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 631.54 632.22 <o,f0,female> the
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 639.34 643.47 <o,f0,male> year of my birth the nintendo entertainment system also went into development
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 648.52 653.17 <o,f0,male> i played in the backyard learned to read and even ate some of my vegetables
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 657.97 660.27 <o,f0,male> but as was the case for most of my generation
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 660.54 662.73 <o,f0,male> i spent a lot of time in front of the tv
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 671.76 673.92 <o,f0,male> when my parents bought my sister and i our first
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 727.74 728.53 <o,f0,male> i'm a video game
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 729.29 741.97 <o,f0,male> it's not because of a certain number of hours i have spent playing or nights i have gone without sleep to finish the next level it is because i have had life altering experiences in virtual space and video games had begun to erode my own understanding of what is
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 745.07 748.09 <o,f0,male> i'm addicted because even though i know i'm losing my grip on
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 761.26 766.36 <o,f0,male> from an early age i learned to invest myself emotionally in what unfolded before me on screen
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 767.53 771.68 <o,f0,male> today after twenty years of watching tv geared to make me emotional
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 772.23 774.55 <o,f0,male> a decent insurance commercial can bring tears to my eyes
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 779.42 782.00 <o,f0,male> am just one of a new generation that is growing up
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 782.71 791.34 <o,f0,male> a generation who may experience much more meaning through video games than they will through the real world video games are nearing an evolutionary leap
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 791.77 803.35 <o,f0,male> a point where game worlds will look and feel just as real as the films we see in theatres or the news we watch on tv and while my sense of free will in these virtual worlds may still be limited what i do learn applies to my real life
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 811.04 811.83 <o,f0,male> second quarter mile
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 820.67 825.32 <o,f0,male> unlike any pop culture phenomenon before it video games actually allow us to become part of
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 851.31 852.72 <o,f0,male> but the beauty of video games
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 853.29 857.53 <o,f0,male> lies not in the lifelike graphics the vibrating joysticks or virtual surround sound
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 858.35 861.13 <o,f0,male> lies in that these games are beginning to make me emotional
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 883.50 892.76 <o,f0,male> a well designed video game will seamlessly weave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience as one becomes more experienced the awareness of physical control melts
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 897.94 898.93 <o,f0,male> just me and the game
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 900.09 901.68 <o,f0,male> the fate of the world
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 902.92 904.36 <o,f0,male> my hands
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 908.41 920.64 <o,f0,male> i know violent video games make my mother worry what troubles me is not that video game violence is becoming more and more like real life violence but that real life violence is starting to look more and more
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 928.22 930.35 <o,f0,male> these are all troubles outside of myself
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 931.09 935.60 <o,f0,male> i however have a problem very close to home something has happened
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 947.15 958.82 <o,f0,male> perhaps there is a single part of our brain that holds all of our gut instincts the things we know to do before we even think while some of these instincts may be innate most are learned and all of them are hardwired into our brains
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 959.51 963.76 <o,f0,male> these instincts are essential for survival in both real and virtual worlds
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 969.08 973.41 <o,f0,male> only in recent years has the technology behind video games allowed for a true overlap
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 975.22 983.39 <o,f0,male> as gamers we are now living by the same laws of physics in the same cities and doing many of the same things we once did in real life only virtually
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 984.88 993.65 <o,f0,male> consider this my real life car has about twenty five thousand miles on it in all my driving games i've driven a total of thirty one four hundred and fifty nine
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 994.80 1002.79 <o,f0,male> to some degree i've learned how to drive from the game the sensory cues are very similar it's a funny feeling when you have spent more time doing something on the tv
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 1005.60 1016.09 <o,f0,male> when i am driving down a road at sunset all i can think is this is almost as beautiful as my games are for my virtual worlds are perfect more beautiful and rich than the real world around us
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 1016.71 1019.58 <o,f0,male> i'm not sure what the implications of my experience
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 1027.97 1036.18 <o,f0,male> today i believe big brother would find much more success brainwashing the masses with video games rather than just simply tvs video games are fun
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 1037.06 1039.83 <o,f0,male> engaging and leave your brain completely vulnerable to
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 1042.14 1043.79 <o,f0,male> but maybe brainwashing isn't always
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 1064.48 1074.80 <o,f0,male> the future of video games holds for our civilization but as virtual and real world experiences increasingly overlap there is a greater and greater potential for other people to feel the same way i do
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 1077.70 1087.43 <o,f0,male> what i have only recently come to realize is that beyond the graphics sound game play and emotion it is the power to break down reality that is so fascinating and addictive to me
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 1097.43 1100.49 <o,f0,male> i know though that no matter how amazing video games may
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 1101.13 1110.76 <o,f0,male> or how flat the real world may seem to us that we must stay aware of what our games are teaching us and how they leave us feeling when we finally do unplug
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 1123.56 1134.33 <o,f0,male> i found that video very very thought provoking and that's why i wanted to bring it here for you guys to see and what was interesting about it is the obvious choice for me to talk about was graphics and audio but as you heard michael talked about all
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 1134.91 1142.36 <o,f0,male> elements as well video games give an awful lot of other things too and that's why people get so addicted the most important one being fun
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 1142.48 1150.58 <o,f0,male> the name of this track is the magic to come who is that going to come from is it going to come from the best directors in the world as we thought it probably would i don't think so i think it's going to come from
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 1150.89 1164.18 <o,f0,male> the children who are growing up now that aren't stuck with all of the stuff that we remember from the past they're going to do it their way using the tools that we've created the same with students or highly creative people writers and people like that
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 1164.91 1170.34 <o,f0,male> as far as colleges go there's about three hundred and fifty colleges around the world teaching video game courses
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 1186.05 1186.34 <o,f0,male> a
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 1210.54 1220.02 <o,f0,male> this is my daughter her name 's emma she's seventeen months old and i've been asking myself what is emma going to experience in the video game world and as i've shown here
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 1220.69 1232.19 <o,f0,male> we have the audience she's never going to know a world where you can't press a button and have millions of people ready to play you know we have the technology she's never going to know a world where the graphics just aren't stunning and really immersive
DavidPerry_2006 1 DavidPerry_2006 1232.81 1242.09 <o,f0,male> and as the student video showed we can impact and move she's never going to know a world where video games aren't incredibly emotional and will probably make her cry i just hope she likes video games
