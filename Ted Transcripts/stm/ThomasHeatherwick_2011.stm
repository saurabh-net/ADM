ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 32.98 35.84 <o,f0,male> and invention on a small scale
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 35.84 53.42 <o,f0,male> and i was there looking at the larger scale of buildings and finding that the buildings that were around me and that were being designed and that were there in the publications i was seeing felt soulless and cold
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 53.42 64.26 <o,f0,male> and there on the smaller scale the scale of an earring or a ceramic pot or a musical instrument was a materiality and a soulfulness
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 64.26 83.19 <o,f0,male> and this influenced me the first building i built was twenty years ago and since in the last twenty years i 've developed a studio in london sorry this was my mother by the way in her bead shop in london i spent a lot of time counting beads and things like that
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 83.19 91.24 <o,f0,male> i 'm just going to show for people who don 't know my studio 's work a few projects that we 've worked on this is a hospital building
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 92.82 95.91 <o,f0,male> this is a shop for a bag company
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 97.84 101.23 <o,f0,male> this is studios for artists
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 102.33 110.66 <o,f0,male> this is a sculpture made from a million yards of wire and one hundred and fifty thousand glass beads the size of a golf ball
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 112.38 114.71 <o,f0,male> and this is a window display
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 116.81 127.8 <o,f0,male> and this is pair of cooling towers for an electricity substation next to st paul 's cathedral in london and this is a temple in japan for a buddhist monk
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 129.78 133.72 <o,f0,male> and this is a cafe by the sea in britain
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 133.72 141.37 <o,f0,male> and just very quickly something we 've been working on very recently is we were commissioned by the mayor of london to design a new bus
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 141.37 158.58 <o,f0,male> that gave the passenger their freedom again because the original routemaster bus that some of you may be familiar with which had this open platform at the back in fact i think all our routemasters are here in california now actually but they aren 't in london
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 158.58 174.25 <o,f0,male> and so you 're stuck on a bus and if the bus is going to stop and it 's three yards away from the bus stop you 're just a prisoner but the mayor of london wanted to reintroduce buses with this open platform
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 174.25 186.26 <o,f0,male> so we 've been working with transport for london and that organization hasn 't actually been responsible as a client for a new bus for fifty years
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 186.26 192.66 <o,f0,male> and so we 've been very lucky to have a chance to work the brief is that the bus should use forty percent less energy
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 192.66 206.27 <o,f0,male> so it 's got hybrid drive and we 've been working to try to improve everything from the fabric to the format and structure and aesthetics
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 206.5 215.71 <o,f0,male> i was going to show four main projects and this is a project for a bridge and so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 229.68 244.01 <o,f0,male> i 'm slightly squeamish but i once saw a photograph of a footballer who was diving for a ball and as he was diving someone had stamped on his knee and it had broken like this
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 264.52 271.62 <o,f0,male> but instead of what it is our focus was on the way it worked
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 298.21 304.64 <o,f0,male> we actually had to halve its speed because everyone was too scared when we first did it so that 's it speeded up
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 304.64 323.17 <o,f0,male> a project that we 've been working on very recently is to design a new biomass power station so a power station that uses organic waste material in the news the subject of where our future water is going to come from and where our power is going to come from is in all the papers all the time
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 323.17 338.23 <o,f0,male> and we used to be quite proud of the way we generated power but recently any annual report of a power company doesn 't have a power station on it it has a child running through a field or something like that
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 346 362.41 <o,f0,male> our condition was that we would work with them and that whatever we did we were not just going to decorate a normal power station and instead we had to learn we kind of forced them to teach us and so we spent time traveling with them and learning about all the different elements
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 362.41 372.64 <o,f0,male> and finding that there were plenty of inefficiencies that weren 't being capitalized on that just taking a field and banging all these things out isn 't necessarily the most efficient way that they could work
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 372.64 377.01 <o,f0,male> so we looked at how we could compose all those elements
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 377.01 380.31 <o,f0,male> instead of just litter create one composition
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 380.31 391.4 <o,f0,male> and what we found this area is one of the poorest parts of britain it was voted the worst place in britain to live and there are two thousand new homes being built next to this power station
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 391.4 402.61 <o,f0,male> so it felt this has a social dimension it has a symbolic importance and we should be proud of where our power is coming from rather than something we are necessarily ashamed of
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 402.61 411.02 <o,f0,male> so we were looking at how we could make a power station that instead of keeping people out and having a big fence around the outside could be a place that pulls you in
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 411.02 423.46 <o,f0,male> and it has to be i 'm trying to get my two hundred and fifty feet high so it felt that what we could try to do is make a power park
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 423.46 434.32 <o,f0,male> and actually bring the whole area in and using the spare soil that 's there on the site we could make a power station that was silent as well because just that soil could make the acoustic difference
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 434.32 449.3 <o,f0,male> and we also found that we could make a more efficient structure and have a cost effective way of making a structure to do this the finished project is meant to be more than just a power station it has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 458.58 470.69 <o,f0,male> all around the area and use that height that we have to have for its function in shanghai we were invited to build well we weren 't invited what am i talking about we won the competition
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 539.59 550.51 <o,f0,male> and the world 's first major botanical institution is in london and they have this extraordinary project where they 've been collecting twenty five percent of all the world 's plant species
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 550.51 568.87 <o,f0,male> so we suddenly realized that there was this thing and everyone agrees that trees are beautiful and i 've never met anyone who says i don 't like trees and the same with flowers i 've never met anyone who says i don 't like flowers but we realized that seeds there 's been this very serious project happening but that seeds
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 588.48 591.77 <o,f0,male> and the film jurassic park actually really helped us
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 591.77 603.6 <o,f0,male> because the dna of the dinosaur that was trapped in the amber gave us some kind of clue that these tiny things could be trapped and be made to seem precious rather than looking like nuts
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 603.6 609.27 <o,f0,male> so the challenge was how are we going to bring light and expose these things
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 609.27 627.85 <o,f0,male> we didn 't want to make a separate building and have separate content so we were trying to think how could we make a whole thing emanate by the way we had half the budget of the other western nations so that was also in the mix with the site the size of a football pitch and so there was one particular toy that gave us a clue
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 658.53 675.92 <o,f0,male> that could move in the wind so the whole thing can gently move when the wind blows and inside the daylight each one is an optic and it brings light into the center and by night artificial light in each one emanates and comes out to the outside
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 675.92 691.87 <o,f0,male> and to make the project affordable we focused our energy instead of building a building as big as the football pitch we focused it on this one element and the government agreed to do that and not do anything else and focus our energy on that
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 707.67 712.59 <o,f0,male> so that even if you 're partially sighted that it was kind of crunchy and soft
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 712.73 716.15 <o,f0,male> that piece of landscape that you see there
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 716.15 728.21 <o,f0,male> and then you know when a pet has an operation and they shave a bit of the skin and get rid of the fur in order to get you to go into the seed cathedral in effect we 've shaved it
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 728.21 738.21 <o,f0,male> and inside there 's nothing there 's no famous actor 's voice there 's no projections there 's no televisions there 's no color changing there 's just silence
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 738.21 748.5 <o,f0,male> and a cool temperature and if a cloud goes past you can see a cloud on the tips where it 's letting the light through
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 751.63 754.98 <o,f0,male> this is the only project that we 've done where
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 754.98 758.75 <o,f0,male> the finished thing looked more like a rendering than our renderings
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 790.8 797.82 <o,f0,male> suddenly actually the next thing this is the head of u k trade and investment who was our client
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 814.7 816.92 <o,f0,male> i 'm sorry about my stupid voice there
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 832.1 845.96 <o,f0,male> is something that we 've been trying to research really and explore alternatives and the project that we 're building in malaysia is apartment buildings for a property developer
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 845.96 865.12 <o,f0,male> and it 's in a piece of land that 's this site and the mayor of kuala lumpur said that if this developer would give something that gave something back to the city they would give them more gross floor area buildable so there was an incentive for the developer to really try to think about what would be better for the city
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 865.12 876.31 <o,f0,male> and the conventional thing with apartment buildings in this part of the world is you have your tower and you squeeze a few trees around the edge and you see cars parked
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 876.31 886.04 <o,f0,male> it 's actually only the first couple of floors that you really experience and the rest of it is just for postcards the lowest value is actually the bottom part of a tower like this
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 886.04 900.75 <o,f0,male> so if we could chop that away and give the building a small bottom we could take that bit and put it at the top where the greater commercial value is for a property developer and by linking these together we could have ninety percent of the site
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 900.75 906.44 <o,f0,male> as a rainforest instead of only ten percent of scrubby trees and bits of road around buildings
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 924.14 927.36 <o,f0,male> rather than engulf it
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 929.76 931.67 <o,f0,male> and that 's my final slide
ThomasHeatherwick_2011 1 ThomasHeatherwick_2011 969.39 989.17 <o,f0,male> twenty two feet long and so the daylight was just coming it was caught on the outside of the box and was coming down to illuminate each seed waterproofing the building was a bit crazy because it 's quite hard to waterproof buildings anyway but if you say you 're going to drill sixty six thousand holes in it
