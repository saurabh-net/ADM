RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 17.13 28.80 <o,f0,female> my name is roz savage and i row across oceans four years ago i rowed solo across the atlantic and since then i've done two out of three stages across the pacific
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 55.61 61.42 <o,f0,female> this has given me a very special relationship with the ocean we have a bit of a love hate thing going on
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 62.78 71.42 <o,f0,female> it like i did about a very strict maths teacher that i once had at school i didn't always like her but i did respect her and she taught me a heck of a lot
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 72.44 85.29 <o,f0,female> today i'd like to share with you some of my ocean adventures and tell you a little bit about what they've taught me and how i think we can maybe take some of those lessons and apply them to this environmental challenge that we face right now
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 86.69 94.13 <o,f0,female> now some of you might be thinking hold on a minute she doesn't look very much like an ocean rower isn't she meant to be about this tall and
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 94.56 101.57 <o,f0,female> about this wide and maybe look a bit more like these guys you'll notice they've all got something that i don
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 103.56 113.61 <o,f0,female> well i don't know what you're thinking but i'm talking about the beards and no matter how long i spend on the ocean i haven't yet managed to muster a decent beard and i hope that it remains that way
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 114.26 127.90 <o,f0,female> for a long time i didn't believe that i could have a big adventure the story that i told myself was that adventurers looked like this i didn't look the part i thought there were them and there were us and i was not one of them
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 139.11 150.93 <o,f0,female> and i think i knew from day one that it wasn't the right job for me but that kind of conditioning just kept me there for so many years until i reached my mid thirties and i thought you know i'm not getting any younger
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 151.21 157.76 <o,f0,female> i feel like i've got a purpose in this life and i don't know what it is but i'm pretty certain that management consultancy is not
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 159.49 171.59 <o,f0,female> fast forward a few years i'd gone through some changes to try and answer that question of what am i supposed to be doing with my life i sat down one day and wrote two versions of my
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 173.38 174.84 <o,f0,female> the one that i wanted
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 175.38 182.51 <o,f0,female> a life of adventure and the one that i was actually heading for which was a nice normal pleasant life but it wasn't
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 182.84 191.25 <o,f0,female> where i wanted to be by the end of my life i wanted to live a life that i could be proud of and i remember looking at these two versions of my obituary and thinking
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 191.98 201.31 <o,f0,female> boy i'm on totally the wrong track here if i carry on living as i am now i'm just not going to end up where i want to be in five years or ten years or at the end of my life
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 202.46 210.71 <o,f0,female> i made a few changes let loose a few trappings of my old life and through a bit of a leap of logic decided to row across the atlantic ocean
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 212.29 222.29 <o,f0,female> the atlantic rowing race runs from the canaries to antigua it's about three thousand miles and it turned out to be the hardest thing i had ever done
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 232.96 241.12 <o,f0,female> and my timing was not great either two thousand and five when i did the atlantic was the year of hurricane katrina there were more
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 251.65 257.61 <o,f0,female> all four of my oars broke before i reached halfway across oars are not supposed to look like this
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 258.33 268.27 <o,f0,female> but what can you do you're in the middle of the ocean oars are your only means of propulsion so i just had to look around the boat and figure out what i was going to use to fix up these oars so that i could carry on
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 268.68 276.42 <o,f0,female> so i found a boat hook and my trusty duct tape and splintered the boat hook to the oars to reinforce it
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 277.08 286.11 <o,f0,female> then when that gave out i sawed the wheel axles off my spare rowing seat and used those and when those gave out i cannibalized one of the broken oars
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 301.13 308.83 <o,f0,female> just in how many ways i went beyond what i thought were my limits i suffered from tendinitis on my shoulders and saltwater sores on my
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 310.33 316.54 <o,f0,female> i really struggled psychologically totally overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge realizing that if i carried on
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 317.05 324.95 <o,f0,female> at two miles an hour three thousand miles was going to take me a very very long time there were so many times when i thought i'd
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 325.10 333.39 <o,f0,female> hit that limit but had not choice but to just carry on and try and figure out how i was going to get to the other side without driving myself crazy
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 334.11 343.53 <o,f0,female> and eventually after one hundred and three days at sea i arrived in antigua i don't think i've ever felt so happy in my entire life
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 344.58 357.23 <o,f0,female> like finishing a marathon and getting out of solitary confinement and winning an oscar all rolled into one i was euphoric and to see all the people coming out to greet me and standing along the clifftops and clapping and cheering
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 358.02 367.77 <o,f0,female> like a movie star it was absolutely wonderful and i really learned then that the bigger the challenge the bigger the sense of achievement when you get to the end of it
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 368.55 375.95 <o,f0,female> so this might by a good moment to take a quick time out to answer a few faqs about ocean rowing that might be going through your mind
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 376.51 385.20 <o,f0,female> number one that i get asked what do you eat a few freeze dried meals but mostly i try and eat much more unprocessed foods
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 385.55 394.83 <o,f0,female> so i grow my own beansprouts i eat fruits and nut bars a lot of nuts and generally arrive about thirty lbs lighter at the other end
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 408.02 417.63 <o,f0,female> on a good night i think my best ever was eleven miles in the right direction worst ever thirteen miles in the wrong direction that's a bad day at the office
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 420.65 428.32 <o,f0,female> a baseball cap rowing gloves and a smile or a frown depending on whether i went backwards overnight and lots
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 429.51 439.82 <o,f0,female> do i have a chase boat no i don 't i am totally self supporting out there i don't see anybody for the whole time that i'm at sea generally and
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 446.52 459.02 <o,f0,female> so how do you top rowing across the atlantic well naturally you decide to row across the pacific well i'd thought the atlantic was big but the pacific is really really big
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 460.38 470.49 <o,f0,female> i think we tend to do it a little bit of a disservice in our usual maps i don't know for sure that the brits invented this particular view of the world but i suspect we might have done because there we are right in the middle
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 478.75 487.56 <o,f0,female> this is how the pacific looks it pretty much covers half the planet you can just see a little bit of north america up here and a sliver of australia down there
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 488.90 496.71 <o,f0,female> it is really big sixty five million square miles and to row in a straight line across it would be about eight thousand miles
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 518.12 527.63 <o,f0,female> the first attempt didn't go so well in two thousand and seven i did a rather involuntary capsize drill three times in twenty four hours a bit like being in a washing machine
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 528.27 537.93 <o,f0,female> got a bit dinged up so did i i blogged about it unfortunately somebody with a bit of a hero complex decided this damsel was in distress and needed saving
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 538.62 546.53 <o,f0,female> i knew about this was when the coast guard plane turned up over head i tried to tell them to go away we had a bt of a battle of wills i lost and got airlifted
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 547.94 561.25 <o,f0,female> awful really awful it was one of the worst feelings of my life as i was lifted up on that winch line into the helicopter and looked down at my trusty little boat rolling around in the twenty ft waves and wondering if i would ever see her again
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 561.70 569.38 <o,f0,female> so i had to launch a very expensive salvage operation and then wait another nine months before i could get back out onto the ocean again
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 569.77 578.16 <o,f0,female> but what do you do fall down nine times get up ten so the following year i set out and fortunately this time made it safely across to hawaii
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 578.51 585.46 <o,f0,female> but it was not without misadventure my water maker broke only the most important piece of kit that i have on the boat
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 586.98 595.78 <o,f0,female> panels it sucks in saltwater and turns it into freshwater but it doesn't react very well to being immersed in ocean which is what happened to it
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 606.53 616.22 <o,f0,female> that area in the north pacific about twice the size of texas with an estimated three point five milion tons of trash in it circulating at the center of that north pacific
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 617.32 626.71 <o,f0,female> so to make the point these guys had actually built their boat out of plastic trash fifteen thousand empty water bottles lashed together into two pontoons
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 627.71 639.76 <o,f0,female> they were going very slowly partly they'd had a bit of a delay they'd had to pull in at catalina island shortly after they left long beach because the lids of all the water bottles were coming undone and they were starting to sink so
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 640.44 647.01 <o,f0,female> had to pull in and do all the lids up but as i was approaching the end of my water reserves
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 655.96 669.39 <o,f0,female> and it took about a week for us to actually gradually converge i was doing a pathetically slow speed of about one point three knots and they were doing only marginally less pathetically speed of about one point four it was like two snails in a mating dance
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 688.49 696.83 <o,f0,female> and this is really bad news because plastic is not an inert substance it leaches out chemicals into the flesh of the poor critter that ate it
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 703.58 706.36 <o,f0,female> so there are very real implications for human health
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 718.78 730.00 <o,f0,female> and you'll notice something about tarawa it is very low lying it's that little green sliver on the horizon which makes them very nervous about rising oceans
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 730.40 742.76 <o,f0,female> this is big trouble for these guys they've got no points of land more than about six feet above sea level and also as an increase in extreme weather events do to climate change they're expecting more waves to come in
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 744.34 752.08 <o,f0,female> which will contaminate their fresh water supply i had a meeting with the president there who told me about his exit strategy
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 752.35 761.16 <o,f0,female> for his country he expects that within the next fifty years the hundred thousand people that live there will have to relocate to new zealand or australia
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 761.66 769.84 <o,f0,female> and that made me think about how would i feel if britain was going to disappear under the waves if the places where i'd been born and gone to school
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 780.39 794.51 <o,f0,female> very shortly i'll be setting out to try and get to australia and if i'm successful i'll be the first woman ever to row solo all the way across the pacific and i try and use this to bring awareness to these environmental issues to bring a human face to the ocean
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 794.94 802.50 <o,f0,female> if the atlantic was about my inner journey discovering my own capabilities maybe the pacific has been about my outer journey
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 810.06 819.87 <o,f0,female> and to take some of those things that i've learned out there and apply them to the situation that human kind now finds itself in i think there are probably three key points here
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 820.98 824.04 <o,f0,female> the first one is about the stories we tell ourselves
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 824.74 832.24 <o,f0,female> for so long i told myself that i couldn't have an adventure because i wasn't six foot tall and athletic and
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 833.65 842.60 <o,f0,female> and then that story changed i found out that people had rowed across oceans i even met one of them and she was just about my size
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 842.79 849.61 <o,f0,female> so even though i didn't grow any taller i didn't sprout a beard something had changed my interior dialogue had changed
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 850.57 858.80 <o,f0,female> the story that we collectively tell ourselves is that we need all this stuff that we need oil but about if we just change that story
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 859.26 867.97 <o,f0,female> we do have alternatives and we have the power of free will to choose those alternatives those sustainable ones to create a greener future
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 870.13 874.38 <o,f0,female> the second point is about the accumulation of tiny actions
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 875.35 889.03 <o,f0,female> we might think that anything that we do as an individual is just a drop in the ocean that it can't really make a difference but it does generally we haven't got ourselves into this mess through big disasters yes there have been the exxon valdezs and
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 889.36 898.76 <o,f0,female> the chernobyls but mostly it's been an accumulation of bad decisions by billions of individuals day after day and year after year
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 899.27 911.41 <o,f0,female> by the same token we can turn that tide we can start making better wiser more sustainable decisions and when we do that we're not just one person anything that we do spreads ripples
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 911.65 924.26 <o,f0,female> other people will see if you're in the supermarket line and you pull out your reusable grocery bag maybe if we all start doing this we can make it socially unacceptable to say yes to plastic in the check out line
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 925.05 928.44 <o,f0,female> that's just one example this is a world wide community
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 938.47 944.24 <o,f0,female> i thought if i had the right house the right car or the right man in my life then i could be happy
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 944.72 957.32 <o,f0,female> but when i wrote that obituary exercise i actually grew up a little bit in that moment and realized that i needed to create my own future i couldn't just wait passively for happiness to come and find me
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 966.76 978.28 <o,f0,female> and it's very difficult to be happy on a planet that's wracked with famine and drought it's very difficult to be healthy on a planet where we've poisoned the
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 979.06 986.00 <o,f0,female> and the sea and the air so shortly i'm going to be launching a new initiative called
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 988.21 994.68 <o,f0,female> and the idea here is that all our eco heroes will log at least one green deed every day it's meant to be a bit of a game
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 996.59 1002.17 <o,f0,female> it we just want to try and create that awareness because sure changing a light bulb isn't going to change the world
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 1002.71 1017.03 <o,f0,female> but that attitude that awareness that leads you to change the light bulb or take your reusable coffee mug that is what could change the world i really believe that we stand at a very important point in history
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 1017.49 1028.60 <o,f0,female> we have a choice we've been blessed or cursed with free will we can choose a greener future and we can get there if we all pull together take it one
