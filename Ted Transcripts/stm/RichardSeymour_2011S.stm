RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 16.38 18.81 <o,f0,male> and by the way i was little
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 38.33 44.93 <o,f0,male> and as he did so his customer noticed that on the back side of the balance wheel was an engraving were words
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 45.43 48.59 <o,f0,male> and he said to the guy why have you put
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 49.11 53.96 <o,f0,male> stuff on the back that no one will ever see and the watchmaker turned around and said
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 140.15 145.24 <o,f0,male> i thought well what the hell 's that about so i started to ask myself questions about it and the first was
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 162.19 165.77 <o,f0,male> and i suddenly realized that there was something that did exactly that
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 165.77 169.89 <o,f0,male> light to dark in six seconds exactly that
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 173.58 189.93 <o,f0,male> you see using this bit the thinky bit the slow bit of the brain using that and this isn 't a think it 's a feel and would you do me a favor for the next fourteen minutes or whatever it is will you feel stuff i don 't need you to think so much as i want you to feel it i felt
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 230.94 234.39 <o,f0,male> everybody likes it but some like it more than others
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 235.36 242.96 <o,f0,male> so this leads me to think of this in a different way we 're not feeling it we 're thinking beauty is in the limbic system if that 's not an outmoded idea
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 242.96 258.85 <o,f0,male> these are the bits the pleasure centers and maybe what i 'm seeing and sensing and feeling is bypassing my thinking the wiring from your sensory apparatus to those bits is shorter than the bits that have to pass through the thinky bit the cortex they arrive first
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 289.57 296.32 <o,f0,male> by osmosis and end up inside it as pure potable drinking water and all of a sudden this plastic bag
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 296.46 299.58 <o,f0,male> was extremely beautiful to me
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 321.99 329.71 <o,f0,male> who are picking up something off that maybe there 's an innocence to it now i 'm going to tell you what it is are you ready this is the last
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 334.73 341.99 <o,f0,male> before she died of cancer to the spine it 's the last thing she did the last physical act
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 344 348.95 <o,f0,male> look at that picture look at the innocence look at the beauty in it is it beautiful now stop
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 365.06 376.39 <o,f0,male> i watch what people do i watch faces i watch reactions because i have to know how people react to things and one of the most common faces on something
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 408.21 426.88 <o,f0,male> response often quite a sad emotional response but it 's part of what we do it isn 't just about nice and this is the dilemma this is the paradox of beauty sensorily we 're taking in all sorts of things mixtures of things that are good bad exciting frightening to come up with that sensorial
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 504.29 518.88 <o,f0,male> saying that beauty was about symmetry well it obviously isn 't this is a more interesting one where half faces were shown to some people and then to add them into a list of most beautiful to least beautiful and then exposing a full face and they found that it was almost exact
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 519.22 522.58 <o,f0,male> coincidence so it wasn 't about symmetry in fact
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 530.6 541.4 <o,f0,male> and as a designer i can 't help meddling with this so i pulled it to bits and sort of did stuff like this and tried to understand what the individual elements were but feeling it as i go now i can feel
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 541.4 554.82 <o,f0,male> a sensation of delight and beauty if i look at that eye i 'm not getting it off the eyebrow and the earhole isn 't doing it to me at all so i don 't know how much this is helping me but it 's helping to guide me to the places where the signals are coming off
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 555.03 562.59 <o,f0,male> and as i say i 'm not a neuroscientist but to understand how i can start to assemble things that will very quickly bypass
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 592.53 604.11 <o,f0,male> because it 's a palimpsest of things it 's masses and masses of layers this is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension it 's something much bigger layer after layer of legend
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 618.61 624.66 <o,f0,male> this bit the big secret of automotive design reflection management it 's not about the shapes
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 624.84 629.93 <o,f0,male> it 's how the shapes reflect light now that thing light flickers across it as you move
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 629.93 645.06 <o,f0,male> so it becomes a kinetic object even though it 's standing still managed by how brilliantly that 's done on the reflection this little relief on the footplate by the way to a rider means there 's something going on underneath it in this case a drive chain running at three hundred miles and hour probably
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 755.65 760.07 <o,f0,male> and only a few people can do it and a focus group cannot do it
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 760.15 768.53 <o,f0,male> and a team rarely can do it it takes a central cortex if you like to be able to orchestrate all those elements at the same time
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 769.41 777.01 <o,f0,male> this is a beautiful water bottle some of you know of it done by ross lovegrove the designer this is pretty close to intrinsic beauty this one
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 791.89 804.15 <o,f0,male> to make something that refracts light like that that comes out of the tool correctly that goes down the line without falling over underneath this like the story of the swan is a million things very difficult to do
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 837.84 843.91 <o,f0,male> the comprehension of it leads us to a greater and heightened sense of the beauty of what 's actually going on
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 895 907.74 <o,f0,male> so is that wrong well in this case it isn 't because it 's a very very ecologically sound piece of technology but you 're a slave of that first flash we are slaves to the first few
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 907.83 913.49 <o,f0,male> fractions of a second and that 's where much of my work has to win or lose on a shelf
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 974.06 980.07 <o,f0,male> the stuff that costs nothing because that knowledge is free bundle that together and where do we come out
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 980.47 987.8 <o,f0,male> form follows function only sometimes only sometimes form is
RichardSeymour_2011S 1 RichardSeymour_2011S 1004.07 1016.37 <o,f0,male> i can make them wonderful and i can make them repeatedly wonderful and you know what those products and services are because you own some of them they 're the things that you 'd snatch if the house was on fire forming the emotional bond
