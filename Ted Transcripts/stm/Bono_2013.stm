Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 16.37 28.56 <o,f0,male> anderson asked me if i could put the last twenty five years of anti poverty campaigning into ten minutes for ted that 's an englishman asking an irishman to be succinct
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 35.14 41.57 <o,f0,male> he said bono wouldn 't that be a good use of your messianic complex so
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 51.58 67.04 <o,f0,male> at least in my head the journey for justice the march against inequality and poverty really began three thousand years ago civilization just getting started on the banks of the nile some slaves jewish shepherds in this instance
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 67.04 75.25 <o,f0,male> smelling of sheep shit i guess proclaimed to the pharaoh sitting high on his throne we
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 75.34 77 <o,f0,male> your majesty ness
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 86.38 92.65 <o,f0,male> and they say no no that 's what it says here in our holy book
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 92.65 102.5 <o,f0,male> cut to our century same country same pyramids another people spreading the same idea of equality with a different book this time it 's called the facebook
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 102.5 110.77 <o,f0,male> crowds are gathered in tahrir square they turn a social network from virtual to actual and kind of rebooted the twenty first century
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 110.77 126.37 <o,f0,male> not to undersell how messy and ugly the aftermath of the arab spring has been neither to oversell the role of technology but these things have given a sense of what 's possible when the age old model of power the pyramid
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 126.37 134.5 <o,f0,male> gets turned upside down putting the people on top and the pharaohs of today on the bottom as it were it 's also shown us
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 134.54 141.04 <o,f0,male> that something as powerful as information and the sharing of it can challenge inequality because facts
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 145.88 153.66 <o,f0,male> liberty is usually around the corner even for the poorest of the poor facts that can challenge cynicism and the apathy
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 153.75 165.81 <o,f0,male> that leads to inertia facts that tell us what 's working and more importantly what 's not so we can fix it facts that if we hear them and heed them could help us meet the challenge that nelson mandela made
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 166.14 168.11 <o,f0,male> back in two thousand and five
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 168.49 175.72 <o,f0,male> when he asked us to be that great generation that overcomes that most awful offense to humanity extreme poverty
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 176.34 183.05 <o,f0,male> facts that build a powerful momentum so i thought forget the rock opera
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 183.1 184.97 <o,f0,male> forget the bombast
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 186.07 189.85 <o,f0,male> my usual tricks the only thing singing today
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 207.32 211.46 <o,f0,male> activist the factivist
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 214.34 217.48 <o,f0,male> because what the facts are telling us
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 217.9 220.69 <o,f0,male> is that the long slow journey
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 220.79 230.29 <o,f0,male> humanity 's long slow journey of equality is actually speeding up look at what 's been achieved look at the pictures these data sets print
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 230.29 244.69 <o,f0,male> since the year two thousand since the turn of the millennium there are eight million more aids patients getting life saving antiretroviral drugs malaria there are eight countries in sub saharan africa that have their death rates cut by seventy five percent
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 244.69 258.22 <o,f0,male> for kids under five child mortality kids under five it 's down by two point six five million a year that 's a rate of seven thousand two hundred and fifty six children 's lives saved each day
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 263.78 270.18 <o,f0,male> let 's just stop for a second actually and think about that have you read anything anywhere in the last week
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 304.65 310.73 <o,f0,male> this fantastic news didn 't happen by itself it was fought for it was campaigned for it was innovated for
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 311.1 313.97 <o,f0,male> and this great news gives birth
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 314.29 319.04 <o,f0,male> to even more great news because the historic trend is this
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 319.04 334.51 <o,f0,male> the number of people living in back breaking soul crushing extreme poverty has declined from forty three percent of the world 's population in one thousand nine hundred and ninety to thirty three percent by two thousand and then to twenty one
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 334.59 338.03 <o,f0,male> percent by two thousand and ten give it up for that
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 345.95 353.92 <o,f0,male> the rate is still too high still too many people unnecessarily losing their lives there 's still work to do but it 's heart stopping
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 354.68 356.82 <o,f0,male> it 's mind blowing stuff
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 357.91 359.58 <o,f0,male> and if you live
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 360.27 363.99 <o,f0,male> on less than dollar one point two five a day if you live in that kind of poverty
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 364.06 365.8 <o,f0,male> this is not just data
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 370.41 372.79 <o,f0,male> the best for your kids and
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 373.58 376.64 <o,f0,male> this rapid transition is a route out of despair
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 378.94 382.49 <o,f0,male> and into hope and guess what if the trajectory continues look
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 382.78 389.03 <o,f0,male> where the amount of people living on dollar one point two five a day gets to by two thousand and thirty
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 403.01 406.72 <o,f0,male> for number crunchers like us that is the erogenous zone
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 407.72 412.63 <o,f0,male> and it 's fair to say that i am by now sexually aroused
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 412.82 414.43 <o,f0,male> by the collating of data
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 420.16 430.26 <o,f0,male> of extreme poverty as defined by people living on less than dollar one point two five a day adjusted of course for inflation from a one thousand nine hundred and ninety baseline we do love a good
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 430.26 432.44 <o,f0,male> baseline
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 432.64 434.43 <o,f0,male> that 's amazing
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 434.43 448.12 <o,f0,male> now i know that some of you think this progress is all in asia or latin america or model countries like brazil and who doesn 't love a brazilian model but look at sub saharan africa
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 470.12 472.8 <o,f0,male> doubled education completion rates and they too
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 479.07 480.97 <o,f0,male> so the pride of lions
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 481.26 483.4 <o,f0,male> is the proof of concept
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 484.55 488.79 <o,f0,male> there are all kinds of benefits to this for a start
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 489.83 494.89 <o,f0,male> you won 't have to listen to an insufferable little jumped up jesus like myself
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 517.87 521.76 <o,f0,male> so why aren 't we jumping up and down about this well
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 522.36 530.52 <o,f0,male> the opportunity is real but so is the jeopardy we can 't get this done until we really accept that we can get this done
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 537.73 539.74 <o,f0,male> and the next one is really beautiful
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 539.94 541.97 <o,f0,male> it 's called momentum
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 543.3 547.98 <o,f0,male> and it 's how we can bend the arc of history
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 547.98 555.43 <o,f0,male> down towards zero just doing the things that we know work so inertia versus momentum there is jeopardy
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 555.43 566.21 <o,f0,male> and of course the closer you get it gets harder we know the obstacles that are in our way right now in difficult times in fact today in your capital
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 566.21 580.79 <o,f0,male> in difficult times some who mind the nation 's purse want to cut life saving programs like the global fund but you can do something about that you can tell politicians that these cuts can cost lives right now
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 580.97 595.5 <o,f0,male> today in oslo as it happens oil companies are fighting to keep secret their payments to governments for extracting oil in developing countries you can do something about that too you can join the one campaign and leaders like
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 595.63 602.57 <o,f0,male> mo ibrahim the telecom entrepreneur we 're pushing for laws that make sure that at least some
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 602.59 605.67 <o,f0,male> of the wealth under the ground ends up
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 605.67 608.12 <o,f0,male> in the hands of the people living above it
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 615.01 623.78 <o,f0,male> of all is not a disease it 's corruption but there 's a vaccine for that too it 's called transparency open data sets
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 624.81 628.44 <o,f0,male> something the ted community is really on it
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 629.21 630.99 <o,f0,male> daylight you could call it
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 631.32 639.34 <o,f0,male> transparency and technology is really turbocharging this it 's getting harder to hide if you 're doing bad stuff
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 640.18 641.84 <o,f0,male> so let me tell you about the
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 647 653.74 <o,f0,male> all across uganda young people armed with two g phones an sms social network
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 653.75 661.17 <o,f0,male> exposing government corruption and demanding to know what 's in the budget and how their money is being spent
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 661.17 664.31 <o,f0,male> this is exciting stuff
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 672.71 677.09 <o,f0,male> you can 't delete this data from your brain but you can delete
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 677.2 686.19 <o,f0,male> the cliched image of supplicant impoverished peoples not taking control of their own lives you can erase that you really can because it 's not true
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 702.39 705.05 <o,f0,male> every place with a rough semblance of governance
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 705.05 708.68 <o,f0,male> might actually be on their way
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 715.97 722.43 <o,f0,male> with this virtuous data based virus the one we call factivism it 's not going to kill you
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 724.31 726.3 <o,f0,male> countless lives
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 726.85 733.88 <o,f0,male> i guess we in the one campaign would love you to be contagious spread it share it pass it on
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 734.43 736 <o,f0,male> by doing so
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 736.78 741.96 <o,f0,male> you will join us and countless others in what i truly believe
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 742.01 745.25 <o,f0,male> is the greatest adventure ever taken the ever
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 752.28 755.28 <o,f0,male> that mandela asked us to be might we answer that
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 755.64 760.26 <o,f0,male> clarion call with science with reason with facts
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 760.88 762.41 <o,f0,male> and dare i say it
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 766.99 769.11 <o,f0,male> factivists have feelings too
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 772.89 777.15 <o,f0,male> some of you know him he set up one of the facebook groups behind the tahrir square
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 777.28 785.09 <o,f0,male> in cairo he got thrown in jail for it but i have his words tattooed on my brain
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 785.09 787.93 <o,f0,male> we are going to win
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 788.15 805.25 <o,f0,male> because we don 't understand politics we are going to win because we don 't play their dirty games we are going to win because we don 't have a party political agenda we are going to win because the tears that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts we are going to win because we have dreams
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 814.86 817.05 <o,f0,male> because the power of the people
Bono_2013 1 Bono_2013 819.02 820.67 <o,f0,male> than the people in power
