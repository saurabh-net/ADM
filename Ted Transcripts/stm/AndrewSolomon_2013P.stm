AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 13.18 16.82 <o,f0,male> in purely non religious terms
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 16.98 29.53 <o,f0,male> homosexuality represents a misuse of the sexual faculty it is a pathetic little second rate substitute for reality a pitiable flight from life
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 29.89 38.62 <o,f0,male> as such it deserves no compassion it deserves no treatment as minority martyrdom
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 38.86 44.96 <o,f0,male> and it deserves not to be deemed anything but a pernicious sickness
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 45.46 58.03 <o,f0,male> that 's from time magazine in one thousand nine hundred and sixty six when i was three years old and last year the president of the united states came out in favor of gay marriage
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 94.15 112.02 <o,f0,male> thought i 'd really rather have a blue balloon but i said that i definitely wanted the pink one and she reminded me that my favorite color was blue the fact that my favorite color now is blue but i 'm still gay
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 127.47 137.77 <o,f0,male> when i was little my mother used to say the love you have for your children is like no other feeling in the world and until you have children you don 't know what it 's like
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 137.95 152.23 <o,f0,male> and when i was little i took it as the greatest compliment in the world that she would say that about parenting my brother and me and when i was an adolescent i thought that i 'm gay and so i probably can 't have a family and when she said it it made me anxious
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 152.23 164.61 <o,f0,male> and after i came out of the closet when she continued to say it it made me furious i said i 'm gay that 's not the direction that i 'm headed in and i want you to stop saying that
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 167.22 174.64 <o,f0,male> about twenty years ago i was asked by my editors at the new york times magazine to write a piece about deaf culture
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 174.64 187.41 <o,f0,male> and i was rather taken aback i had thought of deafness entirely as an illness those poor people they couldn 't hear they lacked hearing and what could we do for them and then i went out into the deaf world i went to deaf clubs
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 187.46 202.17 <o,f0,male> i saw performances of deaf theater and of deaf poetry i even went to the miss deaf america contest in nashville tennessee where people complained about that slurry southern signing
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 205.97 225.3 <o,f0,male> and as i plunged deeper and deeper into the deaf world i become convinced that deafness was a culture and that the people in the deaf world who said we don 't lack hearing we have membership in a culture were saying something that was viable it wasn 't my culture and i didn 't particularly want to rush off and join it
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 225.33 241.51 <o,f0,male> but i appreciated that it was a culture and that for the people who were members of it it felt as valuable as latino culture or gay culture or jewish culture it felt as valid perhaps even as american culture
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 241.69 258.87 <o,f0,male> then a friend of a friend of mine had a daughter who was a dwarf and when her daughter was born she suddenly found herself confronting questions that now began to seem quite resonant to me she was facing the question of what to do with this child should she say you 're just like everyone else but a little bit shorter
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 258.87 267.46 <o,f0,male> or should she try to construct some kind of dwarf identity get involved in the little people of america become aware of what was happening for dwarfs
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 267.46 271.61 <o,f0,male> and i suddenly thought most deaf children are born to hearing parents
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 271.61 288.73 <o,f0,male> those hearing parents tend to try to cure them those deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence most gay people are born to straight parents those straight parents often want them to function in what they think of as the mainstream world and those gay people have to discover identity later on
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 288.73 293.82 <o,f0,male> and here was this friend of mine looking at these questions of identity with her dwarf daughter
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 293.82 300.7 <o,f0,male> and i thought there it is again a family that perceives itself to be normal with a child who seems to be extraordinary
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 300.7 319.97 <o,f0,male> and i hatched the idea that there are really two kinds of identity there are vertical identities which are passed down generationally from parent to child those are things like ethnicity frequently nationality language often religion those are things you have in common with your parents and with your children
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 319.97 324.4 <o,f0,male> and while some of them can be difficult there 's no attempt to cure them
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 324.4 341.26 <o,f0,male> you can argue that it 's harder in the united states our current presidency notwithstanding to be a person of color and yet we have nobody who is trying to ensure that the next generation of children born to african americans and asians come out with creamy skin and yellow hair
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 341.26 351.17 <o,f0,male> there are these other identities which you have to learn from a peer group and i call them horizontal identities because the peer group is the horizontal experience
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 351.17 364.89 <o,f0,male> these are identities that are alien to your parents and that you have to discover when you get to see them in peers and those identities those horizontal identities people have almost always tried to cure
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 364.89 373.65 <o,f0,male> and i wanted to look at what the process is through which people who have those identities come to a good relationship with them and it seemed to me
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 380.05 385.66 <o,f0,male> there 's family acceptance and there 's social acceptance and they don 't always coincide
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 385.66 393.05 <o,f0,male> and a lot of the time people who have these conditions are very angry because they feel as though their parents don 't love them
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 393.05 405.49 <o,f0,male> when what actually has happened is that their parents don 't accept them love is something that ideally is there unconditionally throughout the relationship between a parent and a child but acceptance is something that takes
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 405.49 408.34 <o,f0,male> time it always takes time
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 408.95 413.46 <o,f0,male> one of the dwarfs i got to know was a guy named clinton brown
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 413.46 418.62 <o,f0,male> when he was born he was diagnosed with diastrophic dwarfism a very disabling condition
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 418.62 428.55 <o,f0,male> and his parents were told that he would never walk he would never talk he would have no intellectual capacity and he would probably not even recognize them and it was suggested to them
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 428.55 444.1 <o,f0,male> that they leave him at the hospital so that he could die there quietly and his mother said she wasn 't going to do it and she took her son home and even though she didn 't have a lot of educational or financial advantages she found the best doctor in the country for dealing with diastrophic dwarfism
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 444.1 446.38 <o,f0,male> and she got clinton enrolled with him
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 446.38 451.27 <o,f0,male> and in the course of his childhood he had thirty major surgical procedures
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 451.27 470.23 <o,f0,male> and he spent all this time stuck in the hospital while he was having those procedures as a result of which he now can walk and while he was there they sent tutors around to help him with his school work and he worked very hard because there was nothing else to do and he ended up achieving at a level that had never before been contemplated by any member of his family
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 470.23 479.6 <o,f0,male> he was the first one in his family in fact to go to college where he lived on campus and drove a specially fitted car that accommodated his unusual body
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 479.6 490.82 <o,f0,male> and his mother told me this story of coming home one day and he went to college nearby and she said i saw that car which you can always recognize in the parking lot of a bar she said
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 510.97 514.58 <o,f0,male> would be that he 'd go drinking and driving with his college buddies
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 531.62 534.63 <o,f0,male> did i do i loved him that 's all
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 534.88 540.5 <o,f0,male> clinton just always had that light in him and his father and i were lucky enough
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 540.7 544.2 <o,f0,male> to be the first to see it there
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 544.2 552.84 <o,f0,male> i 'm going to quote from another magazine of the sixty s this one is from one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight the atlantic monthly voice of liberal america
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 553.28 571.5 <o,f0,male> written by an important bioethicist he said there is no reason to feel guilty about putting a down syndrome child away whether it is put away in the sense of hidden in a sanitarium or in a more responsible lethal sense
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 571.5 574.68 <o,f0,male> it is sad yes dreadful
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 574.89 580.9 <o,f0,male> but it carries no guilt true guilt arises only from an offense against a person
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 580.97 585.84 <o,f0,male> and a down 's is not a person
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 595.5 611.94 <o,f0,male> but we forget how we used to see people who had other differences how we used to see people who were disabled how inhuman we held people to be and the change that 's been accomplished there which is almost equally radical is one that we pay not very much attention to
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 612.17 622.86 <o,f0,male> one of the families i interviewed tom and karen robards were taken aback when as young and successful new yorkers their first child was diagnosed with down syndrome
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 622.86 637.18 <o,f0,male> they thought the educational opportunities for him were not what they should be and so they decided they would build a little center two classrooms that they started with a few other parents to educate kids with d s
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 637.18 647.13 <o,f0,male> and over the years that center grew into something called the cooke center where there are now thousands upon thousands of children with intellectual disabilities who are being taught
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 647.13 658.82 <o,f0,male> in the time since that atlantic monthly story ran the life expectancy for people with down syndrome has tripled the experience of down syndrome people includes those who are
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 658.82 665.21 <o,f0,male> those who are writers some who are able to live fully independently in adulthood
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 665.21 684.08 <o,f0,male> the robards had a lot to do with that and i said do you regret it do you wish your child didn 't have down syndrome do you wish you 'd never heard of it and interestingly his father said well for david our son i regret it because for david it 's a difficult way to be in the world and i 'd like to give david an easier life
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 684.08 689.3 <o,f0,male> but i think if we lost everyone with down syndrome it would be a catastrophic loss
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 689.39 696.45 <o,f0,male> and karen robards said to me i 'm with tom for david i would cure it in an instant to give him an easier life
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 696.61 712.36 <o,f0,male> but speaking for myself well i would never have believed twenty three years ago when he was born that i could come to such a point speaking for myself it 's made me so much better and so much kinder and so much more purposeful in my whole life that speaking
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 712.36 718.34 <o,f0,male> for myself i wouldn 't give it up for anything in the world
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 718.34 731.35 <o,f0,male> we live at a point when social acceptance for these and many other conditions is on the up and up and yet we also live at the moment when our ability to eliminate those conditions has reached a height we never imagined before
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 731.42 734.39 <o,f0,male> most deaf infants born in the united states now
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 758.13 766.6 <o,f0,male> and mice who have been given that substance and who have the achondroplasia gene grow to full size testing in humans is around the corner
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 766.7 780.89 <o,f0,male> there are blood tests which are making progress that would pick up down syndrome more clearly and earlier in pregnancies than ever before making it easier and easier for people to eliminate those pregnancies or to terminate them
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 780.9 791.64 <o,f0,male> and so we have both social progress and medical progress and i believe in both of them i believe the social progress is fantastic and meaningful and wonderful
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 799.02 815.11 <o,f0,male> and when i see the way they 're intersecting in conditions like the three i 've just described i sometimes think it 's like those moments in grand opera when the hero realizes he loves the heroine at the exact moment that she lies expiring on a divan
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 827.07 846.09 <o,f0,male> jim sinclair a prominent autism activist said when parents say i wish my child did not have autism what they 're really saying is i wish the child i have did not exist and i had a different non autistic child instead read that again
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 846.21 863.15 <o,f0,male> this is what we hear when you mourn over our existence this is what we hear when you pray for a cure that your fondest wish for us is that someday we will cease to be and strangers you can love will move in behind our faces
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 863.15 877.96 <o,f0,male> it 's a very extreme point of view but it points to the reality that people engage with the life they have and they don 't want to be cured or changed or eliminated they want to be whoever it is that they 've come to be
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 877.96 886.74 <o,f0,male> one of the families i interviewed for this project was the family of dylan klebold who was one of the perpetrators of the columbine massacre
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 886.74 904.98 <o,f0,male> it took a long time to persuade them to talk to me and once they agreed they were so full of their story that they couldn 't stop telling it and the first weekend i spent with them the first of many i recorded more than twenty hours of conversation and on sunday night we were all exhausted we were sitting in the kitchen sue klebold was fixing dinner
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 904.98 914.16 <o,f0,male> and i said if dylan were here now do you have a sense of what you 'd want to ask him and his father said i sure do i 'd want to ask him what the hell
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 914.16 922.03 <o,f0,male> thought he was doing and sue looked at the floor and she thought for a minute and then she looked back up and said
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 922.36 925.96 <o,f0,male> i would ask him to forgive me for being his mother
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 926.01 929.85 <o,f0,male> and never knowing what was going on inside his head
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 949.62 957.12 <o,f0,male> but i 've come to feel that i love the children i had so much that i don 't want to imagine a life without them
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 957.12 973.46 <o,f0,male> i recognize the pain they caused to others for which there can be no forgiveness but the pain they caused to me there is she said so while i recognize that it would have been better for the world if dylan had never been born i 've decided
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 978.32 990.82 <o,f0,male> i thought it was surprising how all of these families had all of these children with all of these problems problems that they mostly would have done anything to avoid and that they had all found so much meaning in that experience of parenting
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 990.82 1009.04 <o,f0,male> and then i thought all of us who have children love the children we have with their flaws if some glorious angel suddenly descended through my living room ceiling and offered to take away the children i have and give me other better children more polite funnier nicer smarter
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1010.18 1024.89 <o,f0,male> i would cling to the children i have and pray away that atrocious spectacle and ultimately i feel that in the same way that we test flame retardant pajamas in an inferno to ensure they won 't catch fire when our child reaches across the stove
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1024.89 1036.18 <o,f0,male> so these stories of families negotiating these extreme differences reflect on the universal experience of parenting which is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1036.18 1038.68 <o,f0,male> where did you come from
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1055.31 1074.84 <o,f0,male> there are only so many families in each of those categories but if you start to think that the experience of negotiating difference within your family is what people are addressing then you discover that it 's a nearly universal phenomenon ironically it turns out that it 's our differences and our negotiation of difference that unite us
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1074.84 1080.93 <o,f0,male> i decided to have children while i was working on this project
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1080.97 1089.19 <o,f0,male> and many people were astonished and said but how can you decide to have children in the midst of studying everything that can go wrong
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1089.4 1100.87 <o,f0,male> and i said i 'm not studying everything that can go wrong what i 'm studying is how much love there can be even when everything appears to be going wrong
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1101.22 1114.09 <o,f0,male> i thought a lot about the mother of one disabled child i had seen a severely disabled child who died through caregiver neglect and when his ashes were interred his mother said
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1114.09 1121.23 <o,f0,male> i pray here for forgiveness for having been twice robbed
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1121.35 1123.97 <o,f0,male> once of the child i wanted
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1124.1 1127.42 <o,f0,male> and once of the son i loved
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1127.42 1142.55 <o,f0,male> and i figured it was possible then for anyone to love any child if they had the effective will to do so so my husband is the biological father of two children with some lesbian friends in minneapolis
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1142.55 1152.45 <o,f0,male> i had a close friend from college who 'd gone through a divorce and wanted to have children and so she and i have a daughter and mother and daughter live in texas
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1152.46 1165.29 <o,f0,male> and my husband and i have a son who lives with us all the time of whom i am the biological father and our surrogate for the pregnancy was laura the lesbian mother of oliver and lucy in minneapolis
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1179.4 1188.06 <o,f0,male> and there are people who think that the existence of my family somehow undermines or weakens or damages their family and
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1188.06 1196.13 <o,f0,male> there are people who think that families like mine shouldn 't be allowed to exist and i don 't accept subtractive models of love
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1196.13 1212.93 <o,f0,male> only additive ones and i believe that in the same way that we need species diversity to ensure that the planet can go on so we need this diversity of affection and diversity of family in order to strengthen the ecosphere of kindness
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1212.93 1219.61 <o,f0,male> the day after our son was born the pediatrician came into the hospital room and said she was concerned
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1219.61 1232.88 <o,f0,male> he wasn 't extending his legs appropriately she said that might mean that he had brain damage in so far as he was extending them he was doing so asymmetrically which she thought could mean that there was a tumor of some kind in action
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1232.88 1237.59 <o,f0,male> and he had a very large head which she thought might indicate hydrocephalus
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1237.59 1255.47 <o,f0,male> and as she told me all of these things i felt the very center of my being pouring out onto the floor and i thought here i had been working for years on a book about how much meaning people had found in the experience of parenting children who are disabled and i didn 't want to join their number
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1255.47 1267.3 <o,f0,male> because what i was encountering was an idea of illness and like all parents since the dawn of time i wanted to protect my child from illness and i wanted also to protect myself from illness
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1267.3 1285.1 <o,f0,male> and yet i knew from the work i had done that if he had any of the things we were about to start testing for that those would ultimately be his identity and if they were his identity they would become my identity that that illness was going to take a very different shape as it unfolded
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1285.1 1290.02 <o,f0,male> we took him to the mri machine we took him to the cat scanner we took this day old child
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1290.02 1307.41 <o,f0,male> and gave him over for an arterial blood draw we felt helpless and at the end of five hours they said that his brain was completely clear and that he was by then extending his legs correctly and when i asked the pediatrician what had been going on she said she thought in the morning he had probably had a cramp
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1316.05 1331.38 <o,f0,male> i thought how my mother was right i thought the love you have for your children is unlike any other feeling in the world and until you have children you don 't know what it feels like
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1331.9 1337.19 <o,f0,male> i think children had ensnared me the moment i connected fatherhood with loss
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1337.9 1348.07 <o,f0,male> but i 'm not sure i would have noticed that if i hadn 't been so in the thick of this research project of mine i 'd encountered so much strange love
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1348.32 1353.54 <o,f0,male> and i fell very naturally into its bewitching patterns and i saw
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1358.29 1369.93 <o,f0,male> during these ten years i had witnessed and learned the terrifying joy of unbearable responsibility and i had come to see how it conquers everything else
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1369.93 1382.14 <o,f0,male> and while i had sometimes thought the parents i was interviewing were fools enslaving themselves to a lifetime 's journey with their thankless children and trying to breed identity out of misery
AndrewSolomon_2013P 1 AndrewSolomon_2013P 1382.14 1389.65 <o,f0,male> i realized that day that my research had built me a plank and that i was ready to join them on their ship
