ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 26.67 34.87 <o,f0,female> in the field of service and education and i'm not a trained academic neither am i
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 35.54 44.58 <o,f0,female> veteran social worker i was twenty six years in the corporate world trying to make organizations profitable and then in two thousand and three
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 45.17 57.37 <o,f0,female> i started parikrma humanity foundation from my kitchen table the first thing that we did was walk through the slums you know by the way there are two million people
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 58.83 65.99 <o,f0,female> in bangalore who live in eight hundred slums we couldn't go to all of the slums but we tried to
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 75.46 82.54 <o,f0,female> to the parents tried to convince them about sending their children to school we played with the children
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 82.82 92.94 <o,f0,female> and came back home really tired exhausted but with images of bright faces twinkling eyes and
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 93.43 99.93 <o,f0,female> went to sleep we were all excited to start but the numbers
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 101.63 107.57 <o,f0,female> two hundred million children between four to fourteen that should be going to school but do not
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 108.01 116.73 <o,f0,female> hundred million children who go to school but can not read one hundred and twenty five million who can not do basic
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 118.03 125.42 <o,f0,female> we also heard that two hundred and fifty billion indian rupees was dedicated for government schooling
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 137.87 148.78 <o,f0,female> one out of four teachers not going to school at all the entire academic year those numbers were absolutely mind boggling overwhelming
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 149.16 159.28 <o,f0,female> and we were constantly asked when will you start how many schools will you start how many children will you get how are you going to scale how are you going to replicate
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 159.85 168.26 <o,f0,female> it was very difficult not to get scared not to get daunted but we dug our heels and said we 're not in the number game
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 169.01 175.55 <o,f0,female> we want to take one child at a time and take the child right through school
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 176.26 183.74 <o,f0,female> to college and get them prepared for better living a high value job
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 184.56 196.05 <o,f0,female> so we started parikrma the first parikrma school started in a slum where there were seventy thousand people living below the
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 198.13 208.82 <o,f0,female> we started our first school was on a rooftop of a building inside the slums a second story building only second story building inside the slums
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 209.50 212.67 <o,f0,female> and that rooftop did not have
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 218.17 224.74 <o,f0,female> hundred and sixty five children indian academic year begins in june so june it rains so many a
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 225.06 234.68 <o,f0,female> times all of us would be huddled under the tin roof waiting for the rain to stop my god what a bonding exercise that was
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 235.73 240.21 <o,f0,female> and all of us that were under that roof are still here together
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 241.80 250.24 <o,f0,female> then came the second school the third school the fourth school and a junior college in six years now
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 250.51 260.31 <o,f0,female> we have four schools one junior college one thousand one hundred children coming from twenty eight slums and four orphanages
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 264.27 264.86 <o,f0,female> dream is

ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 272.58 280.65 <o,f0,female> but also to live peacefully contented in this conflict ridden chaotic globalized world
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 281.70 290.36 <o,f0,female> now when you talk global you have to talk english and so all our schools are english medium schools
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 290.75 299.21 <o,f0,female> but they know there is this myth that children from the slums can not speak english well no one in their family has spoken english
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 299.42 305.50 <o,f0,female> no one in their generation has spoken english but how wrong it is
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 306.27 306.55 <o,f0,male> and
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 323.29 323.54 <o,f0,female> the
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 330.74 331.29 <o,f0,female> writing
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 361.01 361.45 <o,f0,female> i
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 367.19 378.33 <o,f0,female> that girl that you saw her father sells flowers on the roadside and this little boy has been coming to school for five years but isn't it strange that little boys all

ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 390.61 396.18 <o,f0,female> you know when we started with our english medium schools we also decided to adopt the best
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 419.86 427.99 <o,f0,female> also this myth that parents from the slums are not interested in their children going to school they'd much rather
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 428.49 436.88 <o,f0,female> them to work that's absolute hogwash all parents all over the world want their children to lead a better life than themselves
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 437.51 440.97 <o,f0,female> but they need to believe that change is possible
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 478.96 488.18 <o,f0,female> we have eighty percent attendance for all our parents teachers meeting sometimes it's even one hundred percent much more than many privileged schools
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 489.41 498.71 <o,f0,female> have started to attend it's very interesting when we started our school the parents would give thumbprints in the attendance register
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 499.27 507.85 <o,f0,female> now they have started writing their signature the children have taught them it's amazing how much children can teach
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 508.82 521.03 <o,f0,female> we have a few months ago actually late last year we had a few mothers who came to us and said you know we want to learn how to read and write can you teach us so we started
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 522.24 534.21 <o,f0,female> for our parents for our mothers we had twenty five mothers who came regularly after school to study we want to continue with this program and extend it to all our other schools
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 552.93 561.70 <o,f0,female> we have to find a job for them so that they don't regress we have about three fathers who have been trained to cook
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 563.02 573.78 <o,f0,female> have taught them nutrition hygiene we have helped them set up the kitchen and now they are supplying food to all our children they do a very good job because
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 574.72 583.98 <o,f0,female> children are eating their food but most importantly this is the first time they have got respect and they feel that they are doing something worthwhile
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 584.48 597.09 <o,f0,female> more than ninety percent of our non teaching staff are all parents and extended families we've started many programs just to make sure that the child comes to school
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 614.68 620.67 <o,f0,female> one of the twenty eight children from all privilege schools best schools in the country
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 632.16 641.16 <o,f0,female> i got a lot of friends and i felt that my english has improved a lot going there and
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 668.92 669.14 <o,f0,female> now
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 680.92 681.77 <o,f0,female> of those before that
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 693.73 693.98 <o,f0,female> and
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 697.38 698.99 <o,f0,female> and i wouldn't want to go to
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 702.51 702.64 <o,f0,female> it
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 711.70 712.47 <o,f0,female> and ask me
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 720.42 726.63 <o,f0,female> this girl was working as a maid before she came to school and today she wants to be a
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 729.58 736.28 <o,f0,female> our children are doing brilliantly in sports they are really excelling there is an inter school
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 744.86 754.24 <o,f0,female> from one hundred and forty best schools in the city we've got the best school award for three years successively
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 754.64 760.66 <o,f0,female> and our children are coming back home with bag full of medals with lots of admirers and friends
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 762.18 772.75 <o,f0,female> last year there were a couple of kids from elite schools that came to ask for admissions in our school we also have our very own dream team
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 773.22 786.24 <o,f0,female> why is this happening why is this confidence is it the exposure we have professors from mit berkeley stanford indian institute of science who come and teach our children
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 786.82 798.59 <o,f0,female> lots of scientific formulas experiments much beyond the classroom art music are considered therapy and mediums of expression
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 799.47 806.48 <o,f0,female> we also believe that it's the content that is more important it is
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 808.27 816.57 <o,f0,female> not the infrastructure not the toilets not the libraries but it is what actually happens in this school that is more important
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 817.88 825.35 <o,f0,female> creating an environment of learning of inquiry of exploration is what is true education
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 825.81 833.38 <o,f0,female> when we started parikrma we had no idea which direction we were taking we didn't hire mckinsey to do a business plan
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 834.54 844.87 <o,f0,female> but we know for sure that what we want to do today is take one child at a time not get bogged with numbers
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 845.20 854.19 <o,f0,female> and actually see the child complete the circle of life and unleash his total potential
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 855.34 863.90 <o,f0,female> we do not believe in scale because we believe in quality and scale and numbers will automatically happen
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 864.21 874.37 <o,f0,female> we have corporates that have stood behind us and we are able to now open more schools but we began with the idea of one child at a time
ShuklaBose_2009I 1 ShuklaBose_2009I 874.73 881.76 <o,f0,female> this is five year old parusharam he was begging by a bus stop a few years ago
