GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 19.14 27.16 <o,f0,male> it's hard to believe that it's less than a year since the extraordinary moment when the finance the credit which drives our economies froze
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 27.97 35.63 <o,f0,male> massive cardiac arrest the effect the payback perhaps for years of vampire predators like bernie madoff whom we saw earlier
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 45.06 52.15 <o,f0,male> the whole system afloat and we're now in a very strange sort of twilight zone where no one quite knows what's worked
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 52.49 61.14 <o,f0,male> or what doesn 't we don't have any very clear maps any compass to guide us we don't know which experts to believe anymore
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 61.69 70.48 <o,f0,male> what i'm going to try and do is to give some pointers to what i think is the landscape on the other side of the crisis what things we should be looking out for
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 71.02 80.96 <o,f0,male> and how we can actually use the crisis there's a definition of leadership which says is the ability to use the smallest possible crisis for the biggest possible effect
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 81.42 95.12 <o,f0,male> and i want to talk about how we ensure that this crisis which is by no means small really is used to the full i want to start just by saying a bit about where i'm coming from i've got a very confused background which
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 104.75 114.64 <o,f0,male> i've been a civil servant and i've been in charge of policy for this guy as well but what i want to talk about begins when i was at this city this university as a student
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 115.11 127.74 <o,f0,male> and then as now it was a beautiful place of balls and punts beautiful people many of whom took to heart ronald reagan 's comment that even if they say hard work doesn't do you any harm why risk it
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 129.81 138.15 <o,f0,male> but when i was here a lot of my fellow teenagers were in a very different situation leaving school at a time then of rapidly growing
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 138.52 147.29 <o,f0,male> youth unemployment and essentially hitting a brick wall in terms of their opportunities and i spent quite a lot of time with them rather than in punts
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 148.07 160.38 <o,f0,male> and they were people who were not short of wit or grace or energy but they had no hope no jobs no prospects and when people aren't allowed to be useful they soon think that they're useless
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 160.98 168.15 <o,f0,male> that was great for the music business at the time it wasn't much good for anything else and ever since then i've wondered why it is that capitalism
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 168.40 177.26 <o,f0,male> is so amazingly efficient at some things but so inefficient at others why it's so innovative in some ways and so uninnovative in others
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 177.82 185.74 <o,f0,male> now since that time we've actually been through an extraordinary boom the longest boom ever in the history of this country
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 199.04 208.41 <o,f0,male> but i'm not saying growth is wrong but it's very striking throughout the years of growth many things didn't get better rates of depression carried on up right across
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 208.74 216.26 <o,f0,male> the western world if you look at america the proportion of americans with no one to talk to about important things went up from a tenth to a
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 217.17 225.54 <o,f0,male> we commuted longer to work but as you can see from this graph the longer you commute the less happy you're likely to be and it became ever clearer
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 225.90 232.03 <o,f0,male> that economic growth doesn't automatically translate into social growth or human growth
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 232.76 246.50 <o,f0,male> we're now at another moment when another wave of teenagers are entering a cruel job market there will be a million unemployed young people here by the end of the year thousands losing their jobs everyday in america
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 247.01 255.46 <o,f0,male> we've got to do whatever we can to help them but we've also got to ask i think a more profound question of whether we use this crisis to jump forward
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 255.73 262.86 <o,f0,male> to a different kind of economy that's more suited to human needs to a better balance of economy and society
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 278.33 287.06 <o,f0,male> and you saw that in the thirties when the great depression paved the way for bretton woods welfare states and so on
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 287.34 295.47 <o,f0,male> and i think you can see around us now some of the green shoots of a very different kind of economy and capitalism which could grow you can see it in daily life
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 295.86 305.48 <o,f0,male> when times are hard people have to do things for themselves and right across the world oxford omaha omsk you can see an extraordinary explosion of urban farming
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 315.56 329.53 <o,f0,male> a few of these this is atilla the hen and i'm a very small part of a very large movement which for some people is about survival but is also about values about a different kind of economy which isn't so much about consumption and credit
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 330.03 342.04 <o,f0,male> but about things which matter to us and everywhere too you can see a proliferation of time banks and parallel currencies people using smart technologies to link up all the resources freed up by the market
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 342.45 352.66 <o,f0,male> people buildings land and linking them to whoever has got the most compelling needs there's a similar story i think for governments ronald reagan
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 353.48 365.60 <o,f0,male> again said the two funniest sentences in the english language are i 'm from the government and i'm here to help but i think last year when governments did step in people were quite glad that they were there that they did act
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 366.12 374.32 <o,f0,male> but now a few months on however good politicians are at swallowing frogs without pulling a face as someone once put it they can't hide their uncertainty
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 387.36 400.45 <o,f0,male> how much of the money is going into concrete and boosting consumption not into solving the really profound problems we have to solve and everywhere as people think about unprecedented sums which are being spent of our money and our children 's
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 401.34 409.26 <o,f0,male> now in the depth of this crisis they're asking surely we should be using with a longer term vision to accelerate the shift to a green economy
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 409.58 418.97 <o,f0,male> to prepare for aging to deal with some of the inequalities which scar countries like this and the united states rather than just giving the money to the incumbents
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 450.18 458.82 <o,f0,male> or the many cities like san francisco putting in infrastructures for electric cars you can see a bit of the same thing happening in
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 459.85 465.82 <o,f0,male> the business world some i think some of the bankers who have appear to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 466.36 475.63 <o,f0,male> but ask yourselves what will be the biggest sectors of the economy in ten twenty thirty years time it won 't be the ones lining up for handouts like cars and aerospace and so on
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 476.18 485.21 <o,f0,male> the biggest sector by far will be health already eighteen percent of the american economy predicted to grow to thirty even forty percent by mid century
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 486.16 497.13 <o,f0,male> elder care child care already much bigger employers than cars education six seven eight percent of the economy and growing environmental services energy services the myriad of green jobs
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 497.48 504.99 <o,f0,male> they're all pointing to a very different kind of economy which isn't just about products but is using distributed networks
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 505.62 516.26 <o,f0,male> and it's founded above all on care on relationships on what people do to other people often one to one rather than simply selling them a product
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 527.97 538.02 <o,f0,male> we know our societies have to radically change we know we can't go back to where we were before the crisis but we also know it's only through experiment
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 549.60 551.43 <o,f0,male> and here 's the problem
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 551.71 558.75 <o,f0,male> in science we do experiments systematically our societies now spend two three four percent of gdp
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 559.15 567.79 <o,f0,male> to invest systematically in new discovery in science in technology to fuel the pipeline of brilliant inventions which illuminate gatherings
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 568.13 576.74 <o,f0,male> like this it's not that our scientists are necessarily much smarter than they were a hundred years ago maybe they are but they have a hell of a lot more backing than they ever did
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 583.47 592.05 <o,f0,male> no systematic experiment in the things capitalism isn't very good at like compassion or empathy or relationships or care
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 592.75 603.09 <o,f0,male> now i didn't really understand that until i met this guy who was then an eighty year old slightly shambolic man who lived on tomato soup and thought ironing was very overrated
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 603.76 611.59 <o,f0,male> he had helped shape britain 's post war institutions its welfare state its economy but sort of reinvented himself as a social entrepreneur
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 612.23 625.28 <o,f0,male> became an inventor of many many different organizations some famous ones like the open university which has one hundred and ten thousand students the university of the third age which has nearly half a million older people teaching other older people
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 625.64 635.68 <o,f0,male> as well as strange things like diy garages and language lines and schools for social entrepreneurs and he ended his life selling companies to venture capitalists
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 636.41 649.22 <o,f0,male> he believed if you see a problem you shouldn 't tell someone to act you should act on it yourself and he lived long enough and saw enough of his ideas first scorned and then succeed that he said you should always take no as a question and not as
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 651.28 659.66 <o,f0,male> and his life was a systematic experiment to find better social answers not from a theory but from experiment and experiment involving the people
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 659.89 666.48 <o,f0,male> with the best intelligence on social needs which were usually the people living with those needs and he believed we live with others
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 666.89 674.71 <o,f0,male> we share the world with others and therefore our innovation must be done with others too not doing things at people for them and so on
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 675.79 684.26 <o,f0,male> now what he did didn't used to have a name but i think it's rapidly becoming quite mainstream it's what we do in the organization
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 684.60 691.93 <o,f0,male> named after him where we try and invent create launch new ventures whether it's schools web companies health organizations and so on
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 692.55 699.34 <o,f0,male> and we find ourselves part of a very rapidly growing global movement of institutions working on social innovation
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 709.00 717.19 <o,f0,male> and not through theory and they're spreading from korea to brazil to india to the u s a and across europe
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 717.75 726.43 <o,f0,male> and they've been given new momentum by the crisis by the need for better answers to joblessness community breakdown and so on
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 726.78 733.55 <o,f0,male> some of the ideas are strange these are complaints choirs people come together to sing about the things that really bug them
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 735.55 743.86 <o,f0,male> others are much more pragmatic health coaches learning mentals job clubs and some are quite structural like social impact bonds where you raise money
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 744.01 752.55 <o,f0,male> to invest in diverting teenagers from crime or helping old people keep out of hospital and you get paid back according to how successful your projects
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 754.20 767.48 <o,f0,male> now the idea that all of this represents i think is rapidly becoming a common sense and part of how we respond to the crisis recognizing the need to invest in innovation for social progress as well as technological progress
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 785.02 796.65 <o,f0,male> what people are beginning to ask is surely just as we invest in in r and d two three four percent of our gdp of our economy what if we put let 's say one percent of public spending into social innovation
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 797.07 809.21 <o,f0,male> into elder care no kinds of education new ways of helping the disabled perhaps we'd achieve similar productivity gains in society to those we've had in the economy and in technology
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 809.92 821.46 <o,f0,male> and if a generation or two ago the big challenges were ones like getting a man on the moon perhaps the challenges we need to set ourselves now are ones like eliminating child malnutrition stopping trafficking
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 821.97 832.31 <o,f0,male> or one i think closer to home for america or europe why don't we set ourselves the goal of achieving a billion extra years of life for today 's citizens now those are all goals which could be achieved
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 832.67 841.96 <o,f0,male> within a decade but only with radical and systematic experiment not just with technologies but also with lifestyles and culture and policies
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 842.22 850.14 <o,f0,male> and institutions too now i want to end by saying a little bit about what i think this means for capitalism
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 851.22 864.06 <o,f0,male> i think what this is all about this whole movement which is growing from the margins remains quite small nothing like the resources of a cern or a darpa or an ibm or a dupont what it's telling us is that capitalism is going to become more social
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 864.45 873.30 <o,f0,male> it's already immersed in social networks it will become become more involved in social investment and social care and in industries where the value
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 873.78 880.74 <o,f0,male> comes from what you do with others not just from what you sell to them and from relationships as well as from consumption
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 881.17 890.23 <o,f0,male> but interestingly too it implies a future where society learns a few tricks from capitalism about how you embed the dna of restless continual innovation
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 890.54 896.50 <o,f0,male> into society trying things out and then growing and scaling the ones that work
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 897.16 905.22 <o,f0,male> now i think this future will be quite surprising to many people in recent years a lot of intelligent people thought that capitalism had basically
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 905.97 913.21 <o,f0,male> history was over and society would inevitably have to take second place to economy
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 913.72 921.11 <o,f0,male> but i've been struck with a parallel in how people often talk about capitalism today and how they talked about the monarchy two hundred years ago
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 921.67 933.36 <o,f0,male> just after the french revolution and the restoration of the monarchy in france then people said monarchy dominated everywhere because it was rooted in human nature we were naturally deferential we needed hierarchy
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 934.03 942.26 <o,f0,male> just as today the enthusiasts of unrestrained capitalism say it's rooted in human nature only now it's individualism inquisitiveness and so on
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 943.07 953.34 <o,f0,male> then monarchy had seen off its big challenger mass democracy which was seen as well intentioned but doomed experiment just as capitalism has seen off socialism
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 953.76 961.62 <o,f0,male> even fidel castro now says that the only thing worse than being exploited by multinational capitalism is not being exploited by multinational capitalism
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 963.10 973.21 <o,f0,male> and whereas then monarchies palaces and forts dominated every city skyline and looked permanent and confident today it's the gleaming towers of the banks which dominate every big city
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 973.65 981.60 <o,f0,male> i'm not suggesting the crowds are about to storm the barracades and string up every investment banker from the nearest lamppost though that might be quite tempting
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 982.04 993.03 <o,f0,male> but i do think we're on the verge of a period when just as happened to the monarchy and interestingly the military too the central position of finance capital is going to come to an end
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 1004.79 1014.94 <o,f0,male> and as that happens we will remember something very simple and obvious about capitalism which is that unlike what you read in economics textbooks it's not a self sufficient system
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 1015.30 1023.82 <o,f0,male> it depends on other systems on ecology on family on community and if these aren't replenished capitalism suffers too
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 1024.23 1033.38 <o,f0,male> and our human nature isn't just selfish it's also compassionate it's not just competitive it's also caring
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 1034.33 1042.09 <o,f0,male> because of the depth of the crisis i think we are at a moment of choice the crisis is almost certainly deepening around us
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 1042.44 1051.23 <o,f0,male> be worse at the end of this year quite possibly worse in a year 's time than it is today but this is one of those very rare moments when we have to choose
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 1052.09 1062.96 <o,f0,male> just pedaling furiously to get back to where we were a year or two ago and a very narrow idea of what the economy is for or whether this is a moment to jump ahead
GeoffMulgan_2009G 1 GeoffMulgan_2009G 1063.94 1069.58 <o,f0,male> to reboot and to do some of the things we probably should have been doing anyway thank you
