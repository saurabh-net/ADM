PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 13.24 14.04 <o,f0,male> hello
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 29.50 31.63 <o,f0,male> what the big wants the big being
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 31.97 42.24 <o,f0,male> the organization the system the country and what the small wants the individual the person and how do you bring those two things together charlie ledbetter yesterday
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 43.15 49.48 <o,f0,male> very articulately about this need to bring consumers to bring people into the process of creating things
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 50.10 57.93 <o,f0,male> and that's what i want to talk about today so bringing together the small to help facilitate and create the big
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 58.34 64.50 <o,f0,male> i think is something that we believe in something i believe in and something that we kind of bring to life through what we do
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 66.26 72.76 <o,f0,male> i call this first chapter for the brits in the room the blinding glimpse of the bleeding obvious often the good ideas are so
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 73.46 79.97 <o,f0,male> staring at you right in the face that you kind of miss them and i think a lot of times what we do is just sort of hold the mirror up to our clients and
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 92.46 103.47 <o,f0,male> to describe to them what their patient experience was and i think they were expecting they'd worked with lots of consultants before i think they were expecting some kind of hideous org chart with thousands of bubbles and
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 112.72 118.86 <o,f0,male> and all kinds of you know god knows whatever the first thing we actually shared with them was this
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 121.83 123.39 <o,f0,male> your eyeballs completely dissolve
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 125.69 128.74 <o,f0,male> this is fifty nine seconds into the film
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 131.45 133.29 <o,f0,male> this is a minute fifty nine
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 136.21 140.32 <o,f0,male> three minutes nineteen i think something happens i think a head may appear in a second
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 141.92 142.74 <o,f0,male> five minutes ten
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 145.54 147.03 <o,f0,male> six minutes twenty
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 147.63 152.47 <o,f0,male> we showed them the whole cut and they were all completely what is this and
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 152.93 155.71 <o,f0,male> the point is
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 158.62 166.32 <o,f0,male> when you lie in a hospital bed all day all you do is look at the roof and it's a really shitty experience
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 167.02 177.21 <o,f0,male> and just putting yourself in the position of the patient this is christian who works with us at ideo he just lay in the hospital bed and kind of stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles for a really long time
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 177.71 189.23 <o,f0,male> that's what it's like to be a patient in the hospital and they were sort you know blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious oh my goodness so looking at the situation from the point of view of the person out
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 189.74 197.06 <o,f0,male> as opposed to the traditional position of the organization in was for these guys quite a revelation and so
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 198.43 209.27 <o,f0,male> that was a really catalytic thing for them so they snapped into action they said ok it's not about systemic change it's not about huge ridiculous things that we need to do it's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 209.90 219.24 <o,f0,male> so we started with them prototyping some really little things that we could do to have a huge amount of impact the first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 219.79 227.95 <o,f0,male> and we band aided it here onto a gurney a hospital trolley so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 228.16 236.54 <o,f0,male> you could actually have a conversation with them you could kind of see them in your rear view mirror so it created a tiny human interaction very small example of something that they could do
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 238.04 246.26 <o,f0,male> nurses themselves sort of snapped into action said ok we embrace this what can we do the first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 246.88 253.13 <o,f0,male> was really i showed this to my mother recently i think my mother now thinks that i'm some sort of interior decorator it's what i do for a living sort of
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 254.48 262.68 <o,f0,male> not particularly the world 's best design solution for those of us who are real sort of hard core designers but nonetheless a fabulous empathic solution for people
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 264.47 273.57 <o,f0,male> things that they started doing themselves like changing the floor going into the patient 's room so that it signified this is my room this is my personal space
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 274.01 287.82 <o,f0,male> was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem so you went from public space to private space and another idea again that came from one of the nurses which i love was they took traditional sort of corporate white boards then they put them on one wall of the patient 's room and they put
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 289.13 294.63 <o,f0,male> so that what you could actually do was go into the room and write messages to the person who was sick
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 295.62 304.48 <o,f0,male> which was lovely so tiny tiny tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact i thought that was a really really nice
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 305.64 314.27 <o,f0,male> so this is not particularly a new idea kind of seeing opportunities in things that are around you and snapping and turning them into a solution it's a history
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 314.67 321.07 <o,f0,male> of invention based around this i'm going to read this because i want to get these names right joan ganz cooney saw her daughter
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 321.32 329.73 <o,f0,male> came down on a saturday morning saw her daughter watching the test card waiting for programs to come on one morning and from that came sesame street
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 331.89 339.24 <o,f0,male> malcolm mclean was moving from one country to another and was wondering why it took these guys so long to get the boxes onto the ship
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 353.15 353.64 <o,f0,male> and from
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 355.02 355.70 <o,f0,male> came velcro
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 357.68 365.03 <o,f0,male> and finally for the brits percy shaw this is a big british invention saw the cat 's eyes at the side of the road when he was driving home one night
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 365.89 367.57 <o,f0,male> and from that came
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 368.72 377.06 <o,f0,male> a whole series of just using your eyes seeing things for the first time seeing things afresh and using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 377.83 387.59 <o,f0,male> second one without sounding overly zen and this is a quote from the buddha finding yourself in the margins looking to the edges of things is often a really interesting place to start
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 401.57 407.75 <o,f0,male> we were asked by a device producer we did the palm pilot and the treo we did a lot of sexy tech
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 408.97 416.17 <o,f0,male> they'd seen this and they wanted a sexy piece of technology for medical diagnostics this was a device that a nurse uses when they're doing
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 416.36 424.27 <o,f0,male> a spinal procedure in hospital they'll ask the nurses to input data and they had this vision of the nurse kind of clicking away on this aluminum device and it all being incredibly
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 425.67 436.48 <o,f0,male> gadget lustish when we actually went and watched this procedure taking place and i'll explain this in a second it became very obvious that there was a human
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 456.03 464.03 <o,f0,male> was hold the patient 's hand to comfort them human gesture which made the fabulous two handed data
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 464.80 472.22 <o,f0,male> completely impossible so the thing that we designed much less sexy but much more human and practical
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 473.11 473.66 <o,f0,male> was this
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 475.13 483.35 <o,f0,male> so it's not a palm pilot by any stretch of the imagination but it has a thumb scroll so you can do everything with one hand so again going back to this the idea that
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 483.57 492.59 <o,f0,male> a tiny human gesture dictated the design of this product and i think that's really really important
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 492.71 501.46 <o,f0,male> so again this idea of workarounds we use this phrase workarounds a lot sort of looking around us i was actually looking around the ted and just watching all of these kind of things happen while i've been here
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 524.11 529.68 <o,f0,male> follow the line in the street it's a picture in a japanese subway people consciously follow things even
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 530.88 531.34 <o,f0,male> why we
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 533.16 542.67 <o,f0,male> why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence because we kind of have to we're just compelled to we don't know why but we
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 545.45 553.49 <o,f0,male> why do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle again we're sort of using the world around us to create our own design solutions
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 564.17 576.88 <o,f0,male> we sort of assume that because there's a pole in the street that it's okay to use it so we park our shopping cart there it's there for our use on some level so again we sort of co opt our environment to do all these different
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 578.27 582.05 <o,f0,male> we co opt other experiences we take one item and transfer it to another
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 610.54 619.15 <o,f0,male> third section is this idea of not knowing of consciously putting yourself backwards i talk about unthinking situations all the time
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 626.97 638.42 <o,f0,male> and he was asked by his boss to help design a storage system for children this is the billy bookcase it's ikea 's biggest selling product hammer it together hammer it together with a shoe if you're me because they're impossible to assemble
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 639.20 647.07 <o,f0,male> but big selling bookcase how do we replicate this for children the reality is when you actually watch children
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 671.34 678.20 <o,f0,male> what came out of this this is the storage system that he designed so what is this i hear you all ask no i
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 681.13 693.74 <o,f0,male> this and i think this is a particularly lovely solution so you know it's a totally different way of looking at the situation it's a completely empathic solution apart from the fact that teddy 's probably not loving it
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 697.91 708.83 <o,f0,male> a really nice way of re framing the ordinary and i think that's one of the things and putting yourself in the position of the person and i think that's one of the threads that i've heard again from
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 719.11 726.16 <o,f0,male> last section green armband we've all got them is about this really i mean it's about
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 737.69 744.91 <o,f0,male> so again we were asked to design a water pump for a company called approtec in kenya they're now called kickstart
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 746.41 756.21 <o,f0,male> and again as designers we wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful and spend a lot of time thinking of the form and that was completely irrelevant when you put yourself in the position of
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 757.07 767.29 <o,f0,male> these people things like the fact that this has to be able to fold up and fit on a bicycle become much more relevant than the form of it the way it's produced it has to be produced with indigenous
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 776.85 786.11 <o,f0,male> ourselves over to their world so what seems like a very clunky product is in fact incredibly useful it's powered a bit like a stairmaster you pump up and down on it
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 801.64 809.74 <o,f0,male> the needs of the design company the needs of the individuals in the company to feel good about a product we were actually designing and the needs of the individuals we were designing it for
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 811.70 813.61 <o,f0,male> there it is pumping water from thirty feet
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 816.79 827.50 <o,f0,male> as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets to all of you this morning we've made a donation on everybody 's behalf here to kickstart no pun intended their next project
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 828.20 839.23 <o,f0,male> because again i think sort of putting our money where our mouth is here we feel that this is an important gesture so we've handed out bracelets small is the new big i hope you'll all wear them so that's it thank you
