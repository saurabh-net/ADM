RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 56.56 65.19 <o,f0,male> but if you don't have money what happens well you are to ride a bicycle carrying your own weight and also some other weight so that you can
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 65.87 75.11 <o,f0,male> the bread for the day well poor do not remain poor they become lower middle class and if they do so then of course the conditions improve
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 75.85 82.32 <o,f0,male> and they start riding on scooters but the challenge is again they don't get much value because
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 82.50 90.48 <o,f0,male> they can't afford anything more than the scooter the issue is at that price can you give them some extra value
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 91.14 99.94 <o,f0,male> a super value in terms of their ability to ride in a car to get that dignity to get that safety looks practically impossible isn't it
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 100.85 113.10 <o,f0,male> now this is something that we see on indian streets all the time but many people see the same thing and think things differently and one of them is here
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 116.35 124.23 <o,f0,male> the great thing about our leaders is that should they not only have passion in their belly which practically all of them have
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 136.59 145.09 <o,f0,male> is absolutely true it's not just ratan tata it's the house of tatas over time let me confirm what she said yes i went
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 146.82 153.66 <o,f0,male> i was twelve i struggled to day was a huge issue and when i finished my
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 162.35 171.09 <o,f0,male> and it was tata trust which gave me six rupees per month almost a dollar per month for six years that's how i'm standing before you so that
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 203.26 211.79 <o,f0,male> of course as soon as you say something like this people say it is impossible and that's what was said by suzuki he said oh probably he is going to
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 213.29 220.76 <o,f0,male> with stepney and you can see the cartoon here well they didn't build that they built a proper car nano and
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 221.66 229.65 <o,f0,male> i'm six feet half an inch ratan is taller than me and we have ample space in the front and ample space in the back in this particular
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 230.75 239.10 <o,f0,male> and incredible car and of course nothing succeeds like success the cynics then turned around and one after the other
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 272.89 274.58 <o,f0,male> told them question
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 278.55 285.93 <o,f0,male> and at a point in time he got so engrossed in the whole challenge that he himself became a member of the team can you believe it
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 286.45 296.12 <o,f0,male> i still am told about this story of that single wiper design in which he participated until midnight he'd be thinking early morning he'll be coming back with sort of solutions
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 298.02 306.36 <o,f0,male> the team leader was girish wagh a thirty four year old boy in and the nano team average age was just twenty seven years
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 307.13 319.35 <o,f0,male> and they did innovation in design and beyond broke many norms of the standard conventions for the first time for example that a two cylinder gas engine was used in a car with a
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 324.24 327.83 <o,f0,male> huge co creation with vendors and suppliers all ideas on board
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 343.97 353.88 <o,f0,male> seeking solutions for non auto sectors it was an open innovation ideas from all over were welcome the mechanism of helicopters seats and windows was used by the way
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 354.30 362.07 <o,f0,male> as well as a dashboard that was inspired by two wheelers the fuel lines and lamps were as in two wheelers and
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 374.75 388.38 <o,f0,male> and therefore each component had to have a dual functionality and the seat riser for example serving as a mounting for the seat as well as a structural part of the functional rigidity half the number of
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 390.32 402.71 <o,f0,male> contained in nano in comparison to a typical passenger car the length is smaller by eight percent by the way but the current entry level cars in comparison to that is eight percent less but twenty one percent more inside
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 403.88 408.59 <o,f0,male> space and what happened was that
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 408.77 418.74 <o,f0,male> more from less you can see how much more for how much less when the model t was launched and this is by the way all the figures that are adjusted to two thousand and seven dollar prices
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 420.18 428.50 <o,f0,male> was nineteen thousand seven hundred by ford volkswagon was eleven thousand three hundred and thirty three and british motor was around eleven thousand
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 428.93 438.12 <o,f0,male> and nano was bang dollar two thousand this is why you started actually
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 438.21 450.90 <o,f0,male> a new paradigm shift where the same people who could not dream of sitting in a car who were carrying their entire family in a scooter started dreaming of being in a car and those dreams are getting
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 452.39 457.99 <o,f0,male> this is a photograph of a house and a driver and a car near my own home
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 461.35 466.99 <o,f0,male> nano and you can see there is a physical space that has been created for him
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 467.63 480.88 <o,f0,male> parking that car along with the owner 's car but more importantly they've created a space in their mind that yes my chauffeur is going to come in his own car and park it and that's why i call it a transformational innovation
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 481.40 486.25 <o,f0,male> it is not just technological it is social innovation
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 486.39 491.84 <o,f0,male> that we talk about and that is where ladies and gentlemen this famous
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 492.57 505.49 <o,f0,male> of getting more from less for more becomes important i remember talking about this for the first time in australia about one and a half years ago when their academy honored me with a fellowship
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 516.54 530.00 <o,f0,male> i titled this more from less for more and more people as gandhian engineering and gandhian engineering in my judgment is the one which is going to take the world forward is going to make a difference not just for a few but for everyone
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 530.36 536.03 <o,f0,male> let me move from mobility in a car to individual mobility for those unfortunates who have
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 537.52 545.15 <o,f0,male> here is an american citizen and his son having an artificial foot what is its price dollar twenty thousand
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 546.23 550.26 <o,f0,male> and of course these feet are so designed that they can walk only on such
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 562.72 568.76 <o,f0,male> more importantly they not only walk far to work and not only do they cycle to work
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 569.01 577.92 <o,f0,male> but they cycle for work as you can see here and they climb up for their work you have to design an artificial foot for such conditions
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 598.53 610.40 <o,f0,male> a quick molding and modular components enabling custom made on the spot limb fitments you could feel it actually in an hour by the way whereas the equivalent other feet took something like a day
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 611.80 623.58 <o,f0,male> socket made by using heated high density polyethylene pipes rather than using heated sheets and unique high ankle design and human like looks and functions and i like
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 625.55 627.18 <o,f0,male> how it looks and how it works
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 638.81 642.80 <o,f0,male> jumps you can see what stress it must have
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 676.58 680.02 <o,f0,male> so that's what it is all about and therefore time took notice of this
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 687.51 687.96 <o,f0,male> let 's
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 688.52 701.17 <o,f0,male> to something else i've been talking about getting more from less for more let 's move to health we've talked about mobility and the rest of it let 's talk about health what's happening in the area of health you know you have new diseases that require new drugs
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 752.59 760.07 <o,f0,male> it took around ten years and seven hundred million dollars let 's start in the spirit of more from less and more for more
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 778.05 785.63 <o,f0,male> looks absolutely ridiculous you know something this has been achieved in india these targets have been achieved in india and how
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 788.03 798.25 <o,f0,male> once said when you wish to achieve results that have not been achieved before it is an unwise fancy to think that they can be achieved by using methods that have been used before
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 815.34 821.69 <o,f0,male> from men to mice to men not molecule to mice to men you know and that is how this difference has come and you can see
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 841.17 851.67 <o,f0,male> you can see before treatment and after treatment this is really getting more from less for more and more people because these are all affordable treatments now let me just
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 871.60 880.01 <o,f0,male> and he also said i would prize every invention of science made for the benefit for all so he was giving you the message that you must have it for more and more people
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 880.36 887.47 <o,f0,male> not just a few people and therefore ladies and gentlemen this is the theme getting more from less for more
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 887.78 895.75 <o,f0,male> and mind you it is not getting just a little more for just a little less it's not about low cost it's about ultra low cost
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 938.14 946.97 <o,f0,male> it is not only getting more from less for more by more and more people the whole world working for it i was very touched when i saw a breakthrough the other day you
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 948.47 953.42 <o,f0,male> for example they're not available in africa they're not available in indian villages and infants die
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 955.74 962.22 <o,f0,male> two thousand and there's a twenty five dollar incubator giving that performance that had been created and by
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 989.76 999.66 <o,f0,male> the message the final message is this india gave a great gift to the world what was that twentieth century we gave gandhi to the world
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 1000.91 1009.75 <o,f0,male> century gift which is very very important for the whole world whether it is global economic meltdown whether it is climate change any problem that you talk about
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 1010.24 1018.73 <o,f0,male> is gaining more from less for more and more not only the current generations for the future generations and that can come only from gandhian engineering
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 1018.99 1026.94 <o,f0,male> so ladies and gentlemen i'm very happy to announce this gift of the twenty one st century to the world from india gandhian engineering
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 1036.33 1036.78 <o,f0,female> thank you
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 1052.08 1058.07 <o,f0,male> a story that drove me that transformed my life i remember i went to a poor school because
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 1058.31 1066.69 <o,f0,male> my mother could not gather the twenty one rupees that half a dollar that was required within the stipulated time it was high school
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 1067.30 1078.97 <o,f0,male> but it was a poor school with rich teachers honestly and one of them was who taught us physics one day he took us out into the sun and tried to show us how to find the focal length of
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 1080.69 1091.20 <o,f0,male> the lens was here the piece of paper was there he moved it up and down and there was a bright spot up there and then he said this is the focal length but then he held it for a little while lakshmi
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 1105.70 1112.13 <o,f0,male> me a great message focus and you can achieve i said whoa science is so wonderful i have to become a scientist
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 1112.37 1120.92 <o,f0,male> but more importantly focus and you can achieve and that message very frankly is valuable for society today what does that focal length
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 1123.15 1129.21 <o,f0,male> it has parallel lines which are sun rays and the property of parallel lines is that they never meet
RAMashelkar_2009I 1 RAMashelkar_2009I 1140.70 1146.48 <o,f0,male> so i learned the lesson of convex lens leadership from that and when i was at national
