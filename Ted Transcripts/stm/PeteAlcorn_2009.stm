PeteAlcorn_2009 1 PeteAlcorn_2009 20.88 33.55 <o,f0,male> exploding population small planet it 's going to lead to ugly things but i 'm moving past malthus because i think that we just might be about one hundred and fifty years from a kind of new enlightenment
PeteAlcorn_2009 1 PeteAlcorn_2009 52.5 63.42 <o,f0,male> most of the economic models are built around scarcity and growth so a lot of economists look at declining population and expect to see stagnation maybe depression
PeteAlcorn_2009 1 PeteAlcorn_2009 63.78 69.87 <o,f0,male> but a declining population is going to have at least two very beneficial economic effects
PeteAlcorn_2009 1 PeteAlcorn_2009 75.11 78.54 <o,f0,male> make investing in property a bad bet
PeteAlcorn_2009 1 PeteAlcorn_2009 79.4 86.64 <o,f0,male> in the cities a lot of the cost of property is actually wrapped up in its speculative value
PeteAlcorn_2009 1 PeteAlcorn_2009 86.91 89 <o,f0,male> take away land speculation
PeteAlcorn_2009 1 PeteAlcorn_2009 89.16 90.84 <o,f0,male> price of land drops
PeteAlcorn_2009 1 PeteAlcorn_2009 90.94 95.12 <o,f0,male> and that begins to lift a heavy burden off the world 's poor
PeteAlcorn_2009 1 PeteAlcorn_2009 100.15 110.25 <o,f0,male> means scarce labor scarce labor drives wages as wages increase that also lifts the burden on the poor and the working class
PeteAlcorn_2009 1 PeteAlcorn_2009 111.17 117.13 <o,f0,male> now i 'm not talking about a radical drop in population like we saw in the black death but look what happened in europe
PeteAlcorn_2009 1 PeteAlcorn_2009 117.63 120.84 <o,f0,male> after the plague rising wages
PeteAlcorn_2009 1 PeteAlcorn_2009 143.1 151.86 <o,f0,male> all of the western religions begin with the notion of eden and descend through a kind of profligate present to a very ugly future
PeteAlcorn_2009 1 PeteAlcorn_2009 152.62 168.9 <o,f0,male> so human history is viewed as sort of this downhill slide from the good old days but i think we 're in for another change about two generations after the top of that curve once the effects of a declining population start to settle in
PeteAlcorn_2009 1 PeteAlcorn_2009 169.2 175.7 <o,f0,male> at that point we 'll start romanticizing the future again instead of the nasty brutish past
PeteAlcorn_2009 1 PeteAlcorn_2009 176.44 191.34 <o,f0,male> so why does this matter why talk about social economic movements that may be more than a century away because transitions are dangerous times when land owners start to lose money and labor demands more pay
PeteAlcorn_2009 1 PeteAlcorn_2009 191.53 207.07 <o,f0,male> there are some powerful interests that are going to fear for the future fear for the future leads to some rash decisions if we have a positive view about the future then we may be able to accelerate through that turn instead of careening off a cliff
