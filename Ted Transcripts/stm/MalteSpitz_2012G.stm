MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 57.94 76.23 <o,f0,male> and with a mobile phone you can record a song load it up to soundcloud and become famous all this is possible with your mobile phone i 'm a child of one thousand nine hundred and eighty four and i live in the city of berlin
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 76.23 92.16 <o,f0,male> let 's go back to that time to this city here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people stood up and protested for change this is autumn one thousand nine
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 107.91 116.18 <o,f0,male> hold it up an android a blackberry wow that 's a lot almost everybody today has a mobile phone
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 116.18 118.82 <o,f0,male> but
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 118.82 123.73 <o,f0,male> today i will talk about me and my mobile phone and how it changed
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 123.73 126.72 <o,f0,female> my life and
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 126.72 136.12 <o,f0,male> i will talk about this these are thirty five thousand eight hundred and thirty lines of information raw data
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 136.12 142.14 <o,f0,female> and why are these informations there
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 142.14 157.74 <o,f0,male> because in the summer of two thousand and six the e u commission tabled a directive this directive is called data retention directive this directive says that each phone company in europe
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 157.74 166.18 <o,f0,male> each internet service company all over europe has to store a wide range of information about the users
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 176.79 184.63 <o,f0,male> all this information is stored for at least six months up to two years by your phone company
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 196.55 208.87 <o,f0,male> they said we don 't want this data retention we want self determination in the digital age and we don 't want that phone companies and internet companies have to store all this information about
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 225.12 229.24 <o,f0,male> and some even said this would be stasi two point
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 233.76 236.6 <o,f0,female> and
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 265.57 284.97 <o,f0,male> but then i said i want to have this information because this is my life you are protocoling so i decided to start a lawsuit against them because i wanted to have this information but deutsche telekom said no we will not give you this information
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 284.97 304.96 <o,f0,male> so at the end i had a settlement with them i 'll put down the lawsuit and they will send me all the information i ask for because in the mean time the german constitutional court ruled that the implementation of this e u directive into german law was unconstitutional
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 304.96 313.34 <o,f0,male> so i got this ugly brown envelope with a c d inside and on the c d this was on
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 313.34 317.74 <o,f0,male> thirty five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 335.58 345 <o,f0,male> so i was a little bit skeptical what should i do with it because you can see where i am where i sleep at night
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 376.52 390.18 <o,f0,male> and you can even see how i go from frankfurt by train to cologne and how often i call in between all this is possible with this information
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 398.62 400.54 <o,f0,male> it is not only about me
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 402.65 406.69 <o,f0,male> it 's about all of us first it 's only like
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 412.73 423.98 <o,f0,male> and then there are some friends calling me and they call each other and after a while you are calling you and you are calling you and you have this great communication network
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 431.9 450.16 <o,f0,male> you can see all of this you can see the hubs like who are the leaders in the group if you have access to this information you can see what your society is doing if you have access to this information you can control your society
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 452.87 458.27 <o,f0,male> this is a blueprint for countries like china and iran
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 474.56 479.39 <o,f0,female> like i said at the beginning
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 508.52 514.67 <o,f0,male> today state agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 514.67 524.04 <o,f0,male> get about us online and offline they want to have the possibility to track our lives and they want to store them for all time
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 524.04 542.25 <o,f0,male> but self determination and living in the digital age is no contradiction but you have to fight for your self determination today you have to fight for it every day
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 542.25 559.13 <o,f0,male> so when you go home tell your friends that privacy is a value of the twenty first century and it 's not outdated when you go home tell your representative only because
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 559.13 565.74 <o,f0,male> companies and state agencies have the possibility to store certain information they don 't have to do it
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 565.74 568.08 <o,f0,female> and if you
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 575.3 581.2 <o,f0,male> so in the future
MalteSpitz_2012G 1 MalteSpitz_2012G 581.2 592.55 <o,f0,male> every time you use your mobile phone let it be a reminder to you that you have to fight for self determination in the digital age thank you
