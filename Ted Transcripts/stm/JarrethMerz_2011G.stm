JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 13.46 15.52 <o,f0,male> born in switzerland
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 16.02 18.57 <o,f0,male> and raised in ghana west africa
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 30.56 37.59 <o,f0,male> but then by the end of the decade the country had fallen back into political instability and mismanagement
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 41.13 44.05 <o,f0,male> my first military coup
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 45.04 50.13 <o,f0,male> we the children had gathered at a friend 's house it was a dimly lit shack
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 59.38 61.15 <o,f0,male> and tied to the pole
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 61.72 68.22 <o,f0,male> the firing squad aimed fired the general was dead now this was being broadcast live
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 68.87 70.94 <o,f0,male> and shortly after
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 71.3 74.03 <o,f0,male> we left the country and we returned to switzerland
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 74.73 89.17 <o,f0,male> now europe came as a shock to me and i think i started feeling the need to shed my skin in order to fit in i wanted to blend in like a chameleon i think it was a tactic of survival and it worked
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 89.8 91.51 <o,f0,male> or so i believed
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 91.72 98.53 <o,f0,male> so here i was in two thousand and eight wondering where i was in my life
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 99.18 101.77 <o,f0,male> and i felt i was being typecast as an actor
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 101.86 107.69 <o,f0,male> i was always playing the exotic african i was playing the violent african
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 107.69 114.97 <o,f0,male> the african terrorist and i was thinking how many terrorists could i possibly play before turning into one myself
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 119.16 121.36 <o,f0,male> the african in me
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 123.07 139.76 <o,f0,male> and fortunately i decided in two thousand and eight to return to ghana after twenty eight years of absence i wanted to document on film the two thousand and eight presidential elections and there i started by searching for the footprints in my childhood
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 148.38 156.18 <o,f0,male> and i realized that when i 'd left the country free and fair elections in a democratic environment were a dream
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 165.21 171.74 <o,f0,male> like i was looking for my identity was what was happening in ghana a metaphor for what was happening in me
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 184.09 192.48 <o,f0,male> even though we had been trying very hard now in one thousand nine hundred and fifty seven ghana was the first sub saharan country to gain its independence
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 192.57 202.03 <o,f0,male> in the late fifty s ghana and singapore had the same gdp i mean today singapore is a first world country and ghana is not
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 202.65 205.29 <o,f0,male> but maybe it was time
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 205.39 209.38 <o,f0,male> to prove to myself yes it 's important to understand the past it is
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 209.58 215.8 <o,f0,male> important to look at it in a different light but maybe we should look at the strengths in our own culture
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 216.19 219.47 <o,f0,male> and build on those foundations in the present
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 220.15 223.87 <o,f0,male> so here i was december seventh two thousand and eight
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 225 229.5 <o,f0,male> the polling stations opened to the voters at seven zero am
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 229.86 234.29 <o,f0,male> but voters eager to take their own political fate into their hands
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 234.67 247.78 <o,f0,male> were starting to line up at four zero am in the morning and they had traveled from near they had traveled from far because they wanted to make their voices heard and i asked one of the voters i said whom are you going to vote for and he said i 'm sorry i can 't tell you
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 248.23 254.06 <o,f0,male> he said that his vote was in his heart and i understood this was their election
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 254.44 257.43 <o,f0,male> and they weren 't going to let anyone take it away from them
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 258.24 277.23 <o,f0,male> now the first round of the voting didn 't bring forth a clear winner so nobody had achieved the absolute majority so voting went into a second round three weeks later the candidates were back on the road they were campaigning the rhetoric of the candidates of course changed the heat was on and then
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 277.9 279.92 <o,f0,male> the cliche came to haunt us
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 284.12 286.57 <o,f0,male> of ballot boxes being stolen
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 287.99 290.58 <o,f0,male> inflated results started coming in
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 306.28 311.84 <o,f0,male> and my heart sank because i thought here we are again here is another proof
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 311.85 315.32 <o,f0,male> that the african is not capable of governing himself
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 315.96 321.41 <o,f0,male> and not only that i am documenting it documenting my own cultural shortcomings
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 322.21 326.59 <o,f0,male> so when the echo of the gunshots had lingered
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 327.35 331.99 <o,f0,male> it was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob and i didn 't believe what i was hearing they were chanting
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 331.99 333.73 <o,f0,male> we want peace
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 333.76 336 <o,f0,male> we want peace
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 336.67 339.07 <o,f0,male> and i realized it had to come from the people
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 349.97 353.15 <o,f0,male> the sounds of the voices were harmonious
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 359.7 369.91 <o,f0,male> it could be by the will of the masses who were now urgently pressing with all their heart and all their will for peace now here 's an interesting
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 374.77 378.19 <o,f0,male> the values the golden light of democracy
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 378.36 381.16 <o,f0,male> that we are the shining example of how it 's done
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 381.8 383.45 <o,f0,male> but when it comes down to it
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 388.08 403.98 <o,f0,male> in which the u s election stalled in the two thousand presidential elections bush versus gore but instead of the unwillingness of the candidates to allow the system to proceed and the people to decide ghana honored democracy
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 421.24 426.14 <o,f0,male> declared with the consent of the parties to run an unprecedented
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 443.1 454.12 <o,f0,male> gave up power and made way for ghana to move into a new democratic cycle i mean at the absolute time for the absolute need of democracy they did not abuse their power
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 455.8 458.54 <o,f0,male> the belief in true democracy
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 458.82 463.86 <o,f0,male> and in the people runs deep proving that the african is capable of governing himself
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 464.59 469.1 <o,f0,male> now the uphill battle for ghana and for africa is not over
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 469.83 476.86 <o,f0,male> but i have proof that the other side of democracy exists and that we must not take it for granted
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 477.7 486.64 <o,f0,male> now i have learned that my place is not just in the west or in africa and i 'm still searching for my identity
JarrethMerz_2011G 1 JarrethMerz_2011G 494.3 498.13 <o,f0,male> to look at people differently and to look at myself differently
