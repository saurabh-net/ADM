MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 16.28 18.11 <o,f0,male> the past several days
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 18.12 23.12 <o,f0,male> i heard people talking about china and also i talked to friends about china
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 23.23 30.75 <o,f0,male> and chinese internet something is very challenging to me i want to make my friends understand
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 30.75 39.42 <o,f0,male> china is complicated so i always want to tell the story like one hand it is that the other hand is that
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 39.42 58.22 <o,f0,male> you can 't just tell a one sided story i 'll give an example china is a bric country bric country means brazil russia india and china this emerging economy really is helping the revival of the world economy but at the same time
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 58.44 62.51 <o,f0,male> on the other hand china is a sick country
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 79.14 84.15 <o,f0,male> so basically china is a sick bric country
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 98.4 106.74 <o,f0,male> so if you are a fan of the game of thrones you definitely know how important a big wall is for an old kingdom
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 106.74 113.88 <o,f0,male> it prevents weird things from the north same was true for china
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 128.25 147.88 <o,f0,male> that 's the biggest digital boundary in the whole world it 's not only to defend the chinese regime from overseas from the universal values but also to prevent china 's own citizens to access the global free internet and even separate themselves into blocks not
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 147.88 151.51 <o,f0,male> united so basically the internet
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 167.15 183.02 <o,f0,male> but we also use a very simple metaphor the cat and the mouse game to describe in the past fifteen years the continuing fight between chinese censorship government censorship the cat
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 183.02 189.03 <o,f0,male> and the chinese internet users that means us the mouse
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 189.03 198.27 <o,f0,male> but sometimes this kind of a metaphor is too simple so today i want to upgrade it to two point zero version
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 198.27 214.39 <o,f0,male> in china we have five hundred million internet users that 's the biggest population of netizens internet users in the whole world so even though china 's is a totally censored internet but still chinese internet
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 237.31 245.21 <o,f0,male> every single international web two point zero service and we chinese copycat every one
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 364.66 372.9 <o,f0,male> because we have three hundred million microbloggers in china it 's the entire population of the united states
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 372.9 391.23 <o,f0,male> so when these three hundred million people microbloggers even they block the tweet in our censored platform but itself the chinanet but itself can create very powerful energy which has never happened in the chinese history
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 411.62 414.89 <o,f0,male> ten million criticisms of the posting
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 426.12 438.16 <o,f0,male> and also recently very funny debate between the beijing environment ministry and the american embassy in beijing
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 438.16 449 <o,f0,male> because the ministry blamed the american embassy for intervening in chinese internal politics by disclosing the air quality data of beijing
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 449 466.06 <o,f0,male> so the up is the embassy data the pm two point five he showed one hundred and forty eight they showed it 's dangerous for the sensitive group so a suggestion it 's not good to go outside
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 469.45 474.95 <o,f0,male> ministry 's data he shows fifty he says it 's good it 's good to go outside
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 474.95 492.69 <o,f0,male> but ninety nine percent of chinese microbloggers stand firmly on the embassy 's side i live in beijing every day i just watch the american embassy 's data to decide whether i should open my window
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 517.55 521.8 <o,f0,female> but
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 546.28 549.72 <o,f0,male> chinese is always cheating right
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 549.72 560.39 <o,f0,male> so because of this the chinese really regard this microblogging as a media not only a headline to media and also
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 560.39 569.84 <o,f0,male> the clone sina company is the guy who cloned twitter it even has its own name with weibo weibo is the chinese translation for microblog
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 569.84 586.12 <o,f0,male> it has its own innovation at the commenting area it makes the chinese weibo more like facebook rather than the original twitter so these innovations and clones as the weibo and microblogging when it came to china in two thousand
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 600.48 603.43 <o,f0,male> to exist for the chinese public
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 603.43 621.05 <o,f0,male> but also chinese social media is really changing chinese mindsets and chinese life for example they give the voiceless people a channel to make your voice heard we had a petition system it 's a remedy outside
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 621.06 639.68 <o,f0,male> the judicial system because the chinese central government wants to keep a myth the emperor is good the old local officials are thugs so that 's why the petitioner the victims the peasants want to take the train to beijing to petition to the central government they want the emperor to settle the problem
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 658.83 676.78 <o,f0,male> so your sad stories by some chance your story will be picked up by reporters professors or celebrities one of them is yao chen she is the most popular microblogger in china who has about twenty one million followers they 're almost like a
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 690.29 698.29 <o,f0,male> for three hundred million people every day chatting together talking together it 's like a big ted right
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 698.29 702.77 <o,f0,male> but also it is like the first time a public sphere
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 818.19 822.52 <o,f0,male> it is automatically recorded and data mined
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 822.9 834.45 <o,f0,male> and reported to a poll for further political analyzing even if you want to have some gathering before you go there the police are already waiting for you
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 834.45 847.75 <o,f0,male> why because they have the data they have everything in their hands so they can use the one thousand nine hundred and eighty four scenario data mining of the dissident so the crackdown is very serious
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 875.63 880.82 <o,f0,male> without bribing the central cats he can do nothing only apologize
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 880.82 895.85 <o,f0,male> so these three years in the past three years social movements about microblogging really changed local government became more and more transparent because they can 't access the data the server is in beijing
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 895.85 899.2 <o,f0,male> the story about the train crash
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 899.2 911.54 <o,f0,male> maybe the question is not about why ten million criticisms in five days but why the chinese central government allowed the five days of freedom of speech online it 's never happened before
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 941.42 950.05 <o,f0,male> but if you dare to retweet or mention any fake coup about beijing you definitely will be arrested
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 950.05 964.2 <o,f0,male> so this kind of freedom is a targeted and precise window so chinese in china censorship is normal something you find is freedom is weird something will happen behind
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 992.31 1007.71 <o,f0,male> millions of chinese people in the cultural revolution to destroy every local government it 's very simple because chinese central government doesn 't need to even lead the public opinion they just give them a target window to not censor people
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 1010.24 1015.86 <o,f0,male> a political tool so that 's the update about this game
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 1033.94 1046.07 <o,f0,male> it 's like a training of their citizenship preparing for future democracy but it didn 't change the chinese political system and also the chinese central government utilized this centralized
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 1052.23 1056.1 <o,f0,male> so what 's the future
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 1078.62 1088.86 <o,f0,male> and also like facebook and google they claim they are friends of the mouse but sometimes we see them dating the cats
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 1088.86 1101.54 <o,f0,male> so my conclusion is very simple we chinese fight for our freedom you just watch your bad cats don 't let them hook up with the chinese cats
MichaelAnti_2012G 1 MichaelAnti_2012G 1101.54 1112.92 <o,f0,male> only in this way in the future we will achieve the dreams of the mouse that we can tweet anytime anywhere without fear
