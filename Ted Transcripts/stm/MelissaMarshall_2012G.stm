MelissaMarshall_2012G 1 MelissaMarshall_2012G 28.47 48.46 <o,f0,female> and i was scared laughter really scared scared of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big unfamiliar words but as these conversations unfolded i experienced what alice must have when she went down that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world
MelissaMarshall_2012G 1 MelissaMarshall_2012G 48.46 63.01 <o,f0,female> that 's just how i felt as i had those conversations with the students i was amazed at the ideas that they had and i wanted others to experience this wonderland as well and i believe the key to opening that door is great communication
MelissaMarshall_2012G 1 MelissaMarshall_2012G 63.01 78.03 <o,f0,female> we desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grandest challenges from energy to environment to health care among others
MelissaMarshall_2012G 1 MelissaMarshall_2012G 78.03 87.02 <o,f0,female> and if we don 't know about it and understand it then the work isn 't done and i believe it 's our responsibility as non scientists to have these interactions
MelissaMarshall_2012G 1 MelissaMarshall_2012G 87.02 98.52 <o,f0,female> but these great conversations can 't occur if our scientists and engineers don 't invite us in to see their wonderland so scientists and engineers please talk nerdy to us
MelissaMarshall_2012G 1 MelissaMarshall_2012G 98.52 105.78 <o,f0,female> i want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy
MelissaMarshall_2012G 1 MelissaMarshall_2012G 105.78 108.22 <o,f0,female> and that your engineering is engaging
MelissaMarshall_2012G 1 MelissaMarshall_2012G 108.22 127.13 <o,f0,female> first question to answer for us so what tell us why your science is relevant to us don 't just tell me that you study trabeculae but tell me that you study trabeculae which is the mesh like structure of our bones because it 's important to understanding and treating osteoporosis
MelissaMarshall_2012G 1 MelissaMarshall_2012G 127.13 129.76 <o,f0,female> and when you 're describing your science
MelissaMarshall_2012G 1 MelissaMarshall_2012G 146.69 158.48 <o,f0,female> instead as einstein said make everything as simple as possible but no simpler you can clearly communicate your science without compromising the ideas
MelissaMarshall_2012G 1 MelissaMarshall_2012G 158.48 170.33 <o,f0,female> a few things to consider are having examples stories and analogies those are ways to engage and excite us about your content and when presenting your work
MelissaMarshall_2012G 1 MelissaMarshall_2012G 170.33 181.04 <o,f0,female> drop the bullet points have you ever wondered why they 're called bullet points laughter what do bullets do bullets kill and they will kill your presentation
MelissaMarshall_2012G 1 MelissaMarshall_2012G 181.04 189.21 <o,f0,female> a slide like this is not only boring but it relies too much on the language area of our brain and causes us to become overwhelmed
MelissaMarshall_2012G 1 MelissaMarshall_2012G 189.21 201.98 <o,f0,female> instead this example slide by genevieve brown is much more effective it 's showing that the special structure of trabeculae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the eiffel tower
MelissaMarshall_2012G 1 MelissaMarshall_2012G 201.98 216.59 <o,f0,female> and the trick here is to use a single readable sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what 's being described
MelissaMarshall_2012G 1 MelissaMarshall_2012G 216.59 235.95 <o,f0,female> so i think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland that is science and engineering and because the engineers that i 've worked with have taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd i want to summarize with an equation laughter take your science
MelissaMarshall_2012G 1 MelissaMarshall_2012G 235.95 239.94 <o,f0,female> subtract your bullet points and your jargon
MelissaMarshall_2012G 1 MelissaMarshall_2012G 239.94 244.02 <o,f0,female> divide by relevance meaning share what 's relevant to the audience
