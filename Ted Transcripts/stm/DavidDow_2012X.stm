DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 17.64 26.83 <o,f0,male> i was sitting at the kitchen table with my wife katya and we were talking about what i was gonna talk about today
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 27.65 32.61 <o,f0,male> we have an eleven year old son his name is lincoln he was sitting at the same table
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 32.87 34.6 <o,f0,male> doing his math homework
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 34.8 36.74 <o,f0,male> and during a pause
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 36.96 44.11 <o,f0,male> in my conversation with katya i looked over at lincoln and i was suddenly thunderstruck
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 44.8 47.76 <o,f0,male> by a recollection of a client of mine
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 48.38 50.84 <o,f0,male> my client was a guy named will
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 54.02 57.43 <o,f0,male> he was from north texas he never knew his father very well because his father
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 107.05 110.25 <o,f0,male> and i realized that when my client will
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 110.51 112.15 <o,f0,male> was his age
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 112.61 114.98 <o,f0,male> he 'd been living by himself for two years
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 116.36 123.31 <o,f0,male> will eventually joined a gang and committed a number of very serious crimes
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 123.48 126.17 <o,f0,male> including most seriously of all
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 126.88 128.74 <o,f0,male> a horrible tragic murder
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 130.57 135.92 <o,f0,male> and will was ultimately executed as punishment for that crime
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 136.91 139.57 <o,f0,male> but i don 't want to
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 140.02 149.76 <o,f0,male> talk today about the morality of capital punishment i certainly think that my client shouldn 't have been executed but what i would like to do today instead
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 155.44 159.63 <o,f0,male> in a way that is entirely noncontroversial
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 160.73 162.36 <o,f0,male> i think that 's possible
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 162.39 166.56 <o,f0,male> because there is a corner of the death penalty debate
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 166.61 168.28 <o,f0,male> maybe the most important corner
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 168.94 171.2 <o,f0,male> where everybody agrees
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 171.69 179.5 <o,f0,male> where the most ardent death penalty supporters and the most vociferous abolitionists
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 179.69 181.9 <o,f0,male> are on exactly the same page
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 182.63 184.89 <o,f0,male> that 's the corner i want to explore
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 185.14 204.31 <o,f0,male> before i do that though i want to spend a couple of minutes telling you how a death penalty case unfolds and then i want to tell you two lessons that i have learned over the last twenty years as a death penalty lawyer from watching well more than a hundred cases unfold in this way
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 220.02 228.7 <o,f0,male> and it 's followed by a trial where the murderer is convicted and sent to death row and that death sentence is ultimately upheld by the state appellate court
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 235.99 243.33 <o,f0,male> the third chapter is an even more complicated legal proceeding known as a federal habeas corpus proceeding and the fourth chapter
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 276.95 293.7 <o,f0,male> so what all of these death row inmates had to do was rely on volunteer lawyers to handle their legal proceedings than there were lawyers who had both the interest and the expertise to work on these cases
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 293.88 295.45 <o,f0,male> and so inevitably
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 305.39 315.3 <o,f0,male> some of these lawyers were successful they managed to get new trials for their clients years sometimes by months
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 315.35 324.63 <o,f0,male> but the one thing that didn 't happen annual executions in texas
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 365.06 376.64 <o,f0,male> so we have this paradox why is that
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 491.5 495.4 <o,f0,male> here 's the second thing i learned my client will
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 495.61 500.53 <o,f0,male> was not the exception to the rule he was the rule
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 508.21 510.46 <o,f0,male> i 'll write his biography for you
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 511.22 517.59 <o,f0,male> and eight out of ten times the details of that biography will be more or less accurate
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 517.91 531.9 <o,f0,male> and the reason for that is that eighty percent of the people on death row are eighty percent of the people on death row are people who had exposure to the juvenile justice system
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 532.56 534.46 <o,f0,male> that 's the second lesson
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 537.76 540.05 <o,f0,male> right on the cusp of that corner
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 540.43 542.27 <o,f0,male> where everybody 's going to agree
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 547.82 549.89 <o,f0,male> but i think everybody would agree
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 553.52 558.34 <o,f0,male> would be a story where no murder ever occurs
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 582.88 586.91 <o,f0,male> but every once in a while as dwight eisenhower said
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 587.25 590.76 <o,f0,male> the way you solve a problem is to make it bigger
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 592.64 594.91 <o,f0,male> the way we solve this problem
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 598.93 601.01 <o,f0,male> we have to say all right
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 601.3 610.18 <o,f0,male> we have these four chapters of a death penalty story but what happens before that story begins
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 610.7 614.17 <o,f0,male> how can we intervene in the life of a murderer
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 614.55 621.53 <o,f0,male> before he 's a murderer what options do we have to nudge that person
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 621.62 632.18 <o,f0,male> off of the path still think is a bad result
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 632.47 634.59 <o,f0,male> the murder of an innocent human being
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 649.77 656.38 <o,f0,male> well that 's rocket science that 's the mathematical expression for the thrust created by a rocket
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 656.92 658.98 <o,f0,male> what we 're talking about today
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 659.3 661 <o,f0,male> is just as complicated
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 661.61 664.68 <o,f0,male> what we 're talking about today is also
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 664.84 668.35 <o,f0,male> rocket science my client will
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 703.62 718.39 <o,f0,male> in his early childhood years when he was in elementary school there were a wide variety of things that society could have done in fact if we just imagine
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 746.65 749.97 <o,f0,male> that doesn 't mean that we don 't know a lot already
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 765.47 766.98 <o,f0,male> i 'll just mention a few
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 793.96 796.97 <o,f0,male> we could be providing early childhood care
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 809.06 810.91 <o,f0,male> there are other states that do that
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 832.08 840.48 <o,f0,male> there 's one other thing we can be doing well there are a bunch of other things that we could be doing there 's one other thing that we could be that i say today
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 841.37 845.03 <o,f0,male> we could be intervening much more aggressively
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 854.97 857.17 <o,f0,male> if we 're gonna do that
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 871.43 873.2 <o,f0,male> it 's not yet too late
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 873.74 876.3 <o,f0,male> there 's still time to nudge them
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 876.51 880.75 <o,f0,male> if we think about nudging them rather than just punishing them
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 943.71 945.93 <o,f0,male> is we 're paying later
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 946.51 948.4 <o,f0,male> but the thing is
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 962.77 968.61 <o,f0,male> even if you don 't agree that there 's a moral imperative that we do it
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 969.51 972.47 <o,f0,male> it just makes economic sense
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 979.74 981.65 <o,f0,male> the day that he was going to be executed
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 988.36 990.31 <o,f0,male> and we were talking about his life
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 995.49 997.19 <o,f0,male> and then about his mom
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 997.73 1000.08 <o,f0,male> who he did know who is still alive
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 1007.62 1009.4 <o,f0,male> i know that she tried to kill you
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 1012.96 1014.61 <o,f0,male> actually remember that
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 1014.7 1016.27 <o,f0,male> i said i don 't remember anything
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 1016.65 1018.47 <o,f0,male> from when i was five years old
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 1018.68 1020.94 <o,f0,male> maybe you just remember somebody telling you
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 1047.11 1048.72 <o,f0,male> he looked at me and he said
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 1049.2 1051.18 <o,f0,male> that 's something you don 't forget
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 1052.39 1054.68 <o,f0,male> i hope there 's one thing you all won 't forget
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 1074.95 1077.69 <o,f0,male> if we make the picture bigger
DavidDow_2012X 1 DavidDow_2012X 1085.95 1087.83 <o,f0,male> that begins the death penalty story
