MitchellJoachim_2010 1 MitchellJoachim_2010 16.55 24.51 <o,f0,male> grow homes because we can right now america is in an unremitting state of trauma and there's a cause for that all right we've got
MitchellJoachim_2010 1 MitchellJoachim_2010 26.74 33.94 <o,f0,male> mchouses as an architect i have to confront something like this so what's a technology that will allow us to make ginormous houses
MitchellJoachim_2010 1 MitchellJoachim_2010 34.43 43.63 <o,f0,male> well it's been around for two thousand five hundred years it's called pleaching or grafting trees together or grafting inosculate matter into one contiguous vascular system
MitchellJoachim_2010 1 MitchellJoachim_2010 44.01 55.14 <o,f0,male> and we do something different than what we did in the past we add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that we use cnc to make scaffolding to train semi epithetic matter plants into a specific geometry
MitchellJoachim_2010 1 MitchellJoachim_2010 55.43 65.77 <o,f0,male> that makes a home that we call a fab tree hab it fits into the environment it is the environment it is the landscape right and you can have a hundred million of these homes and it's great
MitchellJoachim_2010 1 MitchellJoachim_2010 66.04 76.64 <o,f0,male> because they suck carbon they're perfect you can have one hundred million families or take things out of the suburbs because these are homes that are a part of the environment imagine pre growing a village
MitchellJoachim_2010 1 MitchellJoachim_2010 77.13 84.70 <o,f0,male> takes about seven to ten years and everything is green so not only do we do the veggie house we also
MitchellJoachim_2010 1 MitchellJoachim_2010 85.67 96.38 <o,f0,male> the in vitro meat habitat or homes that we're doing research on now in brooklyn where as an architecture office for the first of its kind to put in a molecular cell biology lab
MitchellJoachim_2010 1 MitchellJoachim_2010 107.34 121.79 <o,f0,male> and what we do is we grow extracellular matrix from pigs we use a modified inkjet printer and we print geometry we print geometry where we can make industrial design objects like you know shoes leather belts handbags etc
MitchellJoachim_2010 1 MitchellJoachim_2010 122.27 130.03 <o,f0,male> where no sentient creature is harmed it's victimless it's meat from a test tube so our theory is that eventually we should be doing this with homes
MitchellJoachim_2010 1 MitchellJoachim_2010 130.30 138.81 <o,f0,male> so here is a typical stud wall an architectural construction and this is a section of our proposal for a meat house where you can see we use
MitchellJoachim_2010 1 MitchellJoachim_2010 139.24 145.15 <o,f0,male> fatty cells as insulation cilia for dealing with wind loads and sphincter muscles for the doors and windows
MitchellJoachim_2010 1 MitchellJoachim_2010 160.05 167.80 <o,f0,male> and we decided to put it in front of the cathedral so religion can confront the house of meat that's why we grow homes thanks very much
