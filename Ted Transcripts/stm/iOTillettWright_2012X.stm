iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 35.47 52.68 <o,f0,female> then we get more personal with it have you ever had any diseases have you ever been divorced does your breath smell bad while you 're answering my interrogation right now what are you into who are you into what gender do you like to sleep with i get it
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 53.36 61.64 <o,f0,female> we are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves we start forming cliques as soon as we 're old enough to know what acceptance feels like
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 62.03 69.17 <o,f0,female> we bond together based on anything that we can music preference race gender the block that we grew up on
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 70.03 74.37 <o,f0,female> we seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 75.74 83.56 <o,f0,female> sometimes though just the question what do you do can feel like somebody 's opening a tiny little box and asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it because
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 103.96 110.31 <o,f0,female> i was shielded from the pains of bigotry and the social restrictions of a religiously based upbringing
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 128.9 131.85 <o,f0,female> so when i was six i decided that i wanted to be a boy
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 141.04 144.72 <o,f0,female> i mean who knows right when you 're six maybe you can do that
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 145.66 149.09 <o,f0,female> i didn 't want anyone to know that i was a girl and they didn 't
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 149.16 154.59 <o,f0,female> i kept up the charade for eight years so
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 154.59 173.69 <o,f0,female> this is me when i was eleven i was playing a kid named walter in a movie called julian po i was a little street tough that followed christian slater around and badgered him see i was also a child actor which doubled up the layers of the performance of my identity because no one knew that i was actually a girl really playing a boy
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 194.78 199.9 <o,f0,female> at sleepovers i would have panic attacks trying to break it to girls that they didn 't want to kiss me without outing myself
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 213.71 226.69 <o,f0,female> if my family though had been the kind of people to believe in therapy they probably would have diagnosed me as something like gender dysmorphic and put me on hormones to stave off puberty but in my particular case i just woke up one day when i was fourteen and i decided that i wanted to be a girl again
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 236.16 240.26 <o,f0,female> they don 't exactly have to come out right no one is exactly shocked
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 243.73 256.63 <o,f0,female> but i wasn 't asked to define myself by my parents when i was fifteen and i called my father to tell him that i had fallen in love it was the last thing on either of our minds to discuss what the consequences were of the fact
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 258.92 260.86 <o,f0,female> three years later when i fell in love with
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 280.07 298.89 <o,f0,female> marriage equality debate was raising a lot of dust around this country and at the time getting married wasn 't really something i spent a lot of time thinking about but i was struck by the fact that america a country with such a tarnished civil rights record could be repeating its mistakes so blatantly and i remember watching the discussion on television and thinking how interesting it was that
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 299.49 307.59 <o,f0,female> the separation of church and state was essentially drawing geographical boundaries throughout this country between places where people believed in it and places where people
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 310.46 314.41 <o,f0,female> that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 314.66 318.14 <o,f0,female> if this was a war with two disparate sides
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 345.41 347.31 <o,f0,female> a tomboyish girl
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 347.66 350.39 <o,f0,female> who liked both boys and girls depending on the person
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 364.69 373.34 <o,f0,female> girls who had eyeshadow to match their scraped knees girls who liked girls and boys who all liked boys and girls who all hated being boxed in to anything
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 373.34 386.86 <o,f0,female> i loved these people and i admired their freedom but i watched as the world outside of our utopian bubble exploded into these raging debates where pundits started likening our love to bestiality on national television
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 387.44 390.31 <o,f0,female> and this powerful awareness rolled in over me that
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 390.4 392.34 <o,f0,female> i was a minority
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 405.14 407.01 <o,f0,female> i wave no flags in my own life
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 407.8 414.75 <o,f0,female> but i was plagued by this question how could anyone vote to strip the rights of the vast variety of people that i knew
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 415.05 424.71 <o,f0,female> based on one element of their character how could they say that we as a group were not deserving of equal rights as somebody else were we even a group
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 432.74 434.51 <o,f0,female> and then it occurred to me
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 435.23 440.63 <o,f0,female> perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were casting into second class citizenship
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 445.32 448.8 <o,f0,female> obviously i couldn 't get twenty million people to the same dinner party so
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 450.53 454.48 <o,f0,female> i figured out a way where i could introduce them to each other photographically
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 454.75 460.43 <o,f0,female> without any artifice without any lighting or without any manipulation of any kind on my part
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 476.84 482.95 <o,f0,female> life magazine introduced generations of people to distant far off cultures they never knew existed through pictures
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 483.68 485.43 <o,f0,female> so i decided to make
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 489.32 491.11 <o,f0,female> mugshots if you will
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 491.86 496.97 <o,f0,female> and i basically decided to photograph anyone in this country that was not one hundred percent straight
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 497.26 499.81 <o,f0,female> which if you don 't know is a limitless
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 502.33 521.19 <o,f0,female> this was a very large undertaking and to do it we needed some help so i ran out in the freezing cold and i photographed every single person that i knew that i could get to in february of about two years ago and i took those photographs and i went to the hrc and i asked them for some help
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 521.4 526.56 <o,f0,female> and they funded two weeks of shooting in new york and then we made this
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 570.04 574.9 <o,f0,female> my goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us through the simplicity of a face
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 598.96 608.81 <o,f0,female> the united states what does equality mean to you marriage freedom civil rights treat every person as you 'd treat yourself it 's when you don 't have to think about it simple as that the fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage today in twenty nine states more than half of this country you can legally be fired just for your sexuality
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 612.77 615.4 <o,f0,female> heard hundreds of people give the same answer
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 664.22 675.34 <o,f0,female> after that almost eighty five thousand people watched that video and then they started emailing us from all over the country asking us to come to their towns and help them to show their faces
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 675.58 689.93 <o,f0,female> and a lot more people wanted to show their faces than i had anticipated so i changed my immediate goal to ten thousand faces that video was made in the spring of two thousand and eleven and as of today i have traveled
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 694.56 696.71 <o,f0,female> i know that this is a talk
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 715.55 733.83 <o,f0,male> so
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 733.83 748.59 <o,f0,female> after traveling and talking to people in places like oklahoma or small town texas we found evidence that the initial premise was dead on visibility really is key familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 756.88 768.21 <o,f0,female> of course in my travels i met people who legally divorced their children for being other than straight but i also met people who were southern baptists who switched churches because their child was a lesbian
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 768.41 770.34 <o,f0,female> sparking empathy
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 770.63 773.41 <o,f0,female> had become the backbone of self evident truths but
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 776.5 782.42 <o,f0,female> self evident truths doesn 't erase the differences between us in fact on the contrary
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 783.98 791.41 <o,f0,female> it highlights them it presents not just the complexities found in a procession of different human beings but the complexities found within each individual person
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 792.03 796.31 <o,f0,female> it wasn 't that we had too many boxes it was that we had too few
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 802.83 805.18 <o,f0,female> at some point
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 805.19 815.54 <o,f0,female> i realized that my mission to photograph gays was inherently flawed because there were a million different shades of gay here i was trying to help
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 842.07 849.96 <o,f0,female> once they got over the shock though by and large people opted for somewhere between seventy to ninety five percent or the three to twenty percent marks
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 859.54 864.09 <o,f0,female> that most people fall on a spectrum of what i have come to refer to as grey
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 864.77 866.47 <o,f0,female> let me be clear though
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 866.83 872.46 <o,f0,female> and this is very important in no way am i saying that preference doesn 't exist
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 887.72 892.19 <o,f0,female> what i am saying though is that human beings are not one dimensional
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 892.92 900.74 <o,f0,female> the most important thing to take from the percentage system is this if you have gay people over here
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 900.74 914.46 <o,f0,female> and you have straight people over here and while we recognize that most people identify as somewhere closer to one binary or another there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 914.46 925.34 <o,f0,female> and the reality that this presents is a complicated one because for example if you pass a law that allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior where exactly do you draw the line
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 926.84 931.94 <o,f0,female> is it over here by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 937.13 940.07 <o,f0,female> where exactly does one become a second class citizen
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 941.4 944.79 <o,f0,female> another interesting thing that i learned
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 950.89 967.77 <o,f0,female> after traveling so much and meeting so many people let me tell you there are just as many jerks and sweethearts and democrats and republicans and jocks and queens and every other polarization you can possibly think of within the lgbt community as there are within the human race
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 967.77 973.1 <o,f0,female> aside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 973.25 981.26 <o,f0,female> and once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle just being other than straight doesn 't necessarily mean that we have anything in common
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 982.25 984.8 <o,f0,male> so
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 986.65 991.22 <o,f0,female> in the endless proliferation of faces that self evident truths is always becoming
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 991.73 1001.04 <o,f0,female> as it hopefully appears across more and more platforms bus shelters billboards facebook pages screen savers
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 1007.47 1014.78 <o,f0,female> hopefully these categories these binaries these over simplified boxes will begin to become useless
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 1014.89 1016.56 <o,f0,female> and they 'll begin to fall away
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 1016.97 1021.97 <o,f0,female> because really they describe nothing that we see and no one that we know
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 1029.7 1032.71 <o,f0,female> and seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 1037.81 1039.53 <o,f0,male> so
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 1039.53 1044.36 <o,f0,female> is it me particularly that you would choose to deny the right to housing
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 1044.53 1050.8 <o,f0,female> the right to adopt children the right to marriage the freedom to shop here live here buy here
iOTillettWright_2012X 1 iOTillettWright_2012X 1066.34 1072.7 <o,f0,female> it 's too late because i already am all of those things we already are all of those things and we always have
