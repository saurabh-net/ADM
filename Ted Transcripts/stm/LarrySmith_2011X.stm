LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 29.51 31.33 <o,f0,female> end of the day
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 53.23 55.79 <o,f0,female> those trying to have good careers are going to fail
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 56.03 59.36 <o,f0,female> because really good jobs are now disappearing
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 59.36 76.35 <o,f0,female> there are great jobs and great careers and then there are the high workload high stress bloodsucking soul destroying kinds of jobs and practically nothing in between so the people looking for good jobs are going to fail i 'm going to talk about those looking for great jobs
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 76.41 82.23 <o,f0,female> great careers and why you 're going to why you 're going to fail first reason is
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 82.23 91.56 <o,f0,female> that no matter how many times people tell you if you want a great career you have to pursue your passion you have to pursue
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 107.38 112.97 <o,f0,female> you still look at it and decide not to do it i 'm not quite sure why you decide not to do it
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 112.97 126.73 <o,f0,female> you 're too lazy to do it it 's too hard you 're afraid if you look for your passion and don 't find it you 'll feel like you 're an idiot so then you make excuses about why you 're not going to look for your passion and they are excuses ladies and gentlemen we 're going to go through a whole long list
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 140.72 157.63 <o,f0,female> well great careers are really and truly for most people just a matter of luck so i 'm going to stand around i 'm going to try to be lucky and if i 'm lucky i 'll have a great career if not i 'll have a good career but a good career is an impossibility so that 's not going to work
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 157.63 175.37 <o,f0,female> then your other excuse is yes there are special people who pursue their passions but they are geniuses they are steven j i 'm not a genius when i was five i thought i was a genius but my professors have beaten that idea out of my head long since
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 196.93 198.99 <o,f0,female> is damning yourself
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 198.99 206.96 <o,f0,female> with the faintest of praise and then of course another excuse well i would do this i would do this but but
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 207.05 209.49 <o,f0,female> well after all
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 209.69 215.23 <o,f0,female> i 'm not weird everybody knows that people who pursue their passions are somewhat obsessive
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 233.93 239.69 <o,f0,female> people don 't have passion
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 283.69 301.09 <o,f0,female> that that 's going to give you a great career when all the evidence is to the contrary so let 's assume let 's deal with those of you who are trying to find your passion you actually understand that you really had better do it never mind the excuses you 're trying to find your passion
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 303.18 305.06 <o,f0,female> and you 're so happy
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 313.51 325.12 <o,f0,female> and what what are you trying to tell me that you well i have an interest i say do you have passion i have an interest you say your interest is compared to what well i 'm interested in this
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 325.12 335.06 <o,f0,female> and what about the rest of humanity 's activities i 'm not interested in them you 've looked at them all have you no not exactly
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 335.06 338.19 <o,f0,female> passion is your greatest love
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 338.36 342.65 <o,f0,female> passion is the thing that will
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 342.65 352.42 <o,f0,female> help you create the highest expression of your talent passion interest it 's not the same thing are you really going to go to your sweetie and say marry me
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 384.27 392.26 <o,f0,female> and that 's what passion is i have a friend proposed to his sweetie he was an economically rational person
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 392.3 396.16 <o,f0,female> he said to his sweetie let us marry
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 396.49 399.07 <o,f0,female> let us merge our interests
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 417.07 425.12 <o,f0,female> i was on a german exchange program then laughter i love you more than all right she left
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 430.94 446.61 <o,f0,female> after he got over his surprise at being you know turned down he concluded he 'd had a narrow escape from marrying an irrational person although he did make a note to himself that the next time he proposed it was perhaps
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 449.82 453.02 <o,f0,female> all of the women he had auditioned for the part
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 473.49 476.58 <o,f0,female> do you know what will happen at the end of your long life
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 476.58 490.76 <o,f0,female> your friends and family will be gathered in the cemetery and there beside your gravesite will be a tombstone and inscribed on that tombstone it will say here lies a distinguished engineer who invented velcro
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 490.76 494.63 <o,f0,female> but what
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 494.65 496.37 <o,f0,female> that tombstone
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 496.37 509.35 <o,f0,female> should have said in an alternative lifetime what it should have said if it was your highest expression of talent was here lies the last nobel laureate in physics
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 509.35 517.22 <o,f0,female> who formulated the grand unified field theory and demonstrated the practicality of warp drive
LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 526.69 533.09 <o,f0,female> one was a missed opportunity but then there are some of you

LarrySmith_2011X 1 LarrySmith_2011X 573.97 590.26 <o,f0,female> human relationships more than accomplishment i want to be a great friend i want to be a great spouse i want to be a great parent and i will not sacrifice them on the altar of great accomplishment
