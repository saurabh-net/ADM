BartonSeaver_2010Z 1 BartonSeaver_2010Z 54.87 67.14 <o,f0,female> where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain restorative is the ability to replenish and progress restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean
BartonSeaver_2010Z 1 BartonSeaver_2010Z 67.39 79.47 <o,f0,female> as a resource suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency it is a more hopeful it is a more human and is a more useful way of understanding our environment
BartonSeaver_2010Z 1 BartonSeaver_2010Z 81.03 88.16 <o,f0,female> guides standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world are very handy they're a wonderful tool
BartonSeaver_2010Z 1 BartonSeaver_2010Z 88.71 95.75 <o,f0,female> green yellow and red lists seafood species the association is very easy buy green don't buy red think twice about yellow
BartonSeaver_2010Z 1 BartonSeaver_2010Z 96.51 107.15 <o,f0,female> but in my mind it's really not enough to just eat green list we can't sustain this without the measure of our success really changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red
BartonSeaver_2010Z 1 BartonSeaver_2010Z 107.93 120.05 <o,f0,female> but what if we eat only in the green list you've got pole caught yellowfin tuna here comes from sustainable stocks pole caught no bycatch great for fishermen lots of money supporting local economies

BartonSeaver_2010Z 1 BartonSeaver_2010Z 138.85 146.29 <o,f0,female> we have to have a context a gauge for our actions in all this example i've heard that red wine is great for my health
BartonSeaver_2010Z 1 BartonSeaver_2010Z 147.40 157.13 <o,f0,female> and minerals heart healthy that's great i love red wine i'm going to drink so much of it i'm going to be so healthy well how many bottles is it before you tell me that i have a problem
BartonSeaver_2010Z 1 BartonSeaver_2010Z 176.68 188.09 <o,f0,female> so the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs restorative seafood might best be represented not by jaws or by flipper or the gordon 's fisherman but rather by the jolly green giant
BartonSeaver_2010Z 1 BartonSeaver_2010Z 200.54 208.25 <o,f0,female> we must continue to eat the best seafood possible if at all but we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables
BartonSeaver_2010Z 1 BartonSeaver_2010Z 208.69 217.38 <o,f0,female> the best part about restorative seafood though is that it comes on the half shell with a bottle of tabasco and lemon wedges it comes in a five ounce portion of tilapia breaded with dijon mustard

BartonSeaver_2010Z 1 BartonSeaver_2010Z 283.83 294.33 <o,f0,female> green foods often represent a way for us to disregard the responsibility as eaters just because it comes from a green source doesn't mean we can treat it with disregard on the
BartonSeaver_2010Z 1 BartonSeaver_2010Z 296.05 305.15 <o,f0,female> we have eco friendly shrimp we can make them we have that technology but we can never have any eco friendly all you can eat shrimp buffet it doesn't work

BartonSeaver_2010Z 1 BartonSeaver_2010Z 389.02 398.62 <o,f0,female> restorative options this is what we need to favor this is what the green list says but this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment
BartonSeaver_2010Z 1 BartonSeaver_2010Z 407.23 415.38 <o,f0,female> i have a recipe for you it pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean so here we go start with a sixteen oz portion of big fish

BartonSeaver_2010Z 1 BartonSeaver_2010Z 450.48 459.67 <o,f0,female> i was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook and he taught me very early on about the privilege that eating represents i remember well the meals of my childhood they were

BartonSeaver_2010Z 1 BartonSeaver_2010Z 515.09 527.04 <o,f0,female> for community though we start at the very beginning there's no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact so try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step to minimize it
BartonSeaver_2010Z 1 BartonSeaver_2010Z 540.61 549.04 <o,f0,female> so if we all take only what we need then we can begin to share the rest we can begin to celebrate we can begin to restore
