PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 15.01 29.39 <o,f0,male> i am known best for human powered flight but that was just one thing that got me going in the sort of things that i'm working in now as a
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 31.41 38.09 <o,f0,male> youngster i was very interested in model airplanes ornithopters autogyros helicopters gliders
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 40.40 47.52 <o,f0,male> planes indoor models outdoor models everything which i just thought was a lot of fun and
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 48.60 57.23 <o,f0,male> wondered why most other people didn't share my same enthusiasm with them and then navy pilot
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 57.99 65.74 <o,f0,male> training and after college i got into sail plane flying power plane flying and
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 67.24 77.57 <o,f0,male> considered the sail planes as a sort of hobby and fun but got tangled up with some great professor types who
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 84.71 89.30 <o,f0,male> really deep science while this was all going on i was
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 91.24 93.78 <o,f0,male> field of weather modification although getting
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 95.04 108.97 <o,f0,male> in aeronautics the weather modification subject was getting started and as a graduate student i could go around to the various talks that were being given on a hitchhiker ride to the east coast and
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 109.62 120.92 <o,f0,male> so on and everybody would talk to me but all the professionals in the field hated each other and they wouldn't communicate and as a result i got the absolutely unique background in that
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 121.89 133.45 <o,f0,male> field and started a company which did more research in weather modification than anybody and there are a lot of things that
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 141.20 149.58 <o,f0,male> with no employees then one or two three and sort of fumbled along on trying to get interesting projects we had
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 151.29 161.92 <o,f0,male> who like i did not want to work for aerospace companies on some big many year project and
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 162.43 167.53 <o,f0,male> so we did our small projects and the company slowly grew
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 223.29 231.27 <o,f0,male> the way i approached it first thinking about ways to make the planes was just like they'd been doing in england
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 231.90 242.14 <o,f0,male> and not succeeding and i gave it up i figured nah there isn't any simple easy way but then got off on a vacation trip and was studying bird
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 242.57 244.90 <o,f0,male> flight just for the fun of it
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 246.32 248.90 <o,f0,male> you can watch a bird soaring around in circles
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 249.66 262.78 <o,f0,male> and measure the time and estimate the bank angle and immediately figure out its speed and the turning radius and so on which i could do in the car as we driving along
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 265.29 267.99 <o,f0,male> my three sons young sons
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 269.35 278.68 <o,f0,male> helping me but ridiculing the whole thing very much the but that began thinking about how birds went around
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 279.56 281.77 <o,f0,male> and then how airplanes
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 284.71 290.63 <o,f0,male> would fly and then other planes and the idea of the gossamer
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 291.45 300.24 <o,f0,male> type airplane quickly emerged was so logical one should have thought of it in the first place but one didn 't and it was just keep the weight down
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 301.42 305.42 <o,f0,male> seventy lbs was all it weighed but let the size swell up
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 307.07 316.86 <o,f0,male> but three times the span three times the cord you're down to a third of the speed a third of the power and a good bicyclist can put out that power
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 319.45 327.76 <o,f0,male> worked and we won the prize a year later we didn't a lot of flying
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 328.01 337.82 <o,f0,male> a lot of experiments a lot of things that didn't work and ones that did work and the plane kept getting a little better a little better got a good pilot brian allen to
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 357.77 368.30 <o,f0,male> put up a new prize for flying the english channel twenty one miles and he thought it would take another eighteen years for somebody to win that we realized that if you just cleaned up our
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 368.92 381.51 <o,f0,male> gossamer condor a little bit the power to fly would be decreased a little bit and if you decrease the power required a little the pilot can fly a much longer period of time
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 381.81 389.34 <o,f0,male> and brian allen was able in a miraculous flight to get the gossamer albatross across the english channel
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 404.52 409.52 <o,f0,male> it turned out that giving the planes to the museum was worth much more
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 412.91 413.85 <o,f0,male> for five years
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 414.29 417.86 <o,f0,male> six years i only had to pay one third income tax
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 418.86 423.50 <o,f0,male> so there were good economic reasons for the project but
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 429.57 434.22 <o,f0,male> the project was done entirely for economic reasons and we have not been
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 440.22 444.07 <o,f0,male> because the prizes are all over but
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 451.54 459.33 <o,f0,male> solar powered plane because we felt solar power was going to be so important for the country and the world we didn't want the
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 460.36 466.77 <o,f0,male> small funding in the government to be decreased which is what the government was trying to do with it and we thought
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 467.46 474.55 <o,f0,male> a solar powered plane wouldn 't really make sense but you could do it and it would get a lot of publicity for solar power and maybe help
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 475.42 485.05 <o,f0,male> field and that project continued did succeed and we then got into other
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 508.84 519.38 <o,f0,male> which collected all my varied thoughts and varied interests over the years this was the one chance that i had to focus on what i really was after and what was
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 520.22 531.78 <o,f0,male> and to my surprise i realized the importance of environmental issues which charles lindbergh devoted the last third of his life to
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 532.89 535.06 <o,f0,male> and preparing that paper
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 537.32 549.82 <o,f0,male> a lot of good i thought back about if i was a space traveler and came and visited earth every five thousand years and for a few thousand visits i would see the same thing
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 550.65 558.61 <o,f0,male> every time the little differences in the earth but this last time just coming round right now suddenly
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 558.77 566.57 <o,f0,male> there'd be huge changes in the environment in the concentration of people and it was just
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 569.26 571.25 <o,f0,male> unbelievable the amount of
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 572.66 579.75 <o,f0,male> all the change in it i wanted to well
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 580.60 593.99 <o,f0,male> the biggest changes is two hundred years ago we began using coal from underground which has a lot of pollution and one hundred years ago began getting gasoline from underground with a lot of pollution and
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 595.13 608.63 <o,f0,male> gasoline consumption or production will reach its limit in about ten years and then go down and we wonder what's going to happen with transportation
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 609.72 621.02 <o,f0,male> i wanted to show the slide this slide i think is the most important one any of you will see ever
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 639.42 650.84 <o,f0,male> air and land vertebrates humans and muskrats and giraffes and birds and so on are the red line goes up that's the humans and livestock
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 658.23 665.99 <o,f0,male> pets are now ninety eight percent of the total world 's mass of vertebrates on land and air
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 666.71 674.91 <o,f0,male> and you don't know what the future will hold but it's not going to get a lower percentage ten thousand years ago
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 675.18 683.74 <o,f0,male> the humans and livestock and pets were not even one tenth of one percent and wouldn't even have been visible on such a curve now
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 684.76 688.90 <o,f0,male> are ninety eight percent and it is
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 706.02 718.32 <o,f0,male> and so on then i ask them questions what's the population of the earth what's the population of the earth going to be when you're the age of your parents which i'd never really they had never really thought about but now they think about it and
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 720.16 721.77 <o,f0,male> what population of the earth
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 733.38 744.22 <o,f0,male> all fighting with each other and when i leave two hours later most of them are saying about two billion people and they don't have any clue about how to get down to two
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 745.17 747.65 <o,f0,male> nor do i but i think they're right
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 748.52 750.98 <o,f0,male> this is a serious
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 754.51 762.41 <o,f0,male> carson was thinking of these and came out with silent spring way back solar manifesto by
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 762.74 775.30 <o,f0,male> hermann scheer in germany claims all energy on earth can be derived for every country from solar energy and water
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 776.93 784.07 <o,f0,male> and so on you don't need to dig down for these chemicals and we
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 787.04 791.81 <o,f0,male> so this just summarizes it over billions of years on a unique sphere chance has painted a thin
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 800.23 809.49 <o,f0,male> to the checks and balances inherent in nature have grown in population technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power we now wield the paintbrush
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 809.88 821.47 <o,f0,male> in charge it's frightening and i do a painting every twenty or twenty five years this is the last one and shows the earth
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 833.68 841.48 <o,f0,male> on i have no idea of what comes next so i just used robotic and natural cockroaches as the
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 842.09 856.15 <o,f0,male> future as sort of a little warning and two weeks after this drawing was done we actually had our first project contract at aerovironment on robotic cockroaches which was very frightening to me
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 862.34 869.80 <o,f0,male> all the slides we as time went on we
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 870.37 879.64 <o,f0,male> our environmental programs we focused more on the really serious energy problems of the future and we produced products
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 881.89 892.10 <o,f0,male> for the company and we developed the impact car that general motors made the ev one out of and
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 894.63 903.01 <o,f0,male> got the air resources board to have the regulations that stimulated the electric cars but they've since come apart and
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 904.38 905.74 <o,f0,male> we've done a lot of
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 906.84 911.32 <o,f0,male> things small drone airplanes and so on i have a
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 913.99 916.51 <o,f0,male> have the first video
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 954.55 957.58 <o,f0,male> the process of turning her back to the sun to maximize the
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 968.08 977.60 <o,f0,male> as the sky gets darker and the outside air temperatures drop below minus one hundred degrees fahrenheit the most environmentally hostile segment of helios 's journey
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 977.92 985.41 <o,f0,male> has gone by without notice except for being recorded by specially designed data acquisition systems and their associated sensors
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 997.71 1004.27 <o,f0,male> this is more than ten thousand feet higher than the previous world 's altitude record held by the sr seventy one blackbird
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 1013.64 1018.05 <o,f0,male> plane has many purposes but it's aimed for communications
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 1018.32 1026.14 <o,f0,male> and it can fly so slowly that it'll just stay up at sixty five thousand feet eventually
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 1026.38 1035.63 <o,f0,male> it will be able to have to stay up day night day night for six months at a time acting like the synchronous satellite but only ten miles above the earth let 's have the next video
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 1055.35 1058.52 <o,f0,male> it sends high resolution video pictures back to the operator
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 1059.03 1062.41 <o,f0,male> with on board gps it can navigate autonomously
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 1062.82 1064.45 <o,f0,male> and it is rugged enough to self
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 1066.94 1067.51 <o,f0,male> okay
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 1073.20 1079.44 <o,f0,male> plane is widely used by the military now in all their operations let 's have the next video
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 1104.44 1107.91 <o,f0,male> two brothers helped build the gossamer condor twenty five years
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 1109.67 1115.69 <o,f0,male> like this for hours aa when they got bored with their father 's project they invented an extraordinary
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 1116.74 1123.56 <o,f0,male> i can control it by putting the lift on one side of the wing or on the other aa they called it their walk along glider
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 1124.97 1126.36 <o,f0,male> i've never seen anything like that
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 1126.63 1129.35 <o,f0,male> how old were you when you invented that tm oh
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 1164.07 1170.23 <o,f0,male> as the wind comes up it has to go over the cliff so as you walk through the air it goes around your body some has to go over you
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 1181.53 1181.90 <o,f0,male> and you can
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 1185.30 1185.91 <o,f0,male> and then
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 1194.49 1201.30 <o,f0,male> so i can do it oops that was going to be a right turn okay this one will be a left
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 1222.22 1225.36 <o,f0,male> and this we just wanted to show you a
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 1226.56 1229.55 <o,f0,male> if we can get the video running on this yeah just an example
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 1231.56 1234.03 <o,f0,male> of video a little video surveillance
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 1236.46 1238.86 <o,f0,male> this was flying around in the party last night
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 1239.84 1240.68 <o,f0,male> and
PaulMacCready_2003 1 PaulMacCready_2003 1244.46 1246.96 <o,f0,male> can fly around and you can spy on anybody you want
