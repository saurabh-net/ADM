YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 89.9 97.45 <o,f0,female> that eighty thousand live audience sang together that was hilarious
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 109.55 119.66 <o,f0,female> yet their courage and talent brought them through and a show and a platform gave them the stage to realize their dreams
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 119.7 136.38 <o,f0,female> well being different is not that difficult we are all different from different perspectives but i think being different is good because you present a different point of view you may have the chance to make a difference
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 136.38 148.61 <o,f0,female> my generation has been very fortunate to witness and participate in the historic transformation of china that has made so many changes in the past twenty thirty years
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 161.72 172.71 <o,f0,female> so after being interrogated by this japanese manager for a half an hour he finally said so miss yang do you have any questions to ask me
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 172.89 180.66 <o,f0,female> i summoned my courage and poise and said yes but could you let me know what actually do you sell
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 181.17 190.01 <o,f0,female> i didn 't have a clue what a sales department was about in a five star hotel that was the first day i set my foot in a five star hotel
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 190.01 208.66 <o,f0,female> around the same time i was going through an audition the first ever open audition by national television in china with another thousand college girls the producer told us they were looking for some sweet innocent and beautiful fresh face
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 208.66 220.72 <o,f0,female> so when it was my turn i stood up and said why do women 's personalities on television always have to be beautiful sweet innocent and you know supportive
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 229.04 241.81 <o,f0,female> offended them but actually they were impressed by my words and so i was in the second round of competition and then the third and the fourth after seven rounds of competition i was the last one to survive it
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 257.17 261.49 <o,f0,female> and
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 261.61 266.93 <o,f0,female> weekly audience at that time was between two hundred to three hundred million people
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 292.71 310.92 <o,f0,female> but then we are also so fortunate to witness the transformation of the whole country i was in beijing 's bidding for the olympic games i was representing the shanghai expo i saw china embracing the world and vice versa but then sometimes i 'm thinking what
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 323.14 331.62 <o,f0,female> so today i want to talk about young people through the platform of social media first of all who are they what do they look like
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 350.87 361.53 <o,f0,female> she didn 't realize that she stepped on a sensitive nerve and aroused national questioning almost a turmoil against the credibility of red cross
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 372.92 377.21 <o,f0,female> as of today we know that she herself made up that title
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 377.4 393.96 <o,f0,female> probably because she feels proud to be associated with charity all those expensive items were given to her as gifts by her boyfriend who used to be a board member in a subdivision of red cross at chamber of commerce it 's very complicated to explain
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 399.99 408.7 <o,f0,female> it shows us a general mistrust of government or government backed institutions which lacked transparency in the past
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 408.85 414.75 <o,f0,female> and also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as microblog
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 435.23 447.42 <o,f0,female> it 's a movie star and she has more than nine point five million followers or fans about eighty percent of those microbloggers are young people under thirty years
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 454.79 457.04 <o,f0,female> to let the steam out a little bit
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 457.05 465.01 <o,f0,female> but because you don 't have many other openings the heat coming out of this opening is sometimes very strong
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 465.28 472.12 <o,f0,female> active and even violent so through microblogging we are able to understand chinese youth even better
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 472.76 490.3 <o,f0,female> so how are they different first of all most of them were born in the eighty s and ninety s under the one child policy and because of selected abortion by families who favored boys to girls now we have ended up with thirty million more young men than women
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 490.67 503.12 <o,f0,female> that could pose a potential danger to the society but who knows we 're in a globalized world so they can look for girlfriends from other countries
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 511.07 522.44 <o,f0,female> in cities eighty percent of kids go to college but they are facing an aging china with a population above sixty five years old coming up with
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 522.44 534.83 <o,f0,female> seven point some percent this year and about to be fifteen percent by the year of two thousand and thirty and you know we have the tradition that younger generations support the elders financially and taking care of them when they 're sick
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 534.83 538.75 <o,f0,female> so it means young couples will have to support four parents
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 543.86 561.71 <o,f0,female> so making a living is not that easy for young people college graduates are not in short supply in urban areas college graduates find the starting salary is about four hundred u s dollars a month while the average rent is above dollar five hundred so what do they do
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 570.78 576.45 <o,f0,female> and for those who are ready to get married and buy their apartment they figured out they have to
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 576.49 580.09 <o,f0,female> for thirty to forty years to afford their first apartment
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 580.42 591.04 <o,f0,female> that ratio in america would only cost a couple five years to earn but in china it 's thirty to forty years with the skyrocketing real estate price
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 591.05 606.43 <o,f0,female> among the two hundred million migrant workers sixty percent of them are young people they find themselves sort of sandwiched between the urban areas and the rural areas most of them don 't want to go back to the countryside but they don 't
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 618.91 628.39 <o,f0,female> tightening loans from banks appreciation of the renminbi or decline of demand from europe or america for the products they produce
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 628.6 635.9 <o,f0,female> last year though an appalling incident in a southern oem manufacturing compound in china
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 635.9 643.27 <o,f0,female> thirteen young workers in their late teens and early twenty s committed suicide just one by one like causing
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 643.27 657.02 <o,f0,female> a contagious disease but they died because of all different personal reasons but this whole incident aroused a huge outcry from society about the isolation both physical and mental
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 657.02 660.71 <o,f0,female> of these migrant workers for those who do return
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 660.71 667.31 <o,f0,female> back to the countryside they find themselves very welcome locally because with the knowledge skills and networks
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 667.31 683.64 <o,f0,female> they have learned in the cities with the assistance of the internet they 're able to create more jobs upgrade local agriculture and create new business in the less developed market so for the past few years the coastal areas they found themselves in a shortage of labor
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 684.44 694.19 <o,f0,female> these diagrams show a more general social background the first one is the engels coefficient which explains that the cost of daily necessities
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 694.19 709.14 <o,f0,female> has dropped its percentage all through the past decade in terms of family income to about thirty seven some percent but then in the last two years it goes up again to thirty nine percent indicating a rising living cost
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 709.14 711.48 <o,f0,female> the gini coefficient
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 729.93 746.35 <o,f0,female> and also the bitterness and even resentment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread so any accusations of corruption or backdoor dealings between authorities or business would arouse a social outcry or even unrest
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 746.35 753.37 <o,f0,female> so through some of the hottest topics on microblogging we can see what young people care most about
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 753.74 771.19 <o,f0,female> social justice and government accountability runs the first in what they demand for the past decade or so a massive urbanization and development have let us witness a lot of reports on the forced demolition of private property
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 804.58 816.77 <o,f0,female> similarly many other issues concerning public safety is a hot topic on the internet we heard about polluted air polluted water poisoned food
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 816.81 819.86 <o,f0,female> and guess what we have faked beef
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 819.93 827.78 <o,f0,female> they have sorts of ingredients that you brush on a piece of chicken or fish and it turns it to look like beef and
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 838.97 853.34 <o,f0,female> so all these things have aroused a huge outcry from the internet and fortunately we have seen the government responding more timely and also more frequently to the public concerns
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 924.86 935.47 <o,f0,female> and also people are doing good through social media and the first picture showed us that a truck caging five hundred homeless and kidnapped dogs for food processing
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 949.93 968.88 <o,f0,female> five hundred dogs were rescued and here also people are helping to find missing children a father posted his son 's picture onto the internet after thousands of resends in relay the child was found and we witnessed the reunion of the family through microblogging
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 969.06 976.26 <o,f0,female> so happiness is the most popular word we have heard through the past two years
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 976.26 991.34 <o,f0,female> happiness is not only related to personal experiences and personal values but also it 's about the environment people are thinking about the following questions are we going to sacrifice our environment further to produce higher gdp
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 991.64 1000.45 <o,f0,female> how are we going to perform our social and political reform to keep pace with economic growth to keep sustainability and stability
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 1000.45 1007.73 <o,f0,female> and also how capable is the system of self correctness to keep more people content
YangLan_2011G 1 YangLan_2011G 1007.73 1022.45 <o,f0,female> with all sorts of friction going on at the same time i guess these are the questions people are going to answer and our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves
