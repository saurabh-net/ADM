CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 402.52 411.56 <o,f0,female> well the only way i can articulate how it felt was that it precipitated my medical decline against my
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 420.77 431.63 <o,f0,female> but soon i was showing signs of right heart failure and i had to return to sea level doing so knowing that i probably would never see my home again
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 433.13 441.46 <o,f0,female> i canceled most of my engagements that summer but i had one left in tel aviv so i went after one performance
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 441.67 454.47 <o,f0,female> i could barely drag myself from the stage to the taxicab i sat down and felt the blood rush down from my face and in the heat of the desert i was
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 455.03 463.02 <o,f0,female> freezing cold my fingers started turning blue and i was like what is going on here i heard my heart 's valves snapping
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 485.05 494.36 <o,f0,female> that stuff up fast i would never leave that apartment alive i started mixing and i felt like everything was going to fall out through one hole
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 495.08 500.73 <o,f0,female> but i just kept on going finally with the last bottle in and the last bubble out i attached the pump to the tubing and lay
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 502.05 509.58 <o,f0,female> it would kick in soon enough if it didn 't i'd probably see my father sooner than i anticipated
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 517.82 526.58 <o,f0,female> which is a side effect of the medication and i knew i'd be okay we're not big on fear in my family but i was scared
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 527.39 534.17 <o,f0,female> went back to the states anticipating i'd return to europe but the heart catheterization showed that i wasn't going
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 534.86 542.78 <o,f0,female> anywhere farther that a flight for life from johns hopkins hospital i performed here and there but as my condition deteriorated so did my voice
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 552.11 559.19 <o,f0,female> months after having very challenging surgeries i knew another young man though who had ph who died while waiting for one
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 559.74 568.89 <o,f0,female> i wanted to live i thought stem cells were a good option but they hadn't developed to a point where i could take advantage of them yet
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 569.83 578.72 <o,f0,female> i officially took a break from singing and i went to the cleveland clinic to be reevaluated for the third time in five years for transplant
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 593.56 600.23 <o,f0,female> is a healthy patient it was like in one verbal swoop he had channeled my
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 600.99 609.22 <o,f0,female> on life and medicine and confucius i still didn't want a transplant but in a month
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 609.65 619.96 <o,f0,female> i was back in the hospital with some severely edemic kankles very attractive and it was right heart failure
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 621.52 623.66 <o,f0,female> i finally
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 624.28 632.93 <o,f0,female> it was time to take my doctor 's advice it was time for me to go to cleveland and to start the agonizing wait
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 638.24 643.97 <o,f0,female> i was still in the hospital i got a telephone call it was my doctor in cleveland marie
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 646.23 652.29 <o,f0,female> and they had lungs it was a match they were from texas
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 652.77 659.57 <o,f0,female> and everybody was really happy for me but me because despite their problems i
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 671.54 682.23 <o,f0,female> there in hopes that they would meet me and say what we knew might be our final goodbye but organs don't wait and i went into surgery
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 682.86 686.45 <o,f0,female> before i could say goodbye
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 687.32 697.82 <o,f0,female> the last thing i remember was lying on a white blanket telling my surgeon that i needed to see my mother again and to please try and save my voice
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 698.40 706.45 <o,f0,female> fell into this apocalyptic dreamworld during the thirteen and a half hour surgery i flatlined twice
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 707.09 717.33 <o,f0,female> forty quarts of blood were infused into my body and in my surgeon 's twenty year career he said it was among the most difficult
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 718.21 720.61 <o,f0,female> that he 's ever performed
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 721.36 736.07 <o,f0,female> they left my chest open for two weeks you could see my over sized heart beating inside of it i was on a dozen machines that were keeping my alive an infection ravaged my skin
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 739.04 740.37 <o,f0,female> i
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 741.59 752.84 <o,f0,female> had hoped my voice would be saved but my doctors knew that the breathing tubes going down my throat might have already destroyed it if they stayed in there was no way i would ever sing again
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 753.17 763.68 <o,f0,female> so my doctor got the ent the top guy at the clinic to come down and give me surgery to move the tubes around my voice box
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 764.51 777.96 <o,f0,female> he said it would kill me so my own surgeon performed the procedure in a last ditch attempt to save my voice though my mom couldn't say goodbye to me before the surgery she didn't leave my side
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 789.40 802.20 <o,f0,female> package it is her one year ago to this very day i woke up

CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 818.09 822.16 <o,f0,female> when i looked up and i saw my mother
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 824.40 825.43 <o,f0,female> i couldn't help
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 828.59 842.61 <o,f0,female> whether by a mack truck or by heart failure or faulty lungs death happens but life isn't really just about avoiding death is it it's about living
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 869.66 876.53 <o,f0,female> and i'm so grateful they did this past summer when i was running and singing and dancing and playing with my nieces
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 885.49 892.52 <o,f0,female> that i couldn't sing and i wanted to tell her and i want to tell you we
CharityTillemannDick_2010P 1 CharityTillemannDick_2010P 892.77 900.63 <o,f0,female> to stop letting disease divorce us from our dreams when we do
