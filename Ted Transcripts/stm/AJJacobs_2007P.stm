AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 16.05 30.29 <o,f0,female> i thought i'd tell you a little about what i like to write and i like to immerse myself in my topics i just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig and
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 31.33 41.10 <o,f0,female> i see my life as a series of experiments so i work for esquire magazine and a couple of years ago i wrote an article called my outsourced life
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 41.53 54.53 <o,f0,female> where i hired a team of people in bangalore india to live my life for me so they answered my emails they answered my phone they argued with my wife for me and they
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 56.13 64.48 <o,f0,female> my son bedtime stories it was the best month of my life because i just sat back and i read books and watched movies
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 65.07 74.19 <o,f0,female> was a wonderful experience more recently i wrote an article for esquire called about radical honesty and this is a movement
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 75.68 86.91 <o,f0,female> this is started by a psychologist in virginia who says that you should never ever lie except maybe during poker and golf his only exceptions and more than that
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 97.43 105.07 <o,f0,female> i do not recommend this at all to give you a sense of the experience the article was called i think you're fat
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 105.54 105.96 <o,f0,male> so
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 114.68 124.07 <o,f0,female> and it was about the year i spent reading the encyclopedia britannica from a to z in my quest to learn everything in the world or more precisely from
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 124.99 130.74 <o,f0,female> which is a type of east asian music all the way to zwyiec which is well i don't
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 145.61 151.91 <o,f0,female> although listening to kevin kelly you don't have to remember anything you can just google it so i wasted some time there
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 154.90 163.15 <o,f0,female> i love those experiments but i think that the most profound and life changing experiment that i've done is my most recent experiment
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 163.77 171.93 <o,f0,female> where i spent a year trying to follow all of the rules of the bible the year of living biblically and
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 173.26 184.72 <o,f0,female> i undertook this for two reasons the first was that i grew up with no religion at all as i say in my book i'm jewish in the same way the olive garden is italian
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 185.43 186.32 <o,f0,male> so
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 189.43 202.96 <o,f0,female> but i've become increasingly interested in religion i do think it's the defining issue of our time or one of the main ones and i have a son i want to know what to teach him so i decided to dive in head first and try to live the bible
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 204.18 212.62 <o,f0,female> the second reason i undertook this is because i'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism religious fundamentalism and people who say
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 221.85 230.13 <o,f0,female> what if you really did take the bible literally i decided to take it to its logical conclusion and take everything in the bible literally
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 230.66 237.84 <o,f0,female> without picking and choosing the first thing i did was i got a stack of bibles i had christian bibles i had
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 238.43 249.88 <o,f0,female> jewish bibles a friend of mine sent me something called a hip hop bible where the twenty three rd psalm is rendered as the lord is all that as opposed to what i knew it as the lord is my shepherd
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 250.57 261.79 <o,f0,female> then i went down and i read several versions and i wrote down every single law that i could find and this was a very long list over seven hundred rules
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 262.43 276.14 <o,f0,female> and they range from the famous ones that i had heard of the ten commandments love your neighbor be fruitful and multiply so i wanted to follow those and actually i take my projects very seriously because i had twins during my year so i
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 276.95 284.32 <o,f0,female> definitely take my projects seriously but i also wanted to follow the hundreds of arcane and obscure laws that are in the bible
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 285.46 291.95 <o,f0,female> there is the law in leviticus you cannot shave the corners of your beard i didn't know where my corners were so i decided
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 292.17 300.35 <o,f0,female> to let the whole thing grow and this is what i looked like by the end as you can imagine i spent a lot of time at airport security
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 302.86 315.58 <o,f0,female> my wife wouldn't kiss me for the last two months so certainly the challenge was there the bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers so i thought sounds strange but i'll try it you only know
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 317.14 329.18 <o,f0,female> i got rid of all my poly cotton t shirts the bible says that if two men are in a fight and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 329.86 332.89 <o,f0,female> her hand shall be cut off so i wanted to follow that rule
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 340.29 345.36 <o,f0,male> wife was standing nearby looking like she had a strong grip so
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 348.57 357.87 <o,f0,female> there's another shot of my beard i will say it was an amazing year because it really was life changing and incredibly challenging and there were two types of laws
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 358.33 363.82 <o,f0,female> were particularly challenging the first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 364.48 377.05 <o,f0,female> know i could spend a year not killing but spending a year not gossiping not coveting not lying you know i live in new york and i work as a journalist so this was seventy five eighty percent of my
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 379.00 385.60 <o,f0,female> but it was really interesting because i was able to make some progress because i couldn't believe how
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 386.26 398.33 <o,f0,female> my behavior changed my thoughts this was one of the huge lessons of the year is that i almost pretended to be a better person and i became a little bit of a better person so
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 400.00 406.40 <o,f0,female> i had always thought you know you change your mind and you change your behavior but it's often the other way round you change your behavior
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 408.28 416.51 <o,f0,female> and you change your mind so you know if you want to become more compassionate you visit sick people in the hospital and you will become more compassionate
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 416.99 424.58 <o,f0,female> you donate money to a cause and you become emotionally involved in that cause so it really was cognitive psychology
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 434.08 441.07 <o,f0,female> that if you smile you will become happier which as we know is actually true the second type of
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 442.23 449.38 <o,f0,female> rule that was difficult to obey was the rules that will get you into a little trouble in twenty one st century america and
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 451.26 454.69 <o,f0,female> the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 455.50 460.70 <o,f0,male> but it's a big part of the bible so i
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 461.36 462.20 <o,f0,male> had to address
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 463.79 473.97 <o,f0,female> i was able to stone one adulterer it happened i was in the park and i was dressed in my biblical clothing sandals and a white robe you know because again the outer
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 475.68 477.98 <o,f0,female> see how dressing biblically affected my mind
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 480.16 490.30 <o,f0,female> up to me and he said why are you dressed like that and i explained my project and he said well i am an adulterer are you going to stone me and i said well that would be great
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 491.82 492.18 <o,f0,male> and
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 495.48 506.42 <o,f0,female> i took out a handful of stones from my pocket that i had been carrying around for weeks hoping for just this interaction and you know they were pebbles
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 509.11 517.77 <o,f0,female> out of my hand he was actually an elderly man mid seventies just so you know but he 's still an adulterer and still quite angry he grabbed them out of my hand and threw them at my face
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 518.51 527.57 <o,f0,female> and i felt that i could eye for an eye i could retaliate and throw one back at him so that was my experience stoning and it did allow me to talk
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 529.16 538.18 <o,f0,female> about in a more serious way these big issues how can the bible be so barbaric in some places and yet so incredibly wise in others
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 557.46 566.41 <o,f0,female> it has all of these authors and editors over hundreds of years and it's sort of evolved it's not a book that was written and came down from on high
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 567.18 574.00 <o,f0,female> so i thought i would end by telling you just a couple of the take away the bigger
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 574.83 581.41 <o,f0,female> lessons that i learned from my year the first is thou shalt not take the bible literally this
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 582.84 589.80 <o,f0,female> very very clear early on because if you do then you end up acting like a crazy person and stoning adulterers or here
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 592.65 601.77 <o,f0,male> well that's another i did spend some time shepherding it's a very relaxing vocation i recommend it but this one is
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 611.55 618.99 <o,f0,female> and my wife thought this was very offensive so she sat in every seat in our apartment and i had to spend much of the year standing until
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 620.36 624.60 <o,f0,male> i bought my own seat and carried it around
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 625.05 635.38 <o,f0,female> so you know i met with creationists i went to the creationists museum and these are the ultimate literalists and it was fascinating because they were not stupid people at all
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 644.04 655.67 <o,f0,female> that they distort all the data to fit their model and they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this and i will say though
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 655.78 661.57 <o,f0,female> the museum is gorgeous they really did a fantastic job if you're ever in kentucky there's
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 671.73 675.03 <o,f0,female> i think it's crazy they did a great job
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 678.17 679.51 <o,f0,male> another lesson is that
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 680.59 690.70 <o,f0,female> thou shalt give thanks and this one was a big lesson because i was praying giving these prayers of thanksgiving which was odd for an agnostic but
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 691.58 701.46 <o,f0,female> saying thanks all the time every day and i started to change my perspective and i started to realize the hundreds of little things that go right every day
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 702.25 708.34 <o,f0,female> that i didn't even notice that i took for granted as opposed to focusing on the three or four that went wrong
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 709.34 720.52 <o,f0,female> so this is actually a key to happiness for me is to just remember when i came over here the car didn't flip over and i didn't trip coming up the stairs it's a remarkable thing
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 725.30 735.03 <o,f0,female> this one was unexpected because i started the year as an agnostic and by the end of the year i became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic which i love
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 736.16 750.22 <o,f0,female> a movement so if anyone wants to join the basic idea is whether or not there is a god there's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness and that our rituals can be sacred the sabbath can be
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 751.12 760.72 <o,f0,female> this was one of the great things about my year doing the sabbath because i am a workaholic so having this one day where you cannot work it really that changed my life
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 778.39 784.85 <o,f0,female> journey i wanted it to be about religion in america so i spent time with evangelical christians and hasidic jews and the
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 785.69 792.01 <o,f0,female> i'm very proud because i think i'm the only person in america to out bible talk a jehovah 's witness
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 800.13 801.05 <o,f0,female> thank you
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 808.26 808.73 <o,f0,male> but it was
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 809.35 816.91 <o,f0,female> because i had some very preconceived notions about for instance evangelical christianity and i found that it's such a wide
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 817.30 828.14 <o,f0,female> and varied movement that it is difficult to make generalizations about it there's a group i met with called the red letter christians and they focus on
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 829.04 834.20 <o,f0,female> words in the bible which are the ones that jesus spoke that's how they printed them in the old bibles and
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 834.98 846.39 <o,f0,female> is that jesus never talked about homosexuality they have a pamphlet that says here 's what jesus said about homosexuality and you open it up and there's nothing in it so
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 847.32 857.84 <o,f0,female> they say jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts helping poor people so this was very inspiring to me
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 859.32 871.53 <o,f0,female> i recommend jim wallace and tony campolo they're very inspiring leaders even though i disagree with much of what they say also thou shalt not
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 882.43 890.29 <o,f0,female> i was shocked learning how much of my life is governed by irrational forces and
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 891.07 903.13 <o,f0,female> the thing is if they're not harmful they're not to be completely dismissed because i learned that i was thinking i was doing all these rituals these biblical rituals separating my
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 904.44 913.91 <o,f0,female> and linen and i would ask these religious people why would the bible possibly tell us to do this why would god care and they said we don't know but it's just rituals
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 915.04 928.63 <o,f0,female> that give us meaning and i would say but that's crazy and they would say well what about you you blow out candles on top of a birthday cake if a guy from mars came down and saw
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 929.27 940.23 <o,f0,female> here 's one guy blowing out the fire on top of a cake versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics would the martians say well that
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 941.09 945.19 <o,f0,female> he makes sense but that guy 's crazy so no i think that
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 953.67 962.14 <o,f0,female> are not harmful but rituals by themselves are not to be dismissed and finally
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 962.74 970.14 <o,f0,female> i learned that thou shall pick and choose and this one i learned because i tried to follow everything in the bible and
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 970.41 979.42 <o,f0,female> i failed miserably because you can 't you have to pick and choose and anyone who follows the bible is going to be picking and choosing the key is
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 980.54 984.55 <o,f0,female> to pick and choose the right parts there's the phrase called
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 994.09 1000.01 <o,f0,female> my argument is what 's wrong with cafeterias i've had some great meals at cafeterias
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 1000.40 1011.88 <o,f0,female> i've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave so it's about choosing the parts of the bible about compassion about tolerance about loving your neighbor as opposed to the parts
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 1012.91 1019.57 <o,f0,female> about homosexuality is a sin or intolerance or violence which are very much in the bible as well
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 1020.06 1030.61 <o,f0,female> so if we are to find any meaning in this book then we have to really engage it and wrestle with it and i thought i'd end with just a couple more
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 1031.02 1034.74 <o,f0,male> there's me reading the bible that's how i hailed taxi cabs
AJJacobs_2007P 1 AJJacobs_2007P 1044.60 1050.14 <o,f0,male> morning but it served well for a day so anyway thank you so much for letting me
