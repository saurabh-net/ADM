PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 27.7 32.22 <o,f0,male> the dinosaurs had a bad day
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 42.08 61.96 <o,f0,male> it released its energy all at once and it was an explosion that was mind numbing if you took every nuclear weapon ever built at the height of the cold war lumped them together and blew them up at the same time that would be one one millionth of the energy released at that moment
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 61.96 77.53 <o,f0,male> the dinosaurs had a really bad day okay now a six mile wide rock is very large we all live here in boulder if you look out your window and you can see long 's peak you 're probably familiar with it now scoop up long 's peak and put it out in space
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 107.45 110.03 <o,f0,male> it was huge to give you a sense of the scale
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 110.06 124.96 <o,f0,male> okay there you go the scale here is fifty miles on top a hundred kilometers on the bottom this thing was three hundred kilometers across two hundred miles an enormous crater that excavated out vast amounts of earth that splashed around the globe and set
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 124.97 131.73 <o,f0,male> fires all over the planet threw up enough dust to block out the sun it wiped out seventy five percent of all species on
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 131.73 137.78 <o,f0,male> earth now not all asteroids are that big some of them are smaller
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 137.86 141.02 <o,f0,male> here is one that came in
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 141.2 149.57 <o,f0,male> over the united states in october of one thousand nine hundred and ninety two it came in on a friday night why is that important because
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 164.74 170.38 <o,f0,male> over west virgina maryland pennsylvania and new jersey until it did that to a car in new york
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 182.7 192.35 <o,f0,male> now this thing was probably about the size of a school bus when it first came in it broke up through atmospheric pressure it crumbled and then the pieces fell apart and did some damage
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 192.35 194.75 <o,f0,male> now you wouldn 't want that falling on your foot
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 194.75 212.44 <o,f0,male> or your head because it would do that to it that would be bad but it won 't wipe out you know all life on earth so that 's fine but it turns out you don 't need something six miles across to do a lot of damage there is a median point between tiny rock and gigantic rock and in fact
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 219.21 230.85 <o,f0,male> that it is actually called meteor crater to give you a sense of scale this is about a mile wide if you look up at the top that 's a parking lot and those are recreational vehicles right there
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 230.85 234.05 <o,f0,male> so it 's about a mile across six hundred feet deep
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 234.05 243.24 <o,f0,male> the object that formed this was probably about thirty to fifty yards across so roughly the size of mackey auditorium here
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 243.24 260.33 <o,f0,male> it came in at speeds that were tremendous slammed into the ground blew up and exploded with the energy of roughly a twenty megaton nuclear bomb a very hefty bomb this was fifty thousand years ago so it may have wiped out a few buffalo or antelope or something like that out in the desert
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 260.33 263.27 <o,f0,male> but it probably would not have caused
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 263.27 274.15 <o,f0,male> global devastation it turns out that these things don 't have to hit the ground to do a lot of damage now in one thousand nine hundred and eight over siberia near the tunguska region
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 274.15 284.94 <o,f0,male> for those of you who are dan aykroyd fans and saw ghostbusters when he talked about the greatest cross dimensional rift since the siberia blast of one thousand nine hundred and nine where he got the date wrong but that 's okay
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 297.38 300.43 <o,f0,male> the heat from the explosion set fire
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 300.43 315.67 <o,f0,male> to the forest below it and then the shock wave came down and knocked down trees for hundreds of square miles okay this did a huge amount of damage and again this was a rock probably roughly the size of this auditorium that we 're sitting in
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 325.42 332.16 <o,f0,male> either way these are tremendous explosions twenty megatons now when these things blow up
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 332.24 351.46 <o,f0,male> they 're not going to do global ecological damage they 're not going to do something like the dinosaur killer did they 're just not big enough but they will do global economic damage because they don 't have to hit necessarily to do this kind of damage they don 't have to do global devastation if one of these things were to hit
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 351.5 367.95 <o,f0,male> pretty much anywhere it would cause a panic but if it came over a city an important city not that any city is more important than others but some of them we depend on them more on the global economic basis that could do a huge amount of damage to us as a civilization so
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 368.28 370.62 <o,f0,male> now that i 've scared the crap out of you
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 388.52 402.66 <o,f0,male> few centuries or every few thousand years but it 's still something to be aware of well what do we do about them the first thing we have to do is find them this is an image of an asteroid that passed us in two thousand and nine it 's right here
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 402.7 408.79 <o,f0,male> but you can see that it 's extremely faint i don 't even know if you can see that in the back row these are just stars
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 408.99 416.49 <o,f0,male> this is a rock that was about thirty yards across so roughly the size of the ones that blew up over tunguska and hit arizona fifty thousand years ago
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 416.49 434.74 <o,f0,male> these things are faint they 're hard to see and the sky is really big we have to find these things first well the good news is we 're looking for them nasa has devoted money to this the national science foundation other countries are very interested in doing this we 're building telescopes that are looking for the threat that 's a great first step
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 434.74 440.38 <o,f0,male> but what 's the second step the second step is that we see one heading toward us we have to stop it what do we do
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 440.38 444.98 <o,f0,male> you 've probably heard about the asteroid apophis if you haven 't yet you will
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 444.99 453.71 <o,f0,male> if you 've heard about the mayan two thousand and twelve apocalypse you 're going to hear about apophis because you 're keyed in to all the doomsday networks anyway
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 463.63 476.36 <o,f0,male> and it 's going to pass by the earth in april of two thousand and twenty nine and it 's going to pass us so close that it 's actually going to come underneath our weather satellites the earth 's gravity is going to bend the orbit of this thing so much
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 476.36 483.64 <o,f0,male> that if it 's just right if it passes through this region of space this kidney bean shaped region called the keyhole
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 483.64 487.19 <o,f0,male> the earth 's gravity will bend it just enough that seven years later
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 496.64 514.03 <o,f0,male> and it 's two hundred and fifty meters across so it would do unbelievable damage now the good news is that the odds of it actually passing through this keyhole and hitting us next go around are one in a million roughly very very low odds so i personally am not lying awake at night worrying about this at all i don 't think apophis is a problem in fact
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 532.36 536.3 <o,f0,male> because how do you stop an asteroid like this well let me ask you
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 536.3 545.61 <o,f0,male> what happens if you 're standing in the middle of the road and a car 's headed for you what do you do you do this right move the car goes past you but we can 't move the earth at least not easily
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 545.61 560.22 <o,f0,male> but we can move a small asteroid and it turns out we 've even done it in the year two thousand and five nasa launched a probe called deep impact which slammed into slammed a piece of itself into the nucleus of a comet comets are very much like asteroids
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 560.22 574.98 <o,f0,male> the purpose wasn 't to push it out of the way the purpose was to make a crater to excavate the material and see what was underneath the surface of this comet which we learned quite a bit about we did move the comet a little tiny bit not very much but that wasn 't the point however
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 575.14 577.43 <o,f0,male> think about this this thing is orbiting the sun
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 597.71 616.42 <o,f0,male> you might think about why don 't we use a nuclear weapon it 's like well you can try that but the problem is timing you shoot a nuclear weapon at this thing you have to blow it up within a few milliseconds of tolerance or else you 'll just miss it and there are a lot of other problems with that it 's very hard to do but just hitting something that 's pretty easy i think even nasa can do that and they proved that they can
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 628.13 644.19 <o,f0,male> well my opinion is fine okay it 's not hitting us in six months that 's good now we have three years to do something else and you can hit it again that 's kind of ham fisted you might just push it into a third keyhole or whatever so you don 't do that and this is the part
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 653.3 657.01 <o,f0,male> then we bring in the velvet gloves
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 717.26 731.76 <o,f0,male> that it can pull the asteroid and you have your rockets set up so you can oh you can barely see it here but there 's rocket plumes and you basically these guys are connected by their own gravity and if you move the probe very slowly very very gently you can
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 750.05 752.26 <o,f0,male> so think about this right
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 752.79 757.5 <o,f0,male> there are these giant rocks flying out there and they 're hitting us and they 're doing damage to us
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 757.5 761.78 <o,f0,male> but we 've figured out how to do this and all the pieces are in place to do this
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 761.78 778.88 <o,f0,male> we have astronomers in place with telescopes looking for them we have smart people very very smart people who are concerned about this and figuring out how to fix the problem and we have the technology to do this this probe actually can 't use chemical rockets chemical rockets provide too much thrust too much push the probe would just shoot away
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 778.88 790.91 <o,f0,male> we invented something called an ion drive which is a very very very low thrust engine it generates the force a piece of paper would have on your hand incredibly light but it can run for months and years
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 790.91 793.15 <o,f0,male> providing that very gentle push
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 793.15 803.17 <o,f0,male> if anybody here is a fan of the original star trek they ran across an alien ship that had an ion drive and spock said they 're very technically sophisticated they 're a hundred years ahead of us with this drive
PhilPlait_2011X 1 PhilPlait_2011X 818.78 836.1 <o,f0,male> that 's the difference that 's the difference between us and the dinosaurs this happened to them it doesn 't have to happen to us the difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we have a space program and we can vote and so we can change
