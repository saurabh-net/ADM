StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 14.31 18.02 <o,f0,male> there is nothing bigger or older than the universe
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 27.48 29.11 <o,f0,male> where did we come from
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 30.23 32.60 <o,f0,male> how did the universe come into being
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 34.38 36.22 <o,f0,male> are we alone in the universe
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 37.42 39.54 <o,f0,male> is there alien life out there
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 40.52 43.05 <o,f0,male> what is the future of the human race
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 43.87 51.40 <o,f0,male> up until the nineteen twenties everyone thought the universe was essentially static and unchanging in time
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 52.56 55.96 <o,f0,male> then it was discovered that the universe was expanding
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 61.92 64.54 <o,f0,male> this meant they must have been closer together
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 66.67 68.10 <o,f0,male> if we extrapolate back
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 68.79 74.96 <o,f0,male> we find we must have all been on top of each other about fifteen billion years ago
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 76.15 79.77 <o,f0,male> this was the big bang the beginning of the universe
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 81.15 83.77 <o,f0,male> was there anything before the big bang
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 84.86 87.72 <o,f0,male> if not what created the universe
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 88.73 93.11 <o,f0,male> why did the universe emerge from the big bang the way it did
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 94.61 99.84 <o,f0,male> we used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 101.04 111.91 <o,f0,male> first there were the laws like maxwell 's equations and general relativity that determined the evolution of the universe given its state over all of space at one time
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 113.74 118.50 <o,f0,male> and second there was no question of the initial state of the universe
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 120.15 129.09 <o,f0,male> we have made good progress on the first part and now have the knowledge of the laws of evolution in all but the most extreme conditions
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 129.33 135.61 <o,f0,male> but until recently we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 136.82 141.66 <o,f0,male> however this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 147.18 155.39 <o,f0,male> under extreme conditions general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 171.80 175.76 <o,f0,male> the universe can spontaneously create itself out of nothing
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 184.01 185.77 <o,f0,male> created in different states
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 186.88 187.85 <o,f0,male> these predictions are
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 188.81 198.40 <o,f0,male> agreement with observations by the wmap satellite of the cosmic microwave background which is an imprint of the very early universe
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 200.32 203.48 <o,f0,male> we think we have solved the mystery of creation
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 204.73 210.42 <o,f0,male> maybe we should patent the universe and charge everyone royalties for their existence
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 213.73 220.52 <o,f0,male> i now turn to the second big question are we alone or is there other life in the universe
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 224.38 236.55 <o,f0,male> we believe that life arose spontaneously on the earth so it must be possible for life to appear on other suitable planets of which there seem to be a large number in the galaxy
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 239.15 241.96 <o,f0,male> but we don't know how life first appeared
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 244.52 250.31 <o,f0,male> we have two pieces of observational evidence on the probability of life appearing
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 252.29 258.41 <o,f0,male> the first is that we have fossils of algae from three point five billion years ago
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 259.54 268.03 <o,f0,male> the earth was formed four point six billion years ago and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 273.83 284.45 <o,f0,male> so life appeared on earth within half a billion years of it being possible which is short compared to the ten billion year lifetime of a planet of earth type
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 285.84 289.24 <o,f0,male> this suggests that a probability of life appearing
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 291.64 298.27 <o,f0,male> if it was very low one would have expected it to take most of the ten billion years available
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 299.35 302.18 <o,f0,male> on the other hand we don't seem to have
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 302.29 304.07 <o,f0,male> been visited by aliens
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 305.07 306.75 <o,f0,male> i am discounting the reports of
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 309.07 312.20 <o,f0,male> why would they appear only to cranks and weirdos
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 315.21 327.85 <o,f0,male> there is a government conspiracy to suppress the reports and keep for itself the scientific knowledge the aliens bring it seems to have been a singularly ineffective policy so far
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 342.59 352.35 <o,f0,male> this probably indicates that there are no alien civilizations at our stage of development within a radius of a few hundred light years
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 362.60 368.00 <o,f0,male> this brings me to the last of the big questions the future of the human race
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 369.02 375.94 <o,f0,male> if we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy we should make sure we survive and continue
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 379.23 383.64 <o,f0,male> but we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 388.41 399.95 <o,f0,male> our population and our use of the finite resources of planet earth are growing exponentially along with our technical ability to change the environment for good or ill
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 405.27 412.20 <o,f0,male> our genetic code still carries the selfish and aggressive instincts that were of survival advantage in
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 417.25 424.30 <o,f0,male> it will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred years let alone the next thousand or
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 428.88 437.49 <o,f0,male> our only chance of long term survival is not to remain lurking on planet earth but to spread out into space
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 440.42 447.55 <o,f0,male> the answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 448.67 454.80 <o,f0,male> but if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years our future is in space
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 456.96 462.70 <o,f0,male> that is why i am in favor of manned or should i say personed space flight
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 476.24 481.33 <o,f0,male> been very lucky that my disability has not been a serious handicap
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 482.07 488.69 <o,f0,male> indeed it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 492.53 498.47 <o,f0,male> the ultimate goal is a complete theory of the universe and we are making good progress
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 507.03 513.70 <o,f0,male> professor if you had to guess either way do you now believe that it is more likely than not
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 515.82 520.97 <o,f0,male> in the milky way as a civilization of our level of intelligence
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 537.49 541.26 <o,f0,male> this answer took seven minutes
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 541.79 544.83 <o,f0,male> and really gave me an insight into the incredible
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 559.11 565.71 <o,f0,male> think it quite likely that we are the only civilization within several hundred light years
StephenHawking_2008 1 StephenHawking_2008 567.09 570.23 <o,f0,male> otherwise we would have heard radio waves
