SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 39.8 45.54 <o,f0,male> national assembly they create the committee of public safety which sounds like a very nice committee notice
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 45.54 54.42 <o,f0,male> this is an aldehyde and it 's an alcohol start differentiating into effector and memory cells a galaxy hey there 's another galaxy
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 54.42 64.34 <o,f0,male> oh look there 's another galaxy and for dollars is their thirty million plus the twenty million dollars from the american manufacturer if this does not blow your mind
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 64.34 67.08 <o,f0,male> then you have no emotion
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 100.97 111.89 <o,f0,male> and some of you all might know about five years ago i was an analyst at a hedge fund and i was in boston and i was tutoring my cousins in new orleans remotely
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 111.94 130.42 <o,f0,male> and i started putting the first youtube videos up really just as a kind of nice to have just a supplement for my cousins something that might give them a refresher or something and as soon as i put those first youtube videos up something interesting happened actually a bunch of interesting things happened the first was the feedback from my cousins
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 130.42 135.52 <o,f0,male> they told me that they preferred me on youtube than in person
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 174.1 181.3 <o,f0,male> they don 't have to be embarrassed and ask their cousin they can just watch those videos if they 're bored they can go ahead they can watch it at their own time at their own pace
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 181.3 198.17 <o,f0,male> and probably the least appreciated aspect of this is the notion that the very first time the very first time that you 're trying to get your brain around a new concept the very last thing you need is another human being saying do you understand this
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 198.17 201.17 <o,f0,male> and that 's what was happening with the interaction with my cousins
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 229.2 233.49 <o,f0,male> this is actually from one of the original calculus videos
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 245.68 247.32 <o,f0,male> and then they smiled
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 248.54 266.7 <o,f0,male> and then in a response to that same comment this is on the thread you can go on youtube and look at these comments someone else wrote same thing here i actually got a natural high and a good mood for the entire day since i remember seeing all of this matrix text in class and here i 'm all like i know kung fu
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 274.42 290.56 <o,f0,male> but then as the viewership kept growing and kept growing i started getting letters from people and it was starting to become clear that it was actually more than just a nice to have this is just an excerpt from one of those letters my twelve year old son has autism
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 290.58 302.66 <o,f0,male> and has had a terrible time with math we have tried everything viewed everything bought everything we stumbled on your video on decimals and it got through then we went on to the dreaded fractions again he got it
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 302.94 306.11 <o,f0,male> we could not believe it he is so excited
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 306.11 314.96 <o,f0,male> and so you can imagine here i was an analyst at a hedge fund it was very strange for me to do something of social value
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 361.88 377.42 <o,f0,male> but i didn 't think it would be something that would somehow penetrate the classroom but then i started getting letters from teachers and the teachers would write saying we 've used your videos to flip the classroom you 've given the lectures so now what we do and this could happen in every classroom in america tomorrow
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 377.42 382.86 <o,f0,male> what i do is i assign the lectures for homework and what used to be homework
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 392.07 398.5 <o,f0,male> i want to pause here for a second because there 's a couple of interesting things one when those teachers are doing that
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 433.14 450.93 <o,f0,male> they took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience thirty kids with their fingers on their lips not allowed to interact with each other a teacher no matter how good has to give this one size fits all lecture to thirty students blank faces slightly antagonistic and now it 's a human experience now they 're actually interacting with each other
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 450.93 466.01 <o,f0,male> so once the khan academy i quit my job and we turned into a real organization we 're a not for profit the question is how do we take this to the next level how do we take what those teachers are doing to their natural conclusion
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 466.01 478.61 <o,f0,male> and so what i 'm showing you over here these are actual exercises that i started writing for my cousins the ones i started were much more primitive this is a more competent version of it
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 478.61 491 <o,f0,male> but the paradigm here is we 'll generate as many questions as you need until you get that concept until you get ten in a row and the khan academy videos are there you get hints the actual steps for that problem if you don 't know how to do it
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 491 500.69 <o,f0,male> but the paradigm here it seems like a very simple thing ten in a row you move on but it 's fundamentally different than what 's happening in classrooms right now in a traditional classroom
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 500.69 513.42 <o,f0,male> you have a couple of homework homework lecture homework lecture and then you have a snapshot exam and that exam whether you get a seventy percent an eighty percent a ninety percent or a ninety five percent the class moves on to the next topic
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 513.42 526.82 <o,f0,male> and even that ninety five percent student what was the five percent they didn 't know maybe they didn 't know what happens when you raise something to the zero power and then you go build on that in the next concept that 's analogous to imagine learning to ride a bicycle
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 526.82 533.6 <o,f0,male> and maybe i give you a lecture ahead of time and i give you that bicycle for two weeks and then i come back after two weeks
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 533.6 537.71 <o,f0,male> and i say well let 's see you 're having trouble taking left turns you can 't quite stop
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 543.66 546 <o,f0,male> and then i say here 's a unicycle
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 546.53 548.42 <o,f0,male> but as ridiculous as that
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 568.89 584.64 <o,f0,male> learn math the way you 'd learn anything like the way you would learn a bicycle stay on that bicycle fall off that bicycle do it as long as necessary until you have mastery the traditional model it penalizes you for experimentation and failure but it does not expect mastery
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 584.64 589.35 <o,f0,male> we encourage you to experiment we encourage you to failure but we do expect mastery
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 590.93 599.58 <o,f0,male> this is just another one of the modules this is trigonometry this is shifting and reflecting functions and they all fit together we have
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 613.32 620.28 <o,f0,male> and the paradigm is once you get ten in a row on that it keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules so if you keep
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 633.22 646.91 <o,f0,male> and the idea is from this we can actually teach everything well everything that can be taught in this type of a framework so you can imagine and this is what we are working on is from this knowledge map you have logic you have computer programming
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 646.91 655.43 <o,f0,male> you have grammar you have genetics all based off of that core of if you know this and that now you 're ready for this next concept
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 655.43 665 <o,f0,male> now that can work well for an individual learner and i encourage one for you to do it with your kids but i also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself it 'll change what happens at the dinner table
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 665 672.21 <o,f0,male> but what we want to do is to use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom that those early teachers had emailed me about
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 672.21 691.02 <o,f0,male> and so what i 'm showing you here this is actually data from a pilot in the los altos school district where they took two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes and completely gutted their old math curriculum these kids aren 't using textbooks they 're not getting one size fits all lectures they 're doing khan academy they 're doing that software for roughly half of their math class and i want to make it clear
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 691.02 695.33 <o,f0,male> we don 't view this as the complete math education what it does is and this is what 's happening in los altos
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 695.33 709.01 <o,f0,male> it frees up time this is the blocking and tackling making sure you know how to move through a system of equations and it frees up time for the simulations for the games for the mechanics for the robot building for the estimating how high that hill is based on its shadow
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 709.01 716.97 <o,f0,male> and so the paradigm is the teacher walks in every day every kid works at their own pace and this is actually a live dashboard from los altos school district
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 716.97 728.58 <o,f0,male> and they look at this dashboard every row is a student every column is one of those concepts green means the student 's already proficient blue means they 're working on it no need to worry red means they 're stuck
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 731.8 741.55 <o,f0,male> let me intervene on the red kids or even better let me get one of the green kids who are already proficient in that concept to be the first line of attack and actually tutor their peer
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 751.71 759.98 <o,f0,male> data centric reality so we don 't want that teacher to even go and intervene and have to ask the kid awkward questions oh what do you not understand or what do you do understand and all of the rest
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 759.98 768.02 <o,f0,male> so our paradigm is to really arm the teachers with as much data as possible really data that in almost any other field is expected if you 're in finance or marketing or manufacturing
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 768.02 781.72 <o,f0,male> and so the teachers can actually diagnose what 's wrong with the students so they can make their interaction as productive as possible so now the teachers know exactly what the students have been up to how long they have been spending every day what videos have they been watching when did they pause the videos what did they stop
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 800.2 810.92 <o,f0,male> they watched the video right over there and then you can see eventually they were able to get ten in a row it 's almost like you can see them learning over those last ten problems they also got faster the height is how long it took them
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 810.92 814.21 <o,f0,male> so
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 828.12 843.98 <o,f0,male> over and over again if you go five days into it there 's a group of kids who 've raced ahead and there 's a group of kids who are a little bit slower and in a traditional model if you did a snapshot assessment you say these are the gifted kids these are the slow kids maybe they should be tracked differently maybe we should put them in different classes
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 843.98 848.46 <o,f0,male> but when you let every student work at their own pace and we see it over and over and over again
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 848.46 858.78 <o,f0,male> you see students who took a little bit of extra time on one concept or the other but once they get through that concept they just race ahead and so the same kids that you thought were slow
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 858.78 871.66 <o,f0,male> six weeks ago you now would think are gifted and we 're seeing it over and over and over again and it makes you really wonder how much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefited from were really just due to a coincidence of time
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 878.61 894.71 <o,f0,male> our goal is to use technology to humanize not just in los altos but on a global scale what 's happening in education and actually that kind of brings an interesting point a lot of the effort in humanizing the classroom is focused on student to teacher ratios
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 894.71 902.83 <o,f0,male> in our mind the relevant metric is student to valuable human time with the teacher ratio so in a traditional model most of the
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 920.34 934.67 <o,f0,male> and as valuable as that is in los altos imagine what that does to the adult learner who 's embarrassed to go back and learn stuff that they should have before before going back to college imagine what it does to a street kid in calcutta
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 934.91 947.56 <o,f0,male> who has to help his family during the day and that 's the reason why he or she can 't go to school now they can spend two hours a day and remediate or get up to speed and not feel embarrassed about what they do or don 't know
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 947.56 955.64 <o,f0,male> now imagine what happens where we talked about the peers teaching each other inside of a classroom but this is all one system
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 955.74 962.82 <o,f0,male> there 's no reason why you can 't have that peer to peer tutoring beyond that one classroom imagine what happens if
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 963.02 973.21 <o,f0,male> that student in calcutta all of a sudden can tutor your son or your son can tutor that kid in calcutta and i think what you 'll see emerging is this notion of
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 977.89 983.2 <o,f0,male> and that 's essentially what we 're trying to build thank you
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 1024.24 1034.38 <o,f0,male> i 've seen some things you 're doing in the system that have to do with motivation and feedback energy points merit badges tell me what you 're thinking there
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 1050.66 1063.33 <o,f0,male> just the wording of the badging or how many points you get for doing something we see on a system wide basis like tens of thousands of fifth graders or sixth graders going one direction or another depending what badge you give them
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 1081.55 1090.69 <o,f0,male> every student work at their own pace on something like this and we 'd give a dashboard and they said oh this is kind of radical we have to think about it and me and the rest of the team were like they 're never going to
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 1090.69 1095.23 <o,f0,male> want to do this but literally the next day they were like can you start in two weeks
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 1097.18 1099.18 <o,f0,male> so fifth grade math
