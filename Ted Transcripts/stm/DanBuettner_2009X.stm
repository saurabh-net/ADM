DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 16.95 29.68 <o,f0,female> called the danish twin study established that only about ten percent of how long the average person lives within certain biological limits is dictated by our genes the other ninety percent is dictated
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 30.19 37.33 <o,f0,female> by our lifestyle so the premise of blue zones if we can find the optimal lifestyle of longevity we can come up with a
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 37.49 45.07 <o,f0,female> de facto formula for longevity but if you ask the average american what the optimal formula of longevity is they probably couldn't tell you
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 53.84 61.37 <o,f0,female> tells us the fact of the matter is there is a lot of confusion around what really helps us live longer better
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 62.10 72.52 <o,f0,female> should you be running marathons or doing yoga should you eat organic meats or should you be eating tofu when it comes to supplements should you be taking them
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 73.00 80.24 <o,f0,female> how about these hormones or resveratrol and does purpose play into it spirituality and how about how we socialize
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 80.92 89.17 <o,f0,female> well our approach to finding longevity was to team up with national geographic and the national institute on aging to find the four demographically
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 107.42 115.85 <o,f0,female> when it comes to longevity and the first myth is if you try really hard you can live to be one hundred false
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 116.33 123.71 <o,f0,female> the problem is only about one out of five thousand people in america live to be one hundred your chances are
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 124.34 134.99 <o,f0,female> very low even though it's the fastest growing demographic in america it's hard to reach one hundred the problem is that we're not programmed for longevity
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 136.57 144.21 <o,f0,female> for something called procreative success i love that word it reminds me of my college days
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 160.29 171.06 <o,f0,female> if you're a rat or an elephant or a human in between it's the same story so to make it to age one hundred you not only have to have had a very good lifestyle you also have to have
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 171.85 180.25 <o,f0,female> the genetic lottery the second myth is there are treatments that can help slow reverse or even stop aging
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 181.05 191.32 <o,f0,female> false when you think of it there is ninety nine things that can age us deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes those brain cells die they never come back
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 191.69 201.19 <o,f0,female> play tennis too hard on your knees ruin your cartilage the cartilage never comes back our arteries can clog our brains can gunk up with plaque and we can get alzheimer 's
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 201.95 213.29 <o,f0,female> is just too many things to go wrong our bodies have thirty five trillion cells trillion with a t we're talking national debt numbers here
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 214.54 225.73 <o,f0,female> those cells turn themselves over once every eight years and every time they turn themselves over there is some damage and that damage builds up and it builds up exponentially it's a little bit like the days when we all had
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 237.21 247.87 <o,f0,female> well the same things happen to our cells that's why a sixty five year old person is aging at a rate of about one hundred and twenty five times faster than a twelve year old person
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 248.63 256.61 <o,f0,female> so if there is nothing you can do to slow your aging or stop your aging what am i doing here well the fact of the matter
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 256.97 267.09 <o,f0,female> is the best science tells us that the capacity of the human body my body your body is about ninety years a little bit more for women
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 267.79 277.70 <o,f0,female> but life expectancy in this country is only seventy eight so somewhere along the line we're leaving about twelve good years on the table
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 278.27 284.32 <o,f0,female> these are years that we could get and research shows that would be
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 284.59 293.77 <o,f0,female> years largely free of chronic disease heart disease cancer and diabetes we think the best way to get these missing years is to look
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 293.98 302.58 <o,f0,female> the cultures around the world that are actually experiencing them areas where people are living to age one hundred at rates up to ten times greater than we are
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 302.96 311.03 <o,f0,female> areas where the life expectancy is an extra dozen years the rate of middle age mortality is a fraction of what it is in this country
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 324.01 334.38 <o,f0,female> and here we have this area where men live the longest about ten times more centenarians than we have here in america and this is a place where people not only reach age one hundred they do so with extraordinary vigor
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 344.64 356.64 <o,f0,female> their history actually goes back to about the time of christ it's actually a bronze age culture that's been isolated because the land is so infertile they largely are shepherds which occasions regular low intensity physical activity
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 357.07 370.57 <o,f0,female> their diet is mostly plant based accentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields they came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread called notamusica made out of durum wheat a type of cheese made from grass fed
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 371.57 378.63 <o,f0,female> animals so the cheese is high in omega three fatty acids instead of omega six fatty acids from corn fed animals
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 379.21 385.50 <o,f0,female> and a type of wine that has three times the level of polyphenols than any known wine in the world it's called
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 386.90 395.32 <o,f0,female> but the real secret i think lies more in the way that they organize their society and one of the most salient elements of the sardinian society is how they treat
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 396.20 397.29 <o,f0,female> people
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 411.04 417.48 <o,f0,female> you go into the bars in sardinia instead of seeing the sports illustrated swimsuit calendar you see the centenarian of the month calendar
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 418.80 423.71 <o,f0,female> this as it turns out is not only good for your aging parents to keep them close to the family
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 433.35 437.31 <o,f0,female> disease that's called the grandmother effect we found our
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 437.98 442.82 <o,f0,female> second blue zone on the other side of the planet about eight hundred miles south
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 443.11 451.98 <o,f0,female> of tokyo on the archipelago of okinawa okinawa is actually one hundred and sixty one small islands and in the northern part of the main island
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 452.52 459.90 <o,f0,female> this is ground zero for world longevity this is a place where the oldest living female population is found
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 460.26 471.15 <o,f0,female> it's a place where people have the longest disability free life expectancy in the world they have what we want they live a long time and tend to die in their sleep very quickly and often i can tell you
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 471.64 472.59 <o,f0,female> sex
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 473.59 479.16 <o,f0,female> they live about seven good years longer than the average american five times as many centenarians as
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 479.23 488.05 <o,f0,female> we have in america one fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer big killers here in america and one sixth the rate of cardiovascular
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 488.39 495.71 <o,f0,female> the fact that this culture has yielded these numbers suggests strongly they have something to teach us what do they do
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 496.20 505.91 <o,f0,female> once again a plant based diet full of vegetables with lots of color in them and they eat about eight times as much tofu as americans do
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 506.43 513.95 <o,f0,female> more significant than what they eat is how they eat it they have all kinds of little strategies to keep from overeating
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 514.36 522.93 <o,f0,female> as you know is a big problem here in america a few of the strategies we observed they eat off of smaller plates so they tend to eat fewer calories at every
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 532.42 542.96 <o,f0,female> they also have a three thousand year old adage which i think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented it was invented by confucius and that diet is known as the hara hatchi bu diet
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 543.80 552.40 <o,f0,female> a little saying these people say before their meal to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is eighty percent full it takes about a half hour for that full feeling to
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 566.53 577.21 <o,f0,female> we know that isolation kills fifteen years ago the average american had three good friends we're down to one and half right now if you were lucky enough to be born in okinawa
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 577.92 585.69 <o,f0,female> you were born into a system where you automatically have a half a dozen friends with whom you travel through life they call it a moai
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 586.10 597.59 <o,f0,female> and if you're in a moai you're expected to share the bounty if you encounter luck and if things go bad child gets sick parent dies you always have somebody who has your back
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 598.16 610.96 <o,f0,female> this particular moai these five ladies have been together for ninety seven years their average age is one hundred and two typically in america we've divided our adult life up into two
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 612.10 621.66 <o,f0,female> sections there is our work life where we're productive and then one day boom we retire and typically that has meant
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 643.93 652.32 <o,f0,female> for this one hundred and two year old karate master his ikigai was carrying forth this martial art for this hundred year old fisherman
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 652.57 662.48 <o,f0,female> it was continuing to catch fish for his family three times a week and this is a question the national institute on aging actually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians and one of the questions they were
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 672.39 679.87 <o,f0,female> for this one hundred and two year old woman her ikigai was simply her great great great granddaughter
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 694.17 703.29 <o,f0,female> that was a wonderful thought my editor at geographic wanted me to find america 's blue zone and for a while we looked on the prairies of minnesota
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 703.64 709.13 <o,f0,female> where actually there is a very high proportion of centenarians but that's because all the young people left
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 712.74 722.07 <o,f0,female> so we turned to the data again and we found america 's longest lived population among the seventh day adventists concentrated in and around loma linda
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 736.80 743.63 <o,f0,female> and they follow five little habits that conveys to them extraordinary longevity comparatively speaking
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 744.13 752.11 <o,f0,female> in america here life expectancy for the average woman is eighty but for an adventist woman their life expectancy
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 752.67 762.46 <o,f0,female> eighty nine and the difference is even more pronounced among men who are expected to live about eleven years longer than their american counterparts now this is a study that followed
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 762.79 771.97 <o,f0,female> about seventy thousand people for thirty years sterling study and i think it supremely illustrates the premise of this blue zone project
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 772.52 784.77 <o,f0,female> this is a heterogeneous community it's white black hispanic asian the only thing that they have in common are a set of very small lifestyle habits that they follow ritualistically for most of their lives
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 785.04 793.16 <o,f0,female> they take their diet directly from the bible genesis chapter one verse where god talks about legumes and seeds
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 793.54 801.36 <o,f0,female> and on one more stanza about green plants ostensibly missing is meat they take this sanctuary in time very serious
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 801.97 809.19 <o,f0,female> for twenty four hours every week no matter how busy they are how stressed out they are at work where the kids need to be driven
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 809.56 817.54 <o,f0,female> they stop everything and they focus on their god their social network and then hardwired right in the religion are nature walks
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 818.17 826.14 <o,f0,female> and the power of this is not that it's done occasionally the power is it's done every week for a lifetime none of it's hard none of it costs money
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 846.73 857.38 <o,f0,female> this is a culture that has yielded ellsworth wheram ellsworth wheram is ninety seven years old he 's a multimillionaire yet when a contractor wanted six thousand dollars

DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 870.44 878.28 <o,f0,female> in the operating room but not as the guy on the table the guy doing open heart surgery

DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 911.24 916.95 <o,f0,female> and tears down the san bernardino freeway where she still volunteers for seven different organizations
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 959.40 969.54 <o,f0,female> none of them exercise at least the way we think of exercise instead they set up their lives so that they are constantly nudged into physical activity
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 970.18 977.25 <o,f0,female> these one hundred year old okinawan women are getting up and down off the ground they sit on the floor thirty or forty times a day
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 991.05 1001.00 <o,f0,female> they want to mix up a cake they're doing it by hand that's physical activity that burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does when they do do intentional physical activity
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 1001.19 1009.81 <o,f0,female> it's the things they enjoy they tend to walk the only proven way to stave off cognitive decline and they all tend to have a garden
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 1010.84 1022.90 <o,f0,female> they know how to set up their life in the right way so they have the right outlook each of these cultures take time to downshift the sardinians pray the seventh day adventists pray the okinawans have this ancestor veneration
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 1023.24 1031.64 <o,f0,female> but when you're in a hurry or stressed out that triggers something called the inflammatory response which is associated with everything from alzheimer 's disease to
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 1040.71 1052.16 <o,f0,female> they have vocabulary for sense of purpose ikigai like the okinawans you know the two most dangerous years in your life are the year you're born because of infant mortality and the year
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 1067.74 1076.14 <o,f0,female> they tend to eat a plant based diet doesn't mean they don't eat meat but lots of beans and nuts and they have strategies to keep from overeating little things that
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 1086.23 1099.77 <o,f0,female> they all tend to belong to a faith based community which is worth between four and fourteen extra years of life expectancy if you do it four times a month and the biggest thing here is they also belong to the right tribe
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 1100.27 1107.04 <o,f0,female> they were either born into or they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 1107.67 1115.16 <o,f0,female> we know from the framingham studies that if your three best friends are obese there is a fifty percent better chance that you'll be overweight
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 1115.97 1123.64 <o,f0,female> so if you hang out with unhealthy people that's going to have a measurable impact over time instead if your friend 's idea of
DanBuettner_2009X 1 DanBuettner_2009X 1136.08 1144.68 <o,f0,female> that is going to have the biggest impact over time diets don't work no diet in the history of the world has ever worked for more than two percent of the population
