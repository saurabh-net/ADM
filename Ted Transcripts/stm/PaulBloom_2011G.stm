PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 15.91 18.6 <o,f0,male> 'm going to talk today about the pleasures of everyday life
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 19.08 22.86 <o,f0,male> but i want to begin with a story of an unusual and terrible man
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 23.25 41.21 <o,f0,male> this is hermann goering goering was hitler 's second in command in world war ii his designated successor and like hitler goering fancied himself a collector of art he went through europe through world war ii stealing extorting and occasionally buying various paintings for his collection
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 41.21 52.14 <o,f0,male> and what he really wanted was something by vermeer hitler had two of them and he didn 't have any so he finally found an art dealer a dutch art dealer named han van meegeren
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 52.21 57.62 <o,f0,male> who sold him a wonderful vermeer for the cost of what would now be ten million dollars
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 57.85 60.03 <o,f0,male> and it was his favorite artwork ever
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 68.02 84.34 <o,f0,male> then the allied forces went through his collections and found the paintings and went after the people who sold it to him and at some point the dutch police came into amsterdam and arrested van meegeren van meegeren was charged with the crime of treason which is itself punishable by death
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 85.06 88.89 <o,f0,male> six weeks into his prison sentence van meegeren confessed
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 89.54 91.56 <o,f0,male> but he didn 't confess to treason
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 96.34 98.55 <o,f0,male> i painted it myself i 'm a forger
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 117 131.21 <o,f0,male> they brought him in he painted a beautiful vermeer and then the charges of treason were dropped he had a lesser charge of forgery got a year sentence and died a hero to the dutch people
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 131.21 144.75 <o,f0,male> there 's a lot more to be said about van meegeren but i want to turn now to goering who 's pictured here being interrogated at nuremberg now goering was by all accounts a terrible man even for a nazi he was a terrible man
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 145.05 148.81 <o,f0,male> his american interrogators described him as an amicable psychopath
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 169.91 175.21 <o,f0,male> he had discovered after all that the painting he thought was this was actually
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 195.12 202.72 <o,f0,male> finest masterpiece his best work people would come from all over the world to see it was actually a forgery it was not that painting
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 239.01 244.73 <o,f0,male> i don 't doubt that that plays some role but what i want to convince you of today is that there 's something else going on
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 245.03 258.99 <o,f0,male> i want to convince you that humans are to some extent natural born essentialists what i mean by this is we don 't just respond to things as we see them or feel them or hear them rather our response is conditioned on our
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 258.99 265.89 <o,f0,male> beliefs about what they really are what they came from what they 're made of what their hidden nature is
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 265.93 270.36 <o,f0,male> i want to suggest that this is true not just for how we think about things but how we react
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 276.48 285.55 <o,f0,male> higher level pleasures like art but even the most seemingly simple pleasures are affected by our beliefs about hidden essences so take
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 306.75 313.47 <o,f0,male> but what 's more interesting is how it tastes to you will depend critically on what you think you 're eating
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 313.64 327.07 <o,f0,male> so one demonstration of this was done with young children how do you make children not just be more likely to eat carrots and drink milk but to get more pleasure from eating carrots and drinking milk to think they taste better it 's simple
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 327.09 338.05 <o,f0,male> you tell them they 're from mcdonald 's they believe mcdonald 's food is tastier and it leads them to experience it as tastier how do you get adults to really enjoy wine it 's very simple
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 366.23 377.58 <o,f0,male> parts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward light up like a christmas tree it 's not just that you say it 's more pleasurable you say you like it more you really experience it in a different way
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 397.65 405.84 <o,f0,male> you probably think the picture on the left is male the one on the right is female if that belief turns out to be mistaken it will make a difference
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 408.03 422.93 <o,f0,male> it will make a difference if they turn out to be much younger or much older than you think they are it will make a difference if you were to discover that the person you 're looking at with lust is actually a disguised version of your son or daughter your mother or father knowing somebody 's your kin typically kills the libido
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 422.93 433.5 <o,f0,male> maybe one of the most heartening findings from the psychology of pleasure is there 's more to looking good than your physical appearance if you like somebody they look better to you
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 433.5 441.22 <o,f0,male> this is why spouses in happy marriages tend to think that their husband or wife looks much better than anyone else thinks that they do
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 443.82 460.58 <o,f0,male> a particularly dramatic example of this comes from a neurological disorder known as capgras syndrome so capgras syndrome is a disorder where you get a specific delusion sufferers of capgras syndrome believe that the people they love most in the world have been replaced by perfect duplicates
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 460.58 472.33 <o,f0,male> now often a result of capgras syndrome is tragic people have murdered those that they loved believing that they were murdering an imposter but there 's at least one case where capgras syndrome had a happy ending
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 472.33 483.25 <o,f0,male> this was recorded in one thousand nine hundred and thirty one research described a woman with capgras syndrome who complained about her poorly endowed and sexually inadequate lover but that was before she got capgras syndrome
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 483.61 501.37 <o,f0,male> after she got it she was happy to report that she has discovered that he possessed a double who was rich virile handsome and aristocratic of course it was the same man but she was seeing him in different ways as a third example consider consumer products so one reason why you might like something is its utility
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 501.38 507.3 <o,f0,male> you can put shoes on your feet you can play golf with golf clubs and chewed up bubble gum doesn 't do anything at all for you
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 507.5 513.51 <o,f0,male> but each of these three objects has value above and beyond what it can do for you based on its history
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 513.84 529.69 <o,f0,male> the golf clubs were owned by john f kennedy and sold for three quarters of a million dollars at auction the bubble gum was chewed up by pop star britney spears and sold for several hundreds of dollars and in fact there 's a thriving market in the partially eaten food of beloved people
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 565.31 570 <o,f0,male> you could get something that looked like it or felt like it but you couldn 't get the same object back
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 570.6 587.76 <o,f0,male> with my colleagues george newman and gil diesendruck we 've looked to see what sort of factors what sort of history matters for the objects that people like so in one of our experiments we asked people to name a famous person who they adored a living person they adored so one answer was george clooney
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 587.76 591.22 <o,f0,male> then we asked them how much would you pay for george clooney 's sweater
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 598.61 612.34 <o,f0,male> then we asked other groups of subjects we gave them different restrictions and different conditions so for instance we told some people look you can buy the sweater but you can 't tell anybody you own it and you can
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 627.4 629.71 <o,f0,male> that causes a huge drop in the value
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 656.13 673.44 <o,f0,male> in the case of artwork the history is special indeed the philosopher denis dutton in his wonderful book the art instinct makes the case that the value of an artwork is rooted in assumptions about the human performance underlying its creation and that could explain the difference between an original and a forgery they may look alike
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 673.78 679.65 <o,f0,male> but they have a different history the original is typically the product of a creative act the forgery isn 't
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 679.86 689.57 <o,f0,male> i think this approach can explain differences in people 's taste in art this is a work by jackson pollock who here likes the work of jackson pollock
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 695.69 709.88 <o,f0,male> i 'm not going to make a claim about who 's right but i will make an empirical claim about people 's intuitions which is that if you like the work of jackson pollock you 'll tend more so than the people who don 't like it to believe that these works are difficult to create
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 710.1 713.9 <o,f0,male> that they require a lot of time and energy and creative energy
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 713.9 730.84 <o,f0,male> i use jackson pollock on purpose as an example because there 's a young american artist who paints very much in the style of jackson pollock and her work was worth many tens of thousands of dollars in large part because she 's a very young artist this is marla olmstead who did most of her work when she was three years old
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 730.84 743.16 <o,f0,male> the interesting thing about marla olmstead is her family made the mistake of inviting the television program sixty minutes ii into their house to film her painting and they then reported that her father was coaching her
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 743.86 747.78 <o,f0,male> when this came out on television the value of her art dropped to nothing
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 748.57 753.06 <o,f0,male> it was the same art physically but the history had changed
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 753.06 765 <o,f0,male> i 've been focusing now on the visual arts but i want to give two examples from music this is joshua bell a very famous violinist and the washington post reporter gene weingarten decided to enlist him for an audacious experiment
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 765 773.07 <o,f0,male> the question is how much would people like joshua bell the music of joshua bell if they didn 't know they were listening to joshua bell
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 773.49 784.07 <o,f0,male> so he got joshua bell to take his million dollar violin down to a washington d c subway station and stand in the corner and see how much money he would make and here 's a brief clip of this
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 815.45 820.59 <o,f0,male> extravagant black tie affair so she 's stunned that he 's standing in a subway station
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 821.13 825.04 <o,f0,male> so she 's struck with pity she reaches into her purse and hands him a twenty
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 889.77 894.36 <o,f0,male> half of them are told that they 're being given the shocks by somebody in another room
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 894.6 902.38 <o,f0,male> but the person in the other room doesn 't know they 're giving them shocks there 's no malevolence they 're just pressing a button the first shock is recorded as very painful
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 902.5 909.03 <o,f0,male> the second shock feels less painful because you get a bit used to it the third drops the fourth the fifth the pain
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 928.65 933.4 <o,f0,male> the most extreme example of this is that in some cases
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 933.4 949.01 <o,f0,male> pain under the right circumstances can transform into pleasure humans have this extraordinarily interesting property that will often seek out low level doses of pain in controlled circumstances and take pleasure from it as in the eating of hot chili peppers
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 949.01 950.97 <o,f0,male> and roller coaster rides
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 950.97 955.37 <o,f0,male> the point was nicely summarized by the poet john milton
PaulBloom_2011G 1 PaulBloom_2011G 955.73 960.45 <o,f0,male> who wrote the mind is its own place and in itself can make a heaven of hell
