PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 13.41 21.77 <o,f0,male> there's an ancient and universal concept that words have power that spells exist and if we could only pronounce the right words then
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 22.61 32.30 <o,f0,male> you know an avalanche would come and wipe out the hobbits right so this is a very attractive idea because we're very lazy like the sorcerer 's apprentice or the world 's greatest computer programmer
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 41.85 50.23 <o,f0,male> and so of course with lots of programmable computers and robots around this is an easy thing to picture so how many of you know what i'm talking about raise your right hand
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 50.71 59.92 <o,f0,male> how many of you don't know what i'm talking about raise your left hand ok all right so that's great so that was too easy you guys have very insecure computers ok
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 60.56 68.25 <o,f0,male> so now the thing is that this is a different kind of spell this is a computer program made of zeros and ones it can be pronounced on a computer it does something like this
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 68.48 81.91 <o,f0,male> the important thing is we can write it in a high level language a computer magician can write this thing it can be compiled into this into zeros and ones and pronounced by a computer and that's what makes computers powerful these high level languages that can be compiled and so
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 82.99 96.60 <o,f0,male> i'm here to tell you you don't need a computer to actually have a spell in fact what you can do at the molecular level is that if you encode information you encode a spell or program as molecules then physics can actually directly interpret that information
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 106.50 114.43 <o,f0,male> that turns it into a nanomachine that actually cuts dna and the interesting thing is that if you change the sequence you change the three dimensional folding
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 114.54 123.93 <o,f0,male> you get now a dna stapler instead these are the kind of molecular programs that we want to be able to write but the problem is we don't know the machine language of proteins we don't have a compiler for proteins
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 124.20 134.35 <o,f0,male> so i've joined a growing band of people that try to make molecular spells using dna we use dna because it's cheaper it's easier to handle it's something that we understand really well we understand it so well in fact
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 134.59 147.04 <o,f0,male> that we think we can actually write programming languages for dna and have molecular compilers so then we think we can do that and my first question doing this or one of my questions doing this was how can you make an arbitrary shape or pattern out of dna
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 147.46 154.34 <o,f0,male> and i decided to use a type of dna origami where you take a long strand of dna and fold it into whatever shape or pattern you might want
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 154.62 162.72 <o,f0,male> so here 's a shape i actually spent about a year in my home in my underwear coding like linus in that picture before and this program takes a shape
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 195.62 208.04 <o,f0,male> and then add this long strand i was telling you about that i've stolen from a virus and then what happens is you heat this whole thing up to about boiling you cool it down to room temperature and as you do what happens is those short strands they do the following thing
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 208.35 217.35 <o,f0,male> each one of them binds that long strand in one place and then has a second half that binds that long strand in a distant place and brings those two parts of the long strand
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 224.87 232.39 <o,f0,male> long strand into the shape that you're looking for it'll approximate that shape we do this for real in the test tube in each little drop of water you get fifty billion of these guys
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 232.63 245.20 <o,f0,male> you can look with a microscope and see them on a surface and the neat thing is that if you change the sequence and change the spell you just change the sequence of the staples you can make a molecule that looks like this and you know he likes to hang out with his
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 254.82 263.15 <o,f0,male> you can get arbitrary patterns so on a rectangle you can paint patterns of north and south america or the words dna so
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 263.46 273.85 <o,f0,male> that's dna origami that's one way there are many ways of casting molecular spells using dna what we really want to do in the end is learn how to program self assembly so that we can build
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 274.81 280.54 <o,f0,male> right we want to be able to build technological artifacts that are maybe good for the world we want to learn how to build
