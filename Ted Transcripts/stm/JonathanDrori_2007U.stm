JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 41.63 52.59 <o,f0,male> science educators so that 's science teachers and also of seven year olds and i find that the seven year olds do marginally better than the other audiences which is somewhat surprising
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 52.83 71.87 <o,f0,male> so the first question and you might want to write this down either on a bit of paper physically or a virtual piece of paper in your head and for viewers at home you can try this as well a little seed weighs next to nothing and a tree weighs a lot right i think we agree on that where does the tree get the stuff that makes up
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 71.87 79.61 <o,f0,male> this chair right where does all this stuff come from knocks and your next question
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 79.8 85.69 <o,f0,male> is can you light a little torch bulb with a battery a bulb
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 85.72 87.36 <o,f0,male> and one piece of wire
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 97.68 100.99 <o,f0,male> the third question is why is it hotter in summer than in winter
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 101.48 103.61 <o,f0,male> i think we can probably agree
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 104.07 106.23 <o,f0,male> that it is hotter in summer than in winter
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 114.59 120.5 <o,f0,male> scribble a plan diagram of the solar system showing the shape of the planets orbits
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 121.06 124.72 <o,f0,male> would you be able to do that and if you can just scribble a pattern
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 129.41 138.76 <o,f0,male> children get their ideas not from teachers as teachers often think but actually from common sense from experience of the world around them
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 138.76 154.02 <o,f0,male> from all the things that go on between them and their peers and their carers and their parents and all of that experience and one of the great experts in this field of course was bless him cardinal wolsey
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 154.02 158.81 <o,f0,male> be very careful what you get into people 's heads because it 's virtually impossible to shift it afterwards
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 159.02 162.67 <o,f0,male> right
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 183.53 189.86 <o,f0,male> now i guarantee that about eighty five percent of you or maybe it 's fewer at ted will have said it comes out of the ground
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 189.86 204.89 <o,f0,male> and some people probably two of you will come up and argue with me afterwards and say that actually it comes out of the ground now if that was true we 'd have trucks going round the country filling people 's gardens in with soil it 'd be a fantastic business but actually we don 't do that the mass of this comes out of the air
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 204.89 214.33 <o,f0,male> now i passed all my biology exams in britain i passed them really well but i still came out of school thinking that that stuff came out of the ground
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 214.33 233.62 <o,f0,male> second one can you light a little torch bulb with a battery bulb and one piece of wire yes you can and i 'll show you in a second how to do that now i have some rather bad news which is that i had a piece of video that i was about to show you which unfortunately the sound doesn 't work in this room so i 'm going to describe to you in true monty python fashion what happens in the video
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 268.32 270.93 <o,f0,male> and when we gave graduate engineers
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 271.12 273.44 <o,f0,male> that question they said it couldn 't be done
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 273.61 285.32 <o,f0,male> and when we gave them a battery and a piece of wire and a bulb and said can you do it they couldn 't do it right and that 's no different from imperial college in london by the way it 's not some sort of
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 288.18 291.16 <o,f0,male> as if
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 343.2 349.93 <o,f0,male> so why is it hotter in summer than in winter we learn as children that you get closer to something that 's hot and it burns you
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 353.36 371.69 <o,f0,male> by extension we think to ourselves why it 's hotter in summer than in winter must be because we 're closer to the sun i promise you that most of you will have got that oh you 're all shaking your heads but only a few of you are shaking your heads very firmly other ones are kind of going like this all right it 's hotter in summer than in winter because the rays from the sun are spread out more
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 371.81 374.5 <o,f0,male> right because of the tilt of the earth
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 374.51 389.96 <o,f0,male> and if you think the tilt is tilting us closer no it isn 't the sun is ninety three million miles away and we 're tilting like this right it makes no odds in fact in the northern hemisphere we 're further from the sun in summer as it happens but it makes no odds the difference
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 390.58 399.91 <o,f0,male> ok now the scribble of the diagram of the solar system if you believe as most of you probably do that it 's hotter in summer than in winter because we 're closer to the sun you must have drawn an ellipse
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 428.04 442.73 <o,f0,male> so here 's copernicus view of what the solar system looked like as a plan that 's pretty much what you should have on your piece of paper right and this is nasa 's view they 're stunningly similar i hope you notice the coincidence here
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 442.73 461.38 <o,f0,male> what would you do if you knew that people had this misconception right in their heads of elliptical orbits caused by our experiences as children what sort of diagram would you show them of the solar system to show that it 's not really like that you 'd show them something like this wouldn 't you it 's a plan looking down from above but no look what i found in the textbooks
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 500.38 507.51 <o,f0,male> we look for evidence that reinforces our models and some folks are just all too able and willing to provide the evidence that reinforces the models
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 507.51 521.69 <o,f0,male> so being i 'm in the united states i 'll have a dig at the europeans these are examples of what i would say is bad practice in science teaching centers these pictures are from la villette in france and the welcome wing of the science museum in london
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 521.69 528.05 <o,f0,male> and if you look at the kind of the way these things are constructed there 's a lot of mediation by glass and it 's very blue and
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 595.77 608.91 <o,f0,male> so children are not empty vessels ok so as monty python would have it this is a bit lord privy seal to say so but this is children are not empty vessels they come with their own ideas and their own theories and unless you work with those
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 608.91 615.99 <o,f0,male> then you won 't be able to shift them right and i probably haven 't shifted your ideas of how the world and universe operates either
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 630.48 645.81 <o,f0,male> so we 're not empty vessels the mental models that we have as children persist into adulthood poor teaching actually does more harm than good in this country and in britain magnetism is understood better by children before they 've been to school than afterwards
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 693.31 707.5 <o,f0,male> is you know how does an aircraft 's wing create lift an obvious question and you 'll have an answer now in your heads and the second question to that then is ensure you 've explained how it is that planes can fly upside down
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 723.34 725.41 <o,f0,male> always wanted to say that in this country
