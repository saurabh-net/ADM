NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 20.34 22.61 <o,f0,female> more than cars or the internet
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 22.9 28.49 <o,f0,female> or even that little mobile device we keep talking about the technology you 're using the most almost every day
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 47.94 52.54 <o,f0,female> in that way sitting has become the smoking of our generation
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 53.93 58.93 <o,f0,female> of course there 's health consequences to this scary ones besides the waist
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 58.93 74.11 <o,f0,female> things like breast cancer and colon cancer are directly tied to our lack of physical activity ten percent in fact on both of those six percent for heart disease seven percent for type two diabetes which is what my father died
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 78.75 80.82 <o,f0,female> but if you 're anything like me it won 't
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 81.52 84.14 <o,f0,female> what did get me moving was a social
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 105.02 114.95 <o,f0,female> and yet i 've taken that idea and made it my own so instead of going to coffee meetings or fluorescent lit conference room meetings i ask people to go on a walking meeting
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 115.23 118.5 <o,f0,female> to the tune of twenty to thirty miles a week
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 127.6 129.55 <o,f0,female> or you could take care of obligations
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 130.16 133.14 <o,f0,female> and one always came at the cost of the other
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 133.57 138.38 <o,f0,female> so now several hundred of these walking meetings later i 've learned a few things
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 138.43 150.87 <o,f0,female> first there 's this amazing thing about actually getting out of the box that leads to out of the box thinking whether it 's nature or the exercise itself it certainly works and second and probably the more
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 157.12 167.29 <o,f0,female> when they 're really not that way and if we 're going to solve problems and look at the world really differently whether it 's in governance or business or environmental issues job creation
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 167.53 178.97 <o,f0,female> maybe we can think about how to reframe those problems as having both things be true because it was when that happened with this walk and talk idea that things became doable and sustainable and viable
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 179.61 186.81 <o,f0,female> so i started this talk talking about the tush so i 'll end with the bottom line which is walk and talk
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 187.29 197.04 <o,f0,female> walk the talk you 'll be surprised at how fresh air drives fresh thinking and in the way that you do you 'll bring into your life an entirely new set of ideas
