RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 12.99 15.11 <o,f0,male> teach chemistry
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 26.75 30.82 <o,f0,male> over and over some people nodding yes
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 30.82 47.01 <o,f0,male> recently i showed this to my students and i just asked them to try and explain why it happened the questions and conversations that followed were fascinating check out this video that maddie from my period three class sent me that evening
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 58.12 69.92 <o,f0,male> obviously as maddie 's chemistry teacher i love that she went home and continued to geek out about this kind of ridiculous demonstration that we did in class
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 69.92 74.34 <o,f0,male> but what fascinated me more is that maddie 's curiosity took her to a new level
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 74.4 91.91 <o,f0,male> if you look inside that beaker you might see a candle maddie 's using temperature to extend this phenomenon to a new scenario you know questions and curiosity like maddie 's are magnets that draw us towards our teachers and they transcend
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 92 105.25 <o,f0,male> all technology or buzzwords in education but if we place these technologies before student inquiry we can be robbing ourselves of our greatest tool as teachers
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 105.26 107.35 <o,f0,male> our students questions
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 107.45 126.04 <o,f0,male> for example flipping a boring lecture from the classroom to the screen of a mobile device might save instructional time but if it is the focus of our students experience it 's the same dehumanizing chatter just wrapped up in fancy clothing but if instead we have the guts
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 126.04 131 <o,f0,male> to confuse our students perplex them and evoke real questions
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 131.2 136.92 <o,f0,male> through those questions we as teachers have information that we can use to tailor robust
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 137.27 140.12 <o,f0,male> and informed methods of blended instruction
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 140.88 145.87 <o,f0,male> so twenty first century lingo jargon mumbo jumbo aside
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 146.09 149.61 <o,f0,male> the truth is i 've been teaching for thirteen years now
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 150.08 152.57 <o,f0,male> and it took a life threatening situation
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 162.35 167.21 <o,f0,male> not some scripted curriculum that gave them tidbits of random information
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 167.61 171.07 <o,f0,male> in may of two thousand and ten at thirty five years old
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 171.28 183.38 <o,f0,male> with a two year old at home and my second child on the way i was diagnosed with a large aneurysm at the base of my thoracic aorta this led to open heart surgery this is the actual real email from my doctor right
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 183.38 187.4 <o,f0,male> there now when i got this i was press caps lock
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 187.43 190.88 <o,f0,male> absolutely freaked out okay but
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 221.22 227.01 <o,f0,male> and third through intense reflection he gathered the information that he needed
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 227.07 230.67 <o,f0,male> to design and revise the procedure and then with a steady hand
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 241.47 243.99 <o,f0,male> that i bring to my lesson planning still today
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 244.36 248.28 <o,f0,male> rule number one curiosity comes first
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 248.35 253.1 <o,f0,male> questions can be windows to great instruction but not the other way around
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 257.82 260.45 <o,f0,male> we 're all teachers we know learning is ugly
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 260.48 262.31 <o,f0,male> and just because the scientific
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 262.31 268.68 <o,f0,male> method is allocated to page five of section one point two of chapter one of the one that we all skip
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 278.46 280.28 <o,f0,male> and rule number three
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 285.3 288.02 <o,f0,male> but it also deserves our revision
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 288.48 291.02 <o,f0,male> can we be the surgeons of our classrooms
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 291.1 295.31 <o,f0,male> as if what we are doing one day will save lives our students our worth it
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 295.81 297.64 <o,f0,male> and each case is different
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 310 318.38 <o,f0,male> southern family and on the left riley now riley 's going to be a big girl in a couple weeks here she 's going to be four years old
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 318.53 322.47 <o,f0,male> and anyone who knows a four year old knows that they love to ask
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 322.92 325.57 <o,f0,male> why yeah why
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 325.57 332.61 <o,f0,male> i could teach this kid anything because she is curious about everything we all were at that age
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 333.06 339.01 <o,f0,male> but the challenge is really for riley 's future teachers the ones she has yet to meet
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 339.19 341.44 <o,f0,male> how will they grow this curiosity
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 341.76 346.66 <o,f0,male> you see i would argue that riley is a metaphor for all kids
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 350.76 355.59 <o,f0,male> to the senior who 's checked out before the year 's even begun or that empty desk
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 355.67 358.29 <o,f0,male> in the back of an urban middle school 's classroom
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 359.05 366.22 <o,f0,male> but if we as educators leave behind this simple role as disseminators of content and embrace a new paradigm
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 366.33 369.3 <o,f0,male> as cultivators of curiosity and inquiry
RamseyMusallam_2013S 1 RamseyMusallam_2013S 369.85 375.69 <o,f0,male> we just might bring a little bit more meaning to their school day and spark their imagination thank you very much
