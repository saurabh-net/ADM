UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 18.61 19.72 <o,f0,male> i started
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 25.64 34.80 <o,f0,male> with the possibility to fly cross country distance just with the use of thermals to soar also different aerobatic
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 35.72 43.62 <o,f0,male> possible with a paraglider from there i started with skydiving in this picture you can see there is a four way skydive
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 54.29 66.11 <o,f0,male> for the film itself and also for the judging from regular relative skydiving i went on to freeflying freeflying is more the three dimensional
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 75.47 84.09 <o,f0,male> flying head down and that's me in the background carving around the whole formation in freefall also with the helmet cam to film this jump
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 86.11 95.50 <o,f0,male> from freeflying i went on to skysurfing skysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet you can imagine with this big
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 97.22 107.37 <o,f0,male> a skysurfing board there is a lot of force a lot of power of course i can use this power for example for nice spinning we call it helicopter moves
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 109.29 117.76 <o,f0,male> from there i went on to wingsuit flying wingsuit flying is a suit that i can make fly just only with my body
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 118.75 128.09 <o,f0,male> put some tension on my body tension on my suit i can make it fly and as you see the fall rate is much much slower because of the
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 129.82 141.32 <o,f0,male> with a proper body position i'm able to really move forward to gain quite some distance this is a jump i did in rio de janeiro you can see the
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 145.07 152.40 <o,f0,male> from there with all the skills and knowledge from paragliding and all the different disciplines in skydiving i went on to base jumping
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 152.81 158.65 <o,f0,male> base jumping is skydiving from fixed objects like buildings
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 161.21 173.59 <o,f0,male> and earth meaning mountains cliffs it's for sure for me it's the ultimate feeling of being in free fall with all the visual references
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 174.74 185.15 <o,f0,male> so my goal soon was to discover new places that nobody had jumped before so in summer two thousand i was the first to base jump the eiger north face in switzerland
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 185.86 193.87 <o,f0,male> two years after this i was the first to base jump from matterhorn a very famous mountain that probably everybody knows in here
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 195.09 202.04 <o,f0,male> two thousand and five i did a base jump from the eiger from the monk and from the jungfrau three very
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 213.09 217.40 <o,f0,male> two thousand and eight i jumped the eiffel tower in paris
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 229.09 238.32 <o,f0,male> so with some friends we started to do different tricks like for example this jump here i jumped from a paraglider or here everybody
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 239.57 252.20 <o,f0,male> was freezing pretty much except me because it was very cold in austria where we did this filming everybody sitting in a basket and i was on top of the balloon ready to slide down with my
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 258.20 260.73 <o,f0,male> from a moving truck on the
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 279.68 282.26 <o,f0,male> of course you need to be in physical
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 282.92 289.47 <o,f0,male> very good condition so i'm training a lot you need to have the best possible equipment
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 290.33 290.65 <o,f0,male> and
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 305.50 313.58 <o,f0,male> so for two thousand and nine i'm training hard for my two new projects the first one i want to set a
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 314.99 323.01 <o,f0,male> in flying from a cliff with my wingsuit and i want to set a new record with the longest distance
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 325.14 332.10 <o,f0,male> for my second project i have a sensational idea of a jump that never has been done before
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 335.92 345.19 <o,f0,male> following movie you will see that i'm much better in flying a wingsuit than speaking in english enjoy and thank you very much
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 602.02 609.12 <o,f0,male> pretty much i believe this is probably the closest possibility to come to the dream of being able to fly
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 622.24 632.80 <o,f0,female> not possible to land a wingsuit yet jc yet but people are trying are you among those you're not going to commit are you among those trying to do it ue it's a dream it's a dream yeah we're still working on it
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 632.97 638.58 <o,f0,male> and we're developing the wingsuits to get better performance to get more knowledge and
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 656.30 669.33 <o,f0,male> no smoke is for two reasons you can see the speed you can see the way where i was flying that's reason number one and reason number two it's much easier for the camera guy to film
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 670.83 681.64 <o,f0,female> so the wingsuit is set up to deliberately release smoke so that you can be tracked one more question what do you do to to cover your face because i just keep thinking of going that fast and having your whole face smushed backwards are you in a
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 688.14 690.11 <o,f0,female> and is that how you usually
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 691.22 701.79 <o,f0,male> a helmet in the mountains i'm always wearing a helmet because of landings usually it's difficult it's not like regular skydiving where you have like the big landings so you have to be prepared
UeliGegenschatz_2009 1 UeliGegenschatz_2009 702.31 705.26 <o,f0,female> now is there anything you don't do do people come to you with projects and say
