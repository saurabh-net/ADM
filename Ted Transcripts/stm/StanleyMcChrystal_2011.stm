StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 17.74 21.97 <o,f0,male> on a tuesday morning i conducted a parachute jump at fort bragg north carolina
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 22.1 27.51 <o,f0,male> it was a routine training jump like many more i 'd done since i became a paratrooper twenty seven years before
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 28.15 32.95 <o,f0,male> we went down to the airfield early because this is the army and you always go early
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 33.92 38.29 <o,f0,male> you do some routine refresher training and then you go to put on your parachute
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 38.85 57.85 <o,f0,male> and a buddy helps you and you put on the t ten parachute and you 're very careful how you put the straps particularly the leg straps because they go between your legs and then you put on your reserve and then you put on your heavy rucksack and then a jumpmaster comes and he 's an experienced nco in parachute operations he checks you out he grabs your adjusting straps and he tightens everything so that your
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 62.7 65.79 <o,f0,male> he 's tightened so your voice goes up a couple octaves as well
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 67.41 70.59 <o,f0,male> then you sit down and you wait a little while because this is the army
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 71.09 84.06 <o,f0,male> then you load the aircraft and then you stand up and you get on and you kind of lumber to the aircraft like this in a line of people and you sit down on canvas seats on either side of the aircraft and you wait a little bit longer because this is the air force teaching the army how to wait
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 86.51 88.36 <o,f0,male> then you take off
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 89.21 94.01 <o,f0,male> and it 's painful enough now and i think it 's designed this way it 's painful enough so you want to jump
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 94.18 96.32 <o,f0,male> you didn 't really want to jump but you want out
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 96.85 112.34 <o,f0,male> so you get in the aircraft you 're flying along and at twenty minutes out these jumpmasters start giving you commands they give twenty minutes that 's a time warning you sit there ok then they give you ten minutes and of course you 're responding with all of these and that 's to boost everybody 's confidence to show that you 're not scared
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 112.34 117.27 <o,f0,male> then they give you get ready then they go outboard personnel stand up
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 117.81 124.76 <o,f0,male> if you 're an outboard personnel now you stand up if you 're an inboard personnel stand up and then you hook up and you hook up your
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 125.04 131.32 <o,f0,male> static line and at that point you think hey guess what i 'm probably going to jump there 's no way to get out of this at this point
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 131.58 137.48 <o,f0,male> you go through some additional checks and then they open the door and this was that tuesday morning in september
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 137.54 141.14 <o,f0,male> and it was pretty nice outside so nice air comes flowing in
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 142.16 144.58 <o,f0,male> the jumpmasters start to check the door
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 145.51 152.37 <o,f0,male> and then when it 's time to go a green light goes and the jumpmaster goes go the first guy goes and you 're just in line and you just kind of lumber to the door
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 152.48 154.96 <o,f0,male> jump is a misnomer you fall
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 155.13 157.01 <o,f0,male> you fall outside the door
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 169.47 172.06 <o,f0,male> an airborne sergeant had taught me to do that
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 172.57 177.45 <o,f0,male> i have no idea whether it makes any difference but he seemed to make sense and i wasn 't going to test
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 177.46 179.35 <o,f0,male> the hypothesis that he 'd be wrong
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 181.09 184.31 <o,f0,male> and then you wait for the opening shock for your parachute to open
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 184.6 188.4 <o,f0,male> if you don 't get an opening shock you don 't get a parachute you 've got a whole new problem set
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 189.55 198.62 <o,f0,male> but typically you do typically it opens and of course if your leg straps aren 't set right at that point you get another little thrill
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 199.15 200.94 <o,f0,male> so then you look around
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 207 213.91 <o,f0,male> you can 't delay that much and you really can 't decide where you hit very much because they pretend you can steer but
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 227.34 231.9 <o,f0,male> now the army teaches you to do five points of performance
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 232.06 239.87 <o,f0,male> the toes of your feet your calves your thighs your buttocks and your push up muscles it 's this elegant little
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 240.34 243.43 <o,f0,male> land twist and roll and that 's not going to hurt
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 259.76 261.43 <o,f0,male> i 'd shake my head
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 261.46 266.35 <o,f0,male> and i 'd ask myself the eternal question why didn 't i go into banking
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 274.83 278.77 <o,f0,male> and they 'd have pulled out their m four carbine and they 'd be picking up their equipment
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 278.95 282.16 <o,f0,male> they 'd be doing everything that we had taught them
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 288.14 295.1 <o,f0,male> they would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders and i realized that if they came out of combat it would be because we led them well
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 295.6 298.37 <o,f0,male> and i was hooked again on the importance of what i did
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 310.67 313.76 <o,f0,male> when we landed on the drop zone everything had changed
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 314.29 320.48 <o,f0,male> and what we thought about the possibility of those young soldiers going into combat as being theoretical
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 320.61 322.12 <o,f0,male> was now very very real
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 322.5 324.61 <o,f0,male> and leadership seemed important
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 324.89 330.48 <o,f0,male> but things had changed i was a forty six year old brigadier general i 'd been successful
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 330.8 332.85 <o,f0,male> but things changed so much
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 337.3 343.79 <o,f0,male> i was raised with traditional stories of leadership robert e lee john buford at gettysburg
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 345.1 346.85 <o,f0,male> and i also was raised
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 346.87 349.98 <o,f0,male> with personal examples of leadership
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 350.19 352.16 <o,f0,male> this was my father in vietnam
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 352.54 358.44 <o,f0,male> and i was raised to believe that soldiers were strong and wise and brave and faithful
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 358.47 360.43 <o,f0,male> they didn 't lie cheat steal
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 361.56 365.89 <o,f0,male> or abandon their comrades and i still believe real leaders are like that
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 369.49 387.61 <o,f0,male> but in my first twenty five years of career i had a bunch of different experiences one of my first battalion commanders i worked in his battalion for eighteen months and the only conversation he ever had with lt mcchrystal was at mile eighteen of a twenty five mile road march and he chewed my ass for about forty seconds
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 387.8 390.14 <o,f0,male> and i 'm not sure that was real interaction
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 390.61 395.7 <o,f0,male> but then a couple of years later when i was a company commander i went out to the national training center
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 395.75 397.33 <o,f0,male> and we did an operation
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 397.49 408.23 <o,f0,male> and my company did a dawn attack you know the classic dawn attack you prepare all night move to the line of departure and i had an armored organization at that point we move forward and we get wiped out
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 408.4 412.21 <o,f0,male> i mean wiped out immediately the enemy didn 't break a sweat doing it
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 412.86 421.03 <o,f0,male> and after the battle they bring this mobile theater and they do what they call an after action review to teach you what you 've done wrong sort of leadership by humiliation
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 426.45 430.27 <o,f0,male> i walked out feeling as low as a snake 's belly in a wagon rut
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 430.48 437.86 <o,f0,male> and i saw my battalion commander because i had let him down and i went up to apologize to him and he said stanley i thought you did great
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 438.76 441.65 <o,f0,male> and in one sentence he lifted me
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 441.65 449.28 <o,f0,male> put me back on my feet and taught me that leaders can let you fail and yet not let you be a failure
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 451.26 456.33 <o,f0,male> when nine eleven came forty six year old brig gen mcchrystal sees a whole new world
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 457.28 460.19 <o,f0,male> first the things that are obvious that you 're familiar with
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 460.3 470.41 <o,f0,male> the environment changed the speed the scrutiny the sensitivity of everything now is so fast sometimes it evolves faster than people have time to really reflect on it
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 470.78 474.91 <o,f0,male> but everything we do is in a different context
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 475.79 491.69 <o,f0,male> more importantly the force that i led was spread over more than twenty countries and instead of being able to get all the key leaders for a decision together in a single room and look them in the eye and build their confidence and get trust from them i 'm now leading a force that 's dispersed
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 491.7 494.1 <o,f0,male> and i 've got to use other techniques
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 494.68 501.76 <o,f0,male> i 've got to use video teleconferences i 've got to use chat i 've got to use email i 've got to use phone calls i 've got to use everything i can
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 501.92 504.06 <o,f0,male> not just for communication
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 509.99 512.01 <o,f0,male> thousands of miles from me
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 512.47 521.52 <o,f0,male> has got to communicate to me with confidence i have to have trust in them and vice versa and i also have to build their faith
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 522.16 533.49 <o,f0,male> and that 's a new kind of leadership for me we had one operation where we had to coordinate it from multiple locations an emerging opportunity came didn 't have time to get everybody together
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 534 539.49 <o,f0,male> so we had to get complex intelligence together we had to line up the ability to act
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 539.57 546.43 <o,f0,male> it was sensitive we had to go up the chain of command convince them that this was the right thing to do and do all of this
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 546.54 548.16 <o,f0,male> on electronic medium
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 554.72 572.92 <o,f0,male> and so now what we had to do is i had to reach out to try to rebuild the trust of that force rebuild their confidence me and them and them and me and our seniors and us as a force all without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder entirely new requirement
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 575.13 577.31 <o,f0,male> also the people had changed
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 577.65 585.05 <o,f0,male> you probably think that the force that i led was all steely eyed commandos with big knuckle fists carrying exotic weapons
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 592.58 595.18 <o,f0,male> it was men women young old
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 595.21 603.71 <o,f0,male> not just from military from different organizations many of them detailed to us just from a handshake and so instead of giving orders
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 603.78 608.16 <o,f0,male> you 're now building consensus and you 're building a sense of shared purpose
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 609.72 616.19 <o,f0,male> probably the biggest change was understanding that the generational difference the ages had changed so much
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 617.35 634.06 <o,f0,male> i went down to be with a ranger platoon on an operation in afghanistan and on that operation a sergeant in the platoon had lost about half his arm throwing a taliban hand grenade back at the enemy after it had landed in his fire team
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 636.59 644.37 <o,f0,male> we talked about the operation and then at the end i did what i often do with a force like that i asked where were you on nine eleven
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 645.48 652.92 <o,f0,male> and one young ranger in the back his hair 's tousled and his face is red and windblown from being in combat in the cold afghan wind
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 654.19 656.34 <o,f0,male> he said sir i was in the sixth grade
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 658.12 659.82 <o,f0,male> and it reminded me
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 664.44 666.2 <o,f0,male> and shared consciousness
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 666.33 676.42 <o,f0,male> and yet he has different experiences in many cases a different vocabulary a completely different skill set in terms of digital media
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 680.89 683.77 <o,f0,male> and yet we need to have that shared sense
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 685.71 701.85 <o,f0,male> it also produced something which i call an inversion of expertise because we had so many changes at the lower levels in technology and tactics and whatnot that suddenly the things that we grew up doing wasn 't what the force was doing anymore so how does a leader
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 702.15 708.85 <o,f0,male> stay credible and legitimate when they haven 't done what the people you 're leading are doing
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 709.49 716.6 <o,f0,male> and it 's a brand new leadership challenge and it forced me to become a lot more transparent a lot more willing to listen
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 716.79 720.15 <o,f0,male> a lot more willing to be reverse mentored from lower
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 721.42 726.34 <o,f0,male> and yet again you 're not all in one room
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 732.96 742.91 <o,f0,male> you don 't reset or recharge your battery every time i stood in front of a screen one night in iraq with one of my senior officers and we watched a firefight from one of our forces
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 742.91 754.82 <o,f0,male> and i remembered his son was in our force and i said john where 's your son and how is he and he said sir he 's fine thanks for asking i said where is he now and he pointed at the screen he said he 's in that firefight
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 756.02 761 <o,f0,male> think about watching your brother father daughter son wife
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 761.23 764.9 <o,f0,male> in a firefight in real time and you can 't do anything about it
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 765.88 772.28 <o,f0,male> think about knowing that over time and it 's a new cumulative pressure on leaders and you have to watch and take care of each other
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 774.96 777.77 <o,f0,male> i probably learned the most about relationships
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 785.08 793.06 <o,f0,male> much of my career in the ranger regiment and every morning in the ranger regiment every ranger and there are more than two thousand of them says a six stanza ranger creed
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 793.07 802.28 <o,f0,male> you may know one line of it it says i 'll never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy and it 's not a mindless mantra and it 's not a poem
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 823.46 832.02 <o,f0,male> and they 've lived up to it which gives it special power and so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 832.73 836.18 <o,f0,male> and i learned personal relationships were more important than ever
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 836.31 845 <o,f0,male> we were in a difficult operation in afghanistan in two thousand and seven and an old friend of mine that i had spent many years at various points of my career with
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 845.37 847.4 <o,f0,male> godfather to one of their kids
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 849.06 854.6 <o,f0,male> he sent me a note just in an envelope that had a quote from sherman to grant that said i knew if i ever got
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 854.6 856.19 <o,f0,male> in a tight spot
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 856.56 859.12 <o,f0,male> that you would come if alive
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 860.69 864.25 <o,f0,male> and having that kind of relationship for me turned out to be critical
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 864.48 867.62 <o,f0,male> at many points in my career and i learned that you have to give that
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 868.87 871.16 <o,f0,male> in this environment because it 's tough
StanleyMcChrystal_2011 1 StanleyMcChrystal_2011 885.79 887.68 <o,f0,male> this isn 't easy stuff
