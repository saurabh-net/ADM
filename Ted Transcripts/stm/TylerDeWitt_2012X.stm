TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 28.4 38.07 <o,f0,male> but i 'm slowly coming to this horrifying realization that my students just might not be learning anything
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 50.7 60.01 <o,f0,male> and so i 'm so excited to discuss this with them and i come in and i say can somebody please explain the main ideas and why this is so cool
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 60.01 64.46 <o,f0,female> there 's silence
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 64.46 70.29 <o,f0,male> finally my favorite student she looks me straight in the eye and she says the reading sucked
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 72.79 83.87 <o,f0,male> and then she clarified she said you know what i don 't mean that it sucks it means that i didn 't understand a word of it it 's boring um who cares and it sucks
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 83.87 93.98 <o,f0,male> these sympathetic smiles spread all throughout the room now and i realize that all of my other students are in the same boat
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 107.5 109.48 <o,f0,female> i
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 120.99 125.64 <o,f0,male> the main characters in the story are bacteria
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 125.64 130.82 <o,f0,male> and viruses these guys are blown up a couple million times
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 130.82 147.12 <o,f0,male> the real bacteria and viruses are so small we can 't see them without a microscope and you guys might know bacteria and viruses because they both make us sick but what a lot of people don 't know is that viruses can also make bacteria sick
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 147.12 153.43 <o,f0,male> now the story that i start telling my kids it starts out like a horror story
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 153.43 160.1 <o,f0,male> once upon a time there 's this happy little bacterium don 't get too attached to
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 171.8 180.27 <o,f0,male> and then things get really horrible as his skin rips apart and he sees a virus coming out from his insides
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 180.27 187.54 <o,f0,male> and then it gets horrible when he bursts open and an army of viruses floods out from his insides
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 187.54 192.26 <o,f0,male> if ouch is right
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 192.26 210.92 <o,f0,male> if you see this and you 're a bacterium this is like your worst nightmare but if you 're a virus and you see this you cross those little legs of yours and you think we rock because it took a lot of crafty work to infect this bacterium
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 210.92 219.66 <o,f0,male> here 's what had to happen a virus grabbed onto a bacterium and it slipped its dna into it
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 219.66 238.09 <o,f0,male> the next thing is that virus dna made stuff that chopped up the bacteria dna and now that we 've gotten rid of the bacteria dna the virus dna takes control of the cell and it tells it to start making more viruses
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 238.09 245.06 <o,f0,male> because you see dna is like a blueprint that tells living things what to make
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 245.06 260.48 <o,f0,male> so this is kind of like going into a car factory and replacing the blueprints with blueprints for killer robots the workers still come the next day they do their job but they 're following different instructions
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 260.48 273.61 <o,f0,male> so replacing the bacteria dna with virus dna turns the bacteria into a factory for making viruses that is until it 's so filled with viruses that it bursts
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 273.61 282.7 <o,f0,male> but that 's not the only way that viruses infect bacteria some are much more crafty
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 282.7 291.14 <o,f0,male> when a secret agent virus infects a bacterium they do a little espionage
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 291.14 305.36 <o,f0,male> here this cloaked secret agent virus is slipping his dna into the bacterial cell but here 's the kicker it doesn 't do anything harmful not at first instead
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 305.36 311.32 <o,f0,male> it silently slips into the bacteria 's own dna and it just stays there
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 311.32 314.35 <o,f0,male> like a terrorist sleeper cell
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 314.35 317.15 <o,f0,male> waiting for instructions
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 317.15 328.65 <o,f0,male> and what 's interesting about this is now whenever this bacteria has babies the babies also have the virus dna in them
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 328.65 332.47 <o,f0,male> so now we have a whole extended bacteria family
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 332.47 345.36 <o,f0,male> filled with virus sleeper cells they 're just happily living together until a signal happens and bam all of the dna pops out
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 345.36 361.02 <o,f0,male> it takes control of these cells turns them into virus making factories and they all burst a huge extended bacteria family all dying with viruses spilling out of their guts the viruses taking over the bacterium
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 361.02 380.84 <o,f0,male> so now you understand how viruses can attack cells there are two ways on the left is what we call the lytic way where the viruses go right in and take over the cells on the right is the lysogenic way that uses secret agent viruses
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 380.84 396.64 <o,f0,male> so this stuff is not that hard right and now all of you understand it but if you 've graduated from high school i can almost guarantee you 've seen this information before but i bet it was presented in a way that it didn 't exactly stick in your mind
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 396.64 400.36 <o,f0,male> so when my students were first learning
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 400.36 402.9 <o,f0,male> why did they hate it so much
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 402.9 413.7 <o,f0,male> well there were a couple of reasons first of all i can guarantee you that their textbooks didn 't have secret agent viruses and they didn 't have horror stories
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 413.7 430.74 <o,f0,male> you know in the communication of science there is this obsession with seriousness it kills me i 'm not kidding i used to work for an educational publisher and as a writer i was always told never to use stories or fun engaging language
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 430.75 436.15 <o,f0,male> because then my work might not be viewed as serious and scientific
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 436.15 449.11 <o,f0,male> right i mean because god forbid somebody have fun when they 're learning science so we have this field of science that 's all about slime and color changes check this out
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 459.73 466.12 <o,f0,male> and then we have of course as any good scientist has to have explosions
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 468.62 474.26 <o,f0,male> if a textbook seems too much fun it 's somehow unscientific
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 474.26 476.37 <o,f0,female> now
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 476.49 494 <o,f0,male> another problem was that the language in their textbook was truly incomprehensible if we want to summarize that story that i told you earlier we could start by saying something like these viruses make copies of themselves by slipping their dna into a bacterium
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 494 497.69 <o,f0,male> the way this showed up in the textbook it looked like this
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 510.84 524.59 <o,f0,male> but here 's the thing there are plenty of people in science education who would look at this and say there 's no way that we could ever give that to students because it contains some language that isn 't completely accurate
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 524.59 538.35 <o,f0,male> for example i told you that viruses have dna well a very tiny fraction of them don 't they have something called rna instead so a professional science writer would circle that and say that has to go we have to change it to something much more technical
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 538.35 544.87 <o,f0,male> and after a team of professional science editors went over this really simple explanation
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 557.28 571.29 <o,f0,male> then it would be accurate but it would be completely impossible to understand this is horrifying you know i keep talking about this idea of telling a story
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 571.29 579.02 <o,f0,male> and it 's like science communication has taken on this idea of what i call the tyranny of precision
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 591.16 607.83 <o,f0,male> i met my friend for lunch the other day and she was wearing these ugly jeans i mean they weren 't really jeans they were more kind of like leggings but like i guess they 're actually kind of more like jeggings like but i think and you 're just like oh my god what is the point or even worse
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 607.83 613.57 <o,f0,male> science education is becoming like that guy who always says actually
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 613.57 630.91 <o,f0,male> right you want to be like oh dude we had to get up in the middle of the night and drive a hundred miles in total darkness and that guy 's like actually it was eighty seven point three miles and you 're like actually shut up i 'm just trying to tell a story
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 633.74 646.36 <o,f0,male> because good storytelling is all about emotional connection we have to convince our audience that what we 're talking about matters but just as important
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 646.36 663.26 <o,f0,male> is knowing which details we should leave out so that the main point still comes across i 'm reminded of what the architect mies van der rohe said and i paraphrase when he said that sometimes you have to lie in order to tell the truth
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 663.26 669.72 <o,f0,male> i think this sentiment is particularly relevant to science education
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 669.72 683.62 <o,f0,male> now finally i am often so disappointed when people think that i 'm advocating a dumbing down of science that 's not true at all
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 700.62 710.93 <o,f0,male> if a young learner thinks that all viruses have dna that 's not going to ruin their chances of success in science
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 710.93 723.14 <o,f0,male> but if a young learner can 't understand anything in science and learns to hate it because it all sounds like this that will ruin their chances of success
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 723.14 736.85 <o,f0,male> this needs to stop and i wish that the change could come from the institutions at the top that are perpetuating these problems and i beg them i beseech them to just stop it
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 748.08 763.9 <o,f0,male> there 's a growing number of online resources that are dedicated to just explaining science in simple understandable ways i dream of a wikipedia like website that would explain any scientific concept you can think of
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 763.9 768.42 <o,f0,male> in simple language any middle schooler can understand
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 768.42 787.18 <o,f0,male> and i myself spend most of my free time making these science videos that i put on youtube i explain chemical equilibrium using analogies to awkward middle school dances and i talk about fuel cells with stories about boys and girls at a summer camp
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 787.18 793.66 <o,f0,male> the feedback that i get is sometimes misspelled and it 's often written in lolcats
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 793.66 806.95 <o,f0,male> but nonetheless it 's so appreciative so thankful that i know this is the right way we should be communicating science
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 806.95 821.06 <o,f0,male> there 's still so much work left to be done though and if you 're involved with science in any way i urge you to join me pick up a camera start to write a blog whatever
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 821.06 826.86 <o,f0,male> but leave out the seriousness leave out the jargon make me laugh
TylerDeWitt_2012X 1 TylerDeWitt_2012X 826.86 834.05 <o,f0,male> make me care leave out those annoying details that nobody cares about and just get
