PeterDiamandis_2008 1 PeterDiamandis_2008 13.64 26.22 <o,f0,male> those of you who know me know how passionate i am about opening the space frontier so when i had the chance to give the world 's expert in gravity the experience of zero gravity it was incredible and i want to tell you that story
PeterDiamandis_2008 1 PeterDiamandis_2008 28.37 37.20 <o,f0,male> i first met him through the archon x prize for genomics it's a competition we're holding the second x prize for the first team to sequence one hundred human genomes in ten days
PeterDiamandis_2008 1 PeterDiamandis_2008 49.26 61.00 <o,f0,male> and i said i can't take you there but i can take you into weightlessness into zero g and he said on the spot absolutely yes well the only way to experience zero g on earth is actually with parabolic flight weightless flight
PeterDiamandis_2008 1 PeterDiamandis_2008 61.45 73.66 <o,f0,male> you take an airplane you fly over the top you're weightless for twenty five seconds come back down you weigh twice as much you do it again and again you can get eight ten minutes weightlessness how nasa's trained their astronauts for so long
PeterDiamandis_2008 1 PeterDiamandis_2008 82.75 92.15 <o,f0,male> aircraft operator say you're crazy don't do that you're going kill the guy and he wanted to go we worked hard to get all the permissions and six months later
PeterDiamandis_2008 1 PeterDiamandis_2008 92.57 103.01 <o,f0,male> we sat down at kennedy space center we had a press conference we announced our intent to do one zero g parabola give him twenty five seconds of zero g
PeterDiamandis_2008 1 PeterDiamandis_2008 104.03 112.39 <o,f0,male> really well we might do three parabolas well we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this and what he said for
PeterDiamandis_2008 1 PeterDiamandis_2008 125.60 127.48 <o,f0,male> we took him out to the kennedy space center
PeterDiamandis_2008 1 PeterDiamandis_2008 128.82 133.69 <o,f0,male> up inside the nasa vehicle into the back of the zero g airplane
PeterDiamandis_2008 1 PeterDiamandis_2008 136.91 145.50 <o,f0,male> we had about twenty people who made donations we raised one hundred and fifty thousand in donations for children 's charities who flew with us a few tedsters here
PeterDiamandis_2008 1 PeterDiamandis_2008 146.93 155.70 <o,f0,male> we set up a whole er we had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane we were monitoring his po two of his blood his heart rate his blood pressure
PeterDiamandis_2008 1 PeterDiamandis_2008 162.38 166.33 <o,f0,male> we took off from the shuttle landing facility where the shuttle takes off and lands
PeterDiamandis_2008 1 PeterDiamandis_2008 167.26 173.43 <o,f0,male> and my partner byron lichtenberg and i carefully suspended him into zero g once he was there
PeterDiamandis_2008 1 PeterDiamandis_2008 173.81 177.94 <o,f0,male> let him go to experience what weightlessness was truly like
PeterDiamandis_2008 1 PeterDiamandis_2008 179.29 189.88 <o,f0,male> and after that first parabola you know the doc said everything is great he was smiling and we said go so we did a second parabola
PeterDiamandis_2008 1 PeterDiamandis_2008 197.79 198.04 <o,f2,female> and
PeterDiamandis_2008 1 PeterDiamandis_2008 200.40 209.35 <o,f0,male> now we actually floated an apple in homage to sir isaac newton because professor hawking holds the same chair at cambridge that isaac newton did
PeterDiamandis_2008 1 PeterDiamandis_2008 210.63 216.10 <o,f0,female> and we did a fourth and a fifth and a sixth and a seventh and an eighth and this
PeterDiamandis_2008 1 PeterDiamandis_2008 216.27 219.34 <o,f0,male> man does not look like a sixty five year old wheelchair bound man
PeterDiamandis_2008 1 PeterDiamandis_2008 223.05 227.93 <o,f0,male> we are living on a precious jewel and it's during our lifetime that we're moving off this planet
