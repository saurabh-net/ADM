ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 21.96 36.23 <o,f0,female> and the journey to that place of understanding and acceptance has been an interesting one for me and it 's given me an insight into the whole notion of self which i think is worth sharing with you today
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 37.07 41.7 <o,f0,female> we each have a self but i don 't think that we 're born with one
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 42.47 57.61 <o,f0,female> you know how newborn babies believe they 're part of everything they 're not separate well that fundamental sense of oneness is lost on us very quickly it 's like that initial stage is over oneness infancy
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 57.72 61.68 <o,f0,female> unformed primitive it 's no longer valid or real
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 62.07 66.65 <o,f0,female> what is real is separateness and at some point in early babyhood
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 66.96 69.47 <o,f0,female> the idea of self starts to form
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 69.83 76 <o,f0,female> our little portion of oneness is given a name is told all kinds of things about itself
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 76 90.69 <o,f0,female> and these details opinions and ideas become facts which go towards building ourselves our identity and that self becomes the vehicle for navigating our social world
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 96.68 98.78 <o,f0,female> is it who we really are
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 99.11 101.02 <o,f0,female> or who we really want to be
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 117.21 131.11 <o,f0,female> and my panic at not having a self that fit and the confusion that came from my self being rejected created anxiety shame and hopelessness which kind of defined me for a long time
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 138.36 140.42 <o,f0,female> the self changed
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 148.94 150.56 <o,f0,female> sometimes hateful
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 150.88 152.96 <o,f0,female> sometimes not wanting to be there at all
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 153.43 156.68 <o,f0,female> the self was not constant
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 161.55 165.14 <o,f0,female> before i realized that it was never alive in the first place
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 173.47 176.14 <o,f0,female> and my mom is black from zimbabwe
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 177.06 181.51 <o,f0,female> even the idea of us as a family was challenging to most people
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 181.88 185.12 <o,f0,female> but nature had its wicked way and brown babies were born
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 186.16 190.71 <o,f0,female> but from about the age of five i was aware that i didn 't fit
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 191.25 199.42 <o,f0,female> i was the black atheist kid in the all white catholic school run by nuns i was an anomaly
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 199.74 205.39 <o,f0,female> and my self was rooting around for definition and trying to plug in
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 206.14 208.35 <o,f0,female> because the self likes to fit
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 208.6 211.89 <o,f0,female> to see itself replicated to belong
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 212.65 230.19 <o,f0,female> that confirms its existence and its importance and it is important it has an extremely important function without it we literally can 't interface with others we can 't hatch plans and climb that stairway of popularity of success
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 231.32 233.18 <o,f0,female> but my skin color wasn 't right
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 234.14 235.72 <o,f0,female> my hair wasn 't right
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 236.03 245.35 <o,f0,female> my history wasn 't right my self became defined by otherness which meant that in that social world i didn 't really exist
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 246.35 251.24 <o,f0,female> and i was other before being anything else even before being a girl
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 252.12 254.63 <o,f0,female> i was a noticeable nobody
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 255.88 257.82 <o,f0,female> another world was opening up
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 258.45 261.39 <o,f0,female> around this time performance
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 268.8 271.52 <o,f0,female> i 'd literally lose myself
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 272.38 283.37 <o,f0,female> and i was a really good dancer i would put all my emotional expression into my dancing i could be in the movement
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 283.81 289.19 <o,f0,female> in a way that i wasn 't able to be in my real life in myself
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 289.36 297.41 <o,f0,female> and at sixteen i stumbled across another opportunity and i earned my first acting role in a film
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 297.74 304.39 <o,f0,female> i can hardly find the words to describe the peace i felt when i was acting
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 304.93 311.02 <o,f0,female> my dysfunctional self could actually plug in to another self not my own
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 311.39 313.18 <o,f0,female> and it felt so good
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 314.07 319.67 <o,f0,female> it was the first time that i existed inside a fully functioning self
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 319.89 321.65 <o,f0,female> one that i controlled
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 327.41 329.21 <o,f0,female> but the shooting day would end
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 329.5 331.81 <o,f0,female> and i 'd return to my gnarly
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 339.75 342.07 <o,f0,female> but still searching for definition
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 342.75 345.98 <o,f0,female> i applied to read anthropology at university
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 346.86 348.42 <o,f0,female> dr phyllis lee
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 348.51 357.72 <o,f0,female> gave me my interview and she asked me how would you define race well i thought i had the answer to that one and i said skin color
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 358.19 361.12 <o,f0,female> so biology genetics she said
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 379.81 383.54 <o,f0,female> there 's been more time to create genetic diversity
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 391.88 394.21 <o,f0,female> on the one hand result
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 402.61 404.16 <o,f0,female> but what was credible
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 404.18 415.41 <o,f0,female> what is biological and scientific fact is that we all stem from africa in fact from a woman called mitochondrial eve who lived one hundred and sixty thousand years ago
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 415.9 423.99 <o,f0,female> and race is an illegitimate concept which our selves have created based on fear and ignorance
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 424.98 432.51 <o,f0,female> strangely these revelations didn 't cure my low self esteem that feeling of otherness
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 433 436.79 <o,f0,female> my desire to disappear was still very powerful
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 437.24 444.5 <o,f0,female> i had a degree from cambridge i had a thriving career but my self was a car crash
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 444.8 449.77 <o,f0,female> and i wound up with bulimia and on a therapist 's couch and of course i did
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 449.9 453.96 <o,f0,female> i still believed my self was all i was
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 454.03 457.88 <o,f0,female> i still valued self worth above all other worth
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 458.33 460.56 <o,f0,female> and what was there to suggest otherwise
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 460.82 467.05 <o,f0,female> we 've created entire value systems and a physical reality to support the worth of self
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 467.09 473.37 <o,f0,female> look at the industry for self image and the jobs it creates the revenue it turns over
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 473.99 479.41 <o,f0,female> we 'd be right in assuming that the self is an actual living thing but it 's not
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 489.19 490.77 <o,f0,female> but there is something
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 496.21 498.75 <o,f0,female> and that thing is oneness
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 514.42 519.78 <o,f0,female> awareness of the reality of oneness and the projection of self hood
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 520.42 525.2 <o,f0,female> for a start we can think about all the times when we do lose ourselves
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 525.39 528.51 <o,f0,female> it happens when i dance when i 'm acting
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 534.51 536.88 <o,f0,female> in those moments i 'm connected
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 547.43 552.82 <o,f0,female> in much the same way as an infant might feel that feeling of oneness
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 553.8 555.5 <o,f0,female> and when i 'm acting a role
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 555.92 557.87 <o,f0,female> i inhabit another self
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 558.58 560.57 <o,f0,female> and i give it life for awhile
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 560.68 562.93 <o,f0,female> because when the self is suspended
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 563.42 565.33 <o,f0,female> so is divisiveness
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 565.39 567.08 <o,f0,female> and judgment
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 567.21 574.31 <o,f0,female> and i 've played everything from a vengeful ghost in the time of slavery to secretary of state in two thousand and four
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 575.35 577.03 <o,f0,female> and no matter how other
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 577.49 579.2 <o,f0,female> these selves might be
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 583.01 584.69 <o,f0,female> and i honestly believe
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 585.07 587.88 <o,f0,female> the key to my success as an actor
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 587.94 595.78 <o,f0,female> and my progress as a person has been the very lack of self that used to make me feel so anxious and insecure
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 596.75 606.37 <o,f0,female> i always wondered why i could feel others pain so deeply why i could recognize the somebody in the nobody
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 607.17 610.11 <o,f0,female> it 's because i didn 't have a self to get in the way
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 610.99 613.29 <o,f0,female> i thought i lacked substance
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 619.75 622.16 <o,f0,female> the thing that was a source of shame
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 622.68 625.07 <o,f0,female> was actually a source of enlightenment
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 625.34 627.05 <o,f0,female> and when i realized
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 627.51 629.2 <o,f0,female> and really understood
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 641.61 649.09 <o,f0,female> very familiar with its dysfunctional behavior but i 'm not ashamed of my self in fact i respect my self
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 656.08 658.2 <o,f0,female> more and more from my essence
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 666.15 674.55 <o,f0,female> dancing and celebrating with women who 've survived the destruction of their selves in literally unthinkable ways
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 675.12 686.76 <o,f0,female> destroyed because other brutalized psychopathic selves all over that beautiful land are fueling our selves addiction to ipods pads and bling
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 700.84 705.08 <o,f0,female> then we 're devaluing and desensitizing life
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 705.4 707.59 <o,f0,female> and in that disconnected state
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 711.07 712.77 <o,f0,female> destroy marine life
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 713.03 715.55 <o,f0,female> and use rape as a weapon of war
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 717.04 719.17 <o,f0,female> so here 's a note to self
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 724.9 729.05 <o,f0,female> and oceans will continue to surge through the cracks
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 739.32 742.04 <o,f0,female> with the earth and every other living thing
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 742.38 748.03 <o,f0,female> we 've just been insanely trying to figure out how to live with each other billions of each other
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 750.36 753.73 <o,f0,female> our crazy selves are living with each other
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 753.77 757.12 <o,f0,female> and perpetuating an epidemic of disconnection
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 758.7 760.49 <o,f0,female> let 's live with each other
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 772.62 776.59 <o,f0,female> our connection to the infinite and every other living thing
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 776.89 779.04 <o,f0,female> we knew it from the day we were born
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 779.76 784.06 <o,f0,female> let 's not be freaked out by our bountiful nothingness
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 784.11 787.52 <o,f0,female> it 's more a reality than the ones our selves have created
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 788.31 790.65 <o,f0,female> imagine what kind of existence
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 796.43 799.41 <o,f0,female> appreciate the privilege of life
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 799.97 802.72 <o,f0,female> and marvel at what comes next
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 803.88 806.97 <o,f0,female> simple awareness is where it begins
ThandieNewton_2011G 1 ThandieNewton_2011G 807.75 809.34 <o,f0,female> thank you for listening
