JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 16.67 28.90 <o,f0,male> it's been reported that wikileaks your baby has in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world 's media combined can that possibly be true
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 51.98 55.54 <o,f0,male> so these are as far as we can tell classical whistleblowers
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 56.10 68.79 <o,f0,male> and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us so we use just state of the art encryption to bounce stuff around the internet to hide trails pass it through legal jurisdictions like sweden and belgium to
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 70.68 71.73 <o,f0,male> those legal protections
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 74.22 76.18 <o,f0,male> the mail the regular postal
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 78.35 81.83 <o,f0,male> or not vet it like a regular news organization
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 82.59 95.50 <o,f0,male> format it which is sometimes something that's quite hard to do when you're talking about giant databases of information release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 97.06 105.43 <o,f0,male> so you make an effort to ensure the documents are legitimate but you actually almost never know who the identity of the
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 106.04 109.61 <o,f0,male> that's right yeah very rarely do we ever know and
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 110.85 112.44 <o,f0,male> if we find out at some stage
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 123.04 125.85 <o,f0,male> asking what the code is for a ted membership
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 128.42 139.38 <o,f0,male> so let 's take the example actually this is something you leaked a few years ago if we can have this document up so this was a story in kenya a few years ago can you tell us what you
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 142.08 147.66 <o,f0,male> so this is the kroll report this was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the kenyan government
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 149.13 159.91 <o,f0,male> its election in two thousand and four prior to two thousand and four kenya was ruled by daniel arap moi for about eighteen years he was a soft dictator of kenya
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 160.32 168.75 <o,f0,male> and when kibaki got into power through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in kenya they commissioned this report spent about two
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 169.18 179.14 <o,f0,male> million pounds on this and an associated report and then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on moi who was the richest man
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 180.24 181.80 <o,f0,male> is the richest man in kenya
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 182.50 185.14 <o,f0,male> it's the holy grail of kenyan journalism
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 185.87 194.85 <o,f0,male> so i went there in two thousand and seven and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election the national election december twenty eight
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 198.29 207.43 <o,f0,male> we released that report we did so three days after the new president kibaki had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 210.27 214.60 <o,f0,male> so this report then became a dead albatross around
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 218.69 230.07 <o,f0,male> and i mean to cut a long story short word of the report leaked into kenya not from the official media but indirectly and in your opinion it actually shifted the election
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 230.84 237.24 <o,f0,male> this became front page of the guardian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of kenya in
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 256.32 259.84 <o,f0,male> so your leak really substantially changed the world
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 265.01 265.36 <o,f0,female> 's
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 280.05 284.72 <o,f2,male> you get on em just open em up i see your element uh got about four
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 293.05 294.48 <o,f0,male> all
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 322.71 325.80 <o,f2,male> right hahaha i
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 329.05 332.10 <o,f0,male> so what was the impact of that
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 337.46 342.72 <o,f0,male> we ended up sending two people to baghdad to further research that story so this is just the first
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 343.76 345.76 <o,f0,male> three attacks that occurred in that
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 346.36 350.79 <o,f0,male> eleven people died in that attack right including two reuters employees
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 355.37 357.57 <o,f0,male> there were between eighteen and twenty six people
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 358.98 366.58 <o,f0,male> and releasing this caused widespread outrage what was the key element of this that actually caused the outrage do
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 369.32 374.95 <o,f0,male> can see the gross disparity in force you have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street and
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 384.52 391.39 <o,f0,male> and killing people rescuing the wounded and there was two journalists involved that clearly weren't insurgents because that's their full time job
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 393.44 401.77 <o,f0,male> i mean there's been this u s intelligence analyst bradley manning arrested and it's alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 411.33 416.14 <o,f0,male> we have denied receiving those cables he has been charged about five days ago
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 418.55 423.79 <o,f0,male> obtaining one hundred and fifty thousand cables and releasing fifty now we had released
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 425.69 428.25 <o,f0,male> early in the year a cable from
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 428.72 435.17 <o,f0,male> the reykjavik u s embassy but this is not necessarily connected i mean i was a known visitor
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 440.49 441.85 <o,f0,male> we would have released them ca you
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 444.45 444.67 <o,f0,male> because
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 445.76 450.35 <o,f0,male> well because these sort of things reveal what the true state
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 453.02 461.08 <o,f0,male> say arab governments are like the true human rights abuses in those governments if you look at declassified cables that's the sort of
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 462.30 470.14 <o,f0,male> so let 's talk a little more broadly about this i mean in general what's your philosophy why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 471.26 477.59 <o,f0,male> well there's a question as to what sort of information is important in the world what sort of information can achieve reform
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 480.05 485.32 <o,f0,male> so information that organizations are spending economic effort into concealing
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 486.23 487.40 <o,f0,male> that's a really good signal
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 488.09 491.24 <o,f0,male> that when the information gets out there's a hope of it doing some good
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 491.91 496.39 <o,f0,male> because the organizations that know it best that know it from the inside out are spending work
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 504.65 514.69 <o,f0,male> are there risks with that either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 530.74 533.23 <o,f0,male> your records with your doctor that's a legitimate secret
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 534.52 538.58 <o,f0,male> we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well motivated
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 539.88 550.52 <o,f0,male> so they are well motivated and what would you say to for example the you know the parent of someone whose son is out serving the u s military and he says you know
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 551.53 557.20 <o,f0,male> put up something that someone had an incentive to put out it shows a u s soldier laughing at people dying
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 557.93 566.57 <o,f0,male> that gives the impression has given the impression to millions of people around the world that u s soldiers are inhuman people actually they're not my son isn 't how dare you what would you say
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 567.36 572.26 <o,f0,male> we do get a lot of that but remember the people in baghdad the people
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 574.78 576.05 <o,f0,male> don't need to see the video
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 576.92 582.34 <o,f0,male> they see it every day so it's not going to change their opinion it's not going to change their perception that's what
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 593.13 602.99 <o,f0,male> found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government light is good
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 605.10 612.02 <o,f0,male> any irony in the fact that in order for you to shine that light you have to yourself create secrecy around your sources
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 613.17 617.30 <o,f0,male> not really i mean we don't have any wikileaks dissidents yet
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 619.40 622.09 <o,f0,male> have sources who are dissidents on other sources
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 627.81 635.27 <o,f0,male> we're presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled to continue our mission not to
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 639.08 649.95 <o,f0,male> just based on what we've heard so far i'm curious as to the opinion in the ted audience you know there might be a couple of views of wikileaks and of julian you know
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 651.30 656.40 <o,f0,male> hero people 's hero bringing this important light dangerous troublemaker
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 676.83 683.96 <o,f0,male> but i think for ted you are i mean it's an intriguing story that's just happened right what is this ja so this is
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 684.31 693.39 <o,f0,male> a sample of what we do sort of every day so late last year in november last year there was a series of well blowouts in albania
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 695.26 698.43 <o,f0,male> like the well blowout in the gulf of mexico but not quite as
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 700.15 707.53 <o,f0,male> and we got a report a sort of engineering analysis into what happened saying that in fact security guards
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 709.05 714.23 <o,f0,male> rival various competing oil firms had in fact parked trucks there and blown them up
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 727.13 732.28 <o,f0,male> knew what it was about so we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 733.51 741.21 <o,f0,male> that basis we put it out and said look we're skeptical about this thing we don't know but what can we do the material looks good it feels right but we
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 743.64 746.29 <o,f0,male> we then got a letter just this week
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 751.60 753.18 <o,f0,male> wanting to track down the source
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 758.07 758.72 <o,f0,male> saying
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 773.01 774.93 <o,f0,male> this screen shot
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 775.80 779.03 <o,f0,male> with the author in the microsoft word id
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 798.56 801.43 <o,f0,male> have you had information from inside bp
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 811.97 820.36 <o,f0,male> the past few months has been sort of minimized while we're re engineering our back systems for the phenomenal public interest that we have
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 821.08 822.45 <o,f0,male> that's a problem i mean
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 823.25 827.98 <o,f0,male> like any sort of growing startup organization we are sort of overwhelmed by
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 829.06 838.05 <o,f0,male> growth and that means we're getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high caliber but don't have enough people to actually
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 839.87 846.37 <o,f0,male> so that's the key bottleneck basically journalistic volunteers and or the funding of journalistic salaries
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 846.77 857.09 <o,f0,male> yeah and trusted people i mean we're an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with so we have to restructure in order to
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 858.80 861.78 <o,f0,male> have people who will deal with the highest national security
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 865.80 875.30 <o,f0,male> help us understand about you personally and how you came to do this and i think i read that as a kid you went to thirty seven different schools can that be right
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 888.16 889.36 <o,f0,male> a psychologist might say
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 889.56 892.09 <o,f0,male> a recipe for breeding paranoia
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 893.44 894.39 <o,f0,male> what the movie business
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 900.91 902.54 <o,f0,male> and you were also i mean you
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 903.10 906.76 <o,f0,male> at an early age and ran into the authorities early on
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 919.32 925.20 <o,f0,male> with hacker i mean there's like there's a method that can be deployed for various things unfortunately at the moment
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 925.43 934.12 <o,f0,male> it's mostly deployed by the russian mafia in order to steal your grandmother 's bank accounts so this phrase is not not as nice as it used to be
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 934.62 938.28 <o,f0,male> yeah well i certainly don't think you're stealing anyone 's grandmother 's
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 940.85 949.64 <o,f0,male> what about your core values can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 954.34 956.97 <o,f0,male> the incident but the core values
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 959.97 964.18 <o,f0,male> capable generous men do not create victims they nurture victims
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 966.00 969.10 <o,f0,male> and that's something from my father and something from other
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 970.27 972.48 <o,f0,male> generous men that have been in my life
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 973.58 976.46 <o,f0,male> capable generous men do not create victims they
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 979.80 982.00 <o,f0,male> you know i'm a combative
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 989.21 990.77 <o,f0,male> there is another way of
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 1002.62 1013.01 <o,f0,male> so just tell us very quickly in the last minute the story what happened in iceland you basically published something there ran into trouble with a bank
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 1015.00 1024.47 <o,f0,male> the news service there was injuncted from running the story instead they publicized your side that made you very high profile in iceland what happened next
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 1025.31 1034.22 <o,f0,male> this is a great case you know iceland went through this financial crisis it was the hardest hit of any country in the world its banking sector was ten times the gdp of the rest of the economy
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 1035.16 1037.21 <o,f0,male> anyway so we release this
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 1038.16 1045.19 <o,f0,male> july last year and the national tv station was injuncted five minutes before it went on air like out of a movie
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 1045.58 1053.35 <o,f0,male> injunction landed on the news desk and the news reader was like this has never happened before what do we do well we just show the website instead for all that time
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 1055.26 1062.69 <o,f0,male> and we became very famous in iceland went to iceland and spoke about this issue and there was a feeling in the community
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 1076.07 1078.69 <o,f0,male> to sort of become an offshore haven
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 1081.86 1089.55 <o,f0,male> with the strongest journalistic protections in the world with a new nobel prize for freedom of speech iceland 's a nordic
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 1090.43 1097.79 <o,f0,male> like norway it's able to tap into the system and just a month ago this was passed by the icelandic parliament
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 1118.76 1120.25 <o,f0,male> watching big brother
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 1120.90 1122.71 <o,f0,male> or it's just all to be played for either way
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 1123.55 1131.00 <o,f0,male> i'm not sure which way it's going to go i mean there's enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and
JulianAssange_2010G 1 JulianAssange_2010G 1134.23 1144.86 <o,f0,male> the e u between china and the united states which way is it going to go it's hard to see that's why it's a very interesting time to be in because with just a little bit of effort we can shift
