ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 23.25 25.86 <o,f0,male> you see all the points all the
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 27.53 37.30 <o,f0,male> it's incredible it is the network and in my case the network has been important in media because i get to connect to people isn't it amazing through that
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 39.47 47.48 <o,f0,male> i connect to people and the way that i've been doing it has been multifaceted for example i get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 52.53 62.31 <o,f0,male> i put together projects like earth sandwich where i ask people to try and simultaneously place two pieces of bread perfectly opposite each other on the earth
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 62.96 71.97 <o,f0,male> and people started laying bread in tribute and eventually a team was able to do it between new zealand and spain it's pretty incredible the
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 73.60 84.93 <o,f0,male> connecting to people in projects like youngmenowme for example in youngmenowme the audience was asked to find a childhood photograph of themselves and restage it as an adult
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 98.07 101.69 <o,f0,male> this is the same person top photo james bottom photo
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 105.28 106.29 <o,f0,male> this was a mother 's day
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 114.52 127.07 <o,f0,male> my favorite of these photos which i couldn't find is there's a picture of a thirty year old woman or so with a little baby on her lap and the next photo is a two hundred and twenty lb man with a tiny little old lady peaking over his shoulder
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 129.04 140.57 <o,f0,male> but this project changed the way that i thought about connecting to people this is project called ray and what happened was i was sent this piece of audio and had no idea who generated the audio somebody said
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 141.24 144.53 <o,f0,male> you have to listen to this and this is what came to me
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 145.01 154.76 <o,f0,male> hi my name is ray and on yesterday my daughter called me because she was stressed out because of things that were going on on her job that she felt was quite unfair
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 155.68 165.93 <o,f0,male> being quite disturbed she called for comfort and i didn't really know what to tell her because we have to deal with so much mess in our society so i was led to write this song just for her
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 167.32 171.98 <o,f0,male> just to give her some encouragement while dealing with stress and pressures on her job and
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 172.51 179.71 <o,f0,male> i figured i'd put it on the internet for all employees under stress to help you better deal with what you're going through on you job here 's how the song goes
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 182.12 183.18 <o,f0,male> i'm about to
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 189.54 190.32 <o,f0,male> i'm about to
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 195.30 201.38 <o,f0,male> if you don't leave me alone a a you gonna have to send me home
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 203.54 205.98 <o,f0,male> about to whip somebody 's
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 224.49 238.29 <o,f0,male> so i was so moved by this this is incredible this was connecting right this was at a distance realizing that someone was feeling something wanting to affect them in a particular way using media to do it putting it online and realizing that there was a greater impact
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 238.60 247.34 <o,f0,male> this was incredible this is what i wanted to do so the first thing i thought of is we have to thank him and i asked my audience i said listen to this piece of audio we have to remix it he 's got a great voice
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 248.05 260.10 <o,f0,male> it's actually in the key of b flat and have to do something with it hundreds of remixes came back lots of different attempts one stood out in particular it was done by a guy named goose
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 280.61 280.80 <o,f0,male> you
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 282.21 282.81 <o,f0,male> me
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 316.38 319.62 <o,f0,male> top downloads on a whole bunch of music streaming services
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 333.87 337.74 <o,f0,male> of audio and the fact that his daughter was upset
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 338.88 344.15 <o,f0,male> in two weeks they found him i received and email and it said hi i'm
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 345.39 347.45 <o,f0,male> i heard you were looking for me
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 348.42 359.11 <o,f0,male> i was like yeah ray it's been an interesting two weeks and so i flew to st louis and met ray and he 's a preacher
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 363.48 365.47 <o,f0,male> among other things so but anyways here
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 369.61 383.08 <o,f0,male> in amsterdam on every street corner and it's sort of a metaphor for me for the virtual world i look at this photo and he seems really interested in what's going on with that button but it doesn't seem like he is really that interested in crossing the street
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 384.90 385.85 <o,f0,male> and it makes me think
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 386.04 395.62 <o,f0,male> of this on street corners everywhere people are looking at their cellphones and it's easy to to dismiss this as some sort of bad trend in human culture
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 396.11 400.99 <o,f0,male> but the truth is life is being lived there when they smile
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 401.52 403.05 <o,f0,male> right you've seen people stop
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 404.42 415.17 <o,f0,male> all of a sudden life is being lived there somewhere up in that weird dense network and this is it right to feel and be felt it's the fundamental
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 416.47 425.74 <o,f0,male> force that we're all after we can build all sorts of environments to make it a little bit easier but ultimately what we're trying to do is really connect with one other person
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 426.22 433.17 <o,f0,male> and that's not always going to happen in physical spaces it's also going to now happen in virtual spaces and we have to get better at figuring that out
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 433.54 443.82 <o,f0,male> i think of the people that build all this technology in the network a lot of them aren't very good at connecting with people this is kind of like something i used to do in
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 444.28 445.93 <o,f0,male> third grade
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 447.14 456.65 <o,f0,male> so here 's a series of projects over the last few years where i've been inspired by trying to figure out how to really facilitate close connection
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 465.79 472.78 <o,f0,male> was sort of meaningless like on the route to the bus stop to a neighbor 's house and take it inside of google streetview
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 473.13 482.15 <o,f0,male> and i promise you if you take that walk inside google streetview you come to a moment where something comes back and hits you in the face
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 482.59 496.23 <o,f0,male> and i collected those moments the photos inside google streetview and the memories specifically our conversation started with me saying i 'm bored and her replying when i'm bored i eat pretzels i remember this distinctly because it came up a lot
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 496.95 511.33 <o,f0,male> right after he told me and my brother he was going to be separating from my mom i remember walking to a convenience store and getting a cherry cola they used some of the morbidly artist footage a close up of chad 's shoes in the middle of the highway i guess the shoes came off when he was hit
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 511.61 520.40 <o,f0,male> he slept over at my house once and he left his pillow it had chad written in magic marker on it he died long after he left the pillow at my house but we never got around to returning it
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 534.53 542.74 <o,f0,male> a hotline where people could leave voicemails of their pain not necessarily related to that event and people called in and left messages like this
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 548.30 549.09 <o,f0,female> not alone
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 550.80 551.99 <o,f0,female> and i am
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 557.11 557.96 <o,f0,female> and when i
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 566.51 574.33 <o,f0,female> even the smallest act of kindness can make me cry like even people in convenience stores saying
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 578.59 579.28 <o,f0,female> looking
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 581.61 591.27 <o,f0,male> so what i did was i took those voicemails and with their permission converted them to mp three s and distributed them to sound editors who created short sounds using just
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 591.96 596.15 <o,f0,male> those voicemails and those were then distributed
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 597.07 602.54 <o,f0,male> to djs who have made hundreds of songs using that source material
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 608.11 609.89 <o,f0,male> we don't have time to play much of it you can look at
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 611.76 624.65 <o,f0,male> fifty two to forty eight with love was a project around the time of the last election cycle where mccain and obama both in their speeches after the election talked about reconciliation and i was like what the hell does that look like
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 625.29 633.56 <o,f0,male> so i thought well let 's just give it a try let 's have people hold up signs about reconciliation and so some really nice things came together i voted
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 634.05 644.63 <o,f0,male> blue i voted red together for our future these are very very cute little things right some came from the winning party dear forty eight i promise to listen to you to fight for you to respect you always some came
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 644.86 650.87 <o,f0,male> from the party who had just lost from a forty eight to a fifty two may your party 's leadership be as classy as you but i doubt it
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 656.63 664.26 <o,f0,male> some message boards apparently found it to be a little patronizing which i could also see and so i started getting amazing amounts of hate mail
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 664.73 676.74 <o,f0,male> death threats even and one guy in particular kept on writing me these pretty awful messages and he was dressed as batman and he said i 'm dressed as batman to hide my identity just in case i thought the real
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 681.56 690.57 <o,f0,male> like phew it's not him so what i did unfortunately i was harboring all this kind of awful experience and this pain inside of
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 690.91 700.10 <o,f0,male> and it started to eat away at my psyche and i was protecting the project from it i realized i was protecting it i didn't want this special little group of photographs to get
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 700.81 715.07 <o,f0,male> sullied in some way so what i did i took all those emails and i put them together into something called angrigami which was an origami template made out of this sort of vile stuff and i asked people to send me beautiful things made out of the angrigami
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 722.62 732.03 <o,f0,male> but this was the emotional moment one of my viewer 's uncles died on a particular day and he chose to commemorate it with a piece of hate
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 732.48 745.66 <o,f0,male> it's amazing the last thing i'm going to tell you about is a series of projects called songs you already know where the idea was i was trying to figure out to address particular kinds of emotions
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 746.11 760.24 <o,f0,male> with group projects so one of them was fairly straightforward a guy said that his daughter got scared at night and could i write a song for her his daughter and i said oh yeah i'll try to write a mantra that she can sing to herself to help herself go to sleep and this was scared
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 775.46 779.65 <o,f0,male> is a song that i sing when
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 803.04 803.36 <o,f0,male> is
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 810.02 819.04 <o,f0,male> so i wrote that song right thank you so the nice thing was is he walked by his daughter 's room at some point and she actually was singing that song to herself so i was like awesome this is great
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 819.82 831.42 <o,f0,male> then i got this email and there's a little bit of a backstory to this and i don't have much time but the idea was that at one point i did a project called facebook me equals you where i wanted to experience what it was like to live as another person
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 831.71 842.58 <o,f0,male> so i asked for people 's usernames and passwords to be sent to me and i got a lot like thirty in a half an hour and i shut that part down and i chose two people to be and i asked them to send me
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 858.77 871.73 <o,f0,male> know i had one but anyway this same person laura ended up emailing me a little bit after that project and i felt badly for not having done a good job and she said i 'm really anxious i just moved to a new town
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 871.92 880.22 <o,f0,male> i have this new job and i've just had this incredible amount of anxiety so she had seen the scared song and wondered if i could do something so i asked her what does it feel like
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 880.70 893.90 <o,f0,male> when you feel this way and she wrote a sort of descriptive set of what it felt like to have had this anxiety and so what i decided to do i said okay i'll think about it and so quietly in the background i started sending people this
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 906.83 918.65 <o,f0,male> so i asked people whether they had basic audio capabilities just so they could sing along to the song with headphones on so i could just get their voices back and this is the kind of thing that i got back
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 931.50 935.14 <o,f0,male> that's one of the better ones really but what's awesome is
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 935.33 943.29 <o,f0,male> as i started getting more and more and more of them all of a sudden i had thirty forty voices from around the world and when you put them together something magical happens
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 955.65 957.28 <o,f0,male> know you've forgotten about me
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 958.87 963.97 <o,f0,male> say thanks for even considering it and then a few days later i sent her this
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 981.38 981.58 <o,f0,female> the
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 994.54 994.93 <o,f0,female> and
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 1062.29 1063.08 <o,f0,female> be
ZeFrank_2010G 1 ZeFrank_2010G 1068.86 1069.34 <o,f0,male> thank you
