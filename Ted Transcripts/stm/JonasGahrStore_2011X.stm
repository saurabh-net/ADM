JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 15.57 25.73 <o,f0,male> all the troubling deficits we struggle with today we think of financial and economic primarily the ones that concern me most is the deficit of political dialogue
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 25.73 36.17 <o,f0,male> our ability to address modern conflicts as they are to go to the source of what they 're all about and to understand the key players and to deal with them
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 36.17 56.17 <o,f0,male> we who are diplomats we are trained to deal with conflicts between states and issues between states and i can tell you our agenda is full there is trade there is disarmament there is cross border relations but the picture is changing and we are seeing that there are new key players coming onto the scene
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 56.17 59.1 <o,f0,male> we loosely call them groups
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 59.1 75.27 <o,f0,male> they may represent social religious political economic military realities and we struggle with how to deal with them the rules of engagement how to talk when to talk and how to deal with them
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 75.27 88.39 <o,f0,male> let me show you a slide here which illustrates the character of conflicts since one thousand nine hundred and forty six until today you see the green is a traditional interstate conflict the ones we used to read about
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 88.39 93.64 <o,f0,male> the red is modern conflict conflicts within states
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 93.64 108.98 <o,f0,male> these are quite different and they are outside the grasp of modern diplomacy and the core of these key actors are groups who represent different interests inside countries
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 108.98 116.04 <o,f0,male> and the way they deal with their conflicts rapidly spreads to other countries so in a way it is everybody 's business
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 116.04 128.45 <o,f0,male> another acknowledgment we 've seen during these years recent years is that very few of these domestic interstate intrastate conflicts can be solved militarily
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 128.45 144.6 <o,f0,male> they may have to be dealt with with military means but they cannot be solved by military means they need political solutions and we therefore have a problem because they escape traditional diplomacy and we have among states a reluctance in dealing with them
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 144.6 148.93 <o,f0,male> plus during the last decade we 've been in the mode
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 155.07 159.58 <o,f0,male> either you were with us or against us it was black or white
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 159.58 166.62 <o,f0,male> and groups are very often immediately label terrorists and who would talk to terrorists
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 181.72 188.06 <o,f0,male> i 'm not naive you cannot talk to everybody all the time and there are times you should walk
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 188.06 193.73 <o,f0,male> and sometimes military intervention is necessary i happen to believe that libya was necessary
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 193.73 210.21 <o,f0,male> and that military intervention in afghanistan was also necessary and my country relies on its security through military alliance that 's clear but still we have a large deficit in dealing with and understanding modern conflict let us turn to afghanistan
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 210.21 217.7 <o,f0,male> ten years after that military intervention that country is far from secure the situation to be honest is very serious
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 217.7 230.21 <o,f0,male> now again the military is necessary but the military is no problem solver when i first came to afghanistan in two thousand and five as a foreign minister i met the commander of isaf the international troops
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 230.21 235.75 <o,f0,male> and he told me that this can be won militarily minister we just have to persevere
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 235.75 243.11 <o,f0,male> now four com isaf 's later we hear a different message this cannot be won militarily
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 243.11 254.45 <o,f0,male> we need military presence but we need to move to politics we can only solve this through a political solution and it is not us who will solve it afghans have to solve it
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 254.45 268.48 <o,f0,male> but then they need a different political process than the one they were given in two thousand and one two thousand and two they need an inclusive process where the real fabric of this very complicated society can deal with their issues
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 268.48 280.83 <o,f0,male> everybody seems to agree with that it was very controversial to say three four five years ago now everybody agrees but now as we prepare to talk we understand how little we know
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 280.84 285.36 <o,f0,male> because we didn 't talk we didn 't grasp what was going on
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 285.36 293.55 <o,f0,male> the international committee of the red cross the icrc is talking to everyone and it is doing so because it is neutral
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 293.55 311.64 <o,f0,male> and that 's one reason why that organization probably is the best informed key player to understand modern conflict because they talk my point is that you don 't have to be neutral to talk and you don 't have to agree when you sit down with the other side
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 348.08 356.69 <o,f0,male> who knows what it will be called in the end that 's not the point the point is that we are probably seeing for the first time in the history of the arab world
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 356.73 371.78 <o,f0,male> a revolution bottom up people 's revolution social groups are taking to the streets and we find out in the west that we know very little about what 's happening because we never talk to the people in these countries
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 371.78 381.83 <o,f0,male> most governments followed the dictate of the authoritarian leaders to stay away from these different groups because they were terrorists
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 381.83 394.5 <o,f0,male> so now that they are emerging in the street and we salute the democratic revolution we find out how little we know right now the discussion goes should we talk to the muslim brotherhood
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 394.5 401.42 <o,f0,male> should we talk to hamas if we talk to them we may legitimize them i think that is wrong
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 401.42 414.62 <o,f0,male> if you talk in the right way you make it very clear that talking is not agreeing and how can we tell the muslim brotherhood as we should that they must respect minority rights
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 414.62 430.42 <o,f0,male> if we don 't accept majority rights because they may turn out to be a majority how can we escape having a double standard if we at the same time preach democracy and at the same time don 't want to deal with the groups
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 433.74 437.76 <o,f0,male> now my diplomats are instructed to talk to all these groups
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 437.76 456.36 <o,f0,male> but talking can be done in different ways we make a distinction between talking from a diplomatic level and talking at the political level now talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid talking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion there 's a big array of the ways of dealing with this
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 456.36 467.69 <o,f0,male> so if we refuse to talk to these new groups that are going to be dominating the news in years to come we will further radicalization
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 467.69 481.54 <o,f0,male> i believe we will make the road from violent activities into politics harder to travel and if we cannot demonstrate to these groups that if you move towards democracy if you move towards taking part in
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 481.57 490.11 <o,f0,male> civilized and normal standards among states there are some rewards on the other side the paradox here is that
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 490.39 498.76 <o,f0,male> the last decade probably was a lost decade for making progress on this and the paradox is that the decade before the last decade was so promising
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 498.76 514.6 <o,f0,male> and for one reason primarily and the reason is what happened in south africa nelson mandela when mandela came out of prison after twenty seven years of captivity if he had told his people it 's time to take up the arms
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 514.6 522.66 <o,f0,male> it 's time to fight he would have been followed and i think the international community would have said fair enough
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 522.73 541.9 <o,f0,male> it 's their right to fight now as you know mandela didn 't do that in his memoirs long road to freedom he wrote that he survived during those years of captivity because he always decided to look upon his oppressor as also being a human being
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 541.9 555.66 <o,f0,male> also being a human being so he engaged a political process of dialogue not as a strategy of the weak but as a strategy of the strong
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 555.66 565.59 <o,f0,male> and he engaged talking profoundly by settling some of the most tricky issues through a truth and reconciliation process where people came and talked
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 580.35 590.29 <o,f0,male> if we 're going to deal with political conflict solving of conflicts if we 're going to understand these new groups which are coming from bottom up
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 590.64 593.65 <o,f0,male> supported by technology which is available to all
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 593.89 603.65 <o,f0,male> we diplomats cannot be sitting back in the banquets believing that we are doing interstate relations we have to connect with these profound changes
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 615.7 625.33 <o,f0,male> i cannot do that unless i send the signals that i will be open to listen to the other side 's signals we need a lot more training on how to do that
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 625.33 643.8 <o,f0,male> and a lot more practice on how that can take problem solving forward we know from our personal experiences that it 's easy sometimes just to walk and sometimes you may need to fight and i wouldn 't say that is the wrong thing in all circumstances sometimes you have to
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 643.8 660.57 <o,f0,male> but that strategy seldom takes you very far the alternative is a strategy of engagement and principled dialogue and i believe we need to strengthen this approach in modern diplomacy not only between states but also within states
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 660.57 673.72 <o,f0,male> we are seeing some new signs we could never have done the convention against anti personnel landmines and the convention that is banning cluster munitions unless we had done diplomacy differently
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 681.27 698.66 <o,f0,male> but they were taking them into the negotiations partly because they represented the victims of these weapons and they brought their knowledge and there was an interaction between diplomacy and the power coming bottom up this is perhaps a first element of a change
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 698.66 708.92 <o,f0,male> in the future i believe we should draw examples from these different illustrations not to have diplomacy which is disconnected from people and civil society
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 708.92 717.19 <o,f0,male> and we have to go also beyond traditional diplomacy to the survival issue of our times climate change
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 717.19 736.14 <o,f0,male> how are we going to solve climate change through negotiations unless we are able to make civil society and people not part of the problem but part of the solution it is going to demand an inclusive process of diplomacy very different from the one we are practicing today as we are heading to new rounds of difficult climate negotiations
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 736.14 741.78 <o,f0,male> but when we move toward something which has to be much more along a broad mobilization
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 741.78 753.3 <o,f0,male> it 's crucial to understand i believe because of technology and because of globalization societies from bottom up we as diplomats need to know the social capital
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 753.57 757.63 <o,f0,male> of communities what is it that makes people trust each other
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 757.73 777.53 <o,f0,male> not only between states but also within states what is the legitimacy of diplomacy of the the solution we devise as diplomats if they cannot be reflected and understood by also these broader forces of societies that we now very loosely call groups
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 777.53 796.43 <o,f0,male> the good thing is that we are not powerless we have never had as many means of communication means of being connected means of reaching out means of including the diplomatic toolbox is actually full of different tools we can use to strengthen our communication
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 796.43 803.41 <o,f0,male> but the problem is that we are coming out of a decade where we had a fear of touching it now i hope
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 803.43 812.69 <o,f0,male> in the coming years that we are able to demonstrate through some concrete examples that fear is receding and that we can take courage
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 812.69 822.33 <o,f0,male> from that alliance with civil society in different countries to support their problem solving among the afghans
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 822.33 825.58 <o,f0,male> inside the palestinian population
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 825.58 837.47 <o,f0,male> between the peoples of palestine and israel and as we try to understand this broad movement across the arab world we are not powerless we need to improve the necessary skills
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 837.47 846.11 <o,f0,male> and we need the courage to use them in my country i have seen how the council of islamist groups
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 846.11 863.71 <o,f0,male> and christian groups came together not as a government initiative but they came together on their own initiative to establish contact and dialogue in times where things were pretty low key tension and when tension increased they already had that dialogue
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 863.71 879.88 <o,f0,male> and that was a strength to deal with different issues our modern western societies are more complex than before in this time of migration how are we going to settle and build a bigger we to deal with our issues if we don 't improve our skills of communication
JonasGahrStore_2011X 1 JonasGahrStore_2011X 879.88 888.78 <o,f0,male> so there are many reasons and for all of these reasons this is time and this is why we must talk thank you for your attention
