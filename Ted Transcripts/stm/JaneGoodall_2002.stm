JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 13.28 20.50 <o,f0,female> good morning everyone and i feel first of all it's been fantastic being here over these past few days
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 20.89 29.46 <o,f0,female> and secondly i feel it's a great honor to kind of wind up this extraordinary gathering of people these amazing talks that we've had
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 30.19 38.50 <o,f0,female> i feel that i've fitted in in many ways to some of the things that i've heard i started off i came directly here
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 39.39 46.62 <o,f0,female> from the deep deep tropical rainforest in ecuador where i was out you could only get there by
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 48.29 55.01 <o,f0,female> indigenous people with paint on their faces and parrot feathers on their headdresses where these people
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 56.32 69.14 <o,f0,female> to try and keep the oil companies and keep the roads out of their forests they're fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that's clean a world that isn't contaminated
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 70.07 78.28 <o,f0,female> world that isn't polluted and what was so amazing to me and what fits right in with what we're all talking about here at ted
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 78.57 86.03 <o,f0,female> is that there right in the middle of this rainforest was some solar panels the first in that part of ecuador
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 86.43 100.88 <o,f0,female> and that was mainly to bring water up by pump so that the women wouldn't have to go down the water was cleaned but because they got a lot of batteries they were able to store a lot of electricity so every house and there were i think eight houses in this little community
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 101.13 111.25 <o,f0,female> could have light for i think it was about half an hour each evening and there is the chief in all his regal finery with a laptop computer
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 114.25 125.85 <o,f0,female> this man he has been outside but he 's gone back and he was saying you know we have suddenly jumped into a whole new era
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 126.36 136.07 <o,f0,female> and we didn't even know about the white man fifty years ago and now here we are with laptop computers and there are some things we want to learn from the modern world we want to know about health
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 137.15 149.56 <o,f0,female> we want to know about what other people do we're interested in it and we want to learn other languages we want to know english and french and perhaps chinese and we're good at languages
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 149.99 162.54 <o,f0,female> so there he is with his little laptop computer but fighting against the might of the pressures because of the debt the foreign debt of ecuador fighting the pressure of world bank
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 163.60 172.31 <o,f0,female> and of course the people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil and so coming directly from
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 172.65 184.26 <o,f0,female> to here but of course my real field of expertise lies in an even different kind of civilization i can't really call it a civilization a different way of life
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 185.98 195.76 <o,f0,female> different being we've talked earlier this wonderful talk by wade davis about the different cultures of the humans around the world
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 197.60 207.92 <o,f0,female> not composed only of human beings there are also other animal beings and i propose to bring into this ted conference as i always do around the world the voice
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 208.13 220.32 <o,f0,female> of the animal kingdom too often we just see a few slides or a bit of film but these beings have voices that mean something and so i want to give you a greeting as from a chimpanzee in the forests of tanzania
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 251.71 259.11 <o,f0,female> for example for the first time a few years ago by simply collecting little fecal samples we were able to have them
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 268.20 277.67 <o,f0,female> each individual infant because the chimps have a very promiscuous mating society so this opens up a whole new avenue of research and we use
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 279.80 289.98 <o,f0,female> geographic whatever it is gsi to determine the range of the chimps and we're using
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 290.88 299.41 <o,f0,female> you can see that i'm not really into this kind of stuff but we're using satellite imagery to look at the deforestation in the area
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 299.89 309.89 <o,f0,female> and of course there's developments in infrared so you can watch animals at night and equipment for recording by video and tape recording is getting lighter and better
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 318.48 330.52 <o,f0,female> especially when chimpanzees and other animals with large brains are studied in captivity modern technology is helping us to search for the upper levels of cognition
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 330.86 340.12 <o,f0,female> in some of these non human animals so that we know today they're capable of performances that would have been thought absolutely impossible by science when i began
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 341.04 350.58 <o,f0,female> i think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled in intellectual performance is one called ai in japan her name means love
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 351.22 358.62 <o,f0,female> and she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working with her she loves her computer she'll leave her big group
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 359.65 367.56 <o,f0,female> running water and her trees and everything and she'll come in to sit at this computer it's like a video game for a kid she's hooked she's twenty eight by the way
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 368.01 377.95 <o,f0,female> and she does things with her computer screen and a touch pad that she can do faster than most humans she does very complex
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 378.73 386.86 <o,f0,female> tasks and i haven't got time to go into them but the amazing thing about this female is she doesn't like making mistakes
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 387.17 398.53 <o,f0,female> if she has a bad run and her score isn't good she'll come and reach up and tap on the glass because she can't see the experimenter which is asking to have another go and her concentration
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 407.64 416.92 <o,f0,female> and the food is not important she does get a tiny reward like one raisin for a correct response but she will do it for nothing if you tell her beforehand
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 417.65 426.71 <o,f0,female> so here we are a chimpanzee using a computer chimpanzees gorillas orangutans also learn human sign language but
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 450.25 462.01 <o,f0,female> with my binoculars it was fortunately one adult male who i'd named david greybeard and by the way science at that time was telling me that i shouldn 't name the chimps they should all have numbers that was more scientific
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 472.05 481.44 <o,f0,female> that he would sometimes pick a leafy twig and strip the leaves modifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose the beginning of tool making
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 482.22 494.60 <o,f0,female> the reason this was so exciting and such a breakthrough is at that time it was thought that humans and only humans used and made tools when i was at school we were defined as man the tool maker
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 494.95 503.17 <o,f0,female> so that when louis leakey my mentor heard this news he said ah we must now redefine man redefine tool or accept chimpanzees as humans
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 506.35 513.99 <o,f0,female> we now know that at gombe alone there are nine different ways in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 514.45 522.82 <o,f0,female> moreover we know that in different parts of africa wherever chimps have been studied there are completely different tool using behaviors
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 523.10 533.36 <o,f0,female> and because it seems that these patterns are passed from one generation to the next through observation imitation and practice that is a definition of human culture
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 534.17 547.26 <o,f0,female> what we find is that over these forty odd years that i and others have been studying chimpanzees and the other great apes and as i say other mammals with complex brains and social systems
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 547.71 555.92 <o,f0,female> we have found that after all there isn't a sharp line dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom it's a very wuzzy line it's getting
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 556.84 563.52 <o,f0,female> all the time as we find animals doing things that we in our arrogance used to think was just human
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 564.33 572.95 <o,f0,female> the chimps there's no time to discuss their fascinating lives but they have this long childhood five years of suckling and sleeping with the mother
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 573.23 579.63 <o,f0,female> and then another three four or five years of emotional dependence on her even when the next child is born
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 580.10 587.04 <o,f0,female> the importance of learning in that time when behavior is flexible and there's an awful lot to learn in chimpanzee society
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 587.55 594.08 <o,f0,female> the long term affectionate supportive bonds that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother with
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 595.34 607.28 <o,f0,female> which can last through a lifetime which may be up to sixty years they can actually live longer than sixty in captivity so we've only done forty years in the wild so far and
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 607.78 617.68 <o,f0,female> we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism we find in their non verbal communication this is very rich they have a lot of sounds
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 624.09 632.85 <o,f0,female> what do they do they kiss they embrace they hold hands they pat one another on the back they swagger they shake their fist the kind of things that we do
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 633.24 646.07 <o,f0,female> and they do them in the same kind of context they have very sophisticated cooperation sometimes they hunt not that often but when they hunt they show sophisticated cooperation and they share the
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 647.55 657.83 <o,f0,female> we find that they show emotions similar to maybe sometimes the same as those that we describe in ourselves as happiness sadness fear despair
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 658.09 666.54 <o,f0,female> they know mental as well as physical suffering and i don't have time to go into the information that will prove some of these things to you save to say that there are
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 666.88 680.59 <o,f0,female> very bright students in the best universities studying emotions in animals studying personalities in animals we know that chimpanzees and some other creatures can recognize themselves in mirrors self as opposed to
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 681.49 692.51 <o,f0,female> they have a sense of humor and these are the kind of things which traditionally have been thought of as human prerogatives but
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 693.40 707.03 <o,f0,female> this teaches us a new respect and it's a new respect not only for the chimpanzees i suggest but some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet once we're prepared to admit that after all we're not the only
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 716.91 724.58 <o,f0,female> creatures on this planet it really gives cause for deep shame at least for me
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 726.33 726.99 <o,f0,female> so
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 727.83 737.44 <o,f0,female> the sad thing is that these chimpanzees who 've perhaps taught us more than any other creature a little humility are in the wild disappearing very fast
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 752.35 760.53 <o,f0,female> they're disappearing in the heart of their range in africa because the big multinational logging companies have come in
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 761.34 767.42 <o,f0,female> roads as they want to do in ecuador and other parts where the forests remain untouched to take out
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 768.38 769.37 <o,f0,female> oil or timber
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 771.47 778.36 <o,f0,female> this has led in congo basin and other parts of the world to what is known as the bush meat trade this means that
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 779.09 790.19 <o,f0,female> for hundreds perhaps thousands of years people have lived in those forests or whatever habitat it is in harmony with their world just killing the animals they need for themselves and their families
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 790.71 798.68 <o,f0,female> now suddenly because of the roads the hunters can go in from the towns they shoot everything every single thing that moves
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 798.95 812.61 <o,f0,female> that's bigger than a small rat they sun dry it or smoke it and now they've got transport they take it on the logging trucks or the mining trucks into the towns where they sell it and people will pay more
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 813.02 819.73 <o,f0,female> for bush meat as it's called than for domestic meat it's culturally preferred and it's not sustainable
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 819.95 826.57 <o,f0,female> and the huge logging camps in the forest are now demanding meat so the pygmy hunters in the congo basin
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 828.51 836.58 <o,f0,female> with their wonderful way of living for so many hundreds of years are now corrupted they're given weapons they shoot for the logging camps they get money
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 837.22 844.99 <o,f0,female> culture is being destroyed along with the animals upon whom they depend so when the logging camp moves there's nothing left
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 845.41 855.04 <o,f0,female> we talked already about the loss of human cultural diversity and i've seen it happening with my own eyes and the grim picture in africa i love africa
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 855.46 864.53 <o,f0,female> what do we see in africa we see deforestation we see the desert spreading we see massive hunger
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 865.08 878.01 <o,f0,female> we see disease and we see population growth in areas where there are more people living on a certain piece of land than the land can possibly support and they're too poor to buy food from elsewhere
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 878.67 889.11 <o,f0,female> the people that we heard about yesterday on the easter island who cut down their last tree were they stupid didn't they know what was happening of course but if you've seen the crippling poverty
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 889.33 898.19 <o,f0,female> in some of these parts of the world it isn't a question of let 's leave the tree for tomorrow how am i going to feed my family today maybe i can get just a few dollars
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 898.46 907.77 <o,f0,female> from this last tree which will keep us going a little bit longer and then we'll pray that something will happen to save us from the inevitable end so
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 908.44 919.22 <o,f0,female> this is a pretty grim picture the one thing we have which makes us so different from chimpanzees or other living creatures is this sophisticated spoken language
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 919.41 929.29 <o,f0,female> a language with which we can tell children about things that aren't here we can talk about the distant past plan for the distant future discuss ideas with each other
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 929.56 938.73 <o,f0,female> so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group we can do it by talking to each other we can do it through video we can do it through the
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 939.54 946.31 <o,f0,female> and we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards and we're destroying the world
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 946.53 953.83 <o,f0,female> in the developed world in a way it's worse because we have so much access to knowledge of the stupidity of what we're doing do
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 955.77 965.04 <o,f0,female> bringing little babies into a world where in many places the water is poisoning them and the air is harming them
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 965.29 975.00 <o,f0,female> and the food that's grown from the contaminated land is poisoning them and that's not just in the far away developing world that's everywhere do you know we all have about fifty
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 983.46 990.78 <o,f0,female> certain kinds of cancers are on the increase around places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1001.33 1014.45 <o,f0,female> mother nature where i believe we need to spend time where there's trees and flowers and birds for our good psychological development and yet there are hundreds and hundreds of children in the developed world who never
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1029.76 1038.16 <o,f0,female> as i was traveling around the world you know i had to leave the forest that's where i love to be i had to leave these fascinating chimpanzees
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1038.72 1049.10 <o,f0,female> my students and field staff to continue studying because finding they dwindled from about two million one hundred years ago to about one hundred and fifty thousand now
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1049.65 1057.66 <o,f0,female> i knew i had to leave the forest to do what i could to raise awareness around the world and the more i talked about the chimpanzees plight
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1057.88 1064.76 <o,f0,female> the more i realized the fact that everything 's interconnected and the problems of the developing world so often stem
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1066.20 1079.47 <o,f0,female> of the developed world and everything was joining together and making not sense hope lies in sense you said it's making a nonsense how can we do it somebody said that yesterday
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1080.00 1086.77 <o,f0,female> and as i was traveling around i kept meeting young people who 'd lost hope they were feeling
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1087.89 1095.89 <o,f0,female> they were feeling well it doesn't matter what we do eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die everything is hopeless we're always being told so by the media
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1096.61 1105.17 <o,f0,female> and then i met some who were angry and anger that can turn to violence and we're all familiar with that and i
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1106.24 1120.55 <o,f0,female> three little grandchildren and when some of these students would say to me at high school or university they'd say we 're angry or we 're filled with despair because we feel you've compromised our future and there's nothing we can do about it
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1120.92 1129.12 <o,f0,female> and i looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren and think how much we've harmed this planet since i was their age i feel this deep shame
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1138.25 1146.62 <o,f0,female> brochures all around outside and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future i beg that you pick up that brochure
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1147.58 1155.41 <o,f0,female> and roots and shoots is a program for hope roots make a firm foundation shoots seem tiny
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1155.56 1163.58 <o,f0,female> but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls see the brick walls as all the problems that we've inflicted on this planet then
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1164.01 1172.35 <o,f0,female> you see it is a message of hope hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through and can make this a better world
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1172.86 1180.85 <o,f0,female> and the most important message of roots and shoots is that every single individual makes a difference every individual has a role to
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1181.91 1192.06 <o,f0,female> every one of us impacts the world around us every day and you scientists know that you can't actually even if you stay in bed all day you're breathing oxygen and giving
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1194.28 1204.18 <o,f0,female> and probably going to the loo and things like that you're making a difference in the world so the roots and shoots program involves youth
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1204.73 1216.72 <o,f0,female> in three kinds of projects and these are projects to make the world around them a better place one project to show care and concern for your own human community
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1217.31 1230.04 <o,f0,female> one for animals including domestic animals and i have to say i learned everything i know about animal behavior even before i got to gombe and the chimps from my dog rusty who was my childhood companion
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1230.66 1243.01 <o,f0,female> and the third kind of project something for the local environment so what the kids do depends first of all how old are they and we go now from pre school right through university
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1243.54 1255.75 <o,f0,female> it's going to depend whether they're inner city or rural it's going to depend if they're wealthy or impoverished it's going to depend which part say of america they're in we're in every state
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1256.31 1264.40 <o,f0,female> and the problems in florida are different from the problems in new york it's going to depend on which country they're in and we're already in sixty
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1279.18 1291.64 <o,f0,female> because they're buying into it and they're the ones who get to decide what they're going to do it isn't something that their parents tell them or their teachers tell them that's effective but if they decide themselves
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1292.01 1299.45 <o,f0,female> we want to clean this river and put the fish back that used to be there we want to clear away the toxic
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1301.19 1307.93 <o,f0,female> from this area and have an organic garden we want to go and spend time with the old people and hear their stories
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1309.48 1319.47 <o,f0,female> oral histories we want to go and work in a dog shelter we want to learn about animals we want you know it goes on and on and this is very hopeful for me
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1319.77 1330.67 <o,f0,female> as i travel around the world three hundred days a year everywhere there's a group of roots and shoots of different ages everywhere there are children with shining eyes saying look at the difference we've made
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1331.41 1341.86 <o,f0,female> and now comes the technology into it because with this new way of communicating electronically these kids can communicate with each other around the world
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1342.35 1350.29 <o,f0,female> and if anyone is interested to help us we've got so many ideas but we need help we need help to create the right kind of
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1350.65 1358.11 <o,f0,female> system that will help these young people to communicate their excitement but also and this is so important to
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1366.87 1377.65 <o,f0,female> these kids who may be in america or maybe this is a group in israel saying yeah you did it a little bit wrong this is how you should do it the philosophy is very simple
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1379.10 1390.28 <o,f0,female> we do not believe in violence no violence no bombs no guns that's not the way to solve problems violence leads to violence at least in my view
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1391.17 1400.17 <o,f0,female> so how do we solve the tools for solving the problems are knowledge and understanding know the facts but see how they fit in the big picture
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1400.93 1407.87 <o,f0,female> hard work and persistence don 't give up and love and compassion leading to respect for all life
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1409.35 1410.59 <o,f0,female> minutes two one
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1419.55 1430.32 <o,f0,female> anyway so basically roots and shoots is beginning to change young people 's lives it's what i'm devoting most of my energy to
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1431.19 1432.00 <o,f0,female> and
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1432.81 1443.01 <o,f0,female> i believe that a group like this can have a very major impact not just because you can share technology with us but because so many of you have children
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1443.61 1454.04 <o,f0,female> and if you take this program out and give it to your children they have such a good opportunity to go out and do good because they've got parents like you
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1454.39 1462.04 <o,f0,female> and it's been so clear how much you all care about trying to make this world a better place it's very encouraging
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1462.59 1475.68 <o,f0,female> but the kids do ask me and this won 't take more than two minutes i promise the kids say doctor jane do you really have hope for the future you travel you see all these horrible things happening
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1476.76 1487.55 <o,f0,female> the human brain i don't need to say anything about that now that we know what the problems are around the world human brains like yours are rising to solve those problems and we've talked a lot about
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1498.28 1504.46 <o,f0,female> a whole area desolated and it can be brought back to bloom again with time or a little help
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1505.66 1518.58 <o,f0,female> and thirdly the last speaker talked about or the speaker before last talked about the indomitable human spirit we are surrounded by the most amazing people who
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1519.28 1529.58 <o,f0,female> do things that seem to be absolutely impossible nelson mandela i take a little piece of limestone from robben island prison where he labored for twenty seven years and came out
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1530.17 1541.74 <o,f0,female> so little bitterness he could lead his people from the horror of apartheid without a bloodbath even after the eleventh of september and i was in new york and i felt the fear
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1543.20 1554.38 <o,f0,female> nevertheless there was so much human courage so much love and so much compassion and then as i went around the country after that and felt the fear the fear that was leading
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1554.60 1565.39 <o,f0,female> to people feeling they couldn't worry about the environment any more in case they seemed not to be patriotic and i was trying to encourage them somebody came up with a little quotation from mahatma gandhi
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1565.85 1579.32 <o,f0,female> if you look back through human history you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good and just after that a woman brought me this little bell and i want to end on this note she said if you're talking
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1584.91 1599.00 <o,f0,female> this this bell is made from metal from a defused landmine from the killing fields of pol pot one of the most evil regimes in human history where people are now beginning to put their lives back together
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1600.05 1601.10 <o,f0,female> the regime has
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1602.34 1609.41 <o,f0,female> so yes there is hope and where is the hope is it out there with the politicians
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1610.35 1616.05 <o,f0,female> it's in our hands it's in your hands and my hands and those of our children
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1616.36 1624.34 <o,f0,female> it's really up to us we're the ones who can make a difference if we lead lives where we consciously leave the lightest possible
JaneGoodall_2002 1 JaneGoodall_2002 1624.99 1636.46 <o,f0,female> ecological footprints if we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy and don't buy the things that are not we can change the world overnight thank you
