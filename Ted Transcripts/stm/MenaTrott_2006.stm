MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 12.45 12.85 <o,f0,female> so
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 37.49 47.05 <o,f0,female> more nerve wracking but then i started thinking about my family i started thinking about my father and my grandfather and my great grandfather and i realized that
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 48.19 51.04 <o,f0,female> all of these teds going through my blood
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 53.74 56.78 <o,f0,female> i had to be consider this my element so
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 69.46 77.01 <o,f0,female> which i really was appalled by and because i wanted to impress
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 77.18 82.86 <o,f0,female> you all with slides since i saw the great presentations yesterday with graphs i made a graph that moves
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 83.61 85.74 <o,f0,female> and i talk about the makeup of me
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 90.46 96.46 <o,f0,female> so so besides this freakish thing this is my science slide so this is math and this is science this is genetics this is my grandmother
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 96.90 97.98 <o,f0,female> and this is where i get this mouth
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 102.56 108.86 <o,f0,female> i'm a blogger which probably to a lot of you means different things you may have heard about the kryptonite lock
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 109.40 120.21 <o,f0,female> sort of brouhaha where a blogger talked about how you hack or break into a kryptonite lock using a ballpoint pen and it spread all over kryptonite had to adjust the lock and they had to address it to
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 132.24 139.97 <o,f0,female> not typesetted on a old typewriter it's on word so bloggers exposed this or they worked hard to expose this
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 140.35 152.79 <o,f0,female> you know blogs are scary this is what you see i see this and i'm sure scared and i swear on stage shitless about blogs because this is not something that's friendly but there are blogs that
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 153.71 163.15 <o,f0,female> changing the way we read news and consume media and you know these are great examples these people are reaching thousands if not millions of readers and that's incredibly important
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 163.42 173.04 <o,f0,female> you know we had during the hurricane you have msnbc posting about the hurricane on their blog updating it frequently this was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 173.40 179.25 <o,f0,female> you know you have my friend who has a blog on digital on pdrs personal recorders
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 179.59 191.33 <o,f0,female> he makes enough money just by running ads to support his family up in oregon that's all he does now and this is something that blogs has made possible and then you have something like this which is interplast it's a wonderful organization
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 191.90 204.65 <o,f0,female> of people and doctors who go to developing nations to offer plastic surgery to those who need it so children with cleft palates they will get it and they document their story this is wonderful i am not
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 205.63 206.07 <o,f0,female> caring
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 210.31 212.14 <o,f0,female> that's what i am i'm a blogger i
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 224.04 233.07 <o,f0,female> i wasn't happy with my job because i was a designer but i wasn't being really stimulated i was an english major in college i didn't have any use for it but i missed writing
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 233.56 241.95 <o,f0,female> so i started to write a blog and i started to create things like these little stories and this was an illustration about my camp experience when i was eleven years old
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 242.35 254.70 <o,f0,female> and how i went to a ymca camp christian camp and basically by the end i had made my friends hate me so much that i hid in a bunk they couldn't find me they sent a search party and i overheard people saying
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 255.00 265.50 <o,f0,female> they wish i had killed myself jumped off bible peak so you can laugh this is ok this is who makes this is me this is what happened to me
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 265.91 277.14 <o,f0,female> and when i started my blog it was really this one goal i wanted i realized i said you know i am not going to be famous to the world but i could be famous to people on the internet
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 277.68 287.65 <o,f0,female> and i set a goal i said i'm going to win an award because i had never won an award in my entire life and i said i'm going to win this award the south by southwest weblog award and i
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 288.71 295.99 <o,f0,female> reached all of these people and i had tens of thousands of people reading about my life everyday and then i wrote a post about a banjo
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 296.75 309.42 <o,f0,female> i wrote a post about wanting to buy a banjo a three hundred dollar banjo which is a lot of money and i don't play instruments i don't know anything about music i like music and i
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 310.44 318.43 <o,f0,female> and i think i probably heard steve martin playing and i said i could do that and i said i said to my husband i said ben can i buy a banjo and he 's like no and my
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 328.21 333.99 <o,f0,female> he told me you cannot buy a banjo this is you're just like your dad who buys who collects instruments and
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 334.68 345.64 <o,f0,female> i wrote a post about how i was so mad at him he was such a tyrant he would not let me buy this banjo and for those people who know me understood my joke this is mena this is how i make a joke at people because
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 345.85 354.80 <o,f0,female> the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant this person is so loving and so sweet that he lets me dress him up and post pictures of him to my blog
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 359.56 370.98 <o,f0,female> if he knew i was showing this right now i put this in today he would kill me but the thing was i wrote this and my friends read it and they're like oh that mena she wrote a post about you know wanting a stupid thing and being stupid
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 371.73 379.16 <o,f0,female> but i got emails from people that said oh my god your husband is such an asshole how much money does he spend on beer in a year
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 397.34 404.96 <o,f0,female> ok what who are these people and why are they reading this and i realized i don't want to reach these people i don't want to write for this public audience
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 405.38 416.64 <o,f0,female> and i started to kill my blog slowly i'm like i don't want to write this anymore and i slowly and slowly and i did tell personal stories from time to then i wrote this one and i put this up because of einstein today
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 436.20 448.70 <o,f0,female> personal that interests me and this is you know this is who who i am you know you see norman rockwell and you have art critics say you know norman rockwell is not art norman rockwell hangs in living rooms and bathrooms and this is not
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 449.21 456.10 <o,f0,female> something to be considered high art and i think this is like one of the most important things to us as you know humans
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 456.51 464.14 <o,f0,female> these things resonate to us and you know if you think about blogs you think of high art blogs the history paintings about you know
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 464.74 476.53 <o,f0,female> all biblical stories and then you have this these are the blogs that interest me the people that just tell stories and one story is about this baby and his name is odin and his father was a blogger
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 477.18 489.04 <o,f0,female> and he was writing his blog one day and his wife gave birth to her baby twenty five at twenty five weeks and he never expected this one day it was normal one day then the next day it was hell
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 489.39 499.54 <o,f0,female> and this is a one pound baby and so odin was documented every single day pictures were taken every day day one day two you know you have day nine they're talking about his apnea
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 500.24 507.39 <o,f0,female> thirty nine he gets pneumonia this his baby is so small and i've never encountered such a just
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 517.15 526.30 <o,f0,female> he 's having failures breathing failures and heart failures and it's slowing down and you don't know what to expect but then it gets better you know day ninety six he goes home
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 527.74 539.63 <o,f0,female> you see this post that's not something that you're going to see in a paper or a magazine but this is something that this person feels and people are excited about it you know twenty eight comments that's not a huge amount of people reading but twenty eight people matter
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 540.08 547.89 <o,f0,female> and today he is a healthy baby who you know if you read his blog it's snowdeal org his father 's blog he
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 558.76 571.63 <o,f0,female> so blogs you know so what you've probably heard these thing before we talked about the well and we talked about all these sort of things throughout our online history but i think blogs are basically just an evolution
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 572.11 582.19 <o,f0,female> and that's where we are today it's this record of who you are your persona you have your google search where you say hey what is mena trott and then you find these things and you're happy or unhappy
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 583.18 591.78 <o,f0,female> but then you also find people 's blogs and those are the records of people that are writing daily not necessarily about the same topic but things that interest to them
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 593.64 603.17 <o,f0,female> we talk about the world flattens as being this panel and i am very optimistic whenever i think about blogs i'm like oh we've got to reach all these people millions and hundreds of millions and billions of people
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 626.64 633.03 <o,f0,female> the life record of a blog is something that i find incredibly important and we started with a slide of my
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 646.66 656.35 <o,f0,female> but you know this is basically the extent of the family that i know in terms of my direct line and i showed a norman rockwell painting before and this one
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 656.54 668.52 <o,f0,female> i grew up with looking at constantly i would spend hours looking at just the connections saying oh the little kid at the top has red hair so does that first generation up there and just these little things you know this is not
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 670.30 677.40 <o,f0,female> science but this was enough for me to be really so interested about how we have evolved and how we can trace our line
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 689.51 700.55 <o,f0,female> this is all i have i have a couple of facts about somebody i have their date of birth and their age and what they did in their household if they spoke english and that's it that's all i know of these people
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 700.88 710.30 <o,f0,female> and it's pretty sad because how i only go back five generations and then it's it i don't even know what happens on my mom 's side because she's from cuba and i don't have that many things
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 725.20 732.72 <o,f0,female> this is my great great grandmother this is the only picture i have and to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 743.46 753.56 <o,f0,female> photo that has greatly influenced me or a series of photos is this project that's done by an argentinean man or his and his wife and he 's basically taking a picture of his family every day
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 753.78 760.56 <o,f0,female> for the past what is seventy six twenty oh my god i'm seventy seven twenty nine years twenty nine years
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 762.57 769.47 <o,f0,female> a joke originally about my graph that i left out is that you see all this math i'm just happy i was able to add it up to one hundred because that's my skill set
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 773.22 779.30 <o,f0,female> so this you have you have these people aging and now this is them today or last year
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 779.93 786.51 <o,f0,female> a powerful thing to have to be able to track this i wish that i would have this of my family i know that
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 787.02 795.73 <o,f0,female> one day my children will be wondering or my grandchildren or my great grandchildren if i ever have children what i am going to
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 796.51 809.31 <o,f0,female> who i was and so i do something that's very narcissistic i am a blogger that is an amazing thing for me because it captures a moment in time every day i take a picture of myself i've been doing this since last year
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 841.88 843.98 <o,f0,female> because there are bad pictures
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 854.22 864.28 <o,f0,female> not to be there and so you see these things it's not just always smiling now i've kind of evolved it so i have this look if you look at my driver 's license i have the same look and it's it's a pretty
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 881.86 891.80 <o,f0,female> so this woman her name was emma and she was a blogger on our service typepad and she was a beta tester so she was there right when we opened you know there was one hundred people
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 892.34 906.05 <o,f0,female> and she wrote about her life dealing with cancer and she was writing and writing and writing and we all started reading it because we had so few blogs on the service we could keep track of everyone and she was writing one day and you know then she disappeared for a little bit
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 906.49 907.71 <o,f0,female> and her sister came on
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 908.23 918.60 <o,f0,female> and she said that that emma had passed away and all of our support staff who had talked to her were were really emotional and it was a very hard day at the company
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 919.13 930.09 <o,f0,female> and it was this was one of those instances where i realized how much blogging affects our relationship and flattening this sort of world that this woman is in england and she lives
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 930.66 936.10 <o,f0,female> she lived a life where she was talking about her what she was doing but the big thing that
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 936.77 949.31 <o,f0,female> really influenced us was her sister wrote to me and she said you know and she wrote on this blog that writing her blog during the last couple of months of her life was probably the best thing that had happened to her and being able to talk to people being able to share
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 949.54 956.64 <o,f0,female> what was going on and being able to write and receive comments and that was amazing to be able to know that we had empowered that and that
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 957.27 971.91 <o,f0,female> blogging was something that she felt comfortable doing and that the idea that blogging doesn't have to be scary that we don't always have to be attack of the blogs that we can be people who are open and wanting to help and talk to people that was an amazing thing and
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 972.64 984.41 <o,f0,female> and so i printed out her or i sent a pdf of her blog to her family and they passed it out at her memorial service and even in her her obituary they mentioned her blog because it was such a big part of her life and that's a huge thing
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 984.82 995.37 <o,f0,female> so that's this is her legacy and i think that my call to action to all of you is you know think about blogs think about what they are think about what you've thought of them you know and then
MenaTrott_2006 1 MenaTrott_2006 995.91 1000.23 <o,f0,female> actually do it because it's something that is really going to change our lives so thank you
