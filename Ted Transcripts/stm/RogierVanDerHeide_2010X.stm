RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 17.03 22.93 <o,f0,male> statement on the screen that says light creates ambiance light makes
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 54.65 63.4 <o,f0,male> that there is no good lighting that is healthy and for our well being without proper darkness
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 63.4 74.9 <o,f0,male> so this is how we normally would light our offices we have codes and standards that tell us that the lights should be so much lux and of great uniformity
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 88.19 100.01 <o,f0,male> if we would apply these codes and standards to the pantheon in rome it would never have looked like this because this beautiful light feature that goes around there all by itself
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 100.01 110.17 <o,f0,male> can only appear because there is also darkness in that same building and the same is more or less what santiago calatrava said when he said light
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 110.17 128.45 <o,f0,male> i make it in my buildings for comfort and he didn 't mean the comfort of a five course dinner as opposed to a one course meal but he really meant the comfort of the quality of the building for the people he meant that you can see the sky and that you can experience the sun
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 128.51 138.48 <o,f0,male> and he created these gorgeous buildings where you can see the sky and where you can experience the sun that give us a better life in the built environment
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 138.48 145.09 <o,f0,male> just because of the relevance of light in its brightness and also in its shadows
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 161.51 164.39 <o,f0,male> a manifestation of that energy
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 164.39 183.39 <o,f0,male> the sun is for dynamics for color changes the sun is for beauty in our environment like in this building the high museum in atlanta which has been created by renzo piano from italy together with arup lighting a brilliant team of lighting designers who
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 183.39 201.23 <o,f0,male> created a very subtle modulation of light across the space responding to what the sun does outside just because of all these beautiful openings in the roof so in an indirect way you can see the sun and what they did is they created an integral building element
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 201.23 204.62 <o,f0,male> to improve the quality of the space
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 204.62 210.51 <o,f0,male> that surrounds the visitors of the museum they created this shade that you can see here
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 210.52 216.96 <o,f0,male> which actually covers the sun but opens up to the good light from the sky
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 216.96 225.46 <o,f0,male> and here you can see how they really crafted a beautiful design process with physical models with quantitative as well as qualitative methods
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 225.46 239.48 <o,f0,male> to come to a final solution that is truly integrated and completely holistic with the architecture they allowed themselves a few mistakes along the way as you can see here there 's some direct light on the floor but they could easily figure out where that comes from
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 239.48 248.03 <o,f0,male> and they allow people in that building to really enjoy the sun the good part of the sun
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 248.03 254.32 <o,f0,male> and enjoying the sun can be in many different ways of course it can be just like this
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 254.32 269.68 <o,f0,male> or maybe like this which is rather peculiar but this is in one thousand nine hundred and sixty three the viewing of a sun eclipse in the united states and it 's just a bit bright up there so these people have found a very intriguing solution
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 269.68 275.2 <o,f0,male> this is i think a very illustrative image of what i try to say that the beautiful dynamics of sun
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 275.2 277.62 <o,f0,male> bringing these into the building
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 277.62 289.54 <o,f0,male> creates a quality of our built environment that truly enhances our lives and this is all about darkness as much as it is about lightness of course because otherwise you don 't see these dynamics
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 289.54 305.06 <o,f0,male> as opposed to the first office that i showed you in the beginning of the talk this is a well known office which is the white group they are in green energy consulting or something like that and they really practice what they preach because this office doesn 't have any electric lighting at all
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 305.06 307.86 <o,f0,male> it has only on one side
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 307.86 316.81 <o,f0,male> this big big glass window that helps to let the sunlight enter deep into the space and create a beautiful quality there and a great dynamic range
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 335.36 341.56 <o,f0,male> i really owe a short introduction of this man to you this is richard kelly
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 341.56 358.89 <o,f0,male> who was born one hundred years ago which is the reason i bring him up now because it 's kind of an anniversary year in the one thousand nine hundred and thirty s richard kelly was the first person to really describe a methodology of modern lighting design and he coined three terms which are focal glow
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 358.89 377.89 <o,f0,male> ambient luminescence and play of the brilliants three very distinctly different ideas about light in architecture that all together make up this beautiful experience so you begin with focal glow he meant something like this where the light gives direction to the space and helps you to get around
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 377.89 391.81 <o,f0,male> or something like this which is the lighting design he did for general motors for the car showroom and you enter that space and you feel like wow this is so impressive just because of this focal point this huge light source in the middle
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 391.81 399.45 <o,f0,male> to me it is something from theatre and i will get back to that a little bit later it 's the spotlight on the artist that helps you to focus
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 399.45 409.78 <o,f0,male> it could also be the sunlight that breaks through the clouds and lights up a patch of the land highlighting it compared to the dim environment
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 409.78 418.02 <o,f0,male> or it can be in today 's retail in the shopping environment lighting the merchandise and creating accents that help you to get around
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 418.02 420.99 <o,f0,male> ambient luminescence is something very different
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 420.99 437.32 <o,f0,male> richard kelly saw it as something infinite something without any focus something where all details actually dissolve in infinity and i see it as a very comfortable kind of light that really helps us to relax
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 437.32 450.28 <o,f0,male> and to contemplate it could also be something like this the national museum of science in london where this blue is embracing all the exhibitions and galleries in one large gesture
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 454.1 470.39 <o,f0,male> really some play of the skyline of hong kong or perhaps the chandelier in the opera house or in the theater here which is a decoration the icing on the cake something playful something that is just an addition to the architectural environment i would say
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 470.39 476.61 <o,f0,male> these three distinct elements together make a lighting environment that helps us to feel better
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 476.61 490.56 <o,f0,male> and we can only create these out of darkness and i will explain that further and i guess that is something that richard kelly here on the left was explaining to ludwig mies van der rohe and behind them you see that seagram building that later turned into
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 490.57 493.9 <o,f0,male> an icon of modern lighting design
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 493.9 504.89 <o,f0,male> those times there were some early attempts also for light therapy already you can see here a photo from the united states library of medicine where people are put in the sun to get better
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 504.89 509.9 <o,f0,male> it 's a little bit of a different story this health aspect of light than what i 'm telling you today
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 509.9 518.42 <o,f0,male> in today 's modern medicine there is a real understanding of light in an almost biochemical way
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 518.42 537.45 <o,f0,male> and there is the idea that when we look at things it is the yellow light that helps us the most that we are the most sensitive for but our circadian rhythms which are the rhythms that help us to wake and sleep and be alert and relaxed and so forth and so on they are much more triggered by blue light
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 537.45 547.21 <o,f0,male> and by modulating the amount of blue in our environment we can help people to relax or to be alert to fall asleep or to stay awake
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 547.21 558.67 <o,f0,male> and that is how maybe in the near future light can help hospitals to make people better sooner recover them quicker
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 558.67 570.51 <o,f0,male> maybe in the airplane we can overcome jet lag like that perhaps in school we can help children to learn better because they concentrate more on their work and you can imagine a lot more applications
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 570.51 580.52 <o,f0,male> but i would like to talk further about the combination of light and darkness as a quality in our life
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 580.52 588.68 <o,f0,male> so light is of course for social interaction also to create relationships with all the features around us
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 588.68 602.83 <o,f0,male> it is the place where we gather around when we have to say something to each other and it is all about this planet but when you look at this planet at night it looks like this and i think this is the most shocking image in my talk today
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 602.83 605.42 <o,f0,male> because all this light here goes up
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 605.42 622.55 <o,f0,male> to the sky it never reaches the ground where it was meant for it never is to the benefit of people it only spoils the darkness so at a global scale it looks like this and i mean that is quite amazing what you see here how much light goes up
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 622.55 627.51 <o,f0,male> into the sky and never reaches the ground because if we look at the earth
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 627.51 639.06 <o,f0,male> the way it should be it would be something like this very inspiring image where darkness is for our imagination and for contemplation and to help us to relate to everything
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 639.06 649.55 <o,f0,male> the world is changing though and urbanization is a big driver of everything i took this photo two weeks ago in guangzhou and i realized that ten years ago there was nothing like this
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 649.55 664.09 <o,f0,male> of these buildings it was just a much smaller city and the pace of urbanization is incredible and enormous and we have to understand these main questions how do people move through these new urban spaces
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 664.09 668.03 <o,f0,male> how do they share their culture how do we tackle things like mobility
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 668.03 681.25 <o,f0,male> and how can light help there because the new technologies they seem to be in a really interesting position to contribute to the solutions of urbanization and to provide us with better environments
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 681.25 690.51 <o,f0,male> it 's not that long ago that our lighting was just done with these kinds of lamps and of course we had the metal halide lamps and fluorescent lamps and things like that
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 690.51 699.8 <o,f0,male> now we have led but here you see the latest one and you see how incredibly small it is and this is exactly what offers us a unique opportunity
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 699.8 713.64 <o,f0,male> because this tiny tiny size allows us to put the light wherever we really need it and we can actually leave it out where it 's not needed at all and where we can preserve darkness so that is a really interesting proposition i think and a new way
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 713.65 718.48 <o,f0,male> of lighting the architectural environment with our well being in mind
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 718.48 724.67 <o,f0,male> the problem is though that i wanted to explain to you how this really works but i can have four of these on my finger
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 724.67 740.66 <o,f0,male> so you would not to be able to really see them so i asked our laboratory to do something about it and they said well we can do something they created for me the biggest led in the world especially for tedx in amsterdam so here it is it 's the same thing as you can see over there
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 740.66 746.2 <o,f0,male> just two hundred times bigger and i will very quickly show you how it works so just
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 746.2 754.32 <o,f0,male> to explain now every led that is made these days gives blue light
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 754.32 763.17 <o,f0,male> now this is not very pleasant and comfortable and for that reason we cover the led with
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 763.17 767.48 <o,f0,male> a phosphor cap and the phosphor is excited by the blue
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 767.48 787.4 <o,f0,male> and makes the light white and warm and pleasant and then when you add the lens to that you can bundle the light and send it to wherever you need it without any need to spill any light to the sky or anywhere else so you can preserve the darkness and make the light i just wanted to show that to you so you understand
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 809.84 814.9 <o,f0,male> can we be more gentle with light like here this is a very low light level actually
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 814.9 833.35 <o,f0,male> can we engage people more in the lighting projects that we create so they really want to connect with it like here or can we create simply sculptures that are very inspiring to be in and to be around and can we preserve the darkness because to find a place like this today on earth is really very very challenging
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 833.35 836.8 <o,f0,male> and to find a starry sky like this is even more difficult
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 836.8 853.19 <o,f0,male> even in the oceans we are creating a lot of light that we could actually ban also for animal life to have a much greater well being and it 's known that migrating birds for example get very disoriented because of these offshore platforms and we discovered that when we make those lights green
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 853.19 861.49 <o,f0,male> the birds they actually go the right way they are not disturbed anymore and it turns out once again that spectral sensitivity
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 863.8 879.19 <o,f0,male> in all of these examples i think we should start making the light out of darkness and use the darkness as a canvas like the visual artists do like edward hopper in this painting i think that there is a lot of suspense in this painting i think
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 879.19 892.86 <o,f0,male> when i see it i start to think who are those people where have they come from where are they going what just happened what will be happening in the next five minutes and it only embodies all these stories and all this suspense because of the darkness and the light
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 908.57 916.87 <o,f0,male> and enjoy the greatest show in the universe which is of course the universe itself
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 916.87 922.59 <o,f0,male> so i give you this wonderful informative image
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 922.59 937.89 <o,f0,male> of the sky ranging from the inner city where you may see one or two stars and nothing else all the way to the rural environments where you can enjoy this great and gorgeous and beautiful performance of the constellations and the stars
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 937.89 940.63 <o,f0,male> in architecture it works just the same
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 940.63 949.58 <o,f0,male> by appreciating the darkness when you design the light you create much more interesting environments that truly enhance our lives
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 959.33 972.01 <o,f0,male> where light and dark in very gentle combinations alter each other to define the space or richard mccormack 's southern tube station in london where you can really see the sky even though you are under the ground
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 991.55 999.65 <o,f0,male> and i think the theater is a place where we truly enhance life with light thank you very much
