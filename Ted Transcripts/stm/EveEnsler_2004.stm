EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 14.09 21.66 <o,f0,female> you're worried i was worried that's why i began this piece i was
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 21.95 23.06 <o,f0,female> worried about
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 25.10 32.88 <o,f0,female> i was worried what we think about vaginas and even more worried that we don't think about them i was worried about my own vagina
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 33.19 43.78 <o,f0,female> it needed a context a culture a community of other vaginas there is so much darkness and secrecy surrounding them like the bermuda triangle
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 44.47 46.37 <o,f0,female> nobody ever reports back from
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 47.88 54.99 <o,f0,female> in the first place it's not so easy to even find your vagina women go days weeks months without looking at it
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 55.47 64.19 <o,f0,female> i interviewed a high powered business woman she told me she didn't have time looking at your vagina she said is a full day 's work you 've got
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 66.24 79.54 <o,f0,female> in front of a mirror full length preferred you've got to get in the perfect position with the perfect light which then becomes shadowed by the angle you're at you're twisting your head up arching your back it's exhausting she was busy she didn't have time
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 80.24 88.71 <o,f0,female> so i decided to talk to women about their vaginas they began as casual vagina interviews and they turned into vagina monologues
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 89.00 100.28 <o,f0,female> i talked with over two hundred women i talked to older women younger women married women lesbians single women i talked to corporate professionals college professors actors sex
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 101.24 113.81 <o,f0,female> i talked to african american women asian american women native american women caucasian women jewish women ok at first women were a little shy a little reluctant to talk
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 114.50 120.63 <o,f0,female> once they got going you couldn't stop them women love to talk about their vaginas they
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 121.64 123.91 <o,f0,female> mainly because no one 's ever asked them before
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 130.52 131.73 <o,f0,female> sounds like an infection
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 133.35 136.70 <o,f0,female> maybe a medical instrument hurry nurse bring the vagina
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 137.93 151.60 <o,f0,female> vagina vagina vagina it doesn't matter how many times you say the word it never sounds like a word you want to say it's a completely ridiculous totally un sexy word if you use it during sex trying to be politically correct
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 154.23 165.44 <o,f0,female> my vagina you kill the act right there i'm worried what we call them and don't call them in great neck new york they call it a pussy cat
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 165.91 171.88 <o,f0,female> a woman told me there her mother used to tell her don 't wear panties dear underneath your pajamas you need to air out your pussy cat
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 177.79 190.03 <o,f0,female> a pooky in new jersey a twat there's powder box derriere a pooky a poochy a poopy a poopaloo a pooninana a padepachetchki a pow and a peach
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 191.57 194.69 <o,f0,female> there's toadie dee dee nishi dignity
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 199.17 202.71 <o,f0,female> gladis siegelman va wee wee
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 224.95 237.27 <o,f0,female> but it really didn't begin there it began with a conversation with a woman we were having a conversation about menopause and we got onto the subject of her vagina which you'll do if you're talking about menopause
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 237.73 247.84 <o,f0,female> and she said things that really shocked me about her vagina that it was dried up and finished and dead and i was kind of shocked and so i said to a friend casually well what do you think about your vagina and
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 248.23 257.31 <o,f0,female> that woman said something more amazing and then the next woman said something more amazing and before i knew it every woman was telling me i had to talk to somebody about their vagina because they had an amazing story
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 257.80 263.67 <o,f0,female> and i was sucked down the vagina trail and i really haven't gotten off of it
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 264.44 273.70 <o,f0,female> i think if you had told me when i was younger that i was going to grow up being in shoe stores and people were going to scream out there she is the vagina lady i don't know that that would have been my life ambition
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 275.42 283.52 <o,f0,female> but i want to talk a little bit about happiness and the relationship to this whole vagina journey because it has been an extraordinary journey that began eight years ago
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 283.95 290.71 <o,f0,female> i think before i did the vagina monologues i didn't really believe in happiness i thought that only idiots were happy
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 290.78 302.28 <o,f0,female> to be honest i remember when i started practicing buddhism fourteen years ago and i was told that the end of this practice was to be happy i said how could you be happy and live in this world of suffering
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 302.61 309.15 <o,f0,female> and live in this world of pain i mistook happiness for a lot of other things like numbness
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 309.53 319.41 <o,f0,female> or decadence or selfishness and what happened through the course of the vagina monologues and this journey is i think i have come to understand a little bit more about happiness
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 320.09 329.87 <o,f0,female> three qualities i want to talk about one is seeing what's right in front of you and talking about it and stating it i think what i learned from
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 330.29 340.05 <o,f0,female> talking about the vagina and speaking about the vagina is it was the most obvious thing it was right in the center of my body and the center of the world and yet it was the one thing nobody talked about
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 340.52 353.72 <o,f0,female> the second thing is that what talking about the vagina did is it opened this door which allowed me to see that there was a way to serve the world to make it better and that's where the deepest happiness has actually come from
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 354.30 368.99 <o,f0,female> and the third principle of happiness which i've realized recently eight years ago this momentum and this energy this v wave started and i can only describe it as a v wave because to be honest i really don't understand it completely i feel at the service of it
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 369.24 380.33 <o,f0,female> but this wave started and if i questioned the wave or tried to stop the wave or look back at the wave i often have the experience of whiplash or the potential of my neck breaking
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 380.58 392.10 <o,f0,female> but if i go with the wave and i trust the wave and i move with the wave i go to the next place and it happens logically and organically and truthfully and i started this piece particularly
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 392.52 403.07 <o,f0,female> with stories and narratives and i was talking to one woman and that led to another woman and that led to another woman and then i wrote those stories down and i put them out in front of other people
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 416.94 429.31 <o,f0,female> but in fact that's not what women lined up to tell me what women lined up to tell me was how they were raped and how they were battered and how they were beaten and how they were gang raped in parking lots and how they were incested by their
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 443.79 456.16 <o,f0,female> 's get women together what could we do with this information that all these women are being violated and it turned out after thinking and investigating that i discovered and the un has actually said this recently
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 456.50 467.12 <o,f0,female> that one out of every three women on this planet will be beaten or raped in her lifetime that's essentially a gender that's essentially the resource of the planet which is women
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 485.61 489.11 <o,f0,female> that catalyzed this wave this energy
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 489.46 501.18 <o,f0,female> and within five years this extraordinary thing began to happen one woman took that energy and she said i want to bring this wave this energy to college campuses and so she took the play
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 513.53 518.84 <o,f0,female> and over the course of the last six years it's spread and it's spread and it's spread and it's spread around the world
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 523.47 532.37 <o,f0,female> one that the epidemic of violence towards women is shocking it's global it is so profound and it is so devastating and it is so in
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 532.58 546.08 <o,f0,female> every little pocket of every little crater of every little society that we don't even recognize it because it's become ordinary this journey has taken me to afghanistan where i had the extraordinary honor and privilege to go into
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 547.23 557.60 <o,f0,female> parts of afghanistan under the taliban i was dressed in a burqa and i went in with an extraordinary group called the revolutionary association of the women of afghanistan and i saw firsthand
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 557.97 561.15 <o,f0,female> how women had been stripped of every single right
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 561.39 565.88 <o,f0,female> that was possible to strip women of from being educated to being employed
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 565.98 568.67 <o,f0,female> to being actually allowed to eat ice cream
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 568.97 572.65 <o,f0,female> for those of you who don't know it it was illegal to eat ice cream under the taliban
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 583.64 593.24 <o,f0,female> we went to a back room and women were seated and a curtain was pulled around us and they were served vanilla ice cream and women lifted their burqas and ate this ice cream
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 593.59 606.26 <o,f0,female> and i don't think i ever understood pleasure until that moment and how women have found a way to keep their pleasure alive it has taken me this journey to islamabad where i have witnessed and met women with their faces melted off
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 606.60 618.46 <o,f0,female> it has taken me to juarez mexico where i was a week ago where i have literally been there in parking lots where bones of women have washed up and been dumped next to coca cola bottles
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 619.02 625.77 <o,f0,female> it has taken me to universities all over this country where girls are date raped and drugged i have seen terrible
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 628.72 639.76 <o,f0,female> but i have also recognized in the course of seeing that violence that being in the face of things and seeing actually what's in front of us is the antidote to depression
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 640.14 655.44 <o,f0,female> and to a feeling that one is worthless and has no value because before the vagina monologues i will say that eighty percent of my consciousness was closed off to what was really going on in this reality and that closing off closed off my vitality and my life energy
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 656.05 665.02 <o,f0,female> what has also happened is in the course of these travels and it's been an extraordinary thing is that every single place that i have gone to in the world i have met a
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 665.79 674.22 <o,f0,female> and i really love hearing about all these species at the bottom of the sea and i was thinking about how being with these extraordinary people on this particular panel
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 674.73 680.46 <o,f0,female> that it's beneath beyond and between and the vagina kind of fits into all those categories
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 681.82 691.64 <o,f0,female> but one of the things i've seen is this species and it is a species and it is a new paradigm and it doesn't get reported in the press or in the media because i don't think good news ever
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 692.31 706.21 <o,f0,female> news and i don't think people who are transforming the planet are what gets the ratings on tv shows but every single country i have been to and in the last six years i've been to about forty five countries and many tiny little villages and cities and towns
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 718.67 727.31 <o,f0,female> than getting an ak forty seven or a weapon of mass destruction or a machete they hold the violence in their bodies
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 729.80 730.64 <o,f0,female> experience it
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 731.09 735.27 <o,f0,female> and then they go out and devote their lives to making sure it doesn't happen to anybody else
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 746.57 754.49 <o,f0,female> and i think that one of the things about being at ted that's been very interesting is that i live in my body a lot and i don't live in my head very much anymore
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 754.71 762.82 <o,f0,female> and this is a very heady place and it's been really interesting to be in my head for the last two days i've been very disoriented because i think
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 763.92 769.92 <o,f0,female> the world the v world is very much in your body it's a body world and the species really exists in the body
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 770.13 779.53 <o,f0,female> and i think there's a real significance in us attaching our bodies to our heads that that separation has created a divide that is often separating purpose
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 779.95 789.82 <o,f0,female> from intent and the connection between body and head often brings those things into union i want to talk about three particular people that i've met
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 799.40 807.45 <o,f0,female> was a woman i met in guatemala she was fourteen years old and she was in a marriage and her husband was beating her on a regular basis
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 807.90 816.70 <o,f0,female> and she couldn't get out because she was addicted to the relationship and she had no money her sister was younger than her and she applied we had a stop rape contest
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 817.24 824.49 <o,f0,female> a few years ago in new york and she applied hoping that she would become a finalist and she could bring her sister she
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 825.16 831.94 <o,f0,female> did become a finalist she brought marsha to new york and at that time we did this extraordinary v day at madison square garden
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 832.25 846.34 <o,f0,female> where we sold out the entire testosterone filled dome eighteen thousand people standing up to say yes to vaginas which was really a pretty incredible transformation and she came and she witnessed this and she decided that she would go back and leave her husband
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 855.63 862.28 <o,f0,female> and i watched her walk up on stage in her red short dress and high heels and she stood there and she said my name is
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 863.57 868.10 <o,f0,female> i was beaten by my husband for five years he almost murdered me i left
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 868.48 872.95 <o,f0,female> and you can too and the entire two thousand people went absolutely crazy
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 873.79 883.45 <o,f0,female> a woman named esther chavez who i met in juarez mexico and esther chavez was a brilliant accountant in mexico city she was seventy two years old and she was planning to retire
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 883.90 895.06 <o,f0,female> she went to juarez to take care of an ailing aunt and over the course of it she began to discover what was happening to the murdered and disappeared women of juarez she gave up her life
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 895.43 908.74 <o,f0,female> she moved to juarez she started to write the stories which documented the disappeared women three hundred women have disappeared in a border town because they're brown and poor there has been no response to the disappearance and not one person has been held accountable
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 908.99 917.23 <o,f0,female> she began to document it she opened a center called casa amiga and in six years she has literally brought this to the consciousness of the world
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 917.51 924.16 <o,f0,female> we were there a week ago when there were seven thousand people on the street and it was truly a miracle and as we walked through the streets
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 924.63 935.41 <o,f0,female> people of juarez who normally don't even come into the streets because the streets are so dangerous literally stood there and wept to see that other people from the world had showed up for that particular community
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 958.78 969.35 <o,f0,female> when she got older she created this incredible thing it's an anatomical sculpture of a woman 's body it's half a woman 's body and she walked through the rift valley and she had
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 978.71 986.18 <o,f0,female> and in the course of her travel she walked literally for eight years through the rift valley through dust through sleeping on the ground because the
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 996.23 1009.17 <o,f0,female> and in that time she created an alternative ritual which involved girls coming of age without the cut when we met her three years ago we said what could v day do for you and she said well if you got me a jeep i could get around a lot faster
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 1010.62 1013.97 <o,f0,female> so we bought her a jeep and in the year that she had the jeep she
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 1014.86 1016.24 <o,f0,female> five hundred girls from being cut
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 1025.58 1035.26 <o,f0,female> i want to tell this little story about my own beginnings because it's very interrelated to happiness and and agnes when i was a little girl and i grew up in a
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 1035.70 1044.38 <o,f0,female> wealthy community it was a upper middle class white community and it had all the trappings and the looks of a perfectly nice wonderful
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 1045.41 1054.48 <o,f0,female> great life and everyone was supposed to be happy in that community and in fact my life was hell i lived with an alcoholic father who beat me and molested me and it was all inside
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 1055.35 1063.72 <o,f0,female> and always as a child i had this fantasy that somebody would come and rescue me and i actually made up a little character whose name was mister alligator
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 1064.03 1071.87 <o,f0,female> and i would call him up when things got really bad and i would say it was time to come and pick me up and i would go and pack a little bag and i would wait for mister alligator to come
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 1072.34 1077.20 <o,f0,female> now mister alligator never did come but the idea of mister alligator coming
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 1089.43 1097.94 <o,f0,female> and we're walking we arrive at the opening of this house and agnes hadn't let me come to the house for days because they were preparing this whole ritual and
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 1098.23 1106.52 <o,f0,female> i want to tell you a great story when agnes first started fighting to stop female genital mutilation in her community she had become an outcast and she was exiled
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 1106.65 1115.06 <o,f0,female> she was slandered and the whole community turned against her but being a vagina warrior she kept going and she kept committing herself to transforming consciousness
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 1115.69 1121.68 <o,f0,female> and in the masai community goats and cows are the most valued possession they're like the mercedes benz
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 1123.31 1135.35 <o,f0,female> of the rift valley and she said two days before the house opened two different people arrived to give her a goat each and she said to me i knew then that female genital mutilation would end one day in africa
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 1136.26 1138.65 <o,f0,female> anyway we arrived and when we arrived
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 1139.86 1154.20 <o,f0,female> there were hundreds of girls dressed in red homemade dresses which is the color of the masai and the color of v day and they greeted us and they had made up these songs that they were singing about the end of suffering and the end of mutilation and they walked us down the path
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 1172.63 1185.97 <o,f0,female> and he'd show up obviously in a form that it took me a long time to understand which is that when we give in the world what we want the most we heal the broken part inside each of us
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 1186.86 1195.80 <o,f0,female> and i feel in the last eight years that this journey this miraculous vagina journey has taught me this really simple thing which is that
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 1196.51 1203.16 <o,f0,female> happiness exists in action it exists in telling the truth and saying what your truth is
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 1203.79 1206.51 <o,f0,female> and it exists in giving away what you want the most
EveEnsler_2004 1 EveEnsler_2004 1207.85 1217.60 <o,f0,female> i feel that knowledge and that journey has been an extraordinary privilege and i feel really blessed to have been here today to communicate that to you
