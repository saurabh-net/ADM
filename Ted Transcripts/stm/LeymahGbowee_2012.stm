LeymahGbowee_2012 1 LeymahGbowee_2012 183.45 185.69 <o,f0,male> in the peak of our activism
LeymahGbowee_2012 1 LeymahGbowee_2012 185.76 191.29 <o,f0,male> the minister of gender liberia called me and said leymah i have a nine year old for you

LeymahGbowee_2012 1 LeymahGbowee_2012 219.28 220.98 <o,f0,male> two thousand and ten
LeymahGbowee_2012 1 LeymahGbowee_2012 221.3 224.28 <o,f0,male> a young woman stands before president sirleaf
LeymahGbowee_2012 1 LeymahGbowee_2012 224.52 226.51 <o,f0,male> and gives her testimony
LeymahGbowee_2012 1 LeymahGbowee_2012 226.54 229.37 <o,f0,male> of how she and her siblings live together
LeymahGbowee_2012 1 LeymahGbowee_2012 229.58 244.39 <o,f0,male> their father and mother died during the war she 's nineteen her dream is to go to college to be able to support them she 's highly athletic one of the things that happens is that she applies for a scholarship
LeymahGbowee_2012 1 LeymahGbowee_2012 251.86 260.49 <o,f0,male> she goes to school on the first day the director of sports who 's responsible for getting her into the program asks her to come out of class
LeymahGbowee_2012 1 LeymahGbowee_2012 260.81 269.68 <o,f0,male> and for the next three years her fate will be having sex with him every day as a favor for getting her in school
LeymahGbowee_2012 1 LeymahGbowee_2012 285.54 288.99 <o,f0,male> the u n has the convention on the rights of the child
LeymahGbowee_2012 1 LeymahGbowee_2012 289.17 300.59 <o,f0,male> countries like america we 've heard things like no child left behind other countries come with different things there is a millennium development called three that focuses on girls
LeymahGbowee_2012 1 LeymahGbowee_2012 300.74 311.37 <o,f0,male> all of these great works by great people aimed at getting young people to where we want to get them globally i think has failed
LeymahGbowee_2012 1 LeymahGbowee_2012 311.94 314.14 <o,f0,male> in liberia for example
LeymahGbowee_2012 1 LeymahGbowee_2012 320.29 323.28 <o,f0,male> teen prostitution is at its peak
LeymahGbowee_2012 1 LeymahGbowee_2012 323.41 330.93 <o,f0,male> in one community we 're told you wake up in the morning and see used condoms like used chewing gum paper
LeymahGbowee_2012 1 LeymahGbowee_2012 331.07 337.27 <o,f0,male> girls as young as twelve being prostituted for less than a dollar a night
LeymahGbowee_2012 1 LeymahGbowee_2012 341.59 347.36 <o,f0,male> and then someone asked me just before my tedtalk a few days ago so where is the hope
LeymahGbowee_2012 1 LeymahGbowee_2012 347.79 367.58 <o,f0,male> several years ago a few friends of mine decided we needed to bridge the disconnect between our generation and the generation of young women it 's not enough to say you have two nobel laureates from the republic of liberia when your girls kids are totally out there and no hope or seemingly no hope
LeymahGbowee_2012 1 LeymahGbowee_2012 367.78 372.37 <o,f0,male> we created a space called the young girls transformative project
LeymahGbowee_2012 1 LeymahGbowee_2012 372.63 375.06 <o,f0,male> we go into rural communities
LeymahGbowee_2012 1 LeymahGbowee_2012 375.08 377.86 <o,f0,male> and all we do like has been done
LeymahGbowee_2012 1 LeymahGbowee_2012 381.07 382.72 <o,f0,female> when these girls sit

LeymahGbowee_2012 1 LeymahGbowee_2012 434.91 444.66 <o,f0,male> she sells water sells soft drinks and sells recharge cards for cellphones and you would think she would take that money and put it back
