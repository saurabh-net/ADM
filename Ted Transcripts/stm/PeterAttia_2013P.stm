PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 23.57 35.9 <o,f0,male> i got paged by the e r around two in the morning to come and see a woman with a diabetic ulcer on her foot i can still remember sort of that smell of rotting flesh as i pulled the curtain back
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 36.28 48.78 <o,f0,male> to see her and everybody there agreed this woman was very sick and she needed to be in the hospital that wasn 't being asked the question that was being asked of me was a different one which was did she also need an amputation
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 48.78 63.25 <o,f0,male> now looking back on that night i 'd love so desperately to believe that i treated that woman on that night with the same empathy and compassion i 'd shown the twenty seven year old
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 63.25 78.3 <o,f0,male> newlywed who came to the e r three nights earlier with lower back pain that turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer in her case i knew there was nothing i could do that was actually going to save her life the cancer was too advanced
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 78.3 97.83 <o,f0,male> but i was committed to making sure that i could do anything possible to make her stay more comfortable i brought her a warm blanket and a cup of a coffee i brought some for her parents but more importantly see i passed no judgment on her because obviously she had done nothing to bring this on herself
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 97.83 117.67 <o,f0,male> so why was it that just a few nights later as i stood in that same e r and determined that my diabetic patient did indeed need an amputation why did i hold her in such bitter contempt you see unlike the woman the night before this woman had type two diabetes she was fat
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 117.69 136.91 <o,f0,male> and we all know that 's from eating too much and not exercising enough right i mean how hard can it be as i looked down at her in the bed i thought to myself if you just tried caring even a little bit you wouldn 't be in this situation at this moment with some doctor you 've never met about to amputate your foot
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 136.91 146.81 <o,f0,male> why did i feel justified in judging her i 'd like to say i don 't know but i actually do
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 146.81 156.99 <o,f0,male> you see in the hubris of my youth i thought i had her all figured out she ate too much she got unlucky she got diabetes case closed
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 156.99 173.29 <o,f0,male> ironically at that time in my life i was also doing cancer research immune based therapies for melanoma to be specific and in that world i was actually taught to question everything to challenge all assumptions and hold them to the highest possible scientific standards
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 173.29 188.91 <o,f0,male> yet when it came to a disease like diabetes that kills americans eight times more frequently than melanoma i never once questioned the conventional wisdom i actually just assmed the pathologic sequence of events was settled science
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 188.91 192.76 <o,f0,male> three years later i found out how wrong i was
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 192.76 211.22 <o,f0,male> but this time i was the patient despite exercising three or four hours every single day and following the food pyramid to the letter i 'd gained a lot of weight and developed something called metabolic syndrome some of you may have heard of this i had become insulin resistant
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 211.22 223.06 <o,f0,male> you can think of insulin as this master hormone that controls what our body does with the foods we eat whether we burn it or store it this is called fuel partitioning in the lingo
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 223.06 235.21 <o,f0,male> now failure to produce enough insulin is incompatible with life and insulin resistance as its name suggests is when your cells get increasingly resistant to the effect of insulin trying to do its job
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 235.21 244.02 <o,f0,male> once you 're insulin resistant you 're on your way to getting diabetes which is what happens when your pancreas can 't keep up with the resistance and make enough insulin
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 244.02 256.44 <o,f0,male> now your blood sugar levels start to rise and an entire cascade of pathologic events sort of spirals out of control that can lead to heart disease cancer even alzheimer 's disease
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 256.44 260.77 <o,f0,male> and amputations just like that woman a few years earlier
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 260.77 269.44 <o,f0,male> with that scare i got busy changing my diet radically adding and subtracting things most of you would find almost assuredly shocking
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 269.44 284.44 <o,f0,male> i did this and lost forty pounds weirdly while exercising less i as you can see i guess i 'm not overweight anymore more importantly i don 't have insulin resistance but most important i was left with these three burning questions that wouldn 't go away
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 284.44 289.16 <o,f0,male> how did this happen to me if i was supposedly doing everything right
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 289.16 296.47 <o,f0,male> if the conventional wisdom about nutrition had failed me was it possible it was failing someone else
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 296.47 308.04 <o,f0,male> and underlying these questions i became almost maniacally obsessed in trying to understand the real relationship between obesity and insulin resistance
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 308.04 320.81 <o,f0,male> now most researchers believe obesity is the cause of insulin resistance logically then if you want to treat insulin resistance you get people to lose weight right you treat the obesity
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 320.81 331.43 <o,f0,male> but what if we have it backwards what if obesity isn 't the cause of insulin resistance at all in fact what if it 's a symptom of a much deeper problem
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 343.18 355.28 <o,f0,male> for a far more sinister problem going on underneath the cell i 'm not suggesting that obesity is benign but what i am suggesting is it may be the lesser of two metabolic evils
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 355.28 362.6 <o,f0,male> you can think of insulin resistance as the reduced capacity of ourselves to partition fuel as i alluded to a moment ago
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 362.6 375.76 <o,f0,male> taking those calories that we take in and burning some appropriately and storing some appropriately when we become insulin resistant the homeostasis in that balance deviates from this state so now when insulin says to a cell
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 375.81 391.71 <o,f0,male> i want you to burn more energy than the cell considers safe the cell in effect says no thanks i 'd actually rather store this energy and because fat cells are actually missing most of the complex cellular machinery found in other cells it 's probably the safest place to store it
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 391.71 396.92 <o,f0,male> so for many of us about seventy five million americans
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 396.92 409.99 <o,f0,male> the appropriate response to insulin resistance may actually be to store it as fat not the reverse getting insulin resistance in response to getting fat
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 409.99 416.48 <o,f0,male> this is a really subtle distinction but the implication could be profound
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 416.48 430.38 <o,f0,male> consider the following analogy think of the bruise you get on your shin when you inadvertently bang your leg into the coffee table sure the bruise hurts like hell and you almost certainly don 't like the discolored look
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 430.38 446.5 <o,f0,male> but we all know the bruise per se is not the problem in fact it 's the opposite it 's a healthy response to the trauma all of those immune cells rushing to the site of the injury to salvage cellular debris and prevent the spread of infection to elsewhere in the body
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 446.5 465.3 <o,f0,male> now imagine we thought bruises were the problem and we evolved a giant medical establishment and a culture around treating bruises masking creams painkillers you name it all the while ignoring the fact that people are still banging their shins into coffee tables
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 465.3 474.93 <o,f0,male> how much better would we be if we treated the cause telling people to pay attention when they walk through the living room rather than the effect
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 474.93 492.16 <o,f0,male> getting the cause and the effect right makes all the difference in the world getting it wrong and the pharmaceutical industry can still do very well for its shareholders but nothing improves for the people with bruised shins cause and effect
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 492.16 499.18 <o,f0,male> so what i 'm suggesting is maybe we have the cause and effect wrong on obesity and insulin resistance
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 499.18 518.26 <o,f0,male> maybe we should be asking ourselves is it possible that insulin resistance causes weight gain and the diseases associated with obesity at least in most people what if being obese is just a metabolic response to something much more threatening an underlying epidemic the one we ought to be worried about
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 518.26 536.62 <o,f0,male> let 's look at some suggestive facts we know that thirty million obese americans in the united states don 't have insulin resistance and by the way they don 't appear to be at any greater risk of disease than lean people conversely we know that six million lean people in the united states are insulin resistant
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 536.62 552.79 <o,f0,male> and by the way they appear to be at even greater risk for those metabolic disease i mentioned a moment ago than their obese counterparts now i don 't know why but it might be because in their case their cells haven 't actually figured out the right thing to do with that excess energy so
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 552.83 561.79 <o,f0,male> if you can be obese and not have insulin resistance and you can be lean and have it this suggests that obesity may just be a proxy
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 561.79 565.18 <o,f0,male> for what 's going on
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 565.19 576.88 <o,f0,male> so what if we 're fighting the wrong war fighting obesity rather than insulin resistance even worse what if blaming the obese means we 're blaming the victims
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 576.88 589.9 <o,f0,male> what if some of our fundamental ideas about obesity are just wrong personally i can 't afford the luxury of arrogance anymore let alone the luxury of certainty
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 589.9 597.98 <o,f0,male> i have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this but i 'm wide open to others now my hypothesis because everybody always asks me is this
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 597.98 609.5 <o,f0,male> if you ask yourself what 's a cell trying to protect itself from when it becomes insulin resistant the answer probably isn 't too much food it 's more likely too much glucose blood sugar
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 609.5 618.54 <o,f0,male> now we know that refined grains and starches elevate your blood sugar in the short run and there 's even reason to believe that sugar may lead to insulin resistance directly
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 618.54 622.75 <o,f0,male> so if you put these physiological processes to work
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 622.75 639.21 <o,f0,male> i 'd hypothesize that it might be our increased intake of refined grains sugars and starches that 's driving this epidemic of obesity and diabetes but through insulin resistance you see and not necessarily through just overeating and under exercising
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 639.21 656.98 <o,f0,male> when i lost my forty pounds a few years ago i did it simply by restricting those things which admittedly suggests i have a bias based on my personal experience but that doesn 't mean my bias is wrong and most important all of this can be tested scientifically
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 656.98 664.87 <o,f0,male> but step one is accepting the possibility that our current beliefs about obesity diabetes and insulin resistance
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 664.87 667.9 <o,f0,male> could be wrong and therefore must be tested
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 667.9 670.7 <o,f0,male> i 'm betting my career on this
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 670.7 689.15 <o,f0,male> today i devote all of my time to working on this problem and i 'll go wherever the science takes me i 've decided that what i can 't and won 't do anymore is pretend i have the answers when i don 't i 've been humbled enough by all i don 't know
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 689.15 697.75 <o,f0,male> for the past year i 've been fortunate enough to work on this problem with the most amazing team of diabetes and obesity researchers in the country
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 720.77 730.09 <o,f0,male> but this team of multi disciplinary highly skeptical and exceedingly talented researchers do agree on two things first
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 730.09 745.59 <o,f0,male> this problem is just simply too important to continue ignoring because we think we know the answer and two if we 're willing to be wrong if we 're willing to challenge the conventional wisdom with the best experiments science can offer we can solve this problem
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 745.59 761.7 <o,f0,male> i know it 's tempting to want an answer right now some form of action or policy some dietary prescription eat this not that but if we want to get it right we 're going to have to do much more rigorous science before we can write that prescription
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 761.7 776.67 <o,f0,male> briefly to address this our research program is focused around three meta themes or questions first how do the various foods we consume impact our metabolism hormones and enzymes and through what nuanced molecular mechanisms
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 776.67 785.3 <o,f0,male> second based on these insights can people make the necessary changes in their diets in a way that 's safe and practical to implement
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 785.3 798.04 <o,f0,male> and finally once we identify what safe and practical changes people can make to their diet how can we move their behavior in that direction so that it becomes more the default rather
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 824.94 828.64 <o,f0,male> most of them actually want to do the right thing but
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 833.66 837.32 <o,f0,male> i dream of a day when
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 837.32 856.56 <o,f0,male> our patients can shed their excess pounds and cure themselves of insulin resistance because as medical professionals we 've shed our excess mental baggage and cured ourselves of new idea resistance sufficiently to go back to our original ideals open minds
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 856.56 862.33 <o,f0,male> the courage to throw out yesterday 's ideas when they don 't appear to be working
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 862.43 867.99 <o,f0,male> and the understanding that scientific truth isn 't final but constantly evolving
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 867.99 883.4 <o,f0,male> staying true to that path will be better for our patients and better for science if obesity is nothing more than a proxy for metabolic illness what good does it do us to punish those with the proxy
PeterAttia_2013P 1 PeterAttia_2013P 907.57 909.87 <o,f0,male> human being
