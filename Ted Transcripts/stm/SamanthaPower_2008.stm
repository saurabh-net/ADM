SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 15.57 25.24 <o,f0,female> i spent the better part of a decade looking at american responses to mass atrocity and genocide and
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 27.12 37.16 <o,f0,female> i'd like to start by sharing with you one moment that to me sums up what there is to know about american and democratic responses to mass atrocity and that moment
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 56.28 67.60 <o,f0,female> on april twenty one in the new york times the paper reported that somewhere between two hundred and three hundred thousand people had already been killed in the genocide it was in the paper
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 68.39 79.25 <o,f0,female> not on the front page it was a lot like the holocaust coverage it was buried in the paper rwanda itself was not seen as newsworthy and amazingly genocide itself was not seen as newsworthy
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 93.31 103.31 <o,f0,female> what's up what's going on in the us government two to three hundred thousand people have just been exterminated in the last couple of weeks in rwanda it's two weeks into the genocide at that time but of course at that time you don't know
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 103.75 114.96 <o,f0,female> how long it's going to last and the journalist said why is there so little response out of washington why no hearings no denunciations no people getting arrested in front of
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 115.34 124.97 <o,f0,female> the rwandan embassy or in front of the white house what's the deal and she said she was so honest she said it 's a great question
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 125.57 138.42 <o,f0,female> all i can tell you is that in my congressional office in colorado and my office in washington were getting hundreds and hundreds of calls about the endangered ape and gorilla population in rwanda
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 138.91 140.74 <o,f0,female> but nobody is calling about the people
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 142.10 144.70 <o,f0,female> the phones just aren't ringing about the people
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 145.54 154.26 <o,f0,female> and the reason i give you this moment is there's a deep truth in it and that truth is or was in the twentieth century
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 154.74 160.98 <o,f0,female> that while we were beginning to develop endangered species movements we didn't have an endangered people 's movement
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 161.65 172.96 <o,f0,female> we had holocaust education in the schools most of us were groomed not only on images of nuclear catastrophe but also on images and knowledge of the holocaust
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 174.03 184.63 <o,f0,female> there's a museum of course on the mall in washington right next to lincoln and jefferson i mean we have owned never again culturally appropriately
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 186.88 196.06 <o,f0,female> and yet the politicization of never again the operationalization of never again had never occurred in the twentieth century
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 196.68 200.10 <o,f0,female> and that's what that moment with patricia schroeder i think shows that if
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 201.26 209.69 <o,f0,female> we are to bring about an end to the world 's worst atrocities we have to make it such there has to be a role there has to be
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 218.87 227.91 <o,f0,female> now here and this will be a relief to you at this point in the afternoon there is good news amazing news in the twenty one st century and that is that
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 228.44 242.04 <o,f0,female> almost out of nowhere there has come into being an anti genocide movement an anti genocide constituency and one that looks destined in fact to be permanent it grew up in response to the atrocities in
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 243.67 253.71 <o,f0,female> it is comprised of students there are something like three hundred anti genocide chapters on college campuses around the country it's bigger than the anti apartheid movement
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 254.29 263.20 <o,f0,female> there are something like five hundred high school chapters devoted to stopping the genocide in darfur evangelicals have joined it
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 263.80 277.54 <o,f0,female> jewish groups have joined it hotel rwanda watchers have joined it it is a cacophonous movement to call it a movement as with all movements perhaps is a little misleading it's diverse it's got a lot of different approaches it's got all the ups and the downs of movements
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 277.65 291.24 <o,f0,female> but it has been amazingly successful in one regard in that it has become it has congealed into this endangered people 's movement that was missing in the twentieth century it sees itself such as it is the
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 292.60 300.58 <o,f0,female> as something that will create the impression that there will be political cost there will be a political price to be paid for allowing genocide
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 300.88 307.87 <o,f0,female> for not having an heroic imagination for not being an upstander but for being in fact a bystander now
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 309.74 319.14 <o,f0,female> because it's student driven there's some amazing things that the movement has done they have launched a divestment campaign that has now convinced i think fifty five universities in twenty two states
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 319.58 330.66 <o,f0,female> to divest their holdings of stocks with regard to companies doing business in sudan they have a one eight hundred genocide number this is going to sound very kitsch but for those of you who may not
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 331.30 341.44 <o,f0,female> be i mean may be apolitical but interested in doing something about genocide you dial one eight hundred genocide and you type in your zip code and you don't even have to know who your congressperson is it will refer you
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 342.05 351.52 <o,f0,female> directly to your congressperson to your us senator to your governor where divestment legislation is pending they've lowered the transaction costs of stopping genocide
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 361.83 374.61 <o,f0,female> when a congress is in session is members of congress calling up these nineteen year olds or twenty four year olds and saying i'm just told i have a d minus on genocide what do i do to get a c i just want to get a c help me
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 375.23 382.51 <o,f0,female> and the students and the others who are part of this incredibly energized base are there to answer that and there's always something to do
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 383.91 393.93 <o,f0,female> now what this movement has done is it has extracted from the bush administration from the united states at a time of massive over stretch military financial diplomatic
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 436.97 450.36 <o,f0,female> the bad news however to this question of will evil prevail is that evil lives on the people in those camps are surrounded on all sides by so called janjaweed these men on horseback with spears and kalashnikovs
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 450.86 459.64 <o,f0,female> women who go to get firewood in order to heat the humanitarian aid in order to feed their families humanitarian aid the dirty secret of it is it has to be heated really to be edible
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 460.46 467.77 <o,f0,female> are themselves subjected to rape which is a tool of the genocide that is being used and the peacekeepers i've mentioned the force has been authorized
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 468.21 474.88 <o,f0,female> but almost no country on earth has stepped forward since the authorization to actually put its troops or its police in harm 's way
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 475.70 485.74 <o,f0,female> so we have achieved an awful lot relative to the twentieth century and yet far too little relative to the gravity of the crime that is unfolding as we sit here as we speak
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 486.77 494.96 <o,f0,female> why the limits to the movement why is what has been achieved or what the movement has done been necessary but not sufficient
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 495.35 502.04 <o,f0,female> to the crime i think there are a couple there are many reasons but a couple just to focus on briefly the first is that the movement such as it is
SamanthaPower_2008 1 SamanthaPower_2008 503.10 505.33 <o,f0,female> stops at america 's borders
