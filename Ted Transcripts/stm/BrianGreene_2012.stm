BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 16.31 23.21 <o,f0,female> few months ago the nobel prize in physics was awarded to two teams of astronomers for a discovery
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 23.21 38.86 <o,f0,female> that has been hailed as one of the most important astronomical observations ever and today after briefly describing what they found i 'm going to tell you about a highly controversial framework for explaining their discovery namely the possibility
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 38.86 56.57 <o,f0,female> that way beyond the earth the milky way and other distant galaxies we may find that our universe is not the only universe but is instead part of a vast complex of universes that we call the multiverse now the idea of a multiverse is a strange
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 68.71 70.79 <o,f0,female> i was holding her and i said
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 71.3 79.03 <o,f0,female> sophia i love you more than anything in the universe and she turned to me and said daddy universe or multiverse
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 91.03 103.34 <o,f0,female> that would rightly be called universes of their own and yet speculative though the idea surely is i aim to convince you that there 's reason for taking it seriously as it just might be right
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 103.34 107.32 <o,f0,female> i 'm going to tell the story of the multiverse in three parts
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 107.32 116.17 <o,f0,female> in part one i 'm going to describe those nobel prize winning results and to highlight a profound mystery which those results revealed in part two
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 149.77 157.94 <o,f0,female> this was revolutionary the prevailing wisdom was that on the largest of scales the universe was static but even so
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 157.98 164.91 <o,f0,female> there was one thing that everyone was certain of the expansion must be slowing down
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 165.33 166.89 <o,f0,female> that much as the
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 166.89 176.1 <o,f0,female> gravitational pull of the earth slows the ascent of an apple tossed upward the gravitational pull of each galaxy on every other must be slowing
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 176.1 178.88 <o,f0,female> the expansion of space
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 178.88 193.66 <o,f0,female> now let 's fast forward to the one thousand nine hundred and ninety s when those two teams of astronomers i mentioned at the outset were inspired by this reasoning to measure the rate at which the expansion has been slowing and they did this
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 193.66 203.22 <o,f0,female> by painstaking observations of numerous distant galaxies allowing them to chart how the expansion rate has changed over time
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 219.94 238.66 <o,f0,female> you saw an apple do that you 'd want to know why what 's pushing on it similarly the astronomers results are surely well deserving of the nobel prize but they raised an analogous question what force is driving all galaxies to rush away from every other at an ever quickening speed
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 238.66 249.59 <o,f0,female> well the most promising answer comes from an old idea of einstein 's you see we are all used to gravity being a force that does one thing
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 249.69 257.94 <o,f0,female> pulls objects together but in einstein 's theory of gravity his general theory of relativity gravity can also
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 258.02 269.38 <o,f0,female> push things apart how well according to einstein 's math if space is uniformly filled with an invisible energy sort of like a uniform invisible mist
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 269.38 281.91 <o,f0,female> then the gravity generated by that mist would be repulsive repulsive gravity which is just what we need to explain the observations because the repulsive gravity of an
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 325.38 338.79 <o,f0,female> this number is small expressed in the relevant unit it is spectacularly small and the mystery is to explain this peculiar number we want this number to emerge from the laws of physics but so far
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 338.79 344.96 <o,f0,female> no one has found a way to do that now you might wonder should you care
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 345.28 347.94 <o,f0,female> maybe explaining this number is
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 347.94 366.86 <o,f0,female> just a technical issue a technical detail of interest to experts but of no relevance to anybody else well it surely is a technical detail but some details really matter some details provide windows into uncharted realms of reality and this peculiar number may be doing just that
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 366.86 377.67 <o,f0,female> as the only approach that 's so far made headway to explain it invokes the possibility of other universes an idea that naturally emerges from string theory which takes me to part two
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 377.68 379.57 <o,f0,female> string theory so
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 384.6 387.33 <o,f0,female> as i now go on to tell you three
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 387.45 393.12 <o,f0,female> key things about string theory first off what is it well it 's an approach
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 393.12 408.8 <o,f0,female> to realize einstein 's dream of a unified theory of physics a single overarching framework that would be able to describe all the forces at work in the universe and the central idea of string theory is quite straightforward it says that
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 425.48 429.11 <o,f0,female> little tiny vibrating filament of energy a little tiny
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 450.97 453.37 <o,f0,female> from vibrating strings it 's a
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 453.44 455.58 <o,f0,female> compelling picture a kind of
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 455.8 468.6 <o,f0,female> cosmic symphony where all the richness that we see in the world around us emerges from the music that these little tiny strings can play but there 's a cost to this
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 468.6 479.67 <o,f0,female> elegant unification because years of research have shown that the math of string theory doesn 't quite work it has internal inconsistencies unless we allow for something
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 479.8 481.46 <o,f0,female> wholly unfamiliar
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 481.75 486.96 <o,f0,female> extra dimensions of space that is we all know about the usual
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 486.96 489.25 <o,f0,female> three dimensions of space and you can think about
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 489.25 499.04 <o,f0,female> those as height width and depth but string theory says that on fantastically small scales there are additional dimensions crumpled to a tiny
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 518.54 521.6 <o,f0,female> the strengths of forces and most importantly
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 541.17 543.98 <o,f0,female> of the extra dimensions all we have
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 544.27 550.94 <o,f0,female> is a list of candidate shapes allowed by the math now when these ideas
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 550.94 561.4 <o,f0,male> first developed there were only about five different candidate shapes so you can imagine analyzing them one by one to determine if any yield the physical features we observe
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 561.4 575.91 <o,f0,male> but over time the list grew as researchers found other candidate shapes from five the number grew into the hundreds and then the thousands a large but still manageable collection to analyze since after all graduate students need something to do
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 576.84 587.59 <o,f0,male> but then the list continued to grow into the millions and the billions until today the list of candidate shapes has soared to about ten to the five hundred
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 589.27 594.46 <o,f0,female> so what to do well some researchers lost heart
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 594.46 603.79 <o,f0,female> concluding that was so many candidate shapes for the extra dimensions each giving rise to different physical features string theory would never make definitive testable
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 603.79 608.17 <o,f0,female> predictions but others turned this issue on its head
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 608.46 623.73 <o,f0,female> taking us to the possibility of a multiverse here 's the idea maybe each of these shapes is on an equal footing with every other each is as real as every other in the sense that there are many universes each with a different shape
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 632.27 634.37 <o,f0,female> prize winning results because you see
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 660.17 664.92 <o,f0,female> the laws of physics can 't explain one number for the dark energy because
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 668.47 673.36 <o,f0,female> which means we have been asking the wrong question
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 676.34 690.54 <o,f0,female> why do we humans find ourselves in a universe with a particular amount of dark energy we 've measured instead of any of the other possibilities that are out there and that 's a question on which we can make headway because
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 690.54 697.67 <o,f0,female> those universes that have much more dark energy than ours whenever matter tries to clump into galaxies
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 697.67 703.85 <o,f0,female> the repulsive push of the dark energy is so strong that it blows the clump apart and galaxies don 't form and
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 715.32 726.88 <o,f0,female> and no chance for our form of life to exist in those other universes so we find ourselves in a universe with the particular amount of dark energy we 've measured simply because
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 727.02 729.8 <o,f0,female> our universe has conditions hospitable
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 729.8 732.44 <o,f0,female> to our form of life
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 739.35 742.96 <o,f0,female> now some find this explanation
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 743.07 751.46 <o,f0,female> unsatisfying we 're used to physics giving us definitive explanations for the features we observe but the point is if
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 752.12 754.07 <o,f0,female> the feature you 're observing
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 754.07 765.25 <o,f0,female> can and does take on a wide variety of different values across the wider landscape of reality then thinking one explanation for a particular value
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 772.91 777.77 <o,f0,female> who was obsessed with understanding a different number why the sun
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 777.77 787.12 <o,f0,female> is ninety three million miles away from the earth and he worked for decades trying to explain this number but he never succeeded and we know why
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 787.12 804.7 <o,f0,female> kepler was asking the wrong question we now know that there are many planets at a wide variety of different distances from their host stars so hoping that the laws of physics will explain one particular number ninety three million miles well that is simply wrongheaded
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 805.17 808.41 <o,f0,female> instead the right question to ask is
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 837.73 847.95 <o,f0,female> it yields conditions vital to our form of life and when it comes to planets and their distances this clearly is the right kind of reasoning
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 847.95 850.29 <o,f0,female> the point is
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 850.33 859.54 <o,f0,female> when it comes to universes and the dark energy that they contain it may also be the right kind of reasoning one key difference of course is
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 860.42 869.54 <o,f0,female> we know that there are other planets out there but so far i 've only speculated on the possibility that there might be other universes so to pull it all together
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 869.54 873.49 <o,f0,female> we need a mechanism that can actually generate
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 873.51 877.6 <o,f0,female> other universes and that takes me to my final part part three
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 877.63 896.96 <o,f0,female> because such a mechanism has been found by cosmologists trying to understand the big bang you see when we speak of the big bang we often have an image of a kind of cosmic explosion that created our universe and set space rushing outward but there 's a little secret
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 897.21 901.34 <o,f0,female> the big bang leaves out something pretty important the bang
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 901.44 919.31 <o,f0,female> it tells us how the universe evolved after the bang but gives us no insight into what would have powered the bang itself and this gap was finally filled by an enhanced version of the big bang theory it 's called inflationary cosmology which identified
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 919.34 924.93 <o,f0,female> a particular kind of fuel that would naturally generate an outward rush
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 925 937.58 <o,f0,female> of space the fuel is based on something called a quantum field but the only detail that matters for us is that this fuel proves to be so efficient that it 's virtually impossible
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 937.62 948.63 <o,f0,female> to use it all up which means in the inflationary theory the big bang giving rise to our universe is likely not a one time event instead the fuel not only generated
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 973.43 986 <o,f0,female> the different shapes yield different physical features and we find ourselves in one universe instead of another simply because it 's only in our universe that the physical features like the amount of dark energy
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 986 993.6 <o,f0,female> for our form of life to take hold and this is the compelling but highly controversial picture of the wider cosmos
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 993.6 998.38 <o,f0,female> that cutting edge observation and theory have now led us to seriously
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 998.38 1005.2 <o,f0,female> consider one big remaining question of course is could we ever
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 1014.41 1020.22 <o,f0,female> the inflationary theory already has strong observational support because the theory predicts
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 1020.22 1039.31 <o,f0,female> that the big bang would have been so intense that as space rapidly expanded tiny quantum jitters from the micro world would have been stretched out to the macro world yielding a distinctive fingerprint a pattern of slightly hotter spots and slightly colder spots across space which powerful telescopes
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 1041.74 1043.82 <o,f0,female> if there are other universes
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 1043.82 1051.55 <o,f0,female> the theory predicts that every so often those universes can collide and if our universe got hit by another that collision
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 1051.55 1068.01 <o,f0,female> would generate an additional subtle pattern of temperature variations across space that we might one day be able to detect and so exotic as this picture is it may one day be grounded in observations establishing the existence
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 1068.01 1071.44 <o,f0,female> of other universes i 'll conclude with
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 1072.87 1074.69 <o,f0,female> a striking implication
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 1074.82 1079.75 <o,f0,female> of all these ideas for the very far future you see we learned
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 1079.91 1084.7 <o,f0,female> that our universe is not static that space is expanding
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 1084.7 1099.07 <o,f0,female> that that expansion is speeding up and that there might be other universes all by carefully examining faint pinpoints of starlight coming to us from distant galaxies but because the expansion is speeding up
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 1099.13 1114.02 <o,f0,female> in the very far future those galaxies will rush away so far and so fast that we won 't be able to see them not because of technological limitations but because of the laws of physics the light those galaxies emit even traveling at the
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 1140.53 1144.29 <o,f0,female> a picture of the cosmos that we definitively know
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 1144.53 1162.05 <o,f0,female> to be wrong now maybe those future astronomers will have records handed down from an earlier era like ours attesting to an expanding cosmos teeming with galaxies but would those future astronomers believe such ancient knowledge
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 1162.06 1169.7 <o,f0,female> or would they believe in the black static empty universe that their own state of the art observations reveal
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 1191.32 1207.04 <o,f0,female> powerful telescopes to the sky have captured a handful of starkly informative photons a kind of cosmic telegram billions of years in transit and the message echoing across the ages is clear sometimes
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 1207.37 1212.17 <o,f0,female> nature guards her secrets with the unbreakable grip of physical law
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 1212.18 1221.73 <o,f0,female> sometimes the true nature of reality beckons from just beyond the horizon thank you very much
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 1227.55 1232.85 <o,f0,male> the range of ideas you 've just spoken about are dizzying exhilarating incredible
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 1232.98 1242.33 <o,f0,male> how do you think of where cosmology is now in a sort of historical side are we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 1250.65 1261.31 <o,f0,female> maybe we 're already in that position and certain deep critical features of the universe already have escaped our ability to understand because of how cosmology evolves
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 1261.31 1266.99 <o,f0,female> so from that perspective maybe we will always be asking questions and never be able to fully answer them
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 1266.99 1284.91 <o,f0,female> on the other hand we now can understand how old the universe is we can understand how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation that was set down thirteen point seven two billion years ago and yet we can do calculations today to predict how it will look and it matches holy cow that 's just amazing
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 1284.91 1288.47 <o,f0,female> so on the one hand it 's just incredible where we 've gotten
BrianGreene_2012 1 BrianGreene_2012 1288.47 1291.58 <o,f0,female> but who knows what sort of blocks we may find in the future
