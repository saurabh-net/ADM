SebastianThrun_2011 1 SebastianThrun_2011 16.16 24.17 <o,f0,male> i loved cars when i turned eighteen i lost my best friend to a car accident
SebastianThrun_2011 1 SebastianThrun_2011 30.74 32.52 <o,f0,male> to saving one million people
SebastianThrun_2011 1 SebastianThrun_2011 32.9 40.47 <o,f0,male> every year now i haven 't succeeded so this is just a progress report but i 'm here to tell you a little bit about self driving cars
SebastianThrun_2011 1 SebastianThrun_2011 40.75 54.23 <o,f0,male> i saw the concept first in the darpa grand challenges where the u s government issued a prize to build a self driving car that could navigate a desert and even though a hundred teams were there these cars went nowhere
SebastianThrun_2011 1 SebastianThrun_2011 55.34 60.88 <o,f0,male> so we decided at stanford to build a different self driving car we built the hardware and the software
SebastianThrun_2011 1 SebastianThrun_2011 61.28 63.74 <o,f0,male> we made it learn from us
SebastianThrun_2011 1 SebastianThrun_2011 63.99 66.29 <o,f0,male> and we set it free in the desert
SebastianThrun_2011 1 SebastianThrun_2011 66.61 69.41 <o,f0,male> and the unimaginable happened it became the first car
SebastianThrun_2011 1 SebastianThrun_2011 74.03 76.74 <o,f0,male> two million dollars
SebastianThrun_2011 1 SebastianThrun_2011 84.02 93.11 <o,f0,male> on building driving cars that can drive anywhere by themselves any street in california we 've driven one hundred and forty thousand miles
SebastianThrun_2011 1 SebastianThrun_2011 106.19 109.04 <o,f0,male> it 's the perfect driving mechanism
SebastianThrun_2011 1 SebastianThrun_2011 109.6 119.56 <o,f0,male> we 've driven in cities like in san francisco here we 've driven from san francisco to los angeles on highway one we 've encountered joggers
SebastianThrun_2011 1 SebastianThrun_2011 119.67 122.27 <o,f0,male> busy highways toll booths
SebastianThrun_2011 1 SebastianThrun_2011 122.63 129.07 <o,f0,male> and this is without a person in the loop the car just drives itself in fact while we drove one hundred and forty thousand miles
SebastianThrun_2011 1 SebastianThrun_2011 129.82 132.46 <o,f0,male> people didn 't even notice
SebastianThrun_2011 1 SebastianThrun_2011 133.01 137.97 <o,f0,male> mountain roads day and night
SebastianThrun_2011 1 SebastianThrun_2011 137.97 142.26 <o,f0,male> and even crooked lombard street in san francisco
SebastianThrun_2011 1 SebastianThrun_2011 165.62 173.08 <o,f0,male> but i can do something for all the people who died do you know that driving accidents are the number one cause of death for young people
SebastianThrun_2011 1 SebastianThrun_2011 174.12 179.13 <o,f0,male> and do you realize that almost all of those are due to human error
SebastianThrun_2011 1 SebastianThrun_2011 181.78 184.82 <o,f0,male> and not machine error and can therefore be prevented by machines
SebastianThrun_2011 1 SebastianThrun_2011 208.72 221.75 <o,f0,male> do you realize that you ted users spend an average of fifty two minutes per day in traffic wasting your time on your daily commute
SebastianThrun_2011 1 SebastianThrun_2011 222.18 228.6 <o,f0,male> you could regain this time this is four billion hours wasted in this country alone
