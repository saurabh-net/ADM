SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 17.89 23.01 <o,f0,male> kind of an obvious statement up there i started with that sentence about twelve years ago
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 23.58 33.81 <o,f0,male> i started in the context of developing countries but you're sitting here from every corner of the world so if you think of a map of your country
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 34.26 40.69 <o,f0,male> i think you'll realize that for every country on earth you could draw little circles to say these are places where
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 43.85 54.68 <o,f0,male> on top of that those are the places from where trouble comes so we have an ironic problem good teachers don't want to go to just those places where they're needed the most
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 64.52 70.17 <o,f0,male> i basically embedded a computer into a wall of
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 71.50 78.20 <o,f0,male> in new delhi the children barely went to school they didn't know any english they'd never seen a computer before
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 78.77 90.38 <o,f0,male> and they didn't know what the internet was i connected high speed internet to it it's about three feet off the ground turned it on and left it there after this we noticed a couple of interesting things which
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 91.86 99.51 <o,f0,male> but i repeated this all over india and then through a large part of the world and noticed that
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 100.43 109.49 <o,f0,male> children will learn to do what they want to learn to do this is the first experiment that we did eight year old boy on your right
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 110.10 117.82 <o,f0,male> teaching his student a six year old girl and he was teaching her how to browse this boy here in the middle of
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 121.69 128.59 <o,f0,male> village where the children recorded their own music and then played it back to each other
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 129.00 139.59 <o,f0,male> and in the process they've enjoyed themselves thoroughly they did all of this in four hours after seeing the computer for the first time in another south indian village
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 140.51 152.62 <o,f0,male> these boys here had assembled a video camera and were trying to take the photograph of a bumble bee they downloaded it from disney com or one of these websites fourteen days after putting the computer
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 161.20 171.68 <o,f0,male> learn to use computers and the internet on their own irrespective of who or where they were at that point i became a little more ambitious
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 172.15 180.68 <o,f0,male> and decided to see what else could children do with a computer we started off with an experiment in hyderabad india
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 181.27 192.95 <o,f0,male> i gave a group of children they spoke english with a very strong telugu accent i gave them a computer with a speech to text interface which you now get free with windows
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 193.57 206.57 <o,f0,male> and asked them to speak into it so when they spoke into it the computer typed out gibberish so they said well it doesn't understand anything of what we are saying so i said yeah i'll leave it here for two months make yourself understood to the computer
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 207.37 212.71 <o,f0,male> so the children said how do we do that and i said i don't know actually
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 215.46 215.87 <o,f0,female> and i
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 221.29 229.78 <o,f0,male> two months later and this is now documented in the information technology for international development journal that accents had changed
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 241.28 249.10 <o,f0,male> so they could do that on their own after that i started to experiment with various other things that they might learn to do on their own
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 250.07 256.39 <o,f0,male> i got an interesting phone call once from columbo from the late arthur c clarke who said i want to see what's going on
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 256.86 264.55 <o,f0,male> and he couldn't travel so i went over there he said two interesting things a teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 267.16 274.19 <o,f0,male> the second thing he said was that if children have interest then education happens
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 275.63 279.11 <o,f0,male> and i was doing that in the field so every time i would watch it and
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 292.73 296.55 <o,f0,male> i took the experiment to south africa this is a fifteen year old boy
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 305.71 306.38 <o,f0,male> i
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 307.02 311.53 <o,f0,male> and i asked him do you send emails and he said yes and they hop across the ocean
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 313.47 319.92 <o,f0,male> in cambodia rural cambodia a fairly silly arithmetic
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 321.47 327.73 <o,f0,male> would play inside the classroom or at home they would you know throw it back at you they'd say this is very boring if you leave it on the pavement
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 329.30 329.91 <o,f0,male> the adults
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 339.68 341.08 <o,f0,male> and all over india
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 341.92 348.83 <o,f0,male> at the end of about two years children were beginning to google their homework as a result the teachers reported
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 349.33 358.64 <o,f0,male> tremendous improvements in their english rapid improvement and all sorts of things they said they have become really deep thinkers and so on
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 360.30 367.91 <o,f0,male> and so forth and indeed they had i mean if there's stuff on google why would you need to stuff
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 370.64 382.44 <o,f0,male> so at the end of the next four years i decided that groups of children can navigate the internet to achieve educational objectives on their own at that time a large amount of money had come into newcastle university
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 383.17 393.29 <o,f0,male> to improve schooling in india so newcastle gave me a call i said i 'll do it from delhi they said there 's no way you're going to handle a million pounds worth of university money
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 394.43 400.89 <o,f0,male> sitting in delhi so in two thousand and six i bought myself a heavy overcoat and moved to
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 402.92 412.64 <o,f0,male> i wanted to test the limits of the system the first experiment i did out of newcastle was actually done in india and i set myself and impossible
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 414.10 425.42 <o,f0,male> can tamil speaking twelve year old children in a south indian village teach themselves biotechnology in english on their own
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 426.00 437.05 <o,f0,male> and i thought i'll test them they'll get a zero i'll give the materials i'll come back and test them they get another zero i'll go back and say yes we need teachers for certain things i
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 437.42 448.35 <o,f0,male> in twenty six children they all came in there and i told them that there's some really difficult stuff on this computer i wouldn't be surprised if you didn't understand anything it's all in english and i'm going
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 451.36 456.85 <o,f0,male> them with it i came back after two months and the twenty six children marched in looking very very quiet i said
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 457.84 465.96 <o,f0,male> did you look at any of the stuff they said yes we did did you understand anything no nothing so i said well
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 466.65 477.79 <o,f0,male> how long did you practice on it before you decided you understood nothing they said we look at it every day so i said for two months you were looking at stuff you didn't understand so a twelve year old girl raises her hand and says
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 480.52 486.88 <o,f0,male> apart from the fact that improper replication of the dna molecule causes genetic disease we've understood nothing
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 510.36 515.87 <o,f0,male> which was not very nice well one of the girls had taught herself to become the teacher
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 516.46 517.68 <o,f0,male> and then that's her over there
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 527.64 528.19 <o,f0,male> english
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 542.32 550.28 <o,f0,male> the last bit when i asked where is the neuron and she says the neuron the neuron and then she looked and did this whatever the expression
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 553.04 558.84 <o,f0,male> so their scores had gone up from zero to thirty percent which is an educational impossibility under the circumstances
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 559.14 566.84 <o,f0,male> but thirty percent is not a pass so i found that they had a friend a local accountant a young girl and they played football with
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 567.88 576.06 <o,f0,male> i asked that girl would you teach them enough biotechnology to pass and she said how would i do that i don't know the subject i said no use the method of the grandmother
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 576.76 583.40 <o,f0,male> she said what 's that i said well what you've got to do is stand behind them and admire them all the time
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 584.46 595.86 <o,f0,male> say to them that 's cool that's fantastic what is that can you do that again can you show me some more she did that for two months the scores went up to fifty which is what the posh schools of new delhi with a trained
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 604.72 611.30 <o,f0,male> there was something happening here that definitely was getting very serious so
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 612.78 616.77 <o,f0,male> all sorts of remote places i came to the most remote place that i could think of
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 620.39 627.08 <o,f0,male> five thousand miles from delhi is the little town of gateshead in gateshead i took thirty two children
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 627.72 640.22 <o,f0,male> and i started to fine tune the method i made them into groups of four i said you make your own groups of four each group of four can use one computer and not four computers remember from the hole in the wall
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 641.34 650.45 <o,f0,male> you can exchange groups you can walk across to another group if you don't like your group etc you can go to another group peer over their shoulders see what they're doing
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 667.48 678.60 <o,f0,male> the children enthusiastically got after me and said now what do you want us to do i gave them six gcse questions the first group the best one solved everything in twenty minutes
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 679.01 686.70 <o,f0,male> the worst in forty five they used everything that they knew news groups google wikipedia ask jeeves etc
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 687.39 697.64 <o,f0,male> the teachers said is this deep learning i said well let 's try it i'll come back after two months we'll give them a paper test no computers no talking to each other etc
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 698.24 704.65 <o,f0,male> the average score when i'd done it with the computers and the groups was seventy six percent when i did the experiment when i did the
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 705.00 712.62 <o,f0,male> after two months the score was seventy six percent there was photographic
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 712.98 721.22 <o,f0,male> recall inside the children i suspect because they're discussing with each other a single child in front of a single computer will not do that
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 721.76 733.78 <o,f0,male> i have further results which are almost unbelievable of scores which go up with time because their teachers say that after the session is over the children continue to google further
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 734.64 746.55 <o,f0,male> in britain i put out a call for british grandmothers after my kuppam experiment well you know they're very vigorous people british grandmothers two hundred of them volunteered
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 749.34 754.03 <o,f0,male> the deal was that they would give me one hour of broadband time sitting in their homes
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 755.25 768.22 <o,f0,male> one day in a week so they did that and over the last two years over six hundred hours of instruction has happened over skype using what my students call the granny cloud
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 780.16 780.91 <o,f0,female> you
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 804.26 813.21 <o,f0,male> back at gateshead a ten year old girl gets into the heart of hinduism in fifteen minutes you know stuff which i don't know anything about
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 816.21 823.59 <o,f0,male> two children watch a tedtalk they wanted to be footballers before after watching eight tedtalks he wants to become
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 832.14 844.91 <o,f0,male> it's pretty simple stuff this is what i'm building now they're called soles self organized learning environments the furniture is designed so that children can sit in front of big powerful screens big broadband connections
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 845.57 857.65 <o,f0,male> but in groups if they want they can call the granny cloud this is a sole in newcastle the mediator is from india so how far can we go one last little bit and i'll stop i went to turin
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 858.08 866.18 <o,f0,male> in may i sent all the teachers away from my group of ten year old students i speak only english they speak
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 867.92 876.66 <o,f0,male> so we had no way to communicate i started writing english questions on the blackboard the children looked at it and said what i said well do it
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 893.28 898.78 <o,f0,male> next question where is calcutta this one
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 904.97 909.88 <o,f0,male> i tried a really hard one then who was pythagoras and what did he do
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 912.50 917.35 <o,f0,male> was silence for a while then they said you 've spelled it wrong it's
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 949.43 949.66 <o,f0,female> the
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 961.59 974.02 <o,f0,male> so you know what's happened i think we've just stumbled across a self organizing system a self organizing system is one where a structure appears without explicit intervention from the outside
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 974.45 986.21 <o,f0,male> self organizing systems also always show emergence which is that the system starts to do things which it was never designed for which is why you react the way you do because it looks impossible
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 986.72 999.94 <o,f0,male> i think i can make a guess now education is self organizing system where learning is an emergent phenomenon it'll take a few years to prove it experimentally but i'm going to try but in the meanwhile there is a method available
SugataMitra_2010G 1 SugataMitra_2010G 1000.91 1014.34 <o,f0,male> one billion children we need one hundred million mediators there are many more than that on the planet ten millions soles one hundred and eighty billion dollars and ten years we could change everything thanks
