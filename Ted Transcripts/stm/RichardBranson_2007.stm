RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 13.65 24.81 <o,f0,male> thank you very much the first ted has been great ca have you met anyone interesting rb well the nice thing about ted is everybody 's interesting i was very glad to see goldie hawn because i had
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 26.40 35.78 <o,f0,male> to make to her i'd had dinner with her about two years ago and i'd she had this big wedding ring and i put it on my finger and i couldn't get
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 37.80 47.47 <o,f0,male> i went home to my wife that night and she wanted to know why i had another woman 's big massive big wedding ring on my finger and anyway the next morning we had to go along to the jeweler and get it
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 56.09 62.78 <o,f0,male> so we're going to put up some slides of one of your some of your companies here you've started one or two in your time
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 63.76 73.56 <o,f0,male> so you know virgin atlantic virgin records i guess it all started with a magazine called student and then yes all these other ones as well i mean how
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 74.00 75.25 <o,f0,male> do you do this
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 90.07 98.31 <o,f0,male> i mean i think i learned early on that if you can run one company you can really run any companies i mean companies are all
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 99.63 105.89 <o,f0,male> finding the right people inspiring those people you know drawing out the best in people and
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 106.86 109.14 <o,f0,male> i just love learning
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 109.83 117.76 <o,f0,male> and i'm incredibly inquisitive and i love taking on you know the status quo and trying to turn it upside down
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 119.57 131.56 <o,f0,male> one long learning process and if i see you know if i fly on somebody else's airline and find the experience is not a pleasant one which it wasn't in twenty one years ago
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 143.62 149.38 <o,f0,male> was a bizarre thing because you made this move that a lot of people advised you was crazy and in fact
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 150.73 160.95 <o,f0,male> in a way it almost took down your empire at one point i had a conversation with one of the investment bankers who at the time when you basically sold virgin records
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 166.70 173.78 <o,f0,male> the world 's fourth biggest record company for the twenty fifth biggest airline and that you were out of your mind why did you do that
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 175.01 176.31 <o,f0,male> well i think that
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 190.05 196.89 <o,f0,male> we had we were being attacked by british airways they were trying to put our airline out of business and
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 197.69 209.49 <o,f0,male> they launched what's become known as the dirty tricks campaign and i realized that the whole empire was likely to come crashing down unless i chipped in a chip and
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 210.36 222.59 <o,f0,male> in order to protect the jobs of the people who worked for the airline and protect the jobs of the people who worked for the record company i had to sell the family jewelry to protect the airline
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 223.76 230.88 <o,f0,male> post napster you're looking like a bit of a genius actually for that as well rb yeah as it turned out
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 231.32 232.60 <o,f0,male> to be the right
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 234.13 238.72 <o,f0,male> it was sad at the time but we moved on
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 258.79 266.70 <o,f0,male> we have a lot of fun and i think the people who work for it enjoy it we we as i say we go in and shake up other industries
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 278.49 280.24 <o,f0,male> i mean virgin brides
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 281.16 281.91 <o,f0,male> what happened
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 283.99 286.01 <o,f0,male> we couldn't find any customers
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 291.20 298.05 <o,f0,male> curious why i think you missed an opportunity with your condoms launch you called it mates i mean couldn't you have used the virgin brand for that as well
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 299.86 303.37 <o,f0,male> virgin no longer or something rb again we may have had
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 337.57 338.58 <o,f0,male> i became
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 347.13 356.22 <o,f0,male> what are the numbers on this i mean how big is the group overall how much what's the total revenue rb it's about twenty five billion dollars now in total ca and how many employees
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 357.07 363.06 <o,f0,male> about fifty five thousand ca so you've been photographed in various ways at various times and
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 365.68 369.66 <o,f0,male> never worrying about putting your dignity on the line or anything like that
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 387.15 389.52 <o,f0,male> tea ca ok
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 391.81 398.73 <o,f0,male> that was a wonderful car boat in which rb oh that car that we actually we we it was a tedster event that i think is that
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 402.14 404.23 <o,f0,male> a minute rb it's a tough job isn't it ca i
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 406.05 409.73 <o,f0,male> when i first came to america i used to try this with employees as well and
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 426.25 427.04 <o,f0,male> cola bottle
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 453.71 459.86 <o,f0,male> twenty five years earlier we'd launched the sex pistols god save the queen and
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 461.04 467.66 <o,f0,male> never expected that twenty five years later that she'd actually knight us but somehow she must have had a forgetful memory i think
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 468.13 472.67 <o,f0,male> well god saved her and you got your just reward do you like to be called
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 476.04 482.12 <o,f0,male> in america i hear people saying sir richard and think there's some shakespearean play taking
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 488.15 489.36 <o,f0,male> can you use your knighthood for
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 495.15 501.51 <o,f0,male> if you're having problems getting a booking in a restaurant or something that might be worth using it ca you know it's not richard branson it's
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 508.14 513.37 <o,f0,male> let 's look at the space thing i think with us we've got a video that shows
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 514.54 514.99 <o,f0,male> to and
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 521.50 525.51 <o,f0,male> so that's the bert rutan designed spaceship rb yeah it'll be
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 526.52 532.59 <o,f0,male> ready in well ready in twelve months and then we do twelve months extensive testing and then
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 533.49 535.42 <o,f0,male> twenty four months from now people
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 537.03 538.07 <o,f0,male> take a ride into space
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 548.36 553.34 <o,f0,male> quite a bit of it the logos and he 's building the space station in new mexico
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 554.14 555.72 <o,f0,male> basically he 's just taken
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 558.22 560.53 <o,f0,male> and the space station will be one
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 571.50 576.01 <o,f0,male> back into this giant eye but he 's absolutely genius when it comes
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 577.72 579.40 <o,f0,male> but you didn't have him design the engine
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 581.09 583.22 <o,f0,male> is quite erratic so i think that he wouldn't be the best
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 584.27 585.49 <o,f0,male> to design
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 586.35 587.48 <o,f0,male> a wonderful talk here
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 609.43 616.51 <o,f0,male> many times i mean i think with the ballooning and boating expeditions we've done in the past
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 618.05 629.58 <o,f0,male> the sea i think six times by helicopters so and each time i didn't expect to come home to tell the tale so in those moments you certainly wonder what you're doing up there or
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 630.73 634.20 <o,f0,male> you got to when did you think this is it i might be
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 641.91 650.97 <o,f0,male> each one actually i think we came close and i mean first of all we nobody had actually crossed the atlantic in a hot air balloon before so we had to
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 653.57 663.07 <o,f0,male> build a hot air balloon that was capable of flying in the jet stream and we weren't quite sure when a balloon actually got into the jet stream whether it would actually survive
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 664.53 670.66 <o,f0,male> two hundred two hundred and twenty miles an hour winds that you can find up there and so just the initial
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 671.17 678.80 <o,f0,male> lift off from sugarloaf to cross the atlantic as were pushing into the jet stream this enormous balloon the top of the balloon
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 687.11 694.12 <o,f0,male> and it just took off and it was like holding onto a thousand horses and we were just
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 694.63 698.59 <o,f0,male> crossing every finger praying that the balloon would hold together which
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 701.75 704.25 <o,f0,male> the ends of all those balloon trips were
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 714.96 717.55 <o,f0,male> and left me holding on
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 726.14 730.06 <o,f0,male> me jump but once his weight had gone the balloon just shot up to
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 732.59 736.48 <o,f0,male> twelve thousand feet and i ca and you inspired an
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 739.16 743.75 <o,f0,male> i put on my oxygen mask and stood on top of the balloon with my parachute looking at the
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 746.08 753.43 <o,f0,male> my courage to jump into the north sea which and it was a very very very lonely few moments but anyway we
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 758.70 761.16 <o,f0,male> i knew i had about half an hour 's fuel left
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 762.16 763.36 <o,f0,male> and i also knew that
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 763.82 771.22 <o,f0,male> the chances were that if i jumped i would only have a couple of minutes of life left so i climbed back into the capsule and
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 773.48 782.74 <o,f0,male> make sure that i was making the right decision and wrote some notes to my family and then climbed back up again looked down at those clouds again climbed back into the capsule again
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 783.88 791.31 <o,f0,male> and then finally just thought there's a better way i've got you know this enormous balloon above me it's the biggest parachute
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 792.87 799.56 <o,f0,male> why not use it and so i managed to fly the balloon down through the clouds and about
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 800.45 813.41 <o,f0,male> fifty feet before i hit the sea threw myself over and the balloon hit the sea and went shooting back up ten thousand feet without me but it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and ca what did you write to
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 815.71 822.38 <o,f0,male> just what you would do in a situation like that just i love you very much and
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 823.62 832.49 <o,f0,male> i'd already written them a letter before going on this trip which just in case anything had happened but fortunately they never had to use it
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 833.94 837.40 <o,f0,male> your companies have had incredible pr value out
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 845.85 854.72 <o,f0,male> regarded as this great hero in the u k and elsewhere and cynics might say you know this is just a smart business guy doing what it takes to
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 859.06 860.92 <o,f0,male> how much was the pr
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 869.75 878.82 <o,f0,male> as an airline owner the last thing you should be doing is heading off in balloons and boats and crashing into the
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 883.16 883.78 <o,f0,male> they had a point
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 897.43 899.75 <o,f0,male> you must have been a genius from the get go right
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 910.03 915.23 <o,f0,male> didn't weren't you just terrible at school rb i was dyslexic
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 916.22 920.54 <o,f0,male> i had no understanding of schoolwork whatsoever
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 923.66 926.43 <o,f0,male> i certainly would have failed iq tests
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 927.45 933.13 <o,f0,male> and it was one of the reasons i left school when i was fifteen years old and
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 934.84 937.41 <o,f0,male> if i if i'm not interested in something
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 940.77 945.50 <o,f0,male> i don't grasp it as somebody who 's dyslexic you also have some quite bizarre situations
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 948.70 959.05 <o,f0,male> i've had to you know i've been running the largest group of private companies in europe but haven't been able to know the difference between net and gross and so the board meetings have been
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 961.74 972.31 <o,f0,male> and so it's like good news or bad news and generally the people would say oh well that's bad news ca but just to clarify the twenty five billion is gross right that's gross rb well i
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 985.82 987.79 <o,f0,male> so when i turned fifty somebody took me outside the
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 991.52 997.47 <o,f0,male> draw on a diagram here 's a net in the sea and the fish have been pulled from the sea into this net
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 997.80 1004.05 <o,f0,male> and that's the profits you've got left over in this little net everything else is eaten and i finally worked it all
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1021.30 1023.15 <o,f0,male> you a rebel then or how would you
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1024.24 1027.81 <o,f0,male> yeah i think i was a bit of a maverick
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1028.92 1030.18 <o,f0,male> and
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1032.70 1039.97 <o,f0,male> but i and i was yeah i was fortunately good at sport and so at least i had something to excel at at school ca and
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1040.46 1047.92 <o,f0,male> some bizarre things happened just earlier in your life i mean there's the story about your mother allegedly dumping you in a field aged four and saying ok
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1050.52 1059.13 <o,f0,male> was you know she felt that we needed to stand on our own two feet from an early age so she did things to us which now she'd be arrested for
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1060.50 1067.83 <o,f0,male> such as pushing us out of the car and telling us to find our own way to granny 's about five miles before we actually got there
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1068.86 1074.67 <o,f0,male> and making us go on wonderful long bike rides and we were never allowed to watch television
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1085.73 1089.01 <o,f0,male> too coddled they don't know what they've got we're going to raise a generation of
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1089.54 1103.95 <o,f0,male> i think if you're bringing up kids you just want to smother them with love and praise and enthusiasm so i don't think you can mollycoddle your kids too much
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1105.33 1106.85 <o,f0,male> you didn't turn out too bad i have to say
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1108.65 1119.03 <o,f0,male> your headmaster said to you i mean he found you kind of an enigma at your school he said you're either going to be a millionaire or go to prison and i'm not sure which which of those
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1123.70 1130.21 <o,f0,male> both i think i went to prison first i was actually prosecuted under two quite ancient acts in the
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1141.16 1148.84 <o,f0,male> mentioning the word venereal disease in public which we had a center where we would help young people who had problems and one of the
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1171.20 1177.73 <o,f0,male> and then subsequently never mind the bollocks here 's the sex pistols the word bollocks the police decided
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1178.20 1185.34 <o,f0,male> was a rude word and so we were arrested for using the word bollocks on the sex pistols album and
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1186.13 1188.58 <o,f0,male> john mortimer the playwright defended us
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1189.29 1194.08 <o,f0,male> and he asked if i could find a linguistics expert to
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1194.98 1201.80 <o,f0,male> come up with a different definition of the word bollocks and so i rang up nottingham university and i asked to talk to the professor of linguistics
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1202.97 1209.96 <o,f0,male> and he said look bollocks is not a has nothing to do with balls whatsoever it's actually a nickname given to priests in the eighteenth century
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1216.06 1225.22 <o,f0,male> a priest myself and so i said would you mind coming to the court and he said he'd be delighted and i said and he said would you like me to wear my dog collar and i said yes that
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1228.66 1237.22 <o,f0,male> so our key witness was argued that it was actually never mind the priest here 's the sex pistols and the judge found us reluctantly found us not
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1239.81 1240.68 <o,f0,male> that is outrageous
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1264.18 1266.98 <o,f0,male> is any of it true is there an element of truth in it
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1267.77 1272.08 <o,f0,male> i don't actually think that the stereotype of a business person
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1281.59 1290.11 <o,f0,male> come back and come back for more and i think all you have in life is your reputation and it's a very small world
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1291.29 1298.94 <o,f0,male> and i actually think that the best way of becoming a successful business leader is
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1309.98 1317.84 <o,f0,male> the people who love you and who see you spending you keep getting caught up in these new projects but it almost feels like you're addicted to launching new stuff you get excited by
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1318.58 1325.43 <o,f0,male> and kapow i mean do you think about life balance how do your family feel about each time you step into something big and
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1336.71 1348.91 <o,f0,male> and so we spend a very good sort of three months away together yes i 'll you know be in touch we're very lucky we have this tiny little island in the caribbean
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1360.57 1365.95 <o,f0,male> you started talking in recent years about this term capitalist philanthropy what is that
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1369.79 1372.65 <o,f0,male> works you know the alternative communism
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1373.95 1374.81 <o,f0,male> has not
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1376.30 1377.87 <o,f0,male> the problem with capitalism is
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1385.74 1387.07 <o,f0,male> with that wealth and
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1388.01 1390.14 <o,f0,male> i think it's important that the individuals
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1391.08 1397.59 <o,f0,male> in that fortunate position do not end up competing for bigger and bigger boats and bigger and bigger cars
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1399.14 1405.32 <o,f0,male> you know use that money to either create new jobs or to tackle
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1406.30 1411.51 <o,f0,male> around the world ca and what are the issues that you worry about most care most about want to turn your
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1414.26 1423.38 <o,f0,male> well there's i mean there's a lot of issues i mean global warming certainly is a massive threat to mankind
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1424.57 1431.89 <o,f0,male> and we are putting a lot of time and energy into a trying to come up with alternative fuels and
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1435.07 1446.79 <o,f0,male> we just launched this prize which is really a prize in case we don't get an answer on alternative fuels in case we don't actually manage to get the carbon
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1452.27 1464.28 <o,f0,male> we need to try to encourage people to come up with a way of extracting carbon out of the earth 's atmosphere and we just you know there weren't really people working on that before so we wanted people to try to
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1465.20 1472.85 <o,f0,male> the best brains in the world to start thinking about that and also to try to extract the methane out of the earth 's atmosphere as well
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1487.69 1496.52 <o,f0,male> yes i mean we've got we're setting up something called the war room which is maybe the wrong word we're trying to maybe we'll change it but anyway it's a war room to
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1497.01 1498.44 <o,f0,male> try to coordinate all
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1500.10 1506.09 <o,f0,male> going on in africa all the different social problems in africa and try to look at best
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1507.84 1519.35 <o,f0,male> practices so for instance there's a doctor in africa that's found that if you give a mother antiretroviral drugs at twenty four weeks
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1534.36 1538.01 <o,f0,male> the war room sounds it sounds powerful and dramatic and is there a risk
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1539.01 1542.54 <o,f0,male> the kind of the business heroes of the west
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1543.19 1554.06 <o,f0,male> get so excited about i mean they're used to having an idea getting stuff done and they believe profoundly in their ability to make a difference in the world is there a risk that we go to places like africa and say
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1555.78 1562.15 <o,f0,male> this problem and we can do it i've got all these billions of dollars you know da da da here 's the big idea and kind of
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1566.09 1567.86 <o,f0,male> making a mess of it do you worry about that
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1570.05 1571.08 <o,f0,male> on this particular
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1574.23 1587.21 <o,f0,male> situation we're actually we're working with the government on it i mean thabo mbeki 's had his problems with accepting hiv and aids are related but this is a way i think of him
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1588.49 1589.50 <o,f0,male> tackling this problem
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1590.47 1598.49 <o,f0,male> and instead of the world criticizing him it's a way of working with him with his government it's important that if people do go to africa and do try to help
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1598.80 1607.58 <o,f0,male> they don't just go in there and then leave after a few years it's got to be consistent but i think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1615.05 1623.39 <o,f0,male> clinics in africa where we're going to be giving free antiretroviral drugs free tb treatment and free malaria treatment but
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1623.97 1630.38 <o,f0,male> we're also trying to make them self sustaining clinics so that people pay for some other aspects ca i mean
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1630.76 1636.31 <o,f0,male> a lot of cynics say about someone like yourself or bill gates or whatever that this is really being
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1646.51 1655.90 <o,f0,male> i think that everybody people do things for a whole variety of different reasons and i think that you know when i'm on me deathbed i will want to feel that
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1656.86 1662.66 <o,f0,male> i've made a difference to other people 's lives and that may be a selfish thing to think
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1663.29 1671.15 <o,f0,male> the way i've been brought up i think if i'm in a position to radically change other people 's lives for the better i should do so ca how
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1672.40 1676.12 <o,f0,male> i'm fifty six ca i mean the psychologist erik erikson says that
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1676.69 1679.82 <o,f0,male> as i understand him and i'm a total amateur but that
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1682.59 1687.99 <o,f0,male> people are driven by this desire to grow and that's where they get their fulfillment
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1689.32 1695.89 <o,f0,male> sixties the mode of operation shifts more to the quest for wisdom and a search for legacy
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1709.04 1717.50 <o,f0,male> i don't think i think too much about legacy i mean i like to you know my grandmother lived to one hundred and one
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1722.04 1730.09 <o,f0,male> i just want to live life to its full you know if i can make a difference i hope to be able to
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1730.52 1737.82 <o,f0,male> make a difference and i think one of the positive things at the moment is you've got sergey and larry from google for instance
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1738.46 1745.39 <o,f0,male> good friends and thank god you've got two people who genuinely care about the world
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1746.25 1754.05 <o,f0,male> with that kind of wealth if they had that kind of wealth and they didn't care about the world it would be very worrying and you know they're going to make a hell of a difference to the world
RichardBranson_2007 1 RichardBranson_2007 1770.80 1779.85 <o,f0,male> and you actually did inspire me i looked at you i thought well he 's made it maybe there is a different way so i would like to thank you for that inspiration and for coming to ted today thank you
