EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 21.14 24.29 <o,f0,female> to discuss the early development of the airplane
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 24.49 34.04 <o,f0,female> the wright brothers in the beginning of the last century had for the first time managed to make one of those devices fly
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 34.04 50.49 <o,f0,female> they also had taken out numerous patents on essential parts of the airplane they were not the only ones that was common practice in the industry and those who held patents on airplanes were defending them fiercely and suing competitors left and right
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 50.69 62.05 <o,f0,female> this actually wasn 't so great for the development of the aviation industry and this was at a time that in particular the u s government was interested in ramping up
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 62.05 78.43 <o,f0,female> the production of military airplanes so there was a bit of a conflict there the u s government decided to take action and forced those patent holders to make their patents available to share with others to enable
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 78.48 83.41 <o,f0,female> the production of airplanes so
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 83.41 86.94 <o,f0,female> what has this got to do
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 87.11 89.65 <o,f0,female> with this
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 89.65 106.8 <o,f0,female> in two thousand and two nelson otwoma a kenyan social scientist discovered he had hiv and needed access to treatment he was told that a cure did not exist aids he heard was lethal
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 107.19 113.33 <o,f0,female> and treatment was not offered this was at a time that treatment actually existed in rich countries
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 113.33 131.75 <o,f0,female> aids had become a chronic disease people in our countries here in europe in north america were living with hiv healthy lives not so for nelson he wasn 't rich enough and not so for his three year old son who he discovered a year later also had hiv
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 139.86 143.96 <o,f0,female> they were facing a different battle
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 144.31 157.95 <o,f0,female> prices for arvs the drugs needed to treat hiv cost about twelve thousand dollars per patient per year the patents on those drugs were held by a number of
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 157.95 167.4 <o,f0,female> western pharmaceutical companies that were not necessarily willing to make those patents available
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 167.67 186.35 <o,f0,female> when you have a patent you can exclude anyone else from making from producing or making low cost versions for example available of those medications clearly this led to patent wars breaking out
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 217.04 228.45 <o,f0,female> dollars per patient per year to three hundred and fifty dollars per patient per year and today that same triple pill cocktail is available for sixty dollars per patient per year and of course
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 228.45 247.96 <o,f0,female> that started to have an enormous effect on the number of people who could afford access to those medicines treatment programs became possible funding became available and the number of people on antiretroviral drugs started to increase very rapidly
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 247.96 253.54 <o,f0,female> today eight million people have access to antiretroviral drugs
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 253.54 256.17 <o,f0,female> thirty four million
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 256.17 268.63 <o,f0,female> are infected with hiv never has this number been so high but actually this is good news because what it means is people stop dying people who have access to these drugs stop dying and there 's something else they also stop
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 268.63 281.02 <o,f0,female> passing on the virus this is fairly recent science that has shown that what that means is we have the tools to break the back of this epidemic so
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 281.93 283.62 <o,f0,female> what 's the problem
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 283.86 286.08 <o,f0,female> well
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 286.31 289.97 <o,f0,female> things have changed first of all the rules have changed
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 290.28 292.78 <o,f0,female> today
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 292.8 300.69 <o,f0,female> all countries are obliged to provide patents for pharmaceuticals that last at least twenty years
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 300.69 315.27 <o,f0,female> this is as a result of the intellectual property rules of the world trade organization so what india did is no longer possible second the practice of patent holding companies have changed
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 315.27 328.46 <o,f0,female> here you see the patent practices before the world trade organization 's rules before ninety five before antiretroviral drugs this is what you see today
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 328.46 334.04 <o,f0,female> and this is in developing countries so what that means is unless we do something deliberate
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 334.04 350.06 <o,f0,female> and unless we do something now we will very soon be faced with another drug price crisis because new drugs are developed new drugs go to market but these medicines are patented in a much wider range of countries
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 350.06 354.83 <o,f0,female> so unless we act unless we do something today
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 354.83 361.04 <o,f0,female> we will soon be faced with what some have termed the treatment time bomb
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 361.16 378.62 <o,f0,female> it isn 't only the number of drugs that are patented there 's something else that can really scare generic manufacturers away this shows you a patent landscape this is the landscape of one medicine
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 378.62 398.06 <o,f0,female> so you can imagine that if you are a generic company about to decide whether to invest in the development of this product unless you know that the licenses to these patents are actually going to be available you will probably choose to do something else again deliberate action is needed
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 398.06 401.76 <o,f0,female> so surely if
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 417.72 426.83 <o,f0,female> in two thousand and ten unitaid established the medicines patent pool for hiv
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 426.92 428.89 <o,f0,female> and this is how it works
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 436.16 454.06 <o,f0,female> patent those inventions but make those patents available to the medicines patent pool the medicines patent pool then license those out to whoever needs access to those patents that can be generic manufacturers it can also be not for profit drug development agencies for example
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 454.06 459.45 <o,f0,female> those manufacturers can then sell those medicines at much lower cost
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 459.45 466.22 <o,f0,female> to people who need access to them to treatment programs that need access to them they pay royalties
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 466.23 473.6 <o,f0,female> over the sales to the patent holders so they are remunerated for sharing their intellectual property
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 478.68 490.8 <o,f0,female> there is one key difference with the airplane patent pool the medicines patent pool is a voluntary mechanism
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 490.94 502.22 <o,f0,female> the airplane patent holders were not left a choice whether they 'd license their patents or not they were forced to do so that is something that the medicines patent pool cannot do
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 502.27 513.09 <o,f0,female> it relies on the willingness of pharmaceutical companies to license their patents and make them available for others to use
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 513.24 531.4 <o,f0,female> today nelson otwoma is healthy he has access to antiretroviral drugs his son will soon be fourteen years old nelson is a member of the expert advisory group of the medicines patent pool
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 531.52 534.61 <o,f0,female> and he told me not so long ago ellen
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 534.96 548.56 <o,f0,female> we rely in kenya and in many other countries on the medicines patent pool to make sure that new medicines also become available to us
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 548.56 558.97 <o,f0,female> that new medicines without delay become available to us and this is no longer fantasy already
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 558.97 561.75 <o,f0,female> i 'll give you an example
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 561.75 580.04 <o,f0,female> in august of this year the united states drug agency approved a new four in one aids medication the company gilead that holds the patents has licensed the intellectual property to the medicines patent pool the pool is already working today two months later
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 598.42 601.04 <o,f0,female> this has never been seen before
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 602.5 618.01 <o,f0,female> nelson 's expectations are very high and quite rightly so he and his son will need access to the next generation of antiretrovirals and the next throughout their lifetime so that he
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 618.01 625.48 <o,f0,female> and many others in kenya and other countries can continue to live healthy active lives
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 625.48 643.32 <o,f0,female> now we count on the willingness of drug companies to make that happen we count on those companies that understand that it is in the interest not only in the interest of the global good but also in their own interest to move from conflict to collaboration
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 643.32 649.98 <o,f0,female> and through the medicines patent pool they can make that happen they can also choose not to do that
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 652.99 655.89 <o,f0,female> those that go down that road may end up
EllenTHoen_2012X 1 EllenTHoen_2012X 655.91 665.2 <o,f0,female> in a similar situation the wright brothers ended up with early last century facing forcible measures by government so
