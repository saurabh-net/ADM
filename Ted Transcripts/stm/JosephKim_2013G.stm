JosephKim_2013G 1 JosephKim_2013G 30.53 44.38 <o,f0,male> but then the great famine began in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four i was four years old my sister and i would go searching for firewood starting at five in the morning and come back after midnight
JosephKim_2013G 1 JosephKim_2013G 95.96 108.53 <o,f0,male> in the same year my mother disappeared one day and then my sister told me that she was going to china to earn money but that she would return with money and food soon
JosephKim_2013G 1 JosephKim_2013G 108.53 114.24 <o,f0,male> since we had never been separated and i thought we would be together forever
JosephKim_2013G 1 JosephKim_2013G 149.15 154.11 <o,f0,male> i started to realize begging would not be the solution
JosephKim_2013G 1 JosephKim_2013G 154.11 164.95 <o,f0,male> so i started to steal from food carts in illegal markets sometimes i found small jobs in exchange for food
JosephKim_2013G 1 JosephKim_2013G 189.51 201.83 <o,f0,male> when i could not fall asleep from bitter cold or hunger pains i hoped that the next morning my sister would come back to wake me up with my favorite food
JosephKim_2013G 1 JosephKim_2013G 201.83 209.68 <o,f0,male> that hope kept me alive i don 't mean big grand hope i mean the kind of hope
JosephKim_2013G 1 JosephKim_2013G 250.19 266.67 <o,f0,male> i knew the journey would be risky but i would be risking my life either way i could die of starvation like my father in north korea or at least i could try for a better life by escaping to china
JosephKim_2013G 1 JosephKim_2013G 266.67 272.53 <o,f0,male> i had learned that many people tried to cross the border to china
JosephKim_2013G 1 JosephKim_2013G 312.78 324.77 <o,f0,male> i made it to china on february fifteen two thousand and six i was sixteen years old i thought things in china would be easier since there was more food
JosephKim_2013G 1 JosephKim_2013G 324.77 338.84 <o,f0,male> i thought more people would help me but it was harder than living in north korea because i was not free i was always worried about being caught and sent back
JosephKim_2013G 1 JosephKim_2013G 338.84 355.14 <o,f0,male> by a miracle some months later i met someone who was running an underground shelter for north koreans and was allowed to live there and eat regular meals for the first time in many years
JosephKim_2013G 1 JosephKim_2013G 355.14 360.19 <o,f0,male> later that year an activist helped me escape china
JosephKim_2013G 1 JosephKim_2013G 360.28 376.84 <o,f0,male> and go to the united states as a refugee i went to america without knowing a word of english yet my social worker told me that i had to go to high school even in north korea i was an f student
JosephKim_2013G 1 JosephKim_2013G 413.67 430.5 <o,f0,male> so in america it was kind of ridiculous that they said i should go to high school i didn 't even go to middle school i decided to go just because they told me to without trying much but one day i came home
JosephKim_2013G 1 JosephKim_2013G 430.58 444.15 <o,f0,male> and my foster mother had made chicken wings for dinner and during dinner i wanted to have one more wing but i realized there were not enough for everyone so i decided against it
JosephKim_2013G 1 JosephKim_2013G 480.08 485.2 <o,f0,male> i felt so suffocated that i had so much food in america
JosephKim_2013G 1 JosephKim_2013G 485.21 488.13 <o,f0,male> yet my father died of starvation
JosephKim_2013G 1 JosephKim_2013G 507.67 524.89 <o,f0,male> i took school seriously and for the first time ever in my life i received an academic award for excellence and made dean 's list from the first semester in high school
JosephKim_2013G 1 JosephKim_2013G 530.79 539.65 <o,f0,male> changed my life laughter hope is personal
JosephKim_2013G 1 JosephKim_2013G 548.8 562.4 <o,f0,male> in north korea i made it myself hope brought me to america but in america i didn 't know what to do because i had this overwhelming freedom
JosephKim_2013G 1 JosephKim_2013G 601.46 608.51 <o,f0,male> this is my message to you have hope for yourself but also help each other
