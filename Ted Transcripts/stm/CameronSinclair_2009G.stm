CameronSinclair_2009G 1 CameronSinclair_2009G 53.14 62.43 <o,f0,male> they pay a middle man thousands of dollars to be there and when they arrive they find themselves in labor camps with no water no air conditioning and their passports taken away
CameronSinclair_2009G 1 CameronSinclair_2009G 63.67 70.52 <o,f0,male> while it's easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities ninety nine percent of these people are hired by the private sector
CameronSinclair_2009G 1 CameronSinclair_2009G 71.07 73.56 <o,f0,male> and so therefore we are equally if not more accountable
CameronSinclair_2009G 1 CameronSinclair_2009G 79.60 91.54 <o,f0,male> in august two thousand and eight uae public officials noted that forty percent of the country 's one thousand and ninety eight labor camps had violated minimum health and fire safety regulations and last summer

CameronSinclair_2009G 1 CameronSinclair_2009G 102.65 110.53 <o,f0,male> when the contractors had gone bust as they'd been over leveraged like everyone else the difference is everything goes missing documentation
CameronSinclair_2009G 1 CameronSinclair_2009G 111.18 122.16 <o,f0,male> passports and tickets home for these workers currently right now thousands of workers are abandoned there is no way back home and there is no way and no proof of arrival

CameronSinclair_2009G 1 CameronSinclair_2009G 130.93 139.16 <o,f0,male> if you know this is going on as we go to the sights every single week are you complacent or complicit in the human rights violations
CameronSinclair_2009G 1 CameronSinclair_2009G 140.06 150.87 <o,f0,male> so let 's forget your environmental footprint let 's think about your ethical footprint what good is it to build a zero carbon energy efficient complex
CameronSinclair_2009G 1 CameronSinclair_2009G 151.12 162.22 <o,f0,male> when the labor producing this architectural gem is unethical at best now recently i've been told i've been taking the high road but quite frankly on this issue there is no other road
CameronSinclair_2009G 1 CameronSinclair_2009G 162.98 172.86 <o,f0,male> so let 's not forget who is really paying the price of this financial collapse and that as we worry about our next job in the office the next design that we can get to keep our workers
