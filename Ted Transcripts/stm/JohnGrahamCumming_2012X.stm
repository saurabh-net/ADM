JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 40.56 52.2 <o,f0,male> the first computer was really designed in the one thousand eight hundred and thirty s and one thousand eight hundred and forty s not the one thousand nine hundred and thirty s and one thousand nine hundred and forty s it was designed and parts of it were prototyped and the bits of it that were built are here in south kensington
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 52.2 61.77 <o,f0,male> that machine was built by this guy charles babbage now i have a great affinity for charles babbage because his hair is always completely unkempt like this in every single picture
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 74.1 81.8 <o,f0,male> and he invited everybody kings the duke of wellington many many famous people and he would have shown you one of his mechanical machines
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 81.8 100.79 <o,f0,male> i really miss that era you know where you could go around for a soiree and see a mechanical computer get demonstrated to you laughter but babbage babbage himself was born at the end of the eighteenth century and was a fairly famous mathematician he held the post that newton held at cambridge and that was recently held by stephen hawking
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 100.79 109 <o,f0,male> he 's less well known than either of them because he got this idea to make mechanical computing devices and never made any of them
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 109 127.1 <o,f0,male> the reason he never made any of them he 's a classic nerd every time he had a good idea he 'd think that 's brilliant i 'm going to start building that one i 'll spend a fortune on it i 've got a better idea i 'm going to work on this one laughter and i 'm going to do this one he did this until sir robert peel then prime minister basically kicked him out of number ten downing street and kicking him out
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 145.35 158.72 <o,f0,male> so as i go through this talk i want you to imagine this gigantic machine we heard those wonderful sounds of what this thing would have sounded like and i 'm going to take you through the architecture of the machine that 's why it 's computer architecture and tell you about this machine which is a computer
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 158.72 176.09 <o,f0,male> so let 's talk about the memory the memory is very like the memory of a computer today except it was all made out of metal stacks and stacks of cogs thirty cogs high imagine a thing this high of cogs hundreds and hundreds of them and they 've got numbers on them
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 176.09 191.4 <o,f0,male> it 's a decimal machine everything 's done in decimal and he thought about using binary the problem with using binary is that the machine would have been so tall it would have been ridiculous as it is it 's enormous so he 's got memory the memory is this bit over here you see it all like this
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 191.4 207.43 <o,f0,male> this monstrosity over here is the cpu the chip if you like of course it 's this big completely mechanical this whole machine is mechanical this is a picture of a prototype for part of the cpu which is in the science museum
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 207.43 214.05 <o,f0,male> the cpu could do the four fundamental functions of arithmetic so addition multiplication subtraction division
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 214.05 217.14 <o,f0,male> which already is a bit of a feat in metal
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 249.94 258.81 <o,f0,male> and this incredible regularity in the memory if you 've ever seen an electron microscope picture you 'll see this this all looks the same then there 's this bit over here which is incredibly complicated
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 272.88 281.67 <o,f0,male> this thing over here is one of three punch card readers in here and this is a program in the science museum just
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 281.67 283.4 <o,f0,male> not far from here
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 283.4 289.54 <o,f0,male> created by charles babbage that is sitting there you can go see it waiting for the machine to be built
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 289.54 292.79 <o,f0,male> and there 's not just one of these there 's many of them
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 328.34 338.98 <o,f0,male> now he needed accessories obviously you 've got a computer now you 've got punch cards a cpu and memory you need accessories you 're going to come with you 're not just going to have that so first of all you had sound
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 392.54 406.66 <o,f0,male> you know at that point i think he got pretty much a pretty good machine along comes this woman ada lovelace now imagine these soirees all these great and good comes along this lady is the daughter of the mad bad and dangerous to know lord byron
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 406.66 413.07 <o,f0,male> and her mother being a bit worried that she might have inherited some of lord byron 's madness and badness thought
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 413.07 419.99 <o,f0,male> i know the solution mathematics is the solution we 'll teach her mathematics that 'll calm her down laughter because of course
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 463.11 477.95 <o,f0,male> written in a particular style it 's not historically totally accurate that she 's the first programmer and actually she did something more amazing rather than just being a programmer she saw something that babbage didn 't babbage was totally obsessed with mathematics
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 477.95 486.31 <o,f0,male> he was building a machine to do mathematics and lovelace said you could do more than mathematics on this machine
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 486.31 503.28 <o,f0,male> and just as you do everyone in this room already 's got a computer on them right now because they 've got a phone if you go into that phone every single thing in that phone or computer or any other computing device is mathematics it 's all numbers at the bottom whether it 's video or text or music or voice it 's all numbers it 's all
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 503.28 517.06 <o,f0,male> underlying it mathematical functions happening and lovelace said just because you 're doing mathematical functions and symbols doesn 't mean these things can 't represent other things in the real world such as music
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 527.05 544.41 <o,f0,male> look this thing could even compose music if you told it a representation of music numerically so this is what i call lovelace 's leap when you say she 's a programmer she did do some but the real thing is to have said the future is going to be much much more than this
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 544.41 562.63 <o,f0,male> now a hundred years later this guy comes along alan turing and in one thousand nine hundred and thirty six and invents the computer all over again now of course babbage 's machine was entirely mechanical turing 's machine was entirely theoretical both of these guys were coming from a mathematical perspective but turing told us something very important
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 562.63 570.57 <o,f0,male> he laid down the mathematical foundations for computer science and said it doesn 't matter how you make a computer
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 570.57 582.74 <o,f0,male> it doesn 't matter if your computer 's mechanical like babbage 's was or electronic like computers are today or perhaps in the future cells or again mechanical again once we get into nanotechnology
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 600.32 603.05 <o,f0,male> only really slowly
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 635.12 649.95 <o,f0,male> one of those is a set of plans that we call plan twenty eight and that is also the name of a charity that i started with doron swade who was the curator of computing at the science museum and also the person who drove the project to build a difference engine and our plan is to build it
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 1 JohnGrahamCumming_2012X 676.22 687.68 <o,f0,male> humongous thing and say ah i see the memory operating i see the cpu operating i hear it operating i probably smell it operating laughter but in between that we 're going to do a simulation
