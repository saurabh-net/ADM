JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 16.39 20.28 <o,f0,male> we solve these problems
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 32.53 42.29 <o,f0,male> march the fifteenth two thousand the b fifteen iceberg broke off the ross ice shelf in the newspaper it said
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 42.42 48.71 <o,f0,male> it was all part of a normal process a little bit further on in the article
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 49.23 53.4 <o,f0,male> it said a loss that would normally take the ice shelf
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 68.3 77.12 <o,f0,male> if we walk into the b fifteen iceberg when we leave here today we 're going to bump into something a thousand feet tall
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 77.93 80.33 <o,f0,male> seventy six miles long
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 81.61 83.96 <o,f0,male> seventeen miles wide
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 96.29 98.4 <o,f0,male> through the lens of normal
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 98.95 105.25 <o,f0,male> is one of the forces that stops us developing real solutions
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 105.57 113.09 <o,f0,male> only ninety days after this arguably the greatest discovery of the last century occurred
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 113.81 120.17 <o,f0,male> it was the sequencing for the first time of the human genome this is the code
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 120.36 126.54 <o,f0,male> that 's in every single one of our fifty trillion cells that makes us who we are
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 128.53 133.52 <o,f0,male> and what we are and if we just take one cell 's worth of this code and unwind it
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 135.01 136.63 <o,f0,male> it 's a meter long
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 137.98 146.88 <o,f0,male> two nanometers thick two nanometers is twenty atoms in thickness and i wondered
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 146.95 161.76 <o,f0,male> what if the answer to some of our biggest problems could be found in the smallest of places where the difference between what is valuable and what is worthless is merely the addition or subtraction of a few atoms
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 166.01 169.94 <o,f0,male> over the essence of energy the electron
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 171.15 180.25 <o,f0,male> so i started to go around the world finding the best and brightest scientists i could at universities whose collective discoveries have the chance to take us there
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 180.59 182.34 <o,f0,male> and we formed a company
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 182.4 191.43 <o,f0,male> to build on their extraordinary ideas six and a half years later a hundred and eighty researchers they have some amazing developments in the lab
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 193.74 195.26 <o,f0,male> such that we can stop
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 195.26 198.84 <o,f0,male> burning up our planet and instead
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 199.54 201.12 <o,f0,male> we can generate
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 201.13 204.74 <o,f0,male> all the energy we need right where we are
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 205.1 208.01 <o,f0,male> cleanly safely and cheaply
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 208.55 211.75 <o,f0,male> think of the space that we spend most of our time
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 223.96 230.72 <o,f0,male> in winter exactly the opposite is happening we 're trying to heat up the space that we 're in and all that is trying to get out through the window
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 240.98 246.58 <o,f0,male> one of the materials that can do this is a remarkable material
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 246.8 255.55 <o,f0,male> carbon that has changed its form in this incredibly beautiful reaction where graphite is blasted by a vapor
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 255.91 263.3 <o,f0,male> and when the vaporized carbon condenses it condenses back into a different form
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 263.75 265.62 <o,f0,male> chickenwire rolled up
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 266.41 279.73 <o,f0,male> but this chickenwire carbon called a carbon nanotube is a hundred thousand times smaller than the width of one of your hairs it 's a thousand times more conductive than copper
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 285.55 288.45 <o,f0,male> one of the things about working at the nanoscale
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 288.75 294.25 <o,f0,male> is things look and act very differently you think of carbon as black
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 298.85 301.1 <o,f0,male> carbon at the nanoscale
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 301.3 303.56 <o,f0,male> is actually transparent
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 309.35 312.92 <o,f0,male> and when it 's in this form if i combine it with a polymer
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 314.08 316.23 <o,f0,male> and affix it to your window
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 317.59 319.1 <o,f0,male> when it 's in its
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 319.29 330.27 <o,f0,male> colored state it will reflect away all heat and light and when it 's in its bleached state it will let all the light and heat through and any combination in between
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 331.25 337.13 <o,f0,male> to change its state by the way takes two volts from a millisecond pulse
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 340.15 346.31 <o,f0,male> until you change its state again as we were working on this incredible discovery at university of florida
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 349.82 352.87 <o,f0,male> to visit another scientist
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 352.98 355.99 <o,f0,male> and he was working on a pretty incredible thing
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 356.12 364.8 <o,f0,male> imagine if we didn 't have to rely on artificial lighting to get around at night
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 374.65 377.49 <o,f0,male> it 's a nanomaterial two nanomaterials
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 379.48 384.02 <o,f0,male> the total width of it is six hundred times smaller
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 384.25 386.41 <o,f0,male> than the width of a decimal place
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 387.44 391.22 <o,f0,male> and it takes all the infrared available at night
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 391.35 394.15 <o,f0,male> converts it into an electron
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 399.21 400.88 <o,f0,male> an image
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 401.86 403.52 <o,f0,male> which you can see through
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 416.93 419.53 <o,f0,male> transparency is key
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 420.49 422.5 <o,f0,male> it 's a film that you can look through
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 422.98 425.11 <o,f0,male> and then i 'm going to turn the lights out
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 427.18 431.34 <o,f0,male> and you can see off a tiny film incredible clarity
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 434.31 436.04 <o,f0,male> as we were working on this
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 436.1 438.1 <o,f0,male> it dawned on us
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 446.1 447.8 <o,f0,male> if we combined it
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 455.9 459.64 <o,f0,male> you 've converted energy into an electron
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 459.72 463.49 <o,f0,male> on a plastic surface that you can stick on your window
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 463.99 465.74 <o,f0,male> but because it 's flexible
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 466.34 468.91 <o,f0,male> it can be on any surface whatsoever
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 480.46 483.37 <o,f0,male> we talked about generating and using
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 484.01 487.44 <o,f0,male> we want to talk about storing energy and unfortunately
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 487.91 507.54 <o,f0,male> the best thing we 've got going is something that was developed in france a hundred and fifty years ago the lead acid battery in terms of dollars per what 's stored it 's simply the best knowing that we 're not going to put fifty of these in our basements to store our power we went to a group at university of texas at dallas and we gave them this diagram
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 507.8 512.75 <o,f0,male> it was in actually a diner outside of dallas fort worth airport we said could you build this
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 512.88 515.3 <o,f0,male> and these scientists instead of laughing at us said
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 525.6 527.94 <o,f0,male> hold it until you need it
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 528.01 530.87 <o,f0,male> and then be able to release it and pass it off
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 531.81 534.41 <o,f0,male> being able to do that means
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 536.87 542.86 <o,f0,male> that i can generate energy cleanly efficiently and cheaply right where i am
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 543.36 545.76 <o,f0,male> it 's my energy
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 546.41 551.79 <o,f0,male> and if i don 't need it i can convert it back up on the window to energy light
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 554.56 560.66 <o,f0,male> to your place and for that i do not need an electric grid between us
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 560.79 570.07 <o,f0,male> the grid of tomorrow is no grid and energy clean efficient energy
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 570.13 572.13 <o,f0,male> will one day be free
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 575.96 581.87 <o,f0,male> if you do this you get the last puzzle piece which is water
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 614.34 622.64 <o,f0,male> these also require tremendous amounts of energy in fact it 's going to require twice the world 's supply of oil to run the pumps to generate the water
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 622.93 625.36 <o,f0,male> we 're simply not going to do that
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 625.48 628.65 <o,f0,male> but in a world where energy is freed
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 637.25 644.76 <o,f0,male> i 'm glad to be working with incredibly brilliant and kind scientists no kinder than many of the people in the world
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 644.88 647.31 <o,f0,male> but they have a magic look at the world
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 648.73 652.67 <o,f0,male> and i 'm glad to see their discoveries coming out of the lab and into the world
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 653.46 659.35 <o,f0,male> it 's been a long time in coming for me eighteen years ago
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 660.07 661.6 <o,f0,male> i saw a photograph
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 670.53 673.84 <o,f0,male> i 've carried this photograph with me every day since then
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 677.51 679.31 <o,f0,male> it 's a picture of a little girl
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 680 681.7 <o,f0,male> dying of thirst
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 704.31 710.82 <o,f0,male> and whenever i go round to somebody who says you know what you 're working on something that 's too difficult it 'll never happen
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 711.51 717.59 <o,f0,male> you don 't have enough money you don 't have enough time there 's something much more interesting around the corner
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 726.16 729.15 <o,f0,male> this is why we have to solve our problems
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 730.39 732.57 <o,f0,male> and i know the answer as to how
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 734.65 737.1 <o,f0,male> is to be able to get exquisite control
JustinHallTipping_2011G 1 JustinHallTipping_2011G 738.61 740.53 <o,f0,male> over a building block of nature
