JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 16.11 21.39 <o,f0,male> my name is jarrett krosoczka and i write and illustrate books for children
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 27.05 30.27 <o,f0,male> but well before my imagination was my vocation
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 30.67 32.44 <o,f0,male> my imagination saved my life
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 33.3 37.92 <o,f0,male> when i was a kid i loved to draw and the most talented artist i knew
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 37.92 39.96 <o,f0,male> was my mother
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 43.81 57.93 <o,f0,male> and when your parent is a drug addict it 's kind of like charlie brown trying to kick the football because as much as you want to love on that person as much as you want to receive love from that person every time you open your heart you end up on your back
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 58.43 67.43 <o,f0,male> so throughout my childhood my mother was incarcerated and i didn 't have my father because i didn 't even learn his first name until i was in the sixth grade
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 68.21 82.57 <o,f0,male> but i had my grandparents my maternal grandparents joseph and shirley who adopted me just before my third birthday and took me in as their own after they had already raised five children so two people who grew up in the great depression
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 82.57 94.38 <o,f0,male> there in the very very early eighty s took on a new kid i was the cousin oliver of the sitcom of the krosoczka family the new kid who came out of nowhere
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 94.42 110.68 <o,f0,male> and i would like to say that life was totally easy with them they each smoked two packs a day each nonfiltered and by the time i was six i could order a southern comfort manhattan dry with a twist rocks on the side the ice on the side so you could fit more liquor in the drink
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 111.72 115.12 <o,f0,male> but they loved the hell out of me they loved me so much
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 115.13 124.76 <o,f0,male> and they supported my creative efforts because my grandfather was a self made man he ran and worked in a factory my grandmother was a homemaker
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 124.76 135.49 <o,f0,male> but here was this kid who loved transformers and snoopy and the ninja turtles and the characters that i read about i fell in love with
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 135.74 143.12 <o,f0,male> and they became my friends so my best friends in life were the characters i read about in books
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 144.02 149.22 <o,f0,male> i went to gates lane elementary school in worcester massachusetts and i had wonderful teachers there
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 149.41 152.26 <o,f0,male> most notably in first grade mrs alisch
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 152.76 162.17 <o,f0,male> and i just i can just remember the love that she offered us as her students when i was in the third grade
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 172.2 179.3 <o,f0,male> and afterwards we all went back to our classrooms and we drew our own renditions of his main character rotten ralph
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 179.62 182.07 <o,f0,male> and suddenly the author appeared in our doorway
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 199.73 204.11 <o,f0,male> two words that made a colossal difference in my life
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 204.75 210.54 <o,f0,male> when i was in the third grade i wrote a book for the first time the owl who thought he was the best flyer
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 214.28 222.98 <o,f0,male> our own creation story so i wrote a story about an owl who challenged hermes to a flying race and the owl cheated
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 222.99 233 <o,f0,male> and hermes being a greek god grew angry and bitter and turned the owl into a moon so the owl had to live the rest of his life as a moon while he watched his family and friends play at night
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 239.31 241.63 <o,f0,male> i was clearly worried about my intellectual property
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 246.69 255.01 <o,f0,male> it was a story that was told with words and pictures exactly what i do now for a living and i sometimes let the words have the stage on their own
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 278.67 297.39 <o,f0,male> using my imagination and that 's what writing is writing is using your imagination on paper and i do get so scared because i travel to so many schools now and that seems like such a foreign concept to kids that writing would be using your imagination on paper if they 're allowed to even write now within the school hours
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 297.39 300.11 <o,f0,male> so i loved writing so much that i 'd come home from school
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 300.23 315.73 <o,f0,male> and i would take out pieces of paper and i would staple them together and i would fill those blank pages with words and pictures just because i loved using my imagination and so these characters would become my friends there was an egg a tomato a head of lettuce and a pumpkin
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 315.73 318.43 <o,f0,male> and they all lived in this refrigerator city
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 318.72 324.25 <o,f0,male> and in one of their adventures they went to a haunted house that was filled with so many dangers like an evil blender
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 344.2 352.75 <o,f0,male> and through pictures now when i was in sixth grade the public funding all but eliminated the arts budgets in the worcester public school system
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 352.75 361.04 <o,f0,male> i went from having art once a week to twice a month to once a month to not at all
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 367.69 371.11 <o,f0,male> i had art
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 371.11 381.54 <o,f0,male> so he walked into my room one evening and he sat on the edge of my bed and he said jarrett it 's up to you but if you 'd like to we 'd like to send you to the classes at the worcester art museum and i was so thrilled
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 381.54 392.25 <o,f0,male> so from sixth through twelfth grade once twice sometimes three times a week i would take classes at the art museum and i was surrounded by other kids who loved to draw other kids who shared a similar passion
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 392.25 398.63 <o,f0,male> now my publishing career began when i designed the cover for my eighth grade yearbook
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 398.65 406.41 <o,f0,male> and if you 're wondering about the style of dress i put our mascot in i was really into bell biv devoe and mc hammer and vanilla ice at the time
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 408.67 413.87 <o,f0,male> and to this day i still can do karaoke to ice ice baby without looking at the screen
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 415.16 417.09 <o,f0,male> don 't tempt me because i will do it
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 418.37 426.98 <o,f0,male> so i get shipped off to private school k through eight public schools but for some reason my grandfather was upset that somebody at the local high school had been stabbed and killed
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 426.98 429.29 <o,f0,male> so he didn 't want me to go there
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 429.77 432.79 <o,f0,male> he wanted me to go to a private school and he gave me an option
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 432.79 436.71 <o,f0,male> you can go to holy name which is coed or st john 's which is all boys
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 436.71 454.7 <o,f0,male> very wise man because he knew i would i felt like i was making the decision on my own and he knew i wouldn 't choose st john 's so i went to holy name high school which was a tough transition because like i said i didn 't play sports and it was very focused on sports but i took solace in mr shilale 's art
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 459.18 461.7 <o,f0,male> i just couldn 't wait to get to that classroom every day
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 461.89 466.86 <o,f0,male> so how did i make friends i drew funny pictures of my teachers
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 470.53 472.19 <o,f0,male> well
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 472.19 478.71 <o,f0,male> in english class in ninth grade my friend john who was sitting next to me laughed a little bit too hard
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 479.76 482.02 <o,f0,male> mr greenwood was not pleased
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 491.08 509.13 <o,f0,male> i was sent to the hall and i thought oh no i 'm doomed my grandfather 's just going to kill me and he came out to the hallway and he said let me see the paper and i thought oh no he thinks it 's a note and so i took this picture and i handed it to him
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 512.9 516.2 <o,f0,male> and he said to me you 're really talented
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 518.33 525.65 <o,f0,male> you 're really good you know the school newspaper needs a new cartoonist and you should be the cartoonist just stop drawing in my class
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 526.6 532.25 <o,f0,male> so my parents never found out about it i didn 't get in trouble i was introduced to mrs casey
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 541.24 542.9 <o,f0,male> handling such heavy issues as
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 543.52 548.21 <o,f0,male> seniors are mean freshmen are nerds
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 549.29 551.23 <o,f0,male> the prom bill is so expensive
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 551.5 553.99 <o,f0,male> i can 't believe how much it costs to go to the prom
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 555.34 558.04 <o,f0,male> and i took the headmaster to task
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 558.45 567.01 <o,f0,male> and then i also wrote an ongoing story about a boy named wesley who was unlucky in love and i just swore up and down that this wasn 't about me
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 567.61 569.52 <o,f0,male> but all these years later it was totally
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 571.67 576.67 <o,f0,male> but it was so cool because i could write these stories i could come up with these ideas and they 'd be published in the school paper
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 584.65 590.23 <o,f0,male> on my fourteenth birthday my grandfather and my grandmother gave me the best birthday present ever
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 590.23 604.1 <o,f0,male> a drafting table that i have worked on ever since here i am twenty years later and i still work on this table every day on the evening of my fourteenth birthday
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 604.1 615.39 <o,f0,male> i was given this table and we had chinese food and this was my fortune you will be successful in your work i taped it to the top
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 615.39 618.04 <o,f0,male> left hand of my table and as you can see it 's still there
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 618.35 621.98 <o,f0,male> now i never really asked my grandparents for anything
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 622.13 627.08 <o,f0,male> well two things rusty who was a great hamster and lived a great long life when i was in fourth grade

JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 637.13 646.96 <o,f0,male> and after begging and pleading for christmas i got a second hand video camera and i instantly started making my own animations on my own
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 647.91 657.21 <o,f0,male> and all throughout high school i made my own animations i convinced my tenth grade english teacher to allow me to do my book report on stephen king 's misery as an animated short
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 660.62 662.39 <o,f0,male> and i kept making comics
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 663.46 666.43 <o,f0,male> i kept making comics and
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 666.43 676.55 <o,f0,male> at the worcester art museum i was given the greatest piece of advice by any educator i was ever given mark lynch he 's an amazing teacher and he 's still a dear friend of mine
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 676.71 682.44 <o,f0,male> and i was fourteen or fifteen and i walked into his comic book class halfway through the course
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 698.33 716.88 <o,f0,male> from his face and he looked at me and he said forget everything you learned and i didn 't understand he said you have a great style celebrate your own style don 't draw the way you 're being told to draw draw the way you 're drawing and keep at it because you 're really
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 716.88 728.86 <o,f0,male> now when i was a teenager i was angsty as any teenager was but after seventeen years of having a mother who was in and out of my life like a yo yo and a father who was faceless i was angry
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 729.99 736.32 <o,f0,male> and when i was seventeen i met my father for the first time upon which i learned i had a brother and sister i had never known about
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 736.63 741.25 <o,f0,male> and on the day i met my father for the first time i was rejected from the rhode island school of design
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 741.56 744.23 <o,f0,male> my one and only choice for college

JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 755.96 763.25 <o,f0,male> and eric lives with me every day so after this experience my art teacher mr shilale he brought in these picture books
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 780.69 792.87 <o,f0,male> and it was there that i wrote a story about a giant orange slug who wanted to be friends with this kid the kid had no patience for him and i sent this book out to a dozen publishers and it was rejected every single time
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 1 JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X 792.92 805.38 <o,f0,male> but i was also involved with the hole in the wall gang camp an amazing camp for kids with all sorts of critical illnesses and it 's those kids at the camp that read my stories and i read to them and i saw that they responded to my work
