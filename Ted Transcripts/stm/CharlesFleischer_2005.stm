CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 16.16 23.54 <o,f0,male> i am going to be talking about secrets obviously the best way to divulge a secret is to tell someone to not say anything about it
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 31.48 33.26 <o,f0,male> and when you use these things you don't have to go like that
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 41.93 42.75 <o,f0,male> yes
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 45.49 46.75 <o,f0,male> i'm sure just change
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 51.99 52.79 <o,f0,male> bill gates
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 59.44 61.49 <o,f0,male> that's not my slides but it's okay
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 64.52 75.64 <o,f0,male> as you can see these are all maps and maps are important devices for transferring information especially if you have human cognitive ability
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 76.14 88.75 <o,f0,male> we can see that all formulas are really maps now as humans we make maps of places that we seldom even go which seems a little wasteful of time this of course is a map of the moon
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 89.64 98.89 <o,f0,male> some very delightful names tranquilacalitis my favorite is frigoris what are these people thinking frigoris what the frigoris you doing names are
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 100.68 105.09 <o,f0,male> this is the moon people could live there one day i'll meet you at frigoris no i don't think so
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 107.42 119.54 <o,f0,male> there we see mars again with various names and this is all done by the way by the international astronomical union this is an actual group of people that sit around naming planetary objects
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 119.92 132.93 <o,f0,male> this is from their actual book these are some of the names that they have chosen ladies and gentlemen i'll go through a little of them bolotnitsa that of course is the slavic swamp mermaid
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 134.24 138.48 <o,f0,male> the whole concept of a mermaid doesn't really blend into the swamp feel
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 139.57 139.85 <o,f0,female> look
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 148.88 152.07 <o,f0,male> fluctus if that don't flow off the tongue what
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 154.99 158.94 <o,f0,female> mean kids are studying this stuff and they've got the word fluctus up there that's wrong
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 169.76 175.06 <o,f0,male> that's a little more flowing hikuleo sounds like a kind of a leonardo dicaprio
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 192.88 202.36 <o,f0,female> really i'm so busy with the stars would you mind taking the insects thank you darling oh take the spiders too i know they're not insects but i don't care monkeys chimps just get rid of
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 205.96 219.81 <o,f0,male> now we're going to be going to mars one day and when we do it's going to be unfair for the people that are living there to have to live with these ridiculous names so you'll be on mars and your at hellespointica depressio which has got to be a really up place
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 221.18 228.07 <o,f0,male> yeah i'm at the depressio and i want to get over to amazonis so i plug it into the mars map and click the button and there's my directions
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 240.68 247.85 <o,f0,male> cool name i will say that so i hold back a little of my venom for these astronomical misnomers and then of course arnon to
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 248.77 255.58 <o,f0,male> and of course there will be advertisements this is from their rule book the international astronomical union and you know their international because they put it
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 259.37 266.32 <o,f0,male> international for those of you who don't speak french i thought i'd translate for you from the rulebook nomenclature is a tool the first consideration
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 266.61 272.55 <o,f0,male> make it clear simple and unambiguous and i think that djabran fluctus that fits that
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 276.05 282.35 <o,f0,female> simple the goddess of goats very simple djabran fluctus now frank is this clear to you djabran fluctus yeah
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 293.94 300.50 <o,f0,male> also from the actual document i highlighted a part i thought may be of interest anyone can suggest changing a name
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 300.91 310.20 <o,f0,male> so i look to you fellow member of the earth community we've got to change this stuff up fast so these are actual names of people that work there
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 310.49 318.96 <o,f0,male> i did some more investigation these are more people working for this group and as you can see they don't use their first names
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 320.68 325.00 <o,f0,male> these are people naming planets and they won 't use their first names something is askew here
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 326.30 328.38 <o,f0,male> is it because his name is really jupiter
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 334.11 335.02 <o,f0,female> that mars
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 336.54 345.45 <o,f0,male> i don't know but it's investigative material no doubt there are some mapping people who do use their names witness please eugene shoemaker
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 354.31 360.25 <o,f0,male> make maps that 's wonderful eugene you could make maps of toronto no i want to make maps of planets
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 371.82 378.89 <o,f0,male> seems a little silly to me there are no jovians getting back to my premise i used stamps by the way because you don't have to pay anybody for the rights
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 402.95 417.11 <o,f0,male> by the way that's a natural picture of saturn no adjustments i mean that's just beautiful so beautiful that i will even give up a laugh to explain my love of this particular planet and the day saturday named after it wonderfully
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 417.65 427.80 <o,f0,male> so formulas relate number to form that's euler his formula was one of the inspirations that lead to the beginning of string theory which is kind of cool not that funny but it is cool
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 429.26 431.26 <o,f0,male> he was also famous for having no body
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 446.36 451.42 <o,f0,male> which is one of the five sacred solids very important shapes you see the icosahedron again
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 451.70 462.22 <o,f0,male> the dodecahedron it's dual there is a dodecahedron which i had to do in my room last night the five sacred solids as you can see there which is not to be confused with the five sacred salads
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 464.15 468.40 <o,f0,male> blue cheese ranch oil and vinegar thousand islands and house i suggest the house
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 469.95 479.49 <o,f0,male> the reality now here is something important what's important about this is these shapes are duals of each other and you can see how the icosahedron withdraws into the dodecahedron
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 479.66 486.16 <o,f0,male> and then they just merge into each other so the whole concept of branes in the universe if the universe is shaped like a dodecahedron
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 486.47 493.80 <o,f0,male> this is is a very good map of what could possibly be and that is of course what we are here to talk about what a coincidence october
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 495.02 503.65 <o,f0,male> in france jean pierre luminet said that the universe is probably shaped like a dodecahedron based on information that they got from this probe
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 504.02 512.78 <o,f0,male> this would be a normal wave pattern but what they're seeing way out there in the far reaches of the microwave background is this kind of odd undulation it doesn't
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 513.70 520.52 <o,f0,male> what they suspected a flat universe would be so you can kind of get and idea from this extrapolating
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 531.20 534.46 <o,f0,male> the universe is either a dodecahedron or a cheeseburger and for me
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 540.46 541.22 <o,f0,male> really hurry up
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 542.41 553.70 <o,f0,male> i just threw this in because as important as all of our intellectual abilities are without heart and without love it's just it's all meaningless and that to me is really beautiful
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 562.85 567.65 <o,f0,male> back to the point of my particular presentation kepler one of my great
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 568.74 577.84 <o,f0,male> who realized that these five solids which i spoke of earlier were related somehow to the planets but he couldn't prove it it freaked him out but it did lead to
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 589.91 595.71 <o,f0,male> i am not suggesting at all that my vietnamese brothers and sisters could maybe use a little art class here and there but
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 601.47 605.80 <o,f0,male> not a good picture now my friends in the island of nevis are a little better look at that
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 610.14 613.79 <o,f0,male> what a handsome cat once again nicaragua let me down
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 615.77 619.16 <o,f0,male> and copurnicus looks like johnny carson which is really
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 621.29 633.60 <o,f0,male> that at all once again these guys rock it out isaac is kickin ass man he looks like a rock star this is freaky is a major way this is sierra leone they got little babies in there floating in
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 636.53 640.29 <o,f0,male> i don't really need to comment on this but i didn't know that isaac newton was in the moody blues
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 647.52 660.33 <o,f0,male> it's a different kind of course and they've got five apples i mean these guys are extrapolating in realms that are not necessarily valid although five is a good number of course ecuador my friend kepler
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 660.97 662.03 <o,f0,male> as you can see
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 689.19 696.43 <o,f0,male> this is of course the cartesian coordinates once again that's sierra leone this is again indicating how
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 696.80 701.78 <o,f0,male> numbers relate to space relate to form maps of the universe because that's why we're here really i think
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 707.57 715.12 <o,f0,male> now monaco took descartes and just flipped him around now monaco is problematic for me and i'll show you why here is a map all they have is a casino on
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 717.45 724.64 <o,f0,male> and why franklin delano roosevelt is on their map i don't even want to hazard a guess but i'd say he'd been to hellespointica depressio recently
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 725.54 729.54 <o,f0,male> this is the flag of monaco ladies and gentlemen the flag of indonesia please examine
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 734.45 743.65 <o,f0,male> not sure how this came to be but it's not right in monaco no what are you talking about they are so different look ours is more red it's longer
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 752.18 758.46 <o,f0,male> was a guy named titus and the reason i just bring this up because it is a law that doesn't really work that's jude law and some of his films
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 775.36 782.18 <o,f0,male> prime numbers gauss one of my favorites golden section i've been obsessed with this thing since before i was born
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 783.42 796.12 <o,f0,male> that scares a lot of you but that was my purpose entirely there we can see fibonacci numbers related to the golden section because fibonacci and golden section relate to the unfolding of the measured meter of mater as i refer to it if fibonacci had been on paxil
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 799.97 800.41 <o,f0,female> that
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 813.72 822.41 <o,f0,male> alright where is this going that's a good question here is the premise that i began twenty seven years ago if numbers can express
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 822.60 828.86 <o,f0,male> the laws of this incredible universe that we live i reason through some sort of reverse engineering we could extrapolate from them
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 829.26 840.98 <o,f0,male> some basic structural element of this universe and that's what i did twenty seven years ago i started working on this and i tried to build a particle accelerator
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 842.97 856.07 <o,f0,male> and that didn't work out well so then i thought a calculator is a metaphor i can just divide numbers that's like atom smashing that's what i did that's how i found moleeds moleeds are what i believe the thing that will allow string
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 856.99 864.93 <o,f0,male> to be proved they are the nodes on the string patterns and relationships twenty seven thirty seven that was the first chart i came up with
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 865.26 875.68 <o,f0,male> you can see even if you don't go for the numbers the beauty of the symmetry the numbers from one to thirty six divided into six groups symmetry pairs every top
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 876.21 885.08 <o,f0,male> adds up to thirty seven bottom all seventy four there is so many intricate relationships that i'm not going to go there now because you would say hey go back to the fluctus
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 889.22 896.02 <o,f0,male> circle of fifths acoustic harmony geometric symmetry i knew those two were related once again the cartesian kind of
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 896.83 904.30 <o,f0,male> so i said if i'm going to put a circle see what kind of patterns i get boom the red system look at that you can't just make this stuff
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 919.61 929.40 <o,f0,female> you'll see over here these are multiples of the number twenty seven and they recapitulate that shape even though that's a circle of nine and that's a circle of thirty six
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 948.17 949.15 <o,f0,female> make that stuff
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 952.04 953.21 <o,f0,female> of a tree ladies and gentlemen
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 957.26 961.10 <o,f0,female> here at ted why because this is the place if aliens land i hope they come here
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 966.83 976.72 <o,f0,male> last year i have found these subsequent systems which allow for the mathematic possibilities of the calabi yau manifolds in a way that doesn't necesitate these little
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 976.99 984.74 <o,f0,male> hidden dimensions which works mathematically but it just doesn't seem god like to me it just seems like it's not sexy and elegant it's hidden i don't want hidden
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 994.96 997.94 <o,f0,female> is like crazy am i the only one that sees this
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 1003.67 1014.39 <o,f0,female> i didn't just draw this in a day by the way you know try making some charts like this at home you gotta be accurate there's measurement involved increments these are maps by the way not stamps but one day
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 1017.43 1028.50 <o,f0,male> punch golden ratio it's crazy and look at this built within it is the golden ratio i start looking at that and look at them again they start looking like planets i go to
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 1041.84 1042.60 <o,f0,male> was right
CharlesFleischer_2005 1 CharlesFleischer_2005 1058.13 1059.50 <o,f0,male> days in a year
