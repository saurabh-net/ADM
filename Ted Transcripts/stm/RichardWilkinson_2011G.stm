RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 16.69 36.12 <o,f0,male> the truth of what i 'm going to say i think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive has been around since before the french revolution what 's changed is we now can look at the evidence we can compare societies more and less equal societies and see what inequality does
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 36.3 54.13 <o,f0,male> i 'm going to take you through that data and then explain why the links i 'm going to be showing you exist but first see what a miserable lot we are laughter i want to start though with a paradox
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 54.16 70.4 <o,f0,male> this shows you life expectancy against gross national income how rich countries are on average and you see the countries on the right like norway and the usa are twice as rich as israel greece portugal on the left
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 70.4 76.93 <o,f0,male> and it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all there 's no suggestion of a relationship there
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 76.93 92.44 <o,f0,male> but if we look within our societies there are extraordinary social gradients in health running right across society this again is life expectancy these are small areas of england and wales the poorest on the right the richest on the left
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 97.95 100.65 <o,f0,male> have less good health than the people at the top
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 100.78 105.77 <o,f0,male> so income means something very important within our societies
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 105.9 107.45 <o,f0,male> and nothing between them
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 108.23 115.2 <o,f0,male> the explanation of that paradox is that within our societies we 're looking at relative income
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 115.61 123.75 <o,f0,male> or social position social status where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 124.28 126.66 <o,f0,male> and as soon as you 've got that idea
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 127.12 135.68 <o,f0,male> you should immediately wonder what happens if we widen the differences or compress them make the income differences bigger or smaller
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 136.01 137.89 <o,f0,male> and that 's what i 'm going to show you
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 137.89 149.11 <o,f0,male> i 'm not using any hypothetical data i 'm taking data from the u n it 's the same as the world bank has on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 149.11 163.47 <o,f0,male> the measure we 've used because it 's easy to understand and you can download it is how much richer the top twenty percent than the bottom twenty percent in each country and you see in the more equal countries on the left japan finland norway sweden
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 163.47 178.19 <o,f0,male> the top twenty percent are about three and a half four times as rich as the bottom twenty percent but on the more unequal end u k portugal usa singapore the differences are twice as big on that measure we are twice as unequal
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 178.2 182.41 <o,f0,male> as some of the other successful market democracies
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 182.75 186.72 <o,f0,male> now i 'm going to show you what that does to our societies
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 186.74 194.18 <o,f0,male> we collected data on problems with social gradients the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 194.18 202.25 <o,f0,male> internationally comparable data on life expectancy on kids maths and literacy scores on infant mortality rates homicide rates
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 202.25 216.04 <o,f0,male> proportion of the population in prison teenage birthrates levels of trust obesity mental illness which in standard diagnostic classification includes drug and alcohol addiction and social
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 229.3 232.47 <o,f0,male> which i shall use over and over again in the data
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 233.1 238.64 <o,f0,male> the more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 251.59 253.4 <o,f0,male> no correlation anymore
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 255.03 270.17 <o,f0,male> we were a little bit worried that people might think we 'd been choosing problems to suit our argument and just manufactured this evidence so we also did a paper in the british medical journal on the unicef index of child well being
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 270.2 287.84 <o,f0,male> it has forty different components put together by other people it contains whether kids can talk to their parents whether they have books at home what immunization rates are like whether there 's bullying at school everything goes into it here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 287.84 294.48 <o,f0,male> kids do worse in the more unequal societies highly significant relationship
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 301.84 305.71 <o,f0,male> there 's no relationship no suggestion of a relationship
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 306.86 315.96 <o,f0,male> what all the data i 've shown you so far says is the same thing the average well being of our societies is not dependent any longer
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 316.37 323.65 <o,f0,male> on national income and economic growth that 's very important in poorer countries but not in the rich developed world
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 323.98 330.83 <o,f0,male> but the differences between us and where we are in relation to each other now matter very much
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 330.83 344.96 <o,f0,male> i 'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index here for instance is trust it 's simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted it comes from the world values survey you see at the more unequal end
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 344.96 354.62 <o,f0,male> it 's about fifteen percent of the population who feel they can trust others but in the more equal societies it rises to sixty or sixty five percent
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 355.84 360.74 <o,f0,male> and if you look at measures of involvement in community life or social capital
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 360.96 365.7 <o,f0,male> very similar relationships closely related to inequality
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 365.7 371.75 <o,f0,male> i may say we did all this work twice we did it first on these rich developed countries
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 371.75 388.3 <o,f0,male> and then as a separate test bed we repeated it all on the fifty american states asking just the same question do the more unequal states do worse on all these kinds of measures so here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government related to inequality
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 388.3 403.16 <o,f0,male> very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust same thing is going on basically we found that almost anything that 's related to trust internationally is related to trust amongst the fifty states in that separate test bed
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 418.86 423.51 <o,f0,male> this is the percent of the population with any mental illness in the preceding year
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 423.51 437.54 <o,f0,male> and it goes from about eight percent up to three times that whole societies with three times the level of mental illness of others and again closely related to inequality
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 437.54 451.6 <o,f0,male> this is violence these red dots are american states and the blue triangles are canadian provinces but look at the scale of the differences it goes from fifteen homicides per million
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 458.31 477.17 <o,f0,male> there 's a about a tenfold difference there log scale up the side but it goes from about forty to four hundred people in prison that relationship is not mainly driven by more crime in some places that 's part of it but most of it is about more punitive sentencing
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 477.18 484.33 <o,f0,male> harsher sentencing and the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 484.33 499.61 <o,f0,male> here we have children dropping out of high school again quite big differences extraordinarily damaging if you 're talking about using the talents of the population this is social mobility
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 499.78 512.29 <o,f0,male> it 's actually a measure of mobility based on income basically it 's asking do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons or is there no relationship between the two
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 512.29 527.84 <o,f0,male> and at the more unequal end fathers income is much more important in the u k usa and in scandinavian countries fathers income is much less important there 's more social mobility
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 527.84 537.44 <o,f0,male> and as we like to say and i know there are a lot of americans in the audience here if americans want to live the american dream they should go to denmark
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 543.06 559.69 <o,f0,male> i 've shown you just a few things in italics here i could have shown a number of other problems they 're all problems that tend to be more common at the bottom of the social gradient but there are endless problems with social gradients that are worse in more unequal countries
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 565.01 569.08 <o,f0,male> think of the expense the human cost of that
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 569.08 584.87 <o,f0,male> i want to go back though to this graph that i showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points one is that in graph after graph we find the countries that do worse whatever the outcome seem to be the more unequal ones
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 584.87 598.6 <o,f0,male> and the ones that do well seem to be the nordic countries and japan so what we 're looking at is general social disfunction related to inequality it 's not just one or two things that go wrong it 's most things
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 598.6 605.16 <o,f0,male> the other really important point i want to make on this graph is that if you look at the bottom sweden and japan
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 617.18 631.92 <o,f0,male> but another really important difference is how they get their greater equality sweden has huge differences in earnings and it narrows the gap through taxation general welfare state generous benefits and so on
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 631.92 641.18 <o,f0,male> japan is rather different though it starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax it has lower taxes it has a smaller welfare state
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 641.18 659.98 <o,f0,male> and in our analysis of the american states we find rather the same contrast there are some states that do well through redistribution some states that do well because they have smaller income differences before tax so we conclude that it doesn 't much matter how you get your greater equality as long as you get there somehow
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 660.27 667.95 <o,f0,male> i am not talking about perfect equality i 'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 667.95 678.72 <o,f0,male> another really surprising part of this picture is that it 's not just the poor who are affected by inequality
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 683.12 692.83 <o,f0,male> and in a number of studies it 's possible to compare how people do in more and less equal countries at each level in the social hierarchy
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 692.83 706.41 <o,f0,male> this is just one example it 's infant mortality some swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths according to the british register of general socioeconomic classification and so
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 706.42 723.33 <o,f0,male> it 's anachronistically a classification by fathers occupations so single parents go on their own but then where it says low social class that 's unskilled manual occupations it goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle then the
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 723.33 729.66 <o,f0,male> junior non manual going up high to the professional occupations doctors lawyers
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 739.31 743.56 <o,f0,male> the biggest differences are at the bottom of society but even at the top
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 747.84 767.83 <o,f0,male> we show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the united states and internationally and that seems to be the general picture that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom but has some benefits even at the top but i should say a few words about what 's going on
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 768.46 781.32 <o,f0,male> i think i 'm looking and talking about the psychosocial effects of inequality more to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority of being valued and devalued respected and disrespected
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 781.32 789.36 <o,f0,male> and of course those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 789.36 801.61 <o,f0,male> it also leads to status insecurity we worry more about how we 're judged and seen by others whether we 're regarded as attractive clever all that kind of thing
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 801.86 810.23 <o,f0,male> the social evaluative judgments increase the fear of those social evaluative judgments
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 810.23 829.68 <o,f0,male> interestingly some parallel work going on in social psychology some people reviewed two hundred and eight different studies in which volunteers had been invited into a psychological laboratory and had their stress hormones their responses to doing stressful tasks measured
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 829.68 840.63 <o,f0,male> and in the review what they were interested in seeing is what kind of stresses most reliably raise levels of cortisol the central stress hormone
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 840.63 859.82 <o,f0,male> and the conclusion was it was tasks that included social evaluative threat threats to self esteem or social status in which others can negatively judge your performance those kind of stresses have a very particular effect on the physiology of stress
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 859.82 865.68 <o,f0,male> now we have been criticized of course there are people who dislike this stuff
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 882.75 895.74 <o,f0,male> our data source decides whether it 's reliable data we don 't otherwise that would introduce bias what about other countries there are two hundred studies
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 895.74 912.96 <o,f0,male> of health in relation to income and equality in the academic peer reviewed journals this isn 't confined to these countries here hiding a very simple demonstration the same countries the same measure of inequality one problem after another
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 914.5 930.13 <o,f0,male> why don 't we control for other factors well we 've shown you that gnp per capita doesn 't make any difference and of course others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 930.17 947.53 <o,f0,male> what about causality correlation in itself doesn 't prove causality we spend a good bit of time and indeed people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes the big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health in the rich developed world
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 947.53 952.26 <o,f0,male> is how important chronic stress from social sources
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 952.26 955.7 <o,f0,male> affecting the immune system the cardiovascular system
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 956.62 963.85 <o,f0,male> or for instance the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 984.1 986.8 <o,f0,male> i think the take home message though
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 987.28 991.82 <o,f0,male> is that we can improve the real quality of human life
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 991.9 1000.63 <o,f0,male> by reducing the differences in incomes between us suddenly we have a handle on the psychosocial well being of whole societies and that 's exciting
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 1000.72 1002.83 <o,f0,female> thank you
