GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 16.72 17.35 <o,f0,male> i have a
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 21.69 29.45 <o,f0,male> doctor gero is a brilliant but slightly mad scientist in the doctoragonball z android saga
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 29.74 36.59 <o,f0,male> if you look very carefully you see that his skull has been replaced with a transparent plexiglas dome
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 37.06 47.27 <o,f0,male> so that the workings of his brain can be observed and also controlled with light that's exactly what i do optical mind control
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 48.78 60.38 <o,f0,male> but in contrast to my evil twin who lusts after world domination my motives are not sinister i control the brain in order to understand how it works
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 61.10 71.35 <o,f0,male> now wait a minute you may say how can you go straight to controlling the brain without understanding it first isn't that putting the cart before the horse
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 72.29 80.47 <o,f0,male> many neuroscientists agree with this view and think that understanding will come from more detailed observation and analysis
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 80.97 87.00 <o,f0,male> they say if we could record the activity of our neurons we would understand the brain
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 87.66 94.66 <o,f0,male> but think for a moment what that means even if we could measure what every cell is doing at all times
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 95.06 104.18 <o,f0,male> would still have to make sense of the recorded activity patterns and that's so difficult chances are we'll understand these patterns just as little as the brains that
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 106.03 113.79 <o,f0,male> take a look at what brain activity might look like in this simulation each black dot is one nerve cell the dot is visible
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 114.26 123.97 <o,f0,male> a cell fires an electrical impulse there's ten thousand neurons here so you've looking at roughly one percent of the brain of a cockroach
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 124.86 133.50 <o,f0,male> your brains are about one hundred million times more complicated somewhere is a pattern like this is you
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 134.33 144.49 <o,f0,male> your perceptions your emotions your memories your plans for the future but we don't know where since we don't know how to read the
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 145.88 152.99 <o,f0,male> we don't understand the code used by the brain to make progress we need to break the code but how
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 156.73 163.43 <o,f0,male> will tell you that in order to figure out what the symbols in a code mean it's essential to be able to play with them to
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 164.37 174.98 <o,f0,female> will so in this situation too to decode the information contained in patterns like this watching alone won 't do we need to rearrange the
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 176.24 185.62 <o,f0,female> in other words instead of recording the activity of neurons we need to control it it's not essential that we can control the activity of all neurons in the brain
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 185.98 196.79 <o,f0,female> just some the more targeted our interventions the better and i'll show you in a moment how we can achieve the necessary precision and since i'm realistic rather than grandiose i don't claim
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 196.96 204.32 <o,f0,female> that the ability to control the function of the nervous system will at once unravel all its mysteries but we'll certainly learn
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 208.29 220.63 <o,f0,female> now i'm by no means the first person to realize how powerful a tool intervention is the history of attempts to tinker with the function of the nervous system is long and illustrious
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 221.12 227.88 <o,f0,female> it dates back at least two hundred years to galvani 's famous experiments in the late eighteenth century
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 229.85 236.02 <o,f0,female> galvani showed that a frog 's legs twitched when he connected the lumbar nerve to a source of electrical current
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 237.80 247.47 <o,f0,female> this experiment revealed the first and perhaps most fundamental nugget of the neural code that information is written in the form of electrical impulses
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 258.39 269.67 <o,f0,female> sticking wires into the brain is obviously rather crude it's hard to do in animals that run around and there is a physical limit to the number of wires that can be inserted simultaneously
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 270.99 279.62 <o,f0,female> so around the turn of the last century i started to think wouldn't it be wonderful if one could take this logic and turn it upside down
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 280.21 286.90 <o,f0,female> so instead of inserting a wire into one spot of the brain re engineer the brain itself
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 287.35 294.69 <o,f0,female> so that some of its neural elements become responsive to diffusely broadcast signals such as a flash of light
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 295.67 306.82 <o,f0,female> such an approach would literally in a flash of light overcome many of the obstacles to discovery first it's clearly a non invasive wireless form of communication
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 307.41 320.58 <o,f0,female> and second just as in a radio broadcast you can communicate with many receivers at once you don't need to know where these receivers are and it doesn't matter if these receivers move just think of the stereo in your car
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 321.36 329.61 <o,f0,female> it gets even better for it turns out that we can fabricate the receivers out of materials that are encoded in dna
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 330.51 339.30 <o,f0,female> each nerve cell with the right genetic makeup will spontaneously produce a receiver that allows us to control its function
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 339.95 350.85 <o,f0,female> i hope you'll appreciate the beautiful simplicity of this concept there's no high tech gizmos here just biology revealed through biology
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 351.66 361.43 <o,f0,female> now let 's take a look at these miraculous receivers up close as we zoom in on one of these purple neurons we see that its outer membrane is studded with microscopic pores
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 362.02 373.57 <o,f0,female> like these conduct electrical current and are responsible for all the communication in the nervous system but these pores here are special they are coupled to light receptors similar to the ones in your eyes
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 374.43 388.31 <o,f0,female> a flash of light hits the receptor the pore opens and electrical current is switched on and the neuron fires electrical impulses because the light activated pore is encoded in dna we can achieve incredible precision
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 388.92 398.62 <o,f0,female> this is because although each cell in our bodies contains the same set of genes different mixes of genes get turned on and off in different cells
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 399.10 406.64 <o,f0,female> you can exploit this to make sure that only some neurons contain our light activated pore and others don 't so in this cartoon
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 406.80 414.20 <o,f0,female> the bluish white cell in the upper left corner does not respond to light because it lacks the light activated pore
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 414.90 427.78 <o,f0,female> the approach works so well that we can write purely artificial messages directly to the brain in this example each electrical impulse each deflection on the trace is caused by a brief pulse of light
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 428.45 437.36 <o,f0,female> and the approach also works in moving behaving animals this is the first ever such experiment sort of the optical equivalent of
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 438.93 446.70 <o,f0,female> it was done six or seven years ago by my then graduate student susana lima susana had engineered the fruit fly on the left
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 447.17 457.34 <o,f0,female> so that just two out of the two hundred thousand cells in its brain expressed the light activated pore you're familiar with these cells because they are the ones that frustrate you
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 457.53 465.83 <o,f0,female> when you try to swat the fly they trained the escape reflex that makes the fly jump into the air and fly away whenever you move your hand in position
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 466.30 477.86 <o,f0,female> and you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect the animal jumps it spreads its wings it vibrates them but it can't actually take off because the fly is sandwiched between two glass plates
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 478.72 490.56 <o,f0,female> now to make sure that this was no reaction of the fly to a flash it could see susana did a simple but brutally effective experiment she cut the heads off of her flies
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 499.08 505.42 <o,f0,female> stand around and groom excessively so it seems that the only trait that survives decapitation is
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 510.57 512.42 <o,f0,female> anyway as you'll see in a moment
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 527.58 539.26 <o,f0,female> they didn't get very far obviously since we took these first steps the field of optogenetics has exploded and there is now hundreds of labs using these approaches
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 539.83 545.53 <o,f0,female> and we've come a long way since galvani 's and susana 's first successes in making animals
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 547.10 556.27 <o,f0,female> we can now actually interfere with their psychology in rather profound ways as i'll show you in my last example which is directed at a familiar question
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 557.07 565.01 <o,f0,female> life is a string of choices creating a constant pressure to decide what to do next we cope with this pressure
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 565.48 571.85 <o,f0,female> having brains and within our brains decision making centers that i've called here the
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 588.43 598.42 <o,f0,female> now to put some neurobiological meat on this abstract model we constructed a simple one dimensional world for our favorite subject fruit flies
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 598.91 611.11 <o,f0,female> each chamber in these two vertical stacks contains one fly the left and the right halves of the chamber are filled with two different odors and a security camera watches as the flies pace up and down
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 612.84 621.61 <o,f0,female> here 's some such cctv footage whenever a fly reaches the midpoint of the chamber where the two odor streams meet it has to make a decision
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 622.13 629.40 <o,f0,female> it has to decide whether to turn around and stay in the same odor or whether to cross the mid line and try something new
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 630.28 639.52 <o,f0,female> these decisions are clearly a reflection of the actor 's policy now for an intelligent being like our fly
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 640.02 650.34 <o,f0,female> this policy is not written in stone but rather changes as the animal learns from experience we can incorporate such an element of adaptive intelligence into our model
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 650.79 659.66 <o,f0,female> by assuming that the fly 's brain contains not only an actor but a different group of cells a critic that provides a running commentary
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 659.89 668.30 <o,f0,female> on the actor 's choices you can think of this nagging inner voice as sort of the brain 's equivalent of the catholic church
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 669.45 675.93 <o,f0,female> an austrian like me or the superego if you're freudian or your mother
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 681.14 681.67 <o,f0,female> now obviously
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 694.26 701.96 <o,f0,female> the logic of our experiment was simple we thought if we could use our optical remote control to activate the cells of the critic
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 716.42 727.01 <o,f0,female> so we bred flies whose brains were more or less randomly peppered with cells that were light addressable and then we took these flies and allowed them to make choices
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 727.68 735.21 <o,f0,female> they made one of the two choices chose one odor in this case the blue one over the orange one we switched on the lights
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 735.63 746.55 <o,f0,female> if the critic was among the optically activated cells the result of this intervention should be a change in policy the fly should learn to avoid the optically reinforced
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 747.77 757.54 <o,f0,female> here 's what happened in two instances we're comparing two strains of flies each of them having about one hundred light addressable cells in their brains
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 757.88 765.68 <o,f0,female> shown here in green on the left and on the right what's common among these groups of cells is that they all produce the neurotransmitter
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 766.94 773.85 <o,f0,female> but the identities of the individual dopamine producing neurons are clearly largely different on the left and on the right
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 782.17 788.47 <o,f0,female> if you look first at the behavior of the fly on the right you can see that whenever it reaches the midpoint of the chamber
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 790.16 798.69 <o,f0,female> it marches straight through as it did before its behavior is completely unchanged but the behavior of the fly on the left is very different
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 799.33 806.77 <o,f0,female> it comes up to the midpoint it pauses it carefully scans the odor interface as if it was sniffing out
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 807.98 819.99 <o,f0,female> and then it turns around this means that the policy that the actor implements now includes an instruction to avoid the odor that's in the right half of the chamber this means that the critic must have spoken in
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 830.40 838.02 <o,f0,female> through many such experiments we were able to narrow down the identity of the critic to just twelve cells
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 838.72 846.88 <o,f0,female> these twelve cells as shown here in green they send the output to a brain structure called the mushroom body which is here in
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 847.78 860.78 <o,f0,female> we know from our formal model that the brain structure at the receiving end of the critic 's commentary is the actor so this anatomy suggests that the mushroom bodies have something to do with action choice
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 885.09 894.08 <o,f0,female> are wired to sensors that detect the presence of odorous molecules in the air each odor activates a different combination of sensors
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 894.35 901.32 <o,f0,female> which in turn activates a different odor detector in the mushroom body so the pilot in the cockpit of the fly
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 903.01 913.06 <o,f0,female> can tell which odor is present simply by looking at which of the blue led 's lights up what the actor does with this information depends on its policy
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 913.47 921.77 <o,f0,female> which is stored in the strengths of the connection between the odor detectors and the motors that power the fly 's evasive actions
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 922.34 930.31 <o,f0,female> if the connection is weak the motors will stay off and the fly will continue straight on its course if the connection is strong the motors will turn on
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 930.61 939.54 <o,f0,female> and the fly will initiate a turn now consider a situation in which the motors stay off the fly continues on its path
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 940.51 952.19 <o,f0,female> and it suffers some painful consequence such as getting zapped in a situation like this we would expect the critic to speak up and to tell the actor to change its policy
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 952.91 965.39 <o,f0,female> we have created such a situation artificially by turning on the critic with a flash of light that caused a strengthening of the connections between the currently active odor detector and the
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 966.51 976.39 <o,f0,female> so the next time the fly finds itself facing the same odor again the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors and to trigger an evasive
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 980.16 987.87 <o,f0,female> i don't know about you but i find it exhilarating to see how vague psychological notions
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 989.41 998.53 <o,f0,female> and give rise to a physical mechanistic understanding of the mind even if it's the mind of the fly this is one piece of good news
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 999.48 1011.13 <o,f0,female> the other piece of good news for a scientist at least is that much remains to be discovered in the experiments i told you about we have lifted the identity of the critic
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1023.08 1031.89 <o,f0,female> some ideas in computer science and in artificial intelligence as to how this might be done but we still haven't solved a single example
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1 GeroMiesenboeck_2010G 1032.88 1044.46 <o,f0,female> of how intelligent behavior springs from the physical interactions in living matter i think we'll get there in the not too distant future thank you
