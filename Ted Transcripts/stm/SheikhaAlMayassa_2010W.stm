SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 15.63 19.69 <o,f0,female> myself and my brother belong to the under thirty demographic
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 19.7 26.34 <o,f0,female> which pat said makes seventy percent but according to our statistics it makes sixty percent of the region 's population
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 32.06 40.12 <o,f0,female> we have been reminiscing about the latest technologies and the ipods and for me the abaya my traditional dress that i 'm wearing today
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 40.41 51.97 <o,f0,female> now this is not a religious garment nor is it a religious statement instead it 's a diverse cultural statement that we choose to wear now i remember a few years ago
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 63.56 74.83 <o,f0,female> her answer was quite the contrary instead she felt more free more free because she could wear whatever she wanted under the abaya she could come to work in her pajamas and nobody would care
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 93.57 103.34 <o,f0,female> we know that modernization is happening and yes qatar wants to be a modern nation but at the same time we are reconnecting and reasserting our arab heritage
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 103.34 117.65 <o,f0,female> it 's important for us to grow organically and we continuously make the conscious decision to reach that balance in fact research has shown that the more the world is flat if i use tom friedman 's analogy or global
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 117.72 127.12 <o,f0,female> the more and more people are wanting to be different and for us young people they 're looking to become individuals and find their differences amongst themselves
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 127.12 138.36 <o,f0,female> which is why i prefer the richard wilk analogy of globalizing the local and localizing the global we don 't want to be all the same but we want to respect each other and understand each other
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 138.36 142.91 <o,f0,female> and therefore tradition becomes more important not less important
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 162.6 165.23 <o,f0,female> i 'm a representation of that phenomenon
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 165.53 184.74 <o,f0,female> and i think a lot of people in this room i can see a lot of you are in the same position as myself and i 'm sure although we can 't see the people in washington they are in the same position we 're continuously trying to straddle different worlds different cultures and trying to meet the challenges of a different expectation from ourselves and from others
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 184.74 189.66 <o,f0,female> so i want to ask a question what should culture in the twenty first century look like
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 189.86 204.89 <o,f0,female> in a time where the world is becoming personalized when the mobile phone the burger the telephone everything has its own personal identity how should we perceive ourselves and how should we perceive others how does that impact our desert culture
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 205.02 222.8 <o,f0,female> i 'm not sure of how many of you in washington are aware of the cultural developments happening in the region and the more recent museum of islamic art opened in qatar in two thousand and eight i myself am personalizing these cultural developments but i also understand that this has to be done organically
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 222.91 239.21 <o,f0,female> yes we do have all the resources that we need in order to develop new cultural institutions but what i think is more important is that we are very fortunate to have visionary leaders who understand that this can 't happen from outside it has to come from within
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 247.92 250.65 <o,f0,female> i want to ask you why do you think this is
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 251.17 265.94 <o,f0,female> is it because it 's a soft option we have nothing else to do no i don 't think so i think that women in this part of the world realize that culture is an important component to connect people both locally and regionally
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 265.94 281.45 <o,f0,female> it 's a natural component for bringing people together discussing ideas in the same way we 're doing here at ted we 're here we 're part of a community sharing out ideas and discussing them art becomes a very important part of our national identity
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 281.53 285.42 <o,f0,female> the existential and social and political impact
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 285.97 291.68 <o,f0,female> an artist has on his nation 's development of cultural identity is very important
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 310.06 316.18 <o,f0,female> for their future generations it 's very important to maintain our cultural identities
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 316.48 333.83 <o,f0,female> why else do greeks demand the return of the elgin marbles and why is there an uproar when a private collector tries to sell his collection to a foreign museum why does it take me months on end to get an export license from london or new york in order to get pieces into my country
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 345.96 356.54 <o,f0,female> instead she tries to engage in a very important dialogue about her culture nation and heritage she does that through important visual forms of photography and film
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 373.9 379.29 <o,f0,female> create an open dialogue so that we share our ideas and share yours with us
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 379.29 384.28 <o,f0,female> in a few days we will be opening the arab museum of modern art
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 384.28 403.42 <o,f0,female> we have done extensive research to ensure that arab and muslim artists and arabs who are not muslims not all arabs are muslims by the way but we make sure that they are represented in this new institution this institution is government backed and it has been the case for the past three decades
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 403.48 410.41 <o,f0,female> we will open the museum in a few days and i welcome all of you to get on qatar airways and come and join us
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 413.13 416.54 <o,f0,female> now this museum is just as important to us as the west
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 442.77 448.68 <o,f0,female> now visual expression is just one form of culture integration
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 448.68 465.35 <o,f0,female> we have realized that recently more and more people are using the means of youtube and social networking to express their stories share their photos and tell their own stories through their own voices in a similar way we have created the doha film institute
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 465.41 483.53 <o,f0,female> now the doha film institute is an organization to teach people about film and filmmaking last year we didn 't have one qatari woman filmmaker today i am proud to say we have trained and educated over sixty six qatari women filmmakers to edit tell their own stories in their own voices
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 489.95 492.7 <o,f0,female> if you 'll allow me i would love to share a one minute film
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 492.71 502.08 <o,f0,female> that has proven to show that a sixty sec film can be as powerful as a haiku in telling a big picture and this is one of our filmmakers products
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 564.64 566.67 <o,f0,female> it 's important for two things
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 566.75 574.65 <o,f0,female> first it allows us to showcase our arab filmmakers and voices to one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world new york city
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 597.84 605.3 <o,f0,female> no not the soft option that we have discussed before but rather the soft power that joseph nye has spoken about before
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 605.58 611.33 <o,f0,female> culture 's a very important tool to bring people together we should not underestimate
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 627.63 638.78 <o,f0,female> this is a very interesting journey i welcome you on board for us to engage and discuss new ideas of how to bring people together through cultural initiatives and discussions
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 1 SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W 642.86 645.27 <o,f0,female> ladies and gentlemen thank you very much
