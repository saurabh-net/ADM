AdamOstrow_2011G 1 AdamOstrow_2011G 52.47 56.71 <o,f0,male> he said here it is i 'm dead and this is my last post to my blog
AdamOstrow_2011G 1 AdamOstrow_2011G 56.71 69.45 <o,f0,male> in advance i asked that once my body finally shut down from the punishments of my cancer then my family and friends publish this prepared message i wrote the first part of the process of turning this from an active website to an archive
AdamOstrow_2011G 1 AdamOstrow_2011G 69.45 85.29 <o,f0,male> now while as a journalist miller 's archive may have been better written and more carefully curated than most the fact of the matter is that all of us today are creating an archive that 's something completely different than anything that 's been created by any previous generation
AdamOstrow_2011G 1 AdamOstrow_2011G 85.29 102.8 <o,f0,male> consider a few stats for a moment right now there are forty eight hours of video being uploaded to youtube every single minute there are two hundred million tweets being posted every day and the average facebook user is creating ninety pieces of content each month
AdamOstrow_2011G 1 AdamOstrow_2011G 102.8 113.33 <o,f0,male> so when you think about your parents or your grandparents at best they may have created some photos or home videos or a diary that lives in a box somewhere
AdamOstrow_2011G 1 AdamOstrow_2011G 113.33 125.4 <o,f0,male> but today we 're all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that 's going to live in the cloud indefinitely years after we 're gone and i think that 's going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities for technologists
AdamOstrow_2011G 1 AdamOstrow_2011G 125.4 133.98 <o,f0,male> now to be clear i 'm a journalist and not a technologist so what i 'd like to do briefly is paint a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like
AdamOstrow_2011G 1 AdamOstrow_2011G 133.98 151.26 <o,f0,male> now we 're already seeing some services that are designed to let us decide what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts after we die one of them actually fittingly enough found me when i checked into a deli at a restaurant in new york on foursquare
AdamOstrow_2011G 1 AdamOstrow_2011G 164.01 166.39 <o,f0,male> the
AdamOstrow_2011G 1 AdamOstrow_2011G 182.51 196.85 <o,f0,male> another service right now is called one thousand memories and what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die but what i think comes next is far more interesting
AdamOstrow_2011G 1 AdamOstrow_2011G 196.85 206.01 <o,f0,male> now a lot of you are probably familiar with deb roy who back in march demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than ninety thousand hours of home video
AdamOstrow_2011G 1 AdamOstrow_2011G 206.01 221.58 <o,f0,male> i think as machines ability to understand human language and process vast amounts of data continues to improve it 's going to become possible to analyze an entire life 's worth of content the tweets the photos the videos the blog posts that we 're producing in such massive numbers
AdamOstrow_2011G 1 AdamOstrow_2011G 221.58 235.59 <o,f0,male> and i think as that happens it 's going to become possible for our digital personas to continue to interact in the real world long after we 're gone thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we 're creating and technology 's ability to make sense of it all
AdamOstrow_2011G 1 AdamOstrow_2011G 235.59 246.6 <o,f0,male> now we 're already starting to see some experiments here one service called my next tweet analyzes your entire twitter stream everything you 've posted onto twitter to make some predictions as to what you might say next
AdamOstrow_2011G 1 AdamOstrow_2011G 246.6 257.52 <o,f0,male> well right now as you can see the results can be somewhat comical you can imagine what something like this might look like five ten or twenty years from now as our technical capabilities improve
AdamOstrow_2011G 1 AdamOstrow_2011G 257.52 273.93 <o,f0,male> taking it a step further mit 's media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans but what if those robots were able to interact based on the unique characteristics of a specific person based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that person produces in their lifetime
AdamOstrow_2011G 1 AdamOstrow_2011G 273.93 287.51 <o,f0,male> finally think back to this famous scene from election night two thousand and eight back in the united states where cnn beamed a live hologram of hip hop artist will i am into their studio for an interview with anderson cooper
AdamOstrow_2011G 1 AdamOstrow_2011G 298.42 307.97 <o,f0,male> i think that 's going to become completely possible as the amount of data we 're producing and technology 's ability to understand it both expand exponentially
AdamOstrow_2011G 1 AdamOstrow_2011G 307.97 319.4 <o,f0,male> now in closing i think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality and if so what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it thank you very much
