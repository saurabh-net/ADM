YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 34.06 36.96 <o,f0,male> as much co two as a frenchman
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 39.22 42.60 <o,f0,male> so what do i have to do i have to kill a frenchman when i come back at home
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 44.92 49.22 <o,f0,male> i have to do my carbon offset in another way like i do every time
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 52.90 58.22 <o,f0,male> in fact my work is to show our impact
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 59.10 59.24 <o,f0,male> on
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 61.56 66.24 <o,f0,male> i'm going to show you some examples of the last pictures i've done in the last year
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 71.74 74.03 <o,f0,male> a lot of pollution
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 74.81 81.23 <o,f0,male> you know the problem we don't want to believe what we know
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 92.47 98.64 <o,f0,male> we know about the end of oil oil sand is not a long term solution
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 99.88 101.32 <o,f0,male> we use three
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 132.32 138.52 <o,f0,male> done this picture last summer it was impossible to do this picture fifteen years ago
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 139.43 144.45 <o,f0,male> now there is a new way open between atlantic and pacific
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 157.96 158.52 <o,f0,male> new
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 162.27 163.09 <o,f0,male> sad picture
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 164.66 170.06 <o,f0,male> eighty percent of its ice according to scientists in one hundred
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 171.29 173.96 <o,f0,male> all the mountain glacier will be
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 175.62 187.20 <o,f0,male> very important for the life on earth like al gore told you two billion people live on the water from the glacier of himalaya return of fish men
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 187.99 198.05 <o,f0,male> one fifth of human kind depend on fish to live today now seventy percent
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 199.59 209.10 <o,f0,male> fish stock are over exploited according to fao if we don't change our system of fishing
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 212.12 218.57 <o,f0,male> in two thousand and fifty we don't want to believe what we know the beautiful picture
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 220.99 231.38 <o,f0,male> in africa one human of six have not enough to eat in the world one billion people have not enough to eat in africa
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 233.65 244.45 <o,f0,male> is one of the main foods in many places here in america ninety percent of the corn cultivated is used to feed animals or to do
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 248.83 255.12 <o,f0,male> in borneo every year we lose fifty thousand square miles in
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 262.79 274.84 <o,f0,male> camp in darfur today we have twenty million refugees in the world according to the u n we speak about two hundred and fifty million refugees in two thousand and fifty
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 279.96 291.57 <o,f0,male> always show my pictures in the street we have done already one hundred exhibitions in the cities but how to understand the world without the voice of people
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 295.54 302.26 <o,f0,male> it was obvious to me to do another work i launched a project named six
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 304.10 312.39 <o,f0,male> i sent around the world six camera men asking the same question the same crucial question about life
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 313.21 317.11 <o,f0,male> we have done five thousand interviews i'm going to show
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 350.77 350.99 <o,f0,male> the
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 359.13 359.32 <o,f0,male> i
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 365.17 367.05 <o,f0,male> i had a big laugh today
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 381.69 383.77 <o,f0,male> go back to iraq and speak to the people
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 390.45 390.75 <o,f0,male> taking
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 393.04 395.07 <o,f0,male> i feel ashamed
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 404.88 406.33 <o,f0,male> make reparations to

YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 467.64 481.01 <o,f0,male> years now of being in a wheelchair i've done more in life being in a chair than out of a chair i still surf i sail the world i freedive after many people said i couldn't do that
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 483.51 493.05 <o,f0,male> and i think that comes from connecting with nature connecting with the energy of life because we're all disabled in some way on the planet spiritually mentally
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 495.29 496.55 <o,f0,male> i got the easy part
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 506.91 507.24 <o,f0,female> say that

YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 566.20 573.98 <o,f0,male> the name of the movie is home maison it is about the state of the planet
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 575.15 581.23 <o,f0,male> a fantastic story of life on the earth i'm very proud to
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 590.09 590.98 <o,f0,male> four and a half
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 595.33 597.24 <o,f0,male> these plants several hundred
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 597.81 605.77 <o,f0,male> years old and we humans have been walking upright for only two hundred thousand
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 608.09 611.24 <o,f0,male> we've managed to adapt and have conquered the whole planet
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 617.13 620.65 <o,f0,male> raising our children not unlike millions of other species living
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 624.63 629.57 <o,f0,male> for the past thirty years i've been closely watching the earth and its dwellers from
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 633.14 638.17 <o,f0,male> to the wellbeing of our planet we depend on water
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 639.56 645.50 <o,f0,male> forests deserts oceans
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 653.30 656.57 <o,f0,male> are still the world 's foremost human occupations
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 658.29 663.24 <o,f0,male> and what binds us together is far greater than what divides us
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 676.54 683.17 <o,f0,male> we carry on raising walls to keep us apart today our greatest battle
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 683.37 692.19 <o,f0,male> is to protect the natural offerings of our planet in less than fifty years we've altered it more thoroughly than in the entire history of mankind
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 693.87 700.93 <o,f0,male> of the world 's forests have vanished water resources are running low intensive farming is depleting soils
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 703.28 705.68 <o,f0,male> energy sources are not sustainable
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 706.26 710.29 <o,f0,male> the climate is changing we are endangering ourselves
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 711.30 712.99 <o,f0,male> we're only trying to improve our lives
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 714.70 716.74 <o,f0,male> the wealth gaps are growing
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 717.76 723.20 <o,f0,male> we haven't yet understood that we're going at a much faster pace than the planet
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 750.74 752.83 <o,f0,male> the power to change this
YannArthusBertrand_2009 1 YannArthusBertrand_2009 760.46 761.18 <o,f0,male> what are we
