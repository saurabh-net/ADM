JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 31.74 36.55 <o,f0,male> let 's first visit our planet but at night and from space
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 36.55 55.54 <o,f0,male> this is what our planet looks like from outer space at nighttime if you were to take a satellite and travel around the planet and the thing you would notice first of course is how dominant the human presence on our planet is we see cities we see oil fields you can even make out fishing fleets in the sea
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 55.54 61.72 <o,f0,male> that we are dominating much of our planet and mostly through the use of energy that we see here at night
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 61.72 76.7 <o,f0,male> but let 's go back and drop it a little deeper and look during the daytime what we see during the day is our landscapes this is part of the amazon basin a place called rondonia in the south center part of the brazilian amazon
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 100.24 116.3 <o,f0,male> these cows are used for beef we 're going to eat these cows and these cows are eaten basically in south america in brazil and argentina they 're not being shipped up here but this kind of fishbone pattern of deforestation is something we notice a lot of around the tropics especially in this part of the world
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 116.3 133.74 <o,f0,male> if we go a little bit further south in our little tour of the world we can go to the bolivian edge of the amazon here also in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five and if you look really carefully there 's a thin white line through that kind of seam and there 's a lone farmer out there in the middle of the primeval jungle
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 133.74 138.31 <o,f0,male> let 's come back again a few years later here in two thousand and three
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 138.31 147.58 <o,f0,male> and we 'll see that that landscape actually looks a lot more like iowa than it does like a rainforest in fact what you 're seeing here are soybean fields
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 147.58 164.55 <o,f0,male> these soybeans are being shipped to europe and to china as animal feed especially after the mad cow disease scare about a decade ago where we don 't want to feed animals animal protein anymore because that can transmit disease instead we want to feed them more vegetable proteins so soybeans have really exploded
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 164.55 175.31 <o,f0,male> showing how trade and globalization are really responsible for the connections to rainforests and the amazon an incredibly strange and interconnected world that we have today
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 175.31 188.71 <o,f0,male> well again and again what we find as we look around the world in our little tour of the world is that landscape after landscape after landscape have been cleared and altered for growing food and other crops
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 188.71 198.18 <o,f0,male> so one of the questions we 've been asking is how much of the world is used to grow food and where is it exactly and how can we change that into the future and what does it mean
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 198.18 214.86 <o,f0,male> well our team has been looking at this on a global scale using satellite data and ground based data kind of to track farming on a global scale and this is what we found and it 's startling this map shows the presence of agriculture on planet earth
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 214.86 230.27 <o,f0,male> the green areas are the areas we use to grow crops like wheat or soybeans or corn or rice or whatever that 's sixteen million square kilometers worth of land if you put it all together in one place it 'd be the size of south america
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 230.27 240.34 <o,f0,male> the second area in brown is the world 's pastures and rangelands where our animals live that area 's about thirty million square kilometers or about an africa 's worth of land
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 240.34 253.09 <o,f0,male> a huge amount of land and it 's the best land of course is what you see and what 's left is like the middle of the sahara desert or siberia or the middle of a rain forest we 're using a planet 's worth of land already
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 253.09 269.72 <o,f0,male> if we look at this carefully we find it 's about forty percent of the earth 's land surface is devoted to agriculture and it 's sixty times larger than all the areas we complain about our suburban sprawl and our cities where we mostly live half of humanity lives in cities today
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 269.72 273.51 <o,f0,male> but a sixty times larger area is used to grow food
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 273.51 277.57 <o,f0,male> so this is an amazing kind of result and it really shocked us when we looked at that
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 277.57 282.86 <o,f0,male> so we 're using an enormous amount of land for agriculture but also we 're using a lot of water
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 282.86 297.7 <o,f0,male> this is a photograph flying into arizona and when you look at it you 're like what are they growing here it turns out they 're growing lettuce in the middle of the desert using water sprayed on top now the irony is it 's probably sold in our supermarket shelves in the twin cities
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 297.7 312.22 <o,f0,male> but what 's really interesting is this water 's got to come from some place and it comes from here the colorado river in north america well the colorado on a typical day in the one thousand nine hundred and fifty s this is just you know not a flood not a drought kind of an average day it looks something like this
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 312.22 318.79 <o,f0,male> but if we come back today during a normal condition to the exact same location this is what 's left
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 318.79 325.18 <o,f0,male> the difference is mainly irrigating the desert for food or maybe golf courses in scottsdale you take your pick
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 325.18 341.54 <o,f0,male> well this is a lot of water and again we 're mining water and using it to grow food and today if you travel down further down the colorado it dries up completely and no longer flows into the ocean we 've literally consumed an entire river in north america for irrigation
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 346.63 356.43 <o,f0,male> now a lot you will remember this from your geography classes this is in the former soviet union in between kazakhstan and uzbekistan one of the great inland seas of the world
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 356.43 370.25 <o,f0,male> but there 's kind of a paradox here because it looks like it 's surrounded by desert why is this sea here the reason it 's here is because on the right hand side you see two little rivers kind of coming down through the sand feeding this basin with water
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 370.25 379.04 <o,f0,male> those rivers are draining snowmelt from mountains far to the east where snow melts it travels down the river through the desert and forms the great aral sea
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 379.04 392.91 <o,f0,male> well in the one thousand nine hundred and fifty s the soviets decided to divert that water to irrigate the desert to grow cotton believe it or not in kazakhstan to sell cotton to the international markets to bring foreign currency into the soviet union they really needed the money
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 426.08 432.81 <o,f0,male> this is not only a change in water and where the shoreline is this is a change in the fundamentals of the environment of this region
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 445.65 453.59 <o,f0,male> one of those small islands that was remote and impossible to get to was a site of soviet biological weapons testing you can walk there today
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 453.59 461.55 <o,f0,male> weather patterns have changed nineteen of the unique twenty fish species found only in the aral sea are now wiped off the face of the earth
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 461.56 474.89 <o,f0,male> this is an environmental disaster writ large but let 's bring it home this is a picture that al gore gave me a few years ago that he took when he was in the soviet union a long long time ago showing the fishing fleets of the aral sea
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 474.89 493.48 <o,f0,male> you see the canal they dug they were so desperate to try to kind of float the boats into the remaining pools of water but they finally had to give up because the piers and the moorings simply couldn 't keep up with the retreating shoreline i don 't know about you but i 'm terrified that future archaeologists will dig this up and write stories about our time in history and wonder what were you thinking
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 493.48 503.27 <o,f0,male> well that 's the future we have to look forward to we already use about fifty percent of the earth 's fresh water that 's sustainable and agriculture alone is seventy percent of that
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 503.27 510.12 <o,f0,male> so we use a lot of water a lot of land for agriculture we also use a lot of the atmosphere for agriculture
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 510.12 521.86 <o,f0,male> usually when we think about the atmosphere we think about climate change and greenhouse gases and mostly around energy but it turns out agriculture is one of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases too
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 521.86 537.51 <o,f0,male> if you look at carbon dioxide from burning tropical rainforest or methane coming from cows and rice or nitrous oxide from too many fertilizers it turns out agriculture is thirty percent of the greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere from human activity
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 537.51 549.11 <o,f0,male> that 's more than all our transportation it 's more than all our electricity it 's more than all other manufacturing in fact it 's the single largest emitter of greenhouse gases of any human activity in the world
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 549.11 551.61 <o,f0,male> and yet we don 't talk about it very much
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 551.61 561.55 <o,f0,male> so we have this incredible presence today of agriculture dominating our planet whether it 's forty percent of our land surface seventy percent of the water we use
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 561.55 573.67 <o,f0,male> thirty percent of our greenhouse gas emissions we 've doubled the flows of nitrogen and phosphorus around the world simply by using fertilizers causing huge problems of water quality from rivers lakes and even oceans
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 573.67 577.11 <o,f0,male> and it 's also the single biggest driver of biodiversity loss
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 577.11 590.9 <o,f0,male> so without a doubt agriculture is the single most powerful force unleashed on this planet since the end of the ice age no question and it rivals climate change in importance and they 're both happening at the same time
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 590.9 603.88 <o,f0,male> but what 's really important here to remember is that it 's not all bad it 's not that agriculture 's a bad thing in fact we completely depend on it it 's not optional it 's not a luxury it 's an absolute necessity
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 603.88 611.44 <o,f0,male> we have to provide food and feed and yeah fiber and even biofuels to something like seven billion people in the world today
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 611.44 627.52 <o,f0,male> and if anything we 're going to have the demands on agriculture increase into the future it 's not going to go away it 's going to get a lot bigger mainly because of growing population we 're seven billion people today heading towards at least nine probably nine and a half before we 're done
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 627.52 639.78 <o,f0,male> more importantly changing diets as the world becomes wealthier as well as more populous we 're seeing increases in dietary consumption of meat which take a lot more resources than a vegetarian diet does
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 639.78 654.61 <o,f0,male> so more people eating more stuff and richer stuff and of course having an energy crisis at the same time where we have to replace oil with other energy sources that will ultimately have to include some kinds of biofuels and bio energy sources
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 663.51 669 <o,f0,male> well how are we going to do this how are going to double global ag production around the world
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 669 684.14 <o,f0,male> well we could try to farm more land this is an analysis we 've done where on the left is where the crops are today on the right is where they could be based on soils and climate assuming climate change doesn 't disrupt too much of this which is not a good assumption
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 684.14 701.52 <o,f0,male> we could farm more land but the problem is the remaining lands are in sensitive areas they have a lot of biodiversity a lot of carbon things we want to protect so we could grow more food by expanding farmland but we 'd better not because it 's ecologically a very very dangerous thing to do
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 701.52 707.93 <o,f0,male> instead we maybe want to freeze the footprint of agriculture and farm the lands we have better
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 707.93 725.18 <o,f0,male> this is work that we 're doing to try to highlight places in the world where we could improve yields without harming the environment the green areas here show where corn yields just showing corn as an example are already really high probably the maximum you could find on earth today for that climate and soil
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 725.18 741.02 <o,f0,male> but the brown areas and yellow areas are places where we 're only getting maybe twenty or thirty percent of the yield you should be able to get you see a lot of this in africa even latin america but interestingly eastern europe where soviet union and eastern bloc countries used to be is still a mess agriculturally
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 741.02 752.97 <o,f0,male> now this would require nutrients and water it 's going to either be organic or conventional or some mix of the two to deliver that plants need water and nutrients but we can do this and there are opportunities to make this work
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 752.97 767.86 <o,f0,male> but we have to do it in a way that is sensitive to meeting the food security needs of the future and the environmental security needs of the future we have to figure out how to make this tradeoff between growing food and having a healthy environment work better
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 767.86 774.01 <o,f0,male> right now it 's kind of an all or nothing proposition we can grow food in the background that 's a soybean field
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 815.11 821.73 <o,f0,male> and i love silver buckshot you put it together and you 've got something really powerful but we need to put them together
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 821.73 825.94 <o,f0,male> so what we have to do i think is invent a new kind of agriculture
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 844.98 847.41 <o,f0,male> or farming for a whole planet
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 847.41 863.67 <o,f0,male> now having this conversation has been really hard and we 've been trying very hard to bring these key points to people to reduce the controversy to increase the collaboration i want to show you a short video that does kind of show our efforts right now to bring these sides together into a single conversation
