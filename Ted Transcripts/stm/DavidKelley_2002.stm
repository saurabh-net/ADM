DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 28.59 38.12 <o,f0,male> i thought it was interesting to think back to that time when richard got the whole thing started thank you very much richard it's been a big enjoyable part of my life coming here
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 38.74 49.80 <o,f0,male> and so thinking back i was thinking those of us in silicon valley were really focused on products or objects certainly technological objects
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 50.22 58.22 <o,f0,male> and so it was great fun in those days and some of you who are in the audience were my clients we'd come in with some
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 74.63 85.05 <o,f0,male> if you were here last year i probably wrestled you to the floor and tried to show you my new eyemodule two which was a camera that plugged into the handspring
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 85.92 94.45 <o,f0,male> i took a lot of pictures last year very few people knew what i was up to but i took a lot of pictures this year maybe you could show the slides
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 95.29 105.55 <o,f0,male> this year we're carrying this treo which we had a lot to do with and helped handspring design it also though we designed it a few years ago it's just become ubiquitous in the last year or so this
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 113.01 125.58 <o,f0,male> and we're just about to announce the zinio reader product that i believe will make magazines even more enjoyable to read so we really will continue to focus on products but
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 135.27 142.95 <o,f0,male> but for us we've really just started to climb maslow 's hierarchy a little bit
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 143.16 151.52 <o,f0,male> and so we're now focused more and more on human centered design human centeredness in an approach to design
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 152.60 161.68 <o,f0,male> that really involves designing behaviors and personality into products and i think you're starting to see that and it's making our job even more enjoyable
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 164.62 170.76 <o,f0,male> enough we used to primarily build three d models you know you've seen some today and
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 171.69 177.52 <o,f0,male> three d renderings then we'd go and we'd show those as communicating our ideas but firms like ours
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 177.93 186.85 <o,f0,male> having to move to a point where we get those objects that we're designing and get them in motion showing how they'll be used and so
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 187.57 195.44 <o,f0,male> in order to do that we've been forming internal video production groups in order to make these kind of experience prototypes
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 195.77 204.82 <o,f0,male> that show just what we mean about the man machine relationship and it's a much better way to see it's kind of like architects who show people in their houses
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 205.24 214.72 <o,f0,male> as opposed to them being empty so i thought that i would show you a few videos to show off this new broader
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 216.89 226.25 <o,f0,male> definition of design in products and services and environments i have a few of them they're no more than a minute or a minute and a half apiece
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 226.70 233.15 <o,f0,male> but i thought you might be interested in seeing some of our work over the last year and how it responds in video
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 234.41 243.24 <o,f0,male> so prada new york we were asked by rem koolhaas and oma to help us conceive the technology that's in their retail store in new york
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 243.96 250.40 <o,f0,male> he wanted a new kind of store a new one a store that had a cultural role as well as a retail
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 260.11 268.44 <o,f0,male> so there 're lots of things everything has rf tags there's rf tags on the user on the cards there's the staff devices that are all around the store
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 268.70 280.19 <o,f0,male> you pick them up and once you see something that you're interested in the staff person can scan them in and then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store you can look at color and sizes and how it appeared on the runway or whatever
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 282.33 294.05 <o,f0,male> and so then the object the merchandise that you're interested in can be scanned it's taken into the dressing room and in the dressing room there are scanners so that we know exactly what
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 304.27 309.16 <o,f0,male> in as you're trying it on it's been used a lot of places but i particularly like
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 309.80 311.95 <o,f0,male> the use here of liquid crystal
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 324.38 326.76 <o,f0,male> the the whole wall goes dark
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 327.94 329.11 <o,f0,male> so you can
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 330.23 331.63 <o,f0,male> try to get approval or not for
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 373.34 374.43 <o,f0,male> a year and a half ago
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 375.14 386.98 <o,f0,male> we were asked to design an installation in the museum this is a new wing of the science museum in london and it's primarily about digital and biomedical issues and
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 387.54 395.98 <o,f0,male> a group at itch which is part of ideo designed this interactive wall that's about four stories tall i don't know if anybody 's seen this it's pretty spectacular in the room
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 396.63 405.33 <o,f0,male> anyway it's based on the london subway system and so you can see that the goal is to bring some of the feedback that the people who had gone to the museum
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 406.18 413.63 <o,f0,male> giving and get it up on the wall so everybody could see just for everybody to see so you enter your information then like the london tube system
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 413.77 422.91 <o,f0,male> the little trains go around with what you're thinking about and then when you get to a station it's expanded so that you can actually read it
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 423.92 432.45 <o,f0,male> then when you exit the imax theatre on the fourth floor mostly teenagers coming out of there there's this big open space that has these tables
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 432.90 439.30 <o,f0,male> in it that have interactive games which are quite fun also designed by durrel of itch and the topics
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 440.90 448.63 <o,f0,male> include things that the museum is about male fertility choosing the sex of your baby or what a driverless car might be like
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 450.92 460.07 <o,f0,male> lots of room so people can come up and understand what it is before they get involved and also it's not shown in the video but these are very beautiful they go to the top of the wall
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 460.33 467.52 <o,f0,male> and when they reach all the way to the top after they've bounced around they disperse into bits and go off into the atmosphere
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 471.33 478.99 <o,f0,male> the next video is not done by us this is cbs sunday morning they aired about two weeks ago scott adams
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 494.20 495.42 <o,f0,male> what's wrong with cubicles
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 503.02 509.84 <o,f0,male> though they work in a wide open office space spectacularly set under san francisco 's oakland bay bridge
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 510.41 512.10 <o,f0,male> the team built their own little
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 512.82 515.16 <o,f0,male> to fully experience the problems
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 541.72 542.12 <o,f0,male> actually
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 548.19 550.20 <o,f0,male> is the idea of making the cubicle
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 552.32 562.68 <o,f0,male> so here 's the final thing complete with orange lighting that follows the sun across that follows the tracks of the sun across the sky so you feel that in your cubicle
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 563.35 568.37 <o,f0,male> and my favorite feature which is a flower in a vase that wilts when you leave in disappointment
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 575.38 577.36 <o,f0,male> has homey touches like a built in
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 611.52 619.75 <o,f0,male> so this building actually celebrates the water as it comes out of the recycling plant and goes into the reed bed so that it can be filtered for the final time
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 639.63 650.34 <o,f0,male> wander around and gather information in a straightforward fashion about the recycling process and what's being done and how they're going to reuse the water once it comes through the
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 659.66 671.03 <o,f0,male> and then if you saw the panels actually rotate so you can get the information on the front side but as they rotate you can see the actual recycling plant behind with all the machines as they actually process
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 688.88 690.42 <o,f0,male> these are all very low budget videos
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 692.79 694.25 <o,f0,male> we're announcing a new product here
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 694.45 697.27 <o,f0,male> tonight which is the first time this ever been shown in public
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 697.74 707.65 <o,f0,male> it's called spyfish and it's a company called h two eye started by nigel jagger in london and it's a company that's trying to
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 709.76 717.16 <o,f0,male> the experience many people have boats or enjoy being on boats but a very small percentage of people actually
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 717.97 731.82 <o,f0,male> have the capability or the interest in going under the water and actually seeing what's there and enjoying what scuba divers do this product it has two cameras you throw it over the side of your boat and you basically
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 732.21 741.88 <o,f0,male> dive without getting wet there's the object for us it was two projects one to design the interface
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 743.34 751.58 <o,f0,male> so that the interface doesn't get in your way you could have that kind of immersive experience of being underwater of feeling like you're underwater seeing what's going on
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 762.08 765.82 <o,f0,male> this project and just ready to start building
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 769.22 776.58 <o,f0,male> is a revolutionary subaquatic video camera it can dive to five hundred feet to where sunlight does not penetrate and is
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 779.23 781.15 <o,f0,male> it becomes your eyes and ears as
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 783.63 787.24 <o,f0,male> battery powered spyfish sends the live video feed through a slender cable
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 787.58 792.10 <o,f0,male> this slender cable was a huge technological advancement and it allowed the whole thing to be the size
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 793.14 794.87 <o,f0,male> the whole system together
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 799.62 800.95 <o,f0,male> you watch the video with
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 801.60 802.60 <o,f0,male> graphics that
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 805.36 809.68 <o,f0,male> fluid graphics and ambient sounds combine to help you completely lose yourself
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 838.16 842.86 <o,f0,male> and the last thing i'll talk about is approtec which is a project that i'm very excited about
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 869.74 881.13 <o,f0,male> products in kenya with kenyan manufacturers designed by people like us but taken there and to this date he 's been gone for only a few years he 's started nineteen thousand companies
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 882.49 885.38 <o,f0,male> he 's made thirty thousand new jobs
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 886.85 896.10 <o,f0,male> the sales of the products this is a non profit the sales of these products is now six percent of the gdp of kenya
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 896.73 908.54 <o,f0,male> this is one guy doing this this is a pretty spectacular thing so we're in the process of helping them design deep well low cost manual pumps in order for these people who have a quarter acre
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 908.91 917.95 <o,f0,male> of land to be able to grow crops in the off season what they do now is they can grow crops in the rainy season but they can't grow them in the off season and so by doing that
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 918.58 931.81 <o,f0,male> the woman that you saw in the first thing she's a school teacher always wanted to send her kids to college and she's going to be able to do it because of these things so with seed squeezers and pumps and hay balers and very straightforward things that we're designing
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 943.75 947.68 <o,f0,male> we also were thinking about the experience of richard and so
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 948.44 949.98 <o,f0,male> we designed this hat
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 953.57 957.26 <o,f0,male> and i needed to deal with him so i just have one more thing to say
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 971.72 972.17 <o,f0,female> i
DavidKelley_2002 1 DavidKelley_2002 992.03 1002.42 <o,f0,male> product to approtec it's really exciting that we're taking a more human centered approach to design that we're including behaviors and personalities in the things we do and i think this is great
