GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 16.81 23.63 <o,f0,male> i would think about changing your perspective on the world a bit and showing you some of the designs that we have in nature and so
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 23.95 33.49 <o,f0,male> i have my first slide to talk about the dawning of the universe and what i call the cosmic scene investigation that is looking at the relics of creation
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 49.13 58.28 <o,f0,male> the work of people but what you actually see is a lot of material that was already here being reshaped in a certain form and so the question is how did that material get here
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 58.49 65.99 <o,f0,male> how did it get into the form that it had before it got reshaped and so forth it's a question of what's the continuity so one of the things i look at is
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 66.18 75.40 <o,f0,male> how did the universe begin and shape what was the whole process in the creation and the evolution of the universe to getting to the point that we have these kinds of materials so that's
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 76.15 86.06 <o,f0,male> the part and let me move on then and show you the hubble ultra deep field if you look at this picture what you will see is a lot of dark with some light objects in it
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 88.09 99.10 <o,f0,male> are stars and you can see them there little pluses this is a star this is a star everything else is a galaxy ok so there's a couple of thousand galaxies you can see easily with your eye in here
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 99.56 102.38 <o,f0,male> and when i look out at particularly this galaxy which
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 102.57 110.88 <o,f0,male> a lot like ours i wonder if there's an art design college conference going on and intelligent beings there are thinking about you know what designs they might do
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 111.03 118.83 <o,f0,male> and there might be a few cosmologists trying to understand where the universe itself came from and there might even be some in that galaxy looking at ours trying to figure out what's going on over here
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 134.10 142.63 <o,f0,male> this is only one thousand galaxies we think there's on the order visible to the hubble space telescope if you had the time to scan it around about one hundred billion galaxies
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 143.12 148.97 <o,f0,male> a very large number of galaxies and that's roughly how many stars there are in our own galaxy but when you look at
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 158.60 172.91 <o,f0,male> you know what kind of creative process and what kind of design produced the world like that and then i'm going to show you it's actually a lot more complicated we're going to try and follow it up we have a tool that actually helps us out in this study and that's the fact that the universe is so incredibly big
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 173.60 186.27 <o,f0,male> that it's a time machine in a certain sense we draw this set of nested spheres cut away so you see it put the earth at the center of the nested spheres just because that's where we're making observations and the moon is only two seconds away so if you take a picture of the moon using
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 210.55 222.39 <o,f0,male> it's about ten years so if you take a picture of what's going on it's ten years ago but you go and look to the center of the galaxy it's thousands of years ago if you look at andromeda which is the nearest big galaxy and it's two million years ago
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 222.63 236.08 <o,f0,male> if you took a picture of the earth two million years ago there'd be no evidence of humans at all because we don't think there were humans yet i mean it just gives you the scale with the hubble space telescope we're looking at hundreds of millions of years to a billion years but if we were capable
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 236.85 244.77 <o,f0,male> to come up with an idea of how to look even further there's some things even further and that was what i did in a lot of my work was to develop the techniques we could look out
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 245.29 256.29 <o,f0,male> back to even earlier epochs before there were stars and before there were galaxies back to when the universe was hot and dense and very different and so that's the sort of sequence and so i have a more artistic impression of this
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 271.52 277.86 <o,f0,male> and then there's a part of the universe we can't see because it's so dense and so hot light can't escape it's like you can't see to the center of the sun
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 278.08 286.07 <o,f0,male> you have to use other techniques to know what's going on inside the sun but you can see the edge of the sun and the universe gets that way and you can see that and then you see this sort of model area
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 303.22 308.80 <o,f0,male> we're going to go from these tiny variations to these irregular galaxies and first stars to these more
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 327.77 335.39 <o,f0,male> then in two thousand the map satellite was launched the wmap and it made somewhat better pictures and later this year
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 335.94 345.20 <o,f0,male> this is the cool stealth version the one that actually has some beautiful design features to it and you should look the planck satellite will be launched and it will make very high resolution maps
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 354.31 361.09 <o,f0,male> both about the structure of spacetime and about the contents of the universe and about how the universe started in its original motions
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 361.20 370.43 <o,f0,male> so we have this picture which is quite a spectacular picture and i'll come back to the beginning where we're going to have some mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 379.77 393.98 <o,f0,male> turn on and they evolve into galaxies and then later they get to the more extensive galaxies and somewhere around this period is when our solar system started forming and it's maturing up to the present time and there's some spectacular things and this wastebasket part
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 394.45 399.00 <o,f0,male> that's to represent what the structure of spacetime itself is doing during this period and so
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 399.76 408.58 <o,f0,male> this is a pretty weird model right what kind of evidence do we have for that so let me show you some of nature 's patterns that are the result of this i always think of
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 409.57 417.76 <o,f0,male> as being the real substance of space and the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean it's a
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 418.32 423.71 <o,f0,male> where the interesting waves are and whatever went on so here is the sloan digital sky survey
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 424.26 436.32 <o,f0,male> showing the location of a million galaxies so there's a dot on here for every galaxy they go out and point a telescope at the sky take a picture identify what are stars and throw them away look at the galaxies estimate how far away they are
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 445.24 453.99 <o,f0,male> fade out because the telescope isn't sensitive enough to do it now i'm going to show you this in three d what happens is you take pictures as the earth rotates you get a fan across
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 454.08 457.31 <o,f0,male> the sky there are some places you can't look because of our own galaxy
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 457.79 470.80 <o,f0,male> or because there are no telescopes available to do it so the next picture shows you the three dimensional version of this rotating around do you see the fan like scans made across the sky remember every spot on here is a galaxy
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 471.94 474.87 <o,f0,male> and you see the galaxies you know
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 475.52 481.36 <o,f0,male> sort of in our neighborhood and you sort of see the structure and you see this thing we call the great wall
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 496.77 505.85 <o,f0,male> but what's going on there's another survey which is very similar to this called the two degree field of view galaxy redshift survey now
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 506.83 510.73 <o,f0,male> it at warp a million and every time there's a
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 527.96 530.46 <o,f0,male> so we're going to go out and swing around and look back at
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 530.68 534.32 <o,f0,male> this and you'll see
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 536.04 541.69 <o,f0,male> first the structure of the survey and then you'll start seeing the structure of the galaxies that we see out there
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 545.84 552.23 <o,f0,male> so again you can see the extension of this great wall of galaxies showing up here but you can see the voids you can see
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 552.59 565.20 <o,f0,male> the complicated structure and you say well how did this happen suppose you're the cosmic designer how are you going to put galaxies out there in a pattern like that it's not just throwing them out at random there's a more complicated process going on here
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 565.73 578.14 <o,f0,male> how are you going to end up doing that and so now we're in for some serious play that is we have to seriously play god not just change people 's lives but make the universe right so if that's your responsibility how are you going to do that
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 599.92 609.06 <o,f0,male> you start out with very simple ingredients and some simple rules but you have to have enough ingredients to make it complicated and then you
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 609.56 623.84 <o,f0,male> put in some randomness some fluctuations and some randomness and realize a whole bunch of different representations so what i'm going to do is show you the distribution of matter as a function of scales we're going to zoom in but this is a plot of what it is and
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 633.23 645.32 <o,f0,male> on me or on the stage it's transparent to light but in order for you to see it we're going to make it white ok so the stuff that's in this picture that's white that is the dark matter it should be called invisible matter but the dark matter we've made visible
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 645.66 654.50 <o,f0,male> and the stuff that is in the yellow color that is the ordinary kind of matter that's turned into stars and galaxies so i'll show you the next movie
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 656.39 664.00 <o,f0,male> so this we're going to zoom in notice this pattern and pay attention to this pattern we're going to zoom in and zoom in
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 664.21 674.49 <o,f0,male> and you'll see there are all these filaments and structures and voids and when a number of filaments come together in a knot that makes a supercluster of galaxies this one we're zooming in on
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 684.31 690.38 <o,f0,male> the center of the cluster so we're zooming in this is a region which probably has more than one hundred thousand
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 690.77 697.25 <o,f0,male> on the order of a million galaxies in that region we're going to keep zooming in ok and so i forgot to tell you the scale
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 698.79 707.15 <o,f0,male> parsec is three point two six light years so a gigaparsec is three billion light years that's the scale so it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 707.58 714.75 <o,f0,male> now we're into a distance sort of between here and here that's the distance between us and andromeda right these little specks that you're seeing in here they're
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 717.90 718.73 <o,f0,male> now we're going to zoom back
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 722.41 734.01 <o,f0,male> and you can see this structure that when we get very far out looks very regular but it's made up of a lot of irregular variations so they're simple building blocks there's a very simple fluid to begin with
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 734.69 736.14 <o,f0,male> matter it's got
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 737.66 751.84 <o,f0,male> ordinary matter it's got photons and it's got neutrinos which don't play much role in the later part of the universe and it's just a simple fluid and it over time develops into this complicated structure and so
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 752.22 758.65 <o,f0,male> you know when you first saw this picture it didn't mean quite so much to you here you're looking across
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 759.29 768.12 <o,f0,male> one percent of the volume of the visible universe and you're seeing billions of galaxies right and nodes but you realize they're not even the main structure there's a framework
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 768.34 778.52 <o,f0,male> which is the dark matter the invisible matter that's out there that's actually holding it all together so let 's fly through it and you can see how much harder it is when you're in the middle of something to figure this out
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 779.40 781.81 <o,f0,male> so here 's that same end result
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 782.18 786.51 <o,f0,male> you see a filament you see the light is the invisible matter and the yellow is
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 786.59 789.43 <o,f0,male> the stars or the galaxies showing up
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 820.77 829.87 <o,f0,male> is how hard would it be to assemble this right how big a contractor team would you need to put this universe together
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 831.53 834.08 <o,f0,male> the issue right and
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 834.89 842.47 <o,f0,male> so here we are you see how the filament you see how several filaments are coming together therefore making this supercluster of galaxies
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 842.90 852.03 <o,f0,male> and you have to understand this is not how it would actually look if you first you can't travel this fast everything would be distorted but this is using simple rendering
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 853.69 862.80 <o,f0,male> graphic arts kind of stuff this is how if you took billions of years to go around it might look to you right and if you could see invisible matter too and so
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 863.33 871.43 <o,f0,male> the idea is you know how would you put together the universe in a very simple way we're going to start and realize
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 871.84 881.53 <o,f0,male> that the entire visible universe everything we can see in every direction with the hubble space telescope plus our other instruments was once in a region that was smaller than an atom
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 882.78 895.79 <o,f0,male> it started with tiny quantum mechanical fluctuations but expanding at a tremendous rate and those fluctuations were stretched to astronomical sizes and those fluctuations eventually are the things we see in the cosmic microwave background
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 896.18 905.05 <o,f0,male> and then we needed some way to turn those fluctuations into galaxies and clusters of galaxies and make these kind of structures go on so i'm going to show you a smaller simulation this simulation
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 905.48 912.53 <o,f0,male> was run on one thousand processors for a month in order to make just this simple visible one so i'm going to show you one that can be run on a desktop
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 914.09 923.75 <o,f0,male> the next picture so you start out with teeny fluctuations when the universe was at this point now four times smaller and so forth and you start seeing these networks this cosmic web
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 924.05 931.51 <o,f0,male> of structure forming and this is a simple one because it doesn't have the ordinary matter and it just has the dark matter in it and you see how the dark matter lumps up
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 931.85 940.63 <o,f0,male> and the ordinary matter just trails along behind so there it is at the beginning it's very uniform the fluctuations are a part in one hundred thousand
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 941.35 953.41 <o,f0,male> a few peaks that are a part in ten thousand and then over billions of years gravity just pulls in this is light over density pulls the material around in that pulls in more material and pulls in more material
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 953.97 961.58 <o,f0,male> but the distances on the universe are so large and the time scales are so large that it takes a long time for this to form and it keeps forming
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 979.38 988.66 <o,f0,male> only things that have started forming already are going to form and then from then on it's going to go on so we're able to do the simulation but this is two days on
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1013.77 1019.78 <o,f0,male> almost nothing that is something extremely tiny extremely small and
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1031.27 1039.42 <o,f0,male> stars and so forth so we have a model and we can calculate it and we can use it to make designs of what we think the universe really looks like
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1039.91 1052.73 <o,f0,male> and that design is sort of way beyond what our original imagination of it was so this is what we started with fifteen years ago with the cosmic background explorer made the map on the upper right
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1053.44 1063.82 <o,f0,male> which basically showed us that there were large scale fluctuations and actually fluctuations on several scales you can kind of see that since then we've had wmap which just gives us higher angular resolution
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1063.97 1070.08 <o,f0,male> we see the same large scale structure but we see additional small scale structure and on the bottom right is
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1070.60 1079.45 <o,f0,male> if the satellite had flipped upside down and mapped the earth what kind of a map we would have got of the earth you can see well you can kind of pick out all the major continents but that's about it
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1079.94 1093.67 <o,f0,male> but what we're hoping when we get to planck we'll have resolution about equivalent to the resolution you see of the earth there where you can really see the complicated pattern that exists on the earth and you can also tell because of the sharp edges
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1094.06 1103.33 <o,f0,male> and the way things fit together there are some non linear processes geology has these effects which is moving the plates around and so forth you can see that just from the map alone
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1103.69 1116.20 <o,f0,male> we want to get to the point in our maps of the early universe we can see whether there are any non linear effects that are starting to move to modify and are giving us a hint about how spacetime itself was actually created at the beginning moments
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1116.70 1125.41 <o,f0,male> so that's where we are today and that's what i wanted to give you a flavor of give you a different view about what the design and what everything else looks like
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1127.03 1129.35 <o,f0,female> thank you
