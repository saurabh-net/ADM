ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 12.65 22.42 <o,f0,male> i just heard the best joke about bond emeruwa i was having lunch with him just a few minutes ago and a nigerian journalist comes and this will only make sense if you've ever watched a james bond movie
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 23.62 27.63 <o,f0,male> and a nigerian journalist comes up to him and goes aha we meet again
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 31.50 31.84 <o,f0,male> so
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 35.42 43.51 <o,f0,male> here mostly because i'm nigerian and if you leave me alone i'll talk for like two hours but i just want to say good afternoon good evening
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 45.54 56.88 <o,f0,male> an incredible few days it's downhill from now on i wanted to thank emeka and chris but also most importantly all the invisible people behind here that you just see flitting around the whole place
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 57.54 65.22 <o,f0,male> that have made sort of this space for such a diverse and robust conversation it's really amazing
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 66.74 78.62 <o,f0,male> been in the audience i'm a writer and i've been watching people with the slide shows and scientists and bankers and i've been feeling a bit like a gangsta rapper at a bar mitzvah
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 82.03 91.04 <o,f0,male> what have i got to say about all this and i was watching jane yesterday and i thought it was really great and i was watching those incredible slides of the
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 91.99 100.32 <o,f0,male> chimpanzees and i thought wow what if a chimpanzee could talk you know what would it say my first thought was well you know there's george bush
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 100.66 109.01 <o,f0,male> but then i thought but why be rude to chimpanzees i guess there goes my green card
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 118.36 126.50 <o,f0,male> about news stories about africa we're not really talking about african narratives and it's important to make a distinction because if the news is anything to go by
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 127.31 137.71 <o,f0,male> forty percent of americans can't either can't afford health insurance or have the most inadequate health insurance and have a president who despite
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 138.43 150.63 <o,f0,male> the protest of millions of his citizens even his own congress continues to prosecute a senseless war so if news is anything to go by the us is right there with zimbabwe right which
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 168.87 179.82 <o,f0,male> the truth is americans everything we know about america everything americans come to know about being american isn't from the news it we i lived there we don't go home at the end of the
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 180.14 189.36 <o,f0,male> think well i really know who i am now because the wall street journal says that the stock exchange closed at this many points what we know about how to be who we are
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 200.66 214.50 <o,f0,male> to remember because you know in africa the complicated questions we want to ask about what all of this means has been asked from the rock paintings of the san people
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 214.94 229.09 <o,f0,male> through the sundiata epics of mali to modern contemporary literature if you want to know about africa read our literature and not just things fall apart because that would be like saying i 've read gone with the wind and so i know everything about america
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 230.51 237.28 <o,f0,male> very important there's a poem by jack gilbert called the forgotten dialect of the heart he says
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 237.97 244.85 <o,f0,male> when the sumerian tablets were first translated they were thought to be business records but what if they were poems and
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 246.12 252.10 <o,f0,male> my love is like twelve ethiopian goats standing still in the morning light
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 253.59 261.32 <o,f0,male> shiploads of thuja are what my body wants to say to your body giraffes are this desire in the
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 262.56 270.16 <o,f0,male> this is important it's important because misreading is really the chance for complication and opportunity the first igbo bible
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 270.48 277.73 <o,f0,male> was translated from english in about the eighteen hundreds by bishop crowther who was a yoruba and it's important to know igbo is a tonal language
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 278.58 287.42 <o,f0,male> and so they'll say the word igwe and igwe same spelling one means sky or heaven and one means bicycle
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 289.54 293.84 <o,f0,male> so god is in heaven surrounded by his angels was
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 315.58 319.05 <o,f0,male> this is good because language complicates things
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 320.35 329.95 <o,f0,male> you know we often think that language mirrors the world in which we live and i find that's not true the language actually makes the world in which we live
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 342.63 349.45 <o,f0,male> everything all of this is story and it's important to remember that because if we don 't then we become
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 376.95 384.34 <o,f0,male> to remember that because otherwise ten years from now we'll be back here trying to tell this story again so
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 385.85 391.99 <o,f0,male> what it says to me then is that it's not really the problem isn't really the stories that are being told or which stories are being told
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 392.36 399.98 <o,f0,male> the problem really is the terms of humanity that we're willing to bring to complicate every story and that's really what it's all about
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 402.02 405.67 <o,f0,male> a nigerian joke well it's just a joke anyway
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 406.00 419.98 <o,f0,male> so there's tom dick and harry and they're working construction and tom opens up his lunch box and there's rice in it and he goes on this rant about twenty years my wife has been packing rice for lunch if she goes it again tomorrow i'm gonna throw myself off this building and kill myself
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 420.54 429.53 <o,f0,male> and dick and harry repeat this the next day tom opens his lunchbox there's rice so he throws himself off and kills himself and tom dick and harry follow and now the inquest you know
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 429.73 438.67 <o,f0,male> tom 's wife and dick 's wife are distraught they wished they'd not packed rice but harry 's wife is confused because she said you know harry had been packing his own lunch for twenty years
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 443.40 452.36 <o,f0,male> this seemingly innocent joke when i heard it as a child in nigeria was told about igbo yoruba and hausa with the hausa being harry
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 452.60 460.01 <o,f0,male> so what seems like an eccentric if tragic joke about harry becomes a way to spread ethnic hatred
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 460.11 470.59 <o,f0,male> my father was educated in cork in the university of cork in the fifties in fact every time i read in ireland people get me all mistaken and they say oh this is chris o 'barney from cork
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 472.27 481.39 <o,f0,male> was also in oxford in the fifties and he had growing up as a child in nigeria my father used to say to me you must never eat or drink in a yoruba person 's house
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 482.01 483.28 <o,f0,male> because they will poison you
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 484.99 489.27 <o,f0,male> it makes sense now when i think about it because if you'd known my father you would 've wanted to poison him
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 499.63 503.10 <o,f0,male> the beginning of the biafran nigerian civil war and
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 504.37 513.69 <o,f0,male> the war ended after three years and i was growing up in school and the federal government didn't want us taught about the history of the war because they thought it probably would make us
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 525.43 538.13 <o,f0,male> so huddled around books with photographs of people in auschwitz i learned the melancholic history of my people through the melancholic history of another people i mean picture this really picture this a
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 539.90 547.28 <o,f0,male> teaching jewish holocaust history to young igbo children story is powerful story is fluid and it belongs to nobody
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 547.70 555.98 <o,f0,male> and it should come as no surprise that my first novel at sixteen was about neo nazis taking over nigeria to institute the fourth reich makes perfect sense
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 558.86 567.03 <o,f0,male> to blow up strategic targets and take over the country and they were foiled by a nigerian james bond called coyote williams and a jewish
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 577.05 588.05 <o,f0,male> but also the book was launched in time for me to be accused of constructing the blueprint for a foiled coup attempt so at eighteen i was bonded off to prison in nigeria
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 589.01 598.70 <o,f0,male> i grew up very privileged and it's important to talk about privilege because we don't talk about it here a lot of us are very privileged i grew up servants cars televisions all that stuff
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 599.36 609.32 <o,f0,male> my story of nigeria growing up was very different from the story i encountered in prison and i had no language for it i was completely terrified completely broken
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 610.15 610.42 <o,f0,male> and
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 612.46 625.61 <o,f0,male> kept trying to find a new language a new way to make sense of all of this six months after that with no explanation they let me go now for those of you who have seen me at the buffet tables know that it was because it was costing them too much to feed
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 635.41 644.55 <o,f0,male> but i mean i grew up with this incredible privilege and not just me millions of nigerians grew up with books and libraries in fact we were talking last night about how
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 645.09 653.40 <o,f0,male> all of the steamy novels of harold robbins had done more for sex education of horny teenage boys in africa than any sex education programs ever
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 655.11 662.71 <o,f0,male> all of those are gone we are squandering the most valuable resource we have on this continent the valuable resource of the imagination
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 663.45 673.99 <o,f0,male> in the film sometimes in april by raoul peck idris elba is poised in a scene with his machete raised and he 's being forced by a crowd to chop up his best friend
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 694.23 701.19 <o,f0,male> chop him up shut him up and as idris moves fraser screams stop
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 710.96 718.16 <o,f0,male> it's not the look of horror and terror on fraser 's face that stops idris or us it's the
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 719.68 729.00 <o,f0,male> it's one that says don 't do this and i'm not saying this to save myself although this would be nice i'm doing it to save you
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 729.34 731.81 <o,f0,male> because if you do this you will be lost
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 733.59 743.22 <o,f0,male> to be so afraid that you're standing in the face of a death you can't escape and that you're soiling yourself and crying but to say in that moment as fraser says to idris tell my girlfriend i love
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 744.33 746.03 <o,f0,male> in that moment fraser says
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 748.49 756.72 <o,f0,male> i am lost already but not you not you this is a redemption we can all aspire to
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 766.88 773.20 <o,f0,male> as a writer i find that african writers have always been the curators of our humanity on this continent
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 773.64 780.82 <o,f0,male> the question is how do i balance narratives that are wonderful with narratives
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 781.85 794.82 <o,f0,male> of wounds and self loathing and this is the difficulty that i face i am trying to move beyond political rhetoric to a place of ethical questioning i am asking us to balance the idea of our complete vulnerability
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 795.35 808.99 <o,f0,male> with the complete notion of transformation or what is possible as a young middle class nigerian activist i launched myself along with a whole generation of us into the campaign to stop the government and i asked millions of people
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 809.49 822.25 <o,f0,male> without questioning my right to do so to go up against the government and i watched them being locked up in prison and tear gassed i justified it and i said this is the cost of revolution have i not myself been imprisoned have i not myself been beaten
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 833.27 836.93 <o,f0,male> righteous righteous war excuse
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 849.72 851.09 <o,f0,male> have been human six days
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 851.85 855.79 <o,f0,male> but only sometimes but this is a good thing it's
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 863.46 871.42 <o,f0,male> you don't know anything about africa you're all idiots and so they said tell me about africa professor abani so i went to google earth and learned about africa
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 871.98 883.24 <o,f0,male> and the truth be told this is it isn't it there are no essential africans and most of us are as completely ignorant as everyone else about the continent we come from and yet we want to make profound statements about it
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 892.83 894.97 <o,f0,male> i want to believe
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 895.30 904.61 <o,f0,male> that we can be agnostic about this that we can rise above all of this when i was ten i read james baldwin 's another country and that book broke me
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 905.16 917.54 <o,f0,male> not because i was encountering homosexual sex and love for the first time but because the way james wrote about it made it impossible for me to attach otherness to it here jimmy said here is love all of it
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 918.28 927.18 <o,f0,male> the fact that it happens in another country takes you quite by surprise my friend ronald gottesman says there are three kinds of people in the world those who can count and those
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 932.37 941.34 <o,f0,male> he also says that the cause of all our trouble is the belief in an essential pure identity religious ethnic historical
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 943.46 954.19 <o,f0,male> i want to leave you with a poem by yusef komunyakaa that speaks to transformation it's called ode to the doctorum and i'll try and read it the way yusef would be proud to hear it read
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 958.07 960.34 <o,f0,male> gazelle i killed you
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 963.91 969.32 <o,f0,male> for how easy it is to be nailed to a board weathered raw as white butcher
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 969.53 976.41 <o,f0,male> paper last night i heard my daughter praying for the meat here at my feet
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 976.56 985.85 <o,f0,male> you know it wasn't anger that made me stop my heart till the hammer fell weeks ago you broke me as a woman once shattered me into a song beneath
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 986.94 996.34 <o,f0,male> before you slouched into that grassy hush and now i'm tightening lashes shaping hide as if around a ribcage shaped like five
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 997.67 1007.59 <o,f0,male> ghosts cannot slip back inside the body 's drum you've been seasoned by wind dusk and sunlight pressure can make everything whole again
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 1009.24 1015.61 <o,f0,male> tacked into the ebony wood your face has been carved five times i have to drive trouble in the hills
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 1015.86 1022.02 <o,f0,male> trouble in the valley and trouble by the river too there is no palm wine fish salt
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 1023.58 1026.70 <o,f0,male> kadoom kadoom kadoom
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 1028.93 1030.42 <o,f0,male> now i have beaten
ChrisAbani_2007G 1 ChrisAbani_2007G 1030.61 1037.83 <o,f0,male> a song back into you rise and walk away like a panther thank
