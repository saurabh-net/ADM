RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 45.55 54.48 <o,f0,male> i spent a few days photographing children in different countries and like a lot of photographers and a lot of journalists i always hope that when my pictures were published
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 54.78 60.44 <o,f0,male> they might actually have an effect on a situation instead of just documenting it so i
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 71.17 85.51 <o,f0,male> i decided i would find six children in different countries and actually go spend some time with the kids and try to tell their story a little bit better than i thought i had done for time magazine in the course of doing the story i was looking for
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 100.50 109.14 <o,f0,male> in korea that there was a young girl who was eleven years old being raised by her grandmother and the grandmother had never let any westerners ever see her every time any westerners came to the village she hid the
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 121.41 131.74 <o,f0,male> with me and went to this village found the grandmother sat down with her and to my astonishment she agreed to let me photograph her granddaughter and i was paying for this myself so i asked the translator
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 132.39 142.48 <o,f0,male> it would be ok if i stayed for the week i had a sleeping bag the family had a small shed on the side of the house so i said could i sleep in my sleeping bag in the evenings and
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 143.26 151.12 <o,f0,male> i just told the little girl whose name was hyun sook lee that if i ever did anything to embarrass her she didn't speak a word of english although she looked very american
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 151.64 159.34 <o,f0,male> she could just put up her hand and say stop and i would stop taking pictures and then my translator left so there i was i couldn't speak a word of korean and this is the first night
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 160.21 166.86 <o,f0,male> her mother was still alive her mother was not raising her her grandmother was raising her and what struck me immediately
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 167.43 174.51 <o,f0,male> was how in love the two of these people were the grandmother was incredibly fond deeply in love with this
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 175.12 185.35 <o,f0,male> they slept on the floor at night the way they heat their homes in korea is to put bricks under the floors so the heat actually radiates from underneath the floor hyun sook was eleven years old i had photographed as i said a lot of these kids
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 186.29 193.38 <o,f0,male> was in fact the fifth child that i found to photograph and almost universally amongst all the kids they were really psychologically
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 194.57 203.93 <o,f0,male> by having been made fun of ridiculed picked on and been rejected and korea was probably the place i found to be the worst for these kids and what struck me immediately in
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 212.18 220.18 <o,f0,male> you can see how much she looks like her grandmother although she looks so western i decided to follow her to school this is the first morning i stayed with her this is on the way to school
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 220.94 223.14 <o,f0,male> this is the morning assembly outside her school
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 227.85 234.70 <o,f0,male> and i noticed that she was clowning around when the teachers would ask questions she'd be the first person to raise her hand
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 235.93 242.58 <o,f0,male> again not at all shy or withdrawn or anything like the other children that i'd photographed again the first one to go to the blackboard to answer questions
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 242.73 251.35 <o,f0,male> getting in trouble for whispering into her best friends ears in the middle of class and one of the other things that i said to her through the translator again this thing about saying stop
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 252.24 261.23 <o,f0,male> was to not pay attention to me and so she really just completely ignored me most of the time i noticed that at recess she was the girl who picked the other girls to be on her team
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 261.92 270.89 <o,f0,male> was very obvious from the very beginning that she was a leader this is on the way home and that's north korea up along the hill this is up along the dmz they would actually cover the windows every night
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 271.17 278.89 <o,f0,male> so that light couldn't be seen because the south korean government has said for years that the north koreans may invade at any time so there's always this the closer you
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 294.14 305.65 <o,f0,male> the week came and my translator came back because i'd asked her to come back so i could formally thank the grandmother and hyun sook and in the course of the grandmother talking to the translator the grandmother started crying
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 305.98 319.35 <o,f0,male> and i said to my translator what 's going on why is she crying and she spoke to the grandmother for a moment and then she started getting tears in her eyes and i said ok what did i do what's going on why is everyone crying and the translator said the grandmother says that she thinks she's dying
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 320.22 330.27 <o,f0,male> and she wants to know if you would take hyun sook to america with you and i said i 'm twenty eight years old and i live in hotels and
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 330.69 338.13 <o,f0,male> i'm not married i mean i had fallen in love with this girl but i you know it was like emotionally i was about twelve years old if you know of photographers
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 338.60 347.70 <o,f0,male> the joke is it's the finest form of delayed adolescence ever invented sorry i have to go on an assignment i'll be back and then you never come back so i
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 349.01 357.00 <o,f0,male> asked the translator why she thought she was dying can i get her to a hospital could i pay to get her a doctor and she refused any help at all
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 373.83 382.52 <o,f0,male> my best friend had mistakenly one day said something about wishing he had another child so here my friends gene and gail had not heard from me in about a year
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 382.92 391.45 <o,f0,male> and suddenly i was calling saying i 'm in korea and i've met this extraordinary girl and i said the grandmother thinks she's sick but i think maybe we
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 391.73 399.18 <o,f0,male> have to bring the grandmother over also and i said i 'll pay for the i mean i had this whole sort of picture so anyway i left and
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 400.30 407.40 <o,f0,male> my friends actually said they were very interested in adopting her and i said look i think i'll scare the grandmother to death if i actually
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 410.32 422.02 <o,f0,male> back and talk to her but i was off on assignment i figured i'd come back in a couple of weeks and talk to the grandmother and on christmas day i was in bangkok with a group of photographers and got a telegram back in those days you got telegrams
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 422.60 432.55 <o,f0,male> from time magazine saying someone in korea had died and left their child in a will to me did i know anything about this because i hadn't told them what i was doing because i was so upset with the story
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 433.89 442.41 <o,f0,male> so i went back to korea and i went back to hyun sook 's village and she was gone and the house that i had spent time in was empty it was incredibly cold
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 453.22 460.64 <o,f0,male> her best friend that she used to play with after school every day and myung sung under some pressure from me and the translator gave us an address on the outside of
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 461.70 469.82 <o,f0,male> and i went to that address and knocked on the door and a man answered the door it was not a very nice area of
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 508.29 510.46 <o,f0,male> so i was
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 510.73 522.16 <o,f0,male> the door was being slammed in my face it's incredibly cold and i'm trying to think what would the hero do in a movie if i was writing this as a movie script so i said listen it's really cold i've come a very long way do you mind if i just come in for a minute i'm freezing
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 522.58 531.28 <o,f0,male> so the guy kind of reluctantly let us in and we sat down on the floor and as we started talking i saw him yell something and hyun sook came and brought us some food
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 531.79 542.76 <o,f0,male> and i had this whole mental picture of sort of like cinderella i sort of had this picture of this incredibly wonderful bright happy little child who now appeared to be very withdrawn
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 543.43 556.54 <o,f0,male> being enslaved by this family and i was really appalled and i couldn't figure out what to do and the more i tried talking to him the less friendly he was getting so i finally decided i said look this is all through the translator because this is all you know i don't speak a word of korean
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 557.10 565.27 <o,f0,male> and i said look i'm really glad that hyun sook has a family to live with i was very worried about her i made a promise to her grandmother your mother
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 588.61 598.41 <o,f0,male> mother had been a prostitute and she was a prostitute and a boy who 'd been in and out of jail and i said to them look there's a little girl who has a tiny chance of getting
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 598.72 609.38 <o,f0,male> out of here and going to america i said i don't know if it's the right decision or not but i would like you to come to lunch tomorrow and tell the uncle what it's like to walk down the street what people say to you what you do for a living
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 609.85 618.90 <o,f0,male> and just i want him to understand what happens if she stays here and i could be wrong i don't know but i wish you would come tomorrow so these two came to lunch and
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 619.61 629.78 <o,f0,male> we got thrown out of the restaurant they were yelling at him they were it got to be really ugly and we went outside and he was just furious and i knew i had totally blown this whole thing here i was again trying to figure out what to do
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 639.68 645.88 <o,f0,male> with your cameras around your neck accusing me of enslaving my niece this is my niece i love her she's
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 646.97 654.02 <o,f0,male> daughter who the hell are you to accuse me of something like this and i said you know look i said
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 667.11 679.32 <o,f0,male> i will fly my friends over here from the united states if you want to meet them to see if you approve of them i just think that what little i know about the situation she has very little chance here of having the kind of life that you probably would like her to have
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 679.91 687.66 <o,f0,male> so everyone told me afterwards that inviting the prospective parents over was again the stupidest thing i could have possibly done because who 's ever good enough for your
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 688.70 698.02 <o,f0,male> but he invited me to come to a ceremony they were having that day for her grandmother and they actually take items of clothing and photographs and they burn them as part of the ritual
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 699.11 706.84 <o,f0,male> and you can see how different she looks just in three months this was now i think february early february and the pictures before were taken in september
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 708.64 716.36 <o,f0,male> an american marine priest that i had met in the course of doing the story who had seventy five children living in his house he had three women helping him take care of these kids
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 729.33 730.91 <o,f0,male> father keene he 's just a wonderful guy
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 737.90 739.37 <o,f0,male> kids
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 739.52 749.36 <o,f0,male> this is a social worker interviewing hyun sook now i had always thought she was completely untouched by all of this because the grandmother to me appeared to be sort of the village wise woman and the
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 794.65 803.61 <o,f0,male> and he said the second day she was here she made up a list of all of the names of the older kids and the younger kids and she assigned one of the older kids to each of the younger kids
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 804.18 816.03 <o,f0,male> and then she set up a work detail list of who cleaned the orphanage on what day and he said she 's telling me that i'm messy and i have to clean up my room and he said i don't know who raised her but he said she 's running the orphanage and she's been here three
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 832.76 835.98 <o,f0,male> this is a woman who is now working at the orphanage whose son had been adopted
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 840.12 848.28 <o,f0,male> gene and gail started studying korean the moment they had gotten my first letter they really wanted to be able to welcome hyun sook into their family
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 848.65 854.25 <o,f0,male> and one of the things father keene told me when i came back from one of these trips hyun sook had chosen the name natasha
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 854.71 867.17 <o,f0,male> which i understood was from her watching a rocky and bullwinkle cartoon on the american air force station this may be one of those myth buster things that we'll have to clear up here in a minute so my friend gene flew over with his son tim
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 867.59 875.34 <o,f0,male> gail couldn't come and they spent a lot of time huddled over a dictionary and this was gene showing the uncle where atlanta was on the map where he lived
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 876.89 879.32 <o,f0,male> this is the uncle signing the adoption papers
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 879.86 887.13 <o,f0,male> now we went out to dinner that night to celebrate the uncle went back to his family and natasha and tim and gene and i went out to dinner
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 887.51 895.15 <o,f0,male> and gene was showing natasha how to use a knife and fork and then natasha was returning the utensil lessons
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 896.01 902.41 <o,f0,male> we went back to our hotel room and gene was showing natasha also where atlanta was this is the third night we were in korea the first night
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 903.63 910.97 <o,f0,male> a room for the kids right next to us now i'd been staying in this room for about three months it was a little fifteen story korean hotel
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 911.66 919.37 <o,f0,male> so the second night we didn't keep the kids room because we went down and slept on the floor with all the kids at the orphanage and the third night we came back we'd just gone out to dinner where you saw the pictures
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 919.95 927.54 <o,f0,male> and we got to the front desk and the guy at the front desk said there 's no other free rooms on your floor tonight so if you want to put the kids five floors below you there's a room there
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 928.08 940.78 <o,f0,male> and gene and i looked at each other and said no we don't want two eleven year olds five floors away so his son said dad i have a sleeping bag i'll sleep on the floor and i said yeah i have one too so tim and i slept on the floor natasha got one bed gene got the other
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 941.22 951.87 <o,f0,male> kids pass out it's been very exciting for three days we're laying in bed and gene and i are talking about how cool we are we said that was so great we saved this little girl 's life we were just like you know
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 952.73 963.77 <o,f0,male> full of ourselves and we fall asleep and i've been in this room you know for a couple of months now and they always overheat the hotels in korea terribly so during the day i always left the window open
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 974.47 984.80 <o,f0,male> freezing i go to close the window and i hear people shouting outside and i thought oh the bars must have just gotten out and i don't speak korean but i'm hearing these voices and i'm not hearing
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 987.22 993.17 <o,f0,male> so i open the window and i look out and there's flames coming up the side of our hotel and the hotel 's on fire
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 993.73 1001.76 <o,f0,male> so i run over to gene and i wake him up and i say gene don't freak out i think the hotel 's on fire and now there's smoke and flames coming by our windows we're on the eleventh floor
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 1002.38 1007.00 <o,f0,male> so the two of us were just like oh my god oh my god so we're trying to get natasha
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 1028.41 1041.36 <o,f0,male> and the whole room filled with smoke in about two seconds and gene turns round and says we 're not going to make it and he closes the door and the whole room is now filled with smoke we're all choking and there's smoke pouring through the vents under the doors there's people screaming
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 1047.30 1058.44 <o,f0,male> i had two overwhelming feelings one was absolute terror it's like oh please god i just want to wake up this has got to be a nightmare this can't be happening please i just want to wake up it's got to be a nightmare and the other is unbelievable guilt here i've been playing god
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 1058.76 1068.94 <o,f0,male> with my friend 's lives my friend 's son with natasha 's life and this what you get when you try playing god is you hurt people i remember just being so frightened and terrified and gene who 's laying on the floor
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 1069.40 1077.01 <o,f0,male> says man we've got to soak towels i said what he says we 've got to soak towels we're going to die from the smoke so we ran to the bathroom and got towels and put them over our faces and the kids faces
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 1077.54 1089.54 <o,f0,male> he said do you have gaffer 's tape i said what he said do you have gaffer 's tape i said yeah somewhere in my halliburton he says we 've got to stop the smoke he said that 's all we can do we've got to stop the smoke i mean gene thank god for gene so we
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 1090.66 1097.60 <o,f0,male> put the room service menus over the vents in the wall we put blankets at the bottom of the door we put the kids on the windowsill to try to get some air
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 1107.48 1113.77 <o,f0,male> eleven people ended up dying in the fire five people jumped and died other people were killed by the smoke and
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 1136.94 1141.53 <o,f0,male> i remember a sort of a tussle at the door trying to get the door open in any case
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 1143.03 1154.14 <o,f0,male> twelve hours later i mean they put us in the lobby gene ended up using his coat and his fist in the coat to break open a liquor cabinet people were lying on the floor it was one of just the most horrifying nights
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 1154.61 1168.50 <o,f0,male> and then twelve hours later we rented a car as we had planned to and drove back to natasha 's village and we kept saying do you realize we were dying in a hotel fire like eight hours ago it's so weird how life just goes on natasha wanted to introduce her brother and father
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 1168.89 1179.62 <o,f0,male> to all the villagers and the day we showed up turned out to be a sixty year old man 's birthday this guy 's sixty years old so it turned into a dual celebration because natasha was the first person from this village ever to go to the united states
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 1180.01 1188.19 <o,f0,male> so these are the greenhouse tents this is the elders teaching gene their dances we drank a lot of rice wine we were both so drunk i couldn't believe it
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 1200.50 1209.07 <o,f0,male> you do for a year so i found out the name of every official on both the korean and american side and i photographed them and told them how famous they were going to be when this book was done
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 1209.69 1214.63 <o,f0,male> and four months later the adoption papers came through this is
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 1215.45 1223.20 <o,f0,male> saying goodbye to everybody at the orphanage this is father keene with natasha at the bus stop her great aunt at the airport i had
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 1223.41 1231.83 <o,f0,male> a wonderful deal with cathay pacific airlines for many years where they gave me free passes on all their airlines in return for photography it was like the ultimate perk
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 1232.31 1246.36 <o,f0,male> and the pilot i actually knew because they used to let me sit in the jump seat to tell you how long ago this was this is a tri star and so they let natasha actually sit in the jump seat and the pilot jeff cowley actually went back and adopted one of the other kids at the orphanage after
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 1246.97 1257.72 <o,f0,male> meeting natasha this is twenty eight hours later in atlanta it's a very long flight just to make things even crazier gail natasha 's new mom was three days away from giving birth to her own daughter
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 1264.77 1275.32 <o,f0,male> showing natasha her new cousins and uncles and aunts gene and gail know everyone in atlanta they're the most social couple imaginable so at this point natasha doesn't speak a word of english other than what little father keene
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 1277.06 1279.93 <o,f0,male> this is kylie her sister who 's now a doctor
RickSmolan_2007P 1 RickSmolan_2007P 1284.17 1296.27 <o,f0,male> this is a deal i had with natasha which is that when we got to atlanta she could take she could cut off my beard she never liked it very much she learned english in three months she entered seventh grade at her own age level
