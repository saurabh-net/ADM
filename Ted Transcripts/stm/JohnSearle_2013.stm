JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 13.02 18.8 <o,f0,male> talk about consciousness why consciousness well it 's a curiously neglected
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 18.8 34.49 <o,f0,male> subject both in our scientific and our philosophical culture now why is that curious well it is the most important aspect of our lives for a very simple logical reason namely it 's a necessary condition on anything being important in our lives that we 're conscious
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 34.49 43.27 <o,f0,male> you care about science philosophy music art whatever it 's no good if you 're a zombie or in a coma right so consciousness is number one
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 43.56 55.46 <o,f0,male> the second reason is that when people do get interested in it as i think they should they tend to say the most appalling things and then even when they 're not saying appalling things and they 're really trying to do serious research
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 55.56 57.39 <o,f0,male> well it 's been
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 57.47 59.11 <o,f0,male> progress has been slow
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 77.76 88.08 <o,f0,male> the thing that struck me is one guy said in exasperation a very famous neurobiologist he said look in my discipline it 's okay to be interested in consciousness but get tenure first
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 88.08 107.41 <o,f0,male> get tenure first now i 've been working on this for a long time i think now you might actually get tenure by working on consciousness if so that 's a real step forward okay now why then is this curious reluctance and curious hostility to consciousness well i think it 's a combination of two features of our intellectual culture
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 107.49 125.91 <o,f0,male> that like to think they 're opposing each other but in fact they share a common set of assumptions one feature is the tradition of religious dualism consciousness is not a part of the physical world it 's a part of the spiritual world it belongs to the soul and the soul
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 139.37 149.96 <o,f0,male> consciousness is not a part of the physical world either it doesn 't exist at all or it 's something else a computer program or some damn fool thing but in any case it 's not
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 157.34 163.84 <o,f0,male> consciousness is subjective therefore there cannot be a science of consciousness okay so
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 175.48 185.03 <o,f0,male> consciousness is a biological phenomenon like photosynthesis digestion mitosis you know all the biological phenomena and once you accept that
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 185.48 198.51 <o,f0,male> most though not all of the hard problems about consciousness simply evaporate and i 'm going to go through some of them okay now i promised you to tell you some of the outrageous things said about consciousness one
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 198.68 207.08 <o,f0,male> consciousness does not exist it 's an illusion like sunsets science has shown sunsets and
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 207.08 217.4 <o,f0,male> rainbows are illusions so consciousness is an illusion two well maybe it exists but it 's really something else it 's a computer program running in the brain
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 217.4 225.98 <o,f0,male> three no the only thing that exists is really behavior it 's embarrassing how influential behaviorism was but i 'll get back to that
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 225.98 238.53 <o,f0,male> and four maybe consciousness exists but it can 't make any difference to the world how could spirituality move anything now whenever somebody tells me that i think you want to see spirituality move something watch
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 238.53 243.18 <o,f0,male> i decide consciously to raise my arm and the damn thing goes
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 248.79 259.63 <o,f0,male> well it 's a bit like the weather in geneva some days it goes up and some days it doesn 't go up no it goes up whenever i damn well want it to okay i 'm going to tell you how that 's possible now
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 267.94 275.96 <o,f0,male> i think it 's rather easy to define if you 're not trying to give a scientific definition we 're not ready for a scientific definition but here 's a common sense definition
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 275.96 290.2 <o,f0,male> consciousness consists of all those states of feeling or sentience or awareness it begins in the morning when you wake up from a dreamless sleep and it goes on all day until you fall asleep or die or otherwise become unconscious
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 290.2 301.88 <o,f0,male> dreams are a form of consciousness on this definition now that 's the common sense definition that 's our target if you 're not talking about that you 're not talking about consciousness but they think well if that
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 318.14 325.06 <o,f0,male> without exception are caused by lower level neurobiological processes in the brain
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 325.06 329.5 <o,f0,male> and they are realized in the brain as higher level or system features
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 329.5 340.79 <o,f0,male> it 's about as mysterious as the liquidity of water right the liquidity is not an extra juice squirted out by the h two o molecules it 's a condition that the system is in
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 340.79 352.59 <o,f0,male> and just as the jar full of water can go from liquid to solid depending on the behavior of the molecules so your brain can go from a state of being conscious to a state of being unconscious
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 352.59 371.86 <o,f0,male> depending on the behavior of the molecules the famous mind body problem is that simple all right but now we get into some harder questions let 's specify the exact features of consciousness so that we can then answer those four objections that i made to it well the first feature is
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 371.92 380.74 <o,f0,male> it 's real and irreducible you can 't get rid of it you see the distinction between reality and illusion
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 380.95 396.7 <o,f0,male> is the distinction between how things consciously seem to us and how they really are it consciously seems like there 's i like the french arc en ciel it seems like there 's an arch in the sky or it seems like the sun is setting over the mountains
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 396.7 399.9 <o,f0,male> it consciously seems to us but that 's not really happening
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 399.9 408.5 <o,f0,male> but for that distinction between how things consciously seem and how they really are you can 't make that distinction for the very existence of consciousness
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 408.5 428.15 <o,f0,male> because where the very existence of consciousness is concerned if it consciously seems to you that you are conscious you are conscious i mean if a bunch of experts come to me and say we are heavy duty neurobiologists and we 've done a study of you searle and we 're convinced you are not conscious you are a very cleverly constructed robot
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 446.31 450.76 <o,f0,male> an illusion in a way that you can with other standard illusions okay
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 450.76 458.4 <o,f0,male> the second feature is this one that has been such a source of trouble to us and that is all of our conscious states have this
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 458.4 466.84 <o,f0,male> qualitative character to them there 's something that it feels like to drink beer which is not what it feels like to do your income tax or listen to music
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 466.84 471.36 <o,f0,male> and this qualitative feel automatically generates a third feature
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 471.36 490.71 <o,f0,male> namely conscious states are by definition subjective in the sense that they only exist as experienced by some human or animal subject some self that experiences them maybe we 'll be able to build a conscious machine since we don 't know how our brains do it we 're not in a position so far to build a conscious machine
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 495.31 514.89 <o,f0,male> in unified conscious fields so i don 't just have the sight of the people in front of me and the sound of my voice and the weight of my shoes against the floor but they occur to me as part of one single great conscious field that stretches forward and backward that is the key to understanding the enormous power of consciousness
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 514.89 526.69 <o,f0,male> and we have not been able to do that in a robot the disappointment of robotics derives from the fact that we don 't know how to make a conscious robot so we don 't have a machine that can do this kind of thing okay the next
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 526.69 540.29 <o,f0,male> feature of consciousness after this marvelous unified conscious field is that it functions causally in our behavior i gave you a scientific demonstration by raising my hand but how is that possible how can it be
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 540.29 553.33 <o,f0,male> that this thought in my brain can move material objects well i 'll tell you the answer i mean we don 't know the detailed answer but we know the basic part of the answer and that is there is a sequence of neuron firings
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 553.33 562.07 <o,f0,male> and they terminate where the acetylcholine is secreted at the axon end plates of the motor neurons sorry to use philosophical terminology here but
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 562.76 577.04 <o,f0,male> when it 's secreted at the axon end plates of the motor neurons a whole lot of wonderful things happen in the ion channels and the damned arm goes up now think of what i told you one and the same event my conscious decision to raise my arm
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 577.04 583.6 <o,f0,male> has a level of description where it has all of these touchy feely spiritual qualities it 's a thought in my brain
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 583.6 593.53 <o,f0,male> but at the same time it 's busy secreting acetylcholine and doing all sorts of other things as it makes its way from the motor cortex down through the nerve fibers in the arm
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 593.53 603.89 <o,f0,male> now what that tells us is that our traditional vocabularies for discussing these issues are totally obsolete one and the same event has a level of description
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 603.89 614.07 <o,f0,male> where it 's neurobiological and another level of description where it 's mental and that 's a single event and that 's how nature works that 's how it 's possible for consciousness to function causally
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 614.11 632.72 <o,f0,male> okay now with that in mind with going through these various features of consciousness let 's go back and answer some of those early objections well the first one i said was consciousness doesn 't exist it 's an illusion well i 've already answered that i don 't think we need to worry about that but the second one had an incredible
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 632.81 636.09 <o,f0,male> influence and may still be around and that is
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 636.09 654.2 <o,f0,male> well if consciousness exists it 's really something else it 's really a digital computer program running in your brain and that 's what we need to do to create consciousness is get the right program yeah forget about the hardware any hardware will do provided it 's rich enough and stable enough to carry the program now we know that that 's
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 654.23 672.4 <o,f0,male> wrong i mean anybody who 's thought about computers at all can see that that 's wrong because computation is defined as symbol manipulation usually thought of as zeros as ones but any symbols will do you get an algorithm that you can program in a binary code and that 's the defining trait
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 672.41 686.59 <o,f0,male> of the computer program but we know that that 's purely syntactical that 's symbolic we know that actual human consciousness has something more than that it 's got a content in addition to the syntax it 's got a semantics
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 686.59 696.69 <o,f0,male> now that argument i made that argument thirty oh my god i don 't want to think about it more than thirty years ago but there 's a deeper argument implicit in what i 've told you and i want to tell you that argument briefly and that is
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 697.73 707.08 <o,f0,male> consciousness creates an observer independent reality it creates a reality of money property government marriage
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 707.08 725.95 <o,f0,male> cern conferences cocktail parties and summer vacations and all of those are creations of consciousness their existence is observer relative it 's only relative to conscious agents that a piece of paper is money or that a bunch of buildings is a university now ask yourself
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 725.95 727.74 <o,f0,male> about computation
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 727.74 733.52 <o,f0,male> is that absolute like force and mass and gravitational attraction or is it observer relative
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 741.73 755.43 <o,f0,male> but when i haul out my pocket calculator and do the calculation the only intrinsic phenomenon is the electronic circuit and its behavior that 's the only absolute phenomenon all the rest is interpreted by us
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 766.65 785.12 <o,f0,male> doesn 't mean computation is arbitrary i spent a lot of money on this hardware but we have this persistent confusion between objectivity and subjectivity as features of reality and objectivity and subjectivity as features of claims and the bottom line of this part of my talk is this
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 785.12 791.84 <o,f0,male> you can have a completely objective science a science where you make objectively true claims
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 791.85 795.11 <o,f0,male> about a domain whose existence is subjective
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 795.11 802.12 <o,f0,male> whose existence is in the human brain consisting of subjective states of sentience or feeling or awareness
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 802.12 807.56 <o,f0,male> so the objection that you can 't have an objective science of consciousness because it 's
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 807.56 826.37 <o,f0,male> subjective and science is objective that 's a pun that 's a bad pun on objectivity and subjectivity you can make objective claims about a domain that is subjective in its mode of existence and indeed that 's what neurologists do i mean you have patients that actually suffer pains and you try to get an objective science of that
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 826.37 832.75 <o,f0,male> okay i promised to refute all these guys and i don 't have an awful lot of time left but let me refute a couple more of them i said
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 832.91 840.43 <o,f0,male> that behaviorism ought to be one of the great embarrassments of our intellectual culture because it 's refuted the moment you think about it
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 840.43 845.49 <o,f0,male> your mental states are identical with your behavior well think about the distinction between
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 845.49 860.45 <o,f0,male> feeling a pain and engaging in pain behavior i won 't demonstrate pain behavior but i can tell you i 'm not having any pains right now so it 's an obvious mistake why did they make the mistake the mistake was and you can go back and read the literature on this you can see this over and over
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 860.45 862.85 <o,f0,male> they think if you accept
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 862.85 875.3 <o,f0,male> the irreducible existence of consciousness you 're giving up on science you 're giving up on three hundred years of human progress and human hope and all the rest of it and the message i want to leave you with is
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 875.3 887.69 <o,f0,male> consciousness has to become accepted as a genuine biological phenomenon as much subject to scientific analysis as any other phenomenon in biology or for that matter the rest of science thank you very much
