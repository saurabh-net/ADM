DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 37.42 38.97 <o,f0,male> that we've done since the civil war a
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 43.57 48.64 <o,f0,male> and literally this guy sat in my office in new hampshire and said i want you to give me something
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 49.31 50.83 <o,f0,male> that we can put on these kids
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 67.08 69.49 <o,f0,male> he finishes explaining that and i'm waiting for the big
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 70.43 73.83 <o,f0,male> three hundred pound paper proposal and he said that 's what i want
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 79.78 81.77 <o,f0,male> that technology 's just not available right now
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 84.73 86.13 <o,f0,male> not in an envelope of a human
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 87.29 88.66 <o,f0,male> with twenty one degrees of freedom
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 111.32 113.62 <o,f0,male> my nights and weekends are already filled up with things like
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 114.36 119.73 <o,f0,male> let 's supply water to the world and power to the world and educate all the kids which chris i will not talk about
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 130.18 135.88 <o,f0,male> he says to me we 've done some work around the country we've got some pretty amazing neurology and other people
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 140.82 145.56 <o,f0,male> over the next month i visited lots of places some out here around the country found the best of the best
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 146.18 147.67 <o,f0,male> i went down to washington
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 148.29 153.67 <o,f0,male> i saw these guys and said i did what you asked me i looked at what's out there i still think you're
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 154.87 156.22 <o,f0,male> but not as nuts as i thought
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 157.39 160.72 <o,f0,male> i put a team together a little over thirteen months ago
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 161.25 163.22 <o,f0,male> got up to twenty some odd people
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 163.91 165.60 <o,f0,male> we said we're going to build a device
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 166.81 171.91 <o,f0,male> that does what he wants we have fourteen out of the twenty one degrees of freedom you don't need the ones in the last two fingers
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 172.75 174.17 <o,f0,male> we put this thing together
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 174.48 183.88 <o,f0,male> a couple of weeks ago we took it down to walter reed which is unfortunately more in the news these days we showed it to a bunch of guys one guy who described himself as being lucky because
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 193.14 196.85 <o,f0,male> good arm and then he pushed himself back from the table he had no legs
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 197.80 199.49 <o,f0,male> these kids have attitudes that you just
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 201.30 205.27 <o,f0,male> so i'm going to show you now without the skin on it a thirty second piece and then
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 207.22 213.41 <o,f0,male> but understand what you're looking at we made small enough to fit on a fiftieth percentile female
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 214.12 216.51 <o,f0,male> so that we could put it in any of these people
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 217.54 222.54 <o,f0,male> it's going to go inside something that we use in cat scans and mris of whatever is their good arm
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 227.44 233.43 <o,f0,male> and paint it in three d exact mirror image of their other limb so you won 't see all the really cool stuff
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 245.32 249.68 <o,f0,male> the more it attaches they take the load off and it becomes again compliant
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 250.46 256.55 <o,f0,male> to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this that we demonstrated in washington can we look at this thing
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 263.31 266.01 <o,f0,male> watch the fingers grab the thumb comes
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 267.65 273.59 <o,f0,male> wrist this weighs six point nine pounds going to scratch his nose
DeanKamen_2007 1 DeanKamen_2007 285.71 288.08 <o,f0,male> now he 's going to put that down pick up a piece of paper
