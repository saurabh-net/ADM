DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 16.73 21.17 <o,f0,male> so much everyone from ted and chris and amy in particular i cannot believe
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 22.68 32.58 <o,f0,male> here i have not slept in weeks neil and i were sitting there comparing how little we've slept in anticipation for this i've never been so nervous and i do this when i'm nervous i just realized
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 48.28 61.20 <o,f0,male> i was trying to finish my first book i was wandering around dazed every day because i wrote from twelve a m to five a m so i would walk around in a daze during the day i had no mental acuity to speak of during the day
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 62.44 63.24 <o,f0,male> i had
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 66.82 76.18 <o,f0,male> in the brooklyn neighborhood that i lived in park slope there are a lot of writers it's like a very high per capita ratio of writers to normal people meanwhile i had
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 77.57 81.39 <o,f0,male> grown up around a lot of teachers my mom was a teacher my sister became a teacher
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 82.97 91.01 <o,f0,male> and after college so many of my friends went into teaching and so i was always hearing them talk about their lives and how inspiring they were and they were really sort of the
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 91.50 101.27 <o,f0,male> hard working and constantly inspiring people i knew but i knew so many of the things they were up against so many of the struggles they were dealing with and one of them was that
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 111.43 118.80 <o,f0,male> so many of these students had come from households where english isn't spoken in the home where many of them have different
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 128.16 136.33 <o,f0,male> they would talk to me about this and say you know what we really need is just more people more bodies more one on one attention more hours more
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 137.15 146.82 <o,f0,male> expertise from people that have skills in english and can work with these students one on one now i would say well why don't you just work with them one on one and they would say well
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 147.15 157.32 <o,f0,male> we have five classes of thirty to forty students each this can lead up to one hundred and fifty one hundred and eighty two hundred students a day how can we possibly give each student even one hour
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 159.35 165.02 <o,f0,male> of one on one attention you'd have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers and so
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 166.38 172.85 <o,f0,male> we started talking about this and at the same time i thought about this massive group of people i knew writers editors journalists
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 175.27 180.44 <o,f0,male> graduate students assistant professors you name it all these people that had sort of flexible daily hours and
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 180.68 182.21 <o,f0,male> an interest in the english word
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 183.68 189.34 <o,f0,male> i hope to have an interest in the english language but i'm not speaking it
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 189.54 193.15 <o,f0,male> well right now i'm trying that clock has got me
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 198.70 208.12 <o,f0,male> written word in terms of nurturing a democracy nurturing an enlightened life and so they had you know their
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 208.32 216.16 <o,f0,male> time and their interest but at the same time there wasn't a conduit that i knew of in my community to bring these two communities together so when i moved back to
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 218.16 225.20 <o,f0,male> we rented this building and the idea was to put mcsweeney 's mcsweeney 's quarterly that we published twice or three times a year
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 225.38 227.13 <o,f0,male> and a few other magazines we were going to
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 228.62 237.56 <o,f0,male> move it into an office for the first time it used to be in my kitchen in brooklyn we were going to move it into an office and we were going to actually share space with a tutoring center so we thought
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 238.60 245.60 <o,f0,male> have all these writers and editors and everybody sort of a writing community coming into the office every day anyway why don't we just open up the front of the building
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 246.24 254.26 <o,f0,male> to come in there after school get extra help on their written homework so you have basically no border between these two communities so
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 255.41 267.91 <o,f0,male> the idea was that we would be working on whatever we're working on at two thirty the students flow in and you put down what you're doing or you trade or you work a little bit later or whatever it is you give those hours in the afternoon to the students in the neighborhood so
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 283.36 285.58 <o,f0,male> so we rented this space and everything was
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 295.77 309.08 <o,f0,male> really and we couldn't think of anything necessarily to sell but we did all the necessary research it used to be a weight room so there were rubber floors below acoustic tile ceilings fluorescent lights we took all that down and we found
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 309.83 317.69 <o,f0,male> beautiful wooden floors whitewashed beams and it had the look while we were renovating this place somebody said you know it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 318.39 325.26 <o,f0,male> and we looked around and somebody else said well you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer and so
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 332.80 334.63 <o,f0,male> that let 's sell pirate supplies
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 336.28 345.93 <o,f0,male> this is the pirate supply store you see this is sort of a sketch i did on a napkin a great carpenter built all this stuff and you see we made it look sort of
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 346.39 355.41 <o,f0,male> pirate supply like here you see planks sold by the foot and we have supplies to combat scurvy we have the peg legs
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 356.35 369.14 <o,f0,male> there that are all handmade and fitted to you up at the top you see the eyepatch display which is the black column there for everyday use your regular eyepatch and then you have the pastel and other colors for stepping out
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 379.28 385.85 <o,f0,male> this is a vat that we fill with treasures that students dig in this is replacement eyes in case you lose one
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 386.74 389.30 <o,f0,male> these are some signs that we have all over the place
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 390.52 391.16 <o,f0,male> with pirates
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 392.67 396.23 <o,f0,male> reading the sign we pull a rope behind the counter and
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 396.95 402.90 <o,f0,male> mop heads drop on your head that was just my one thing i said we had to have something that drops on people
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 404.56 406.52 <o,f0,male> it became mop heads and
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 407.41 411.11 <o,f0,male> this is the fish theater which is just a saltwater tank with three seats
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 413.57 414.84 <o,f0,male> and then right behind it
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 421.90 427.74 <o,f0,male> the mcsweeney 's offices where all of us would be working on the magazine and book editing and like that the kids would come in
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 428.23 436.66 <o,f0,male> or we thought they would come in i should back up we set the place up we opened up we spent months and months renovating this place
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 438.48 447.19 <o,f0,male> we had tables chairs computers everything i went to a dot com auction at a holiday inn in palo alto and i bought eleven g four s with a stroke of
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 452.51 454.35 <o,f0,male> we bought em we set everything up
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 454.88 456.52 <o,f0,male> and then we waited
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 468.86 477.63 <o,f0,male> and writing related needs just come in it's all free and we thought oh they're going to storm the gates they're gonna love it and they didn 't and so
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 478.12 486.00 <o,f0,male> we waited we sat at the tables we waited and waited and everybody was becoming very discouraged because it was weeks and weeks that we waited really where nobody
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 486.20 491.89 <o,f0,male> came in and then somebody alerted us to the fact that maybe there was a trust
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 492.15 493.65 <o,f0,male> gap because
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 502.71 508.42 <o,f0,male> we never put it together you know and so then around that time
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 509.42 515.42 <o,f0,male> i persuaded a woman named nineveh caligari a longtime san francisco educator she was teaching in mexico city
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 516.30 526.81 <o,f0,male> the experience necessary knew everything about education was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood i convinced her to move up from mexico city where she was teaching she took over as executive director immediately
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 527.34 536.38 <o,f0,male> she made the inroads with the teachers and the parents and the students and everything and so suddenly it was actually full every day and what we were trying to offer every day
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 536.72 547.63 <o,f0,male> one on one attention the goal was to have a one to one ratio with every one of these students you know it's been proven that thirty five to forty hours a year with one on one attention a student can get one grade level higher and so
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 556.70 569.17 <o,f0,male> right there the parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tutored so that was the basis of it was one on one attention and we found ourselves full every day with kids if you're on valencia street within those few blocks
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 570.27 581.10 <o,f0,male> around two zero two thirty you will get run over often by the kids and their big backpacks or whatever actually running to this space which is very strange because it's school in a way but
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 601.90 614.53 <o,f0,male> our interns were actually working at the same tables very often and shoulder to shoulder computer next to computer with the students and so it became a tutoring center publishing center is what we called it and a writing center they go
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 615.03 622.16 <o,f0,male> and they might be working with a high school student actually working on a novel because we had very gifted kids too so there's no stigma they're all working next to each other
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 633.55 644.17 <o,f0,male> feeds on each other there's a lot of cross pollination the only problem especially for the adults working at mcsweeney 's who hadn't necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up was that there was just the one
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 647.13 647.30 <o,f0,male> like
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 648.28 656.38 <o,f0,male> this is a problem but you know there's something about the kids finishing their homework in a given day working one on one getting all this attention they go home
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 656.88 665.18 <o,f0,male> they don't stall they don't do their homework in front of the tv they're allowed to go home at five thirty enjoy their family enjoy other hobbies get outside
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 665.63 675.36 <o,f0,male> play and that makes a happy family a bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community a bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world so the key to it all is homework
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 680.92 694.47 <o,f0,male> one on one attention so we started off with about twelve volunteers and then we had about fifty and then a couple hundred and we now have one thousand four hundred volunteers on our roster and we make it incredibly easy to volunteer the key thing is
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 724.05 732.72 <o,f0,male> has to be used before two thirty so we started bringing in classes during the day so every day there's a field trip where they together create a book you can see it being typed up above
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 733.29 742.15 <o,f0,male> this is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing you just point a camera at a class and it always looks like this so
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 742.93 750.16 <o,f0,male> this is one of the books that they do notice the title of the book the book that was never checked out titanic and
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 750.41 752.12 <o,f0,male> the first line of that book is
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 755.17 757.58 <o,f0,male> once there was a book named cindy
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 758.69 760.72 <o,f0,male> that was about the titanic so
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 764.32 772.99 <o,f0,male> it completely seriously which blows their mind so then we still had more tutors to use this is a shot of just some of the tutors during one
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 774.41 781.52 <o,f0,male> the teachers that we work with and everything is different to teachers they tell us what to do we went in there thinking we 're ultimately completely malleable you're going to tell us
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 788.62 795.53 <o,f0,male> what about the students that wouldn't come to you necessarily who don't have really active parents that are bringing them or aren't close enough
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 829.80 838.18 <o,f0,male> thousands and thousands more students then another school said well what if we just give you a classroom and you can staff it all day so this is the everett middle school
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 847.59 856.03 <o,f0,male> this is their newspaper the straight up news that has an ongoing column from mayor gavin newsom in both languages english and spanish
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 856.85 865.07 <o,f0,male> so then one day isabel allende wrote to us and said hey why don't you assign a book with high school students i want them to write about how
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 865.44 872.95 <o,f0,male> to achieve peace in a violent world and so we went into thurgood marshall high school which is a school that we had worked with on some other things and
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 873.66 883.22 <o,f0,male> we gave that assignment to the students and we said isabel allende is going to read all your essays at the end she's going to publish them in a book she's going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form it's going to be available
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 891.70 899.37 <o,f0,male> was that outside audience there was isabel allende on the other end i think we had about one hundred and seventy tutors that worked on this book with them
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 900.63 914.93 <o,f0,male> and so this worked out incredibly well we had a big party at the end this is a book that you can find anywhere so that led to a series of these you can see amy tan sponsored the next one i might get somewhere and this became an ongoing thing more and more books now
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 916.35 927.05 <o,f0,male> we're sort of addicted to the book thing the kids will work harder than they've ever worked in their life if they know it's going to be permanent know it's going to be on a shelf know that nobody can diminish what they've thought and said that
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 928.01 935.11 <o,f0,male> words honored their thoughts with hundreds of hours of five drafts six drafts all this attention that we give to their thoughts and
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 935.40 942.66 <o,f0,male> once they achieve that level once they've written at that level they can never go back it's absolutely transformative and so then they're all sold in the store
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 943.32 946.31 <o,f0,male> this is near the planks we sell all the
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 947.73 949.46 <o,f0,male> where else would you put them right so
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 950.78 960.66 <o,f0,male> we sell em and then something weird had been happening with the stores the store actually even though we started out as just a gag the store actually made money
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 963.30 964.97 <o,f0,male> it was paying the rent and
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 965.36 978.98 <o,f0,male> this is just a san francisco thing i don't know i don't want to judge but people would come in and this was before the pirate movies and everything it was making a lot of money not a lot of money but it was paying the rent paying a full time staff member there there's the ocean maps you can see on the left
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 980.46 989.28 <o,f0,male> and it became a gateway to the community people would come in and say what the what is this i don't want to swear on the web
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 993.42 998.95 <o,f0,male> a rule i don't know they would say what is this and people would come in
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 999.69 1004.42 <o,f0,male> and learn more about it and then right beyond there's usually a little chain there right beyond they would see the kids
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 1004.55 1016.47 <o,f0,male> being tutored this is a field trip going on and so they would be shopping and they might be more likely to buy some lard or millet for their parrot or you know a hook or hook protector for nighttime all of these things we sell
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 1017.47 1025.73 <o,f0,male> so the store actually did really well but it brought in so many people teachers donors volunteers everybody because it was street level it was open to the public it wasn't a non profit buried
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 1026.03 1033.49 <o,f0,male> you know on the thirtieth floor of some building downtown it was right in the neighborhood that it was serving and it was open all the time to the public so it became this sort of
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 1034.64 1042.57 <o,f0,male> happy accident so all the people i used to know in brooklyn they said well why don't we have a place like that here and a lot of them had been former educators or would be educators
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 1042.90 1049.21 <o,f0,male> so they combined with a lot of local designers local writers and they just took the idea independently and they did their own thing
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 1049.47 1058.89 <o,f0,male> they didn't want to sell pirate supplies they didn't think that that was going to work there so knowing the crime fighting community in new york they opened the brooklyn
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 1059.88 1069.76 <o,f0,male> company this is sam potts great design that did this and this was to make it look sort of like one of those keysmith 's shops that has to have every service they've ever offered you know all
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 1076.69 1087.11 <o,f0,male> basic form these are all handmade these are all sort of repurposed other products or whatever all the packaging is done by sam potts so then you have the villain containment unit where kids put their parents
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 1088.67 1095.06 <o,f0,male> have the office this is a little vault you have put your product in there it goes up an electric lift
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 1106.44 1109.53 <o,f0,male> do it hand on heart and everything these are some
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 1113.75 1122.37 <o,f0,male> this is a secret identity kit if you want to take on the identity of sharon boone one american female marketing executive from hoboken new jersey it's a full dossier on everything you would need to know
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 1124.49 1126.59 <o,f0,male> so this is the capery where
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 1127.67 1136.75 <o,f0,male> get fitted for your cape and then you walk up these three steel graded steps and then we turn on three hydraulic fans from every side and then you can see the cape in action
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 1137.44 1142.25 <o,f0,male> there's nothing worse than you know getting up there and the cape is bunching up or something like that
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 1148.63 1155.55 <o,f0,male> in but it slowly opens you can see it there in the middle next to all the grappling hooks it opens and then this is the tutoring center in the back
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 1162.97 1175.51 <o,f0,male> this is i just want to emphasize locally funded locally built all the designers all of the builders everybody was local all the time was pro bono i just came and visited and said yes you guys are doing great or whatever that was it you can see the time in all five boroughs of new york in the back
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 1181.43 1192.67 <o,f0,male> so this is the space during tutoring hours it's very busy same principles one on one attention complete devotion to the students work and a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility of creativity and ideas and
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 1206.98 1217.04 <o,f0,male> you can read this quote addicted to video games and tv couldn't concentrate at home came in got this concentrated attention and he couldn't escape it so soon enough
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 1217.67 1228.52 <o,f0,male> he was writing he would finish his homework early got really addicted to finishing his homework early it's an addictive thing to sort of be done with it and to have it checked and to know he 's going to achieve the next thing and be prepared for school the next day
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 1228.83 1236.99 <o,f0,male> so he got hooked on that and then he started doing other things he 's now been published in five books he co wrote a mockumentary about failed superheroes called super has beens
DaveEggers_2008 1 DaveEggers_2008 1238.85 1241.61 <o,f0,male> he wrote a series on penguin
