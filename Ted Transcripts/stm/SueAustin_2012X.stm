SueAustin_2012X 1 SueAustin_2012X 13.44 20.66 <o,f0,female> to be here to talk about my journey to talk about the wheelchair and the freedom it has bought
SueAustin_2012X 1 SueAustin_2012X 20.66 29.25 <o,f0,female> i started using a wheelchair sixteen years ago when an extended illness changed the way i could access the world
SueAustin_2012X 1 SueAustin_2012X 29.62 47.45 <o,f0,female> when i started using the wheelchair it was a tremendous new freedom i 'd seen my life slip away and become restricted it was like having an enormous new toy i could whiz around and feel the wind in my face again just being out on the street was exhilarating
SueAustin_2012X 1 SueAustin_2012X 67.04 68.59 <o,f0,female> to be in a wheelchair
SueAustin_2012X 1 SueAustin_2012X 74.48 80.41 <o,f0,female> they used words like limitation fear pity and restriction
SueAustin_2012X 1 SueAustin_2012X 104.99 114.82 <o,f0,female> as a result i knew i needed to make my own stories about this experience new narratives to reclaim my identity
SueAustin_2012X 1 SueAustin_2012X 145.56 149.75 <o,f0,female> by creating unexpected images
SueAustin_2012X 1 SueAustin_2012X 155.46 167.45 <o,f0,female> when i literally started leaving traces of my joy and freedom it was exciting to see the interested and surprised responses from people
SueAustin_2012X 1 SueAustin_2012X 167.77 170.98 <o,f0,female> it seemed to open up new perspectives
SueAustin_2012X 1 SueAustin_2012X 182.71 192.78 <o,f0,female> so when i began to dive in two thousand and five i realized scuba gear extends your range of activity in just the same way as a wheelchair does
SueAustin_2012X 1 SueAustin_2012X 208.94 211.59 <o,f0,female> and the underwater wheelchair
SueAustin_2012X 1 SueAustin_2012X 211.73 218.2 <o,f0,female> that has resulted has taken me on the most amazing journey over the last seven years
SueAustin_2012X 1 SueAustin_2012X 218.39 231.14 <o,f0,female> so to give you an idea of what that 's like i 'd like to share with you one of the outcomes from creating this spectacle and show you what an amazing journey it 's taken me on
SueAustin_2012X 1 SueAustin_2012X 311.04 312.76 <o,f0,female> the
SueAustin_2012X 1 SueAustin_2012X 448.86 455.31 <o,f0,female> amazing experience beyond most other things i 've experienced in life i literally have
SueAustin_2012X 1 SueAustin_2012X 463.32 474.19 <o,f0,female> and the incredibly unexpected thing is that other people seem to see and feel that too their eyes literally light up and they say things like
SueAustin_2012X 1 SueAustin_2012X 492 494.87 <o,f0,female> they have to think in a completely
SueAustin_2012X 1 SueAustin_2012X 495.34 505.41 <o,f0,female> and i think that moment of completely new thought perhaps creates a freedom that spreads to the rest of other people 's lives
SueAustin_2012X 1 SueAustin_2012X 511.72 517.15 <o,f0,female> the joy it brings when instead of focusing on loss or limitation
SueAustin_2012X 1 SueAustin_2012X 517.36 529.74 <o,f0,female> we see and discover the power and joy of seeing the world from exciting new perspectives for me the wheelchair becomes a vehicle for transformation
SueAustin_2012X 1 SueAustin_2012X 535.06 553.99 <o,f0,female> pushed me through into a new way of being into new dimensions and into a new level of consciousness and the other thing is that because nobody 's seen or heard of an underwater wheelchair before and creating this spectacle is about creating new ways of seeing being and knowing
SueAustin_2012X 1 SueAustin_2012X 553.99 557.21 <o,f0,female> now you have this concept in your mind
