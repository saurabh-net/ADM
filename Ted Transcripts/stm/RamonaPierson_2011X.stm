RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 16.39 32.04 <o,f0,female> going to share something with you i haven 't talked about probably in more than ten years so bear with me as i take you through this journey when i was twenty two years old i came home from work put a leash on my dog and went for my usual run
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 32.04 46 <o,f0,female> i had no idea that at that moment my life was going to change forever while i was preparing my dog for the run a man was finishing drinking at a bar picked up his car keys got into a car
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 46 50.42 <o,f0,female> headed south or wherever he was
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 50.42 67.43 <o,f0,female> i was running across the street and the only thing that i actually remember is feeling like a grenade went off in my head and i remember putting my hands on the ground and feeling my life 's blood emptying out of my neck and my mouth
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 67.43 83.14 <o,f0,female> what had happened is he ran a red light and hit me and my dog she ended up underneath the car i flew out in front of the car and then he ran over my legs my left leg got caught up in the wheel well spun it around
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 86.28 93.54 <o,f0,female> the bumper of the car hit my throat slicing it open i ended up with blunt chest trauma
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 93.54 102.03 <o,f0,female> your aorta comes up behind your heart it 's your major artery and it was severed so my blood was gurgling out of my mouth
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 108.48 111.85 <o,f0,female> i had no idea what was going on but strangers intervened
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 111.85 115.36 <o,f0,female> kept my heart moving beating
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 115.36 121.06 <o,f0,female> i say moving because it was quivering and they were trying to put a beat back into it
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 121.06 134.17 <o,f0,female> somebody was smart and put a bic pen in my neck to open up my airway so that i could get some air in there and my lung collapsed so somebody cut me open and put a pin in there as well to stop
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 147.43 156.6 <o,f0,female> eighteen months later i woke up i was blind i couldn 't speak and i couldn 't walk i was sixty four lbs
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 169.96 171.54 <o,f0,female> i
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 171.54 185.6 <o,f0,female> i had so many surgeries to put my neck back together to repair my heart a few times some things worked some things didn 't i had lots of titanium put in me cadaver bones to try to get my feet moving the right way
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 185.6 192.05 <o,f0,female> and i ended up with a plastic nose porcelain teeth and all kinds of other things but eventually i started to look human again
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 192.05 198.97 <o,f0,male> but
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 198.97 217.26 <o,f0,female> it 's hard sometimes to talk about these things so bear with me i had more than fifty surgeries but who 's counting so eventually the hospital decided it was time for me to go they needed to open up space for somebody else that they thought could
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 225.15 231.95 <o,f0,female> so they basically put a map up on the wall threw a dart and it landed at a senior home here in colorado
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 231.95 243.09 <o,f0,female> and i know all of you are scratching your head a senior citizens home what in the world are you going to do there but if you think about all of the skills and talent that are in this room right now
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 298.43 303.92 <o,f0,female> they eventually started matching their talents and skills to all of my needs
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 303.92 321.84 <o,f0,female> but one of the first things they needed to do was assess what i needed right away i needed to figure out how to eat like a normal human being since i 'd been eating through a tube in my chest and through my veins so i had to go through trying to eat again and they went through that process
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 321.84 335.48 <o,f0,female> and then they had to figure out well she needs furniture she is sleeping in the corner of this apartment so they went to their storage lockers and all gathered their extra furniture gave me pots and pans blankets
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 335.48 338.6 <o,f0,male> everything
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 338.6 349.36 <o,f0,female> and then the next thing that i needed was a makeover so out went the green scrubs and in came the polyester and floral prints
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 387.42 392.04 <o,f0,female> you 're a kid you take things for granted you learn things unconsciously
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 407.67 418.21 <o,f0,female> but the men had a better idea they were going to make it fun for me so they were teaching me cuss word scrabble at night
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 426.76 433.49 <o,f0,female> so i 'm going to just leave it to your imagination as to what my first words were
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 434.23 437.63 <o,f0,female> when sally finally got my confidence built
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 448.43 452.56 <o,f0,female> the redundancy was actually good for me so we 'll just keep moving on
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 459.41 475.46 <o,f0,female> one of the pivotal times for me was actually learning to cross a street again as a blind person so close your eyes now imagine you have to cross a street you don 't know how far that street is
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 475.46 481.63 <o,f0,female> and you don 't know if you 're going straight and you hear cars whizzing back and forth
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 481.63 489.23 <o,f0,female> and you had a horrible accident that landed you in this situation so there were two obstacles i had to get through
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 489.23 503.33 <o,f0,female> one was post traumatic stress disorder and every time i approached the corner or the curb i would panic and the second one was actually trying to figure out how to cross that street
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 503.33 515.22 <o,f0,female> so one of the seniors just came up to me and she pushed me up to the corner and she said when you think it 's time to go just stick the cane out there if it 's hit don 't cross the street
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 522.85 526.93 <o,f0,female> but by the third cane that went whizzing across the road
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 532.35 551.92 <o,f0,female> so that i could go to the braille institute and actually gain the skills to be a blind person and also to go get a guide dog who transformed my life and i was able to return to college because of the senior citizens who invested in me and also the guide dog and skill set i had gained
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 551.92 566.05 <o,f0,female> ten years later i gained my sight back not magically i opted in for three surgeries and one of them was experimental it was actually robotic surgery they removed a hematoma from behind my eye
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 568.34 572.8 <o,f0,female> the biggest change for me was that the world moved forward
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 587.75 593.36 <o,f0,female> how you feel about things and how things sound and how things smell
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 593.36 607.02 <o,f0,female> so one day i was in my room and i saw this thing sitting in my room and i thought it was a monster so i was walking around it and i go i 'm just going to touch it and i touched it and i went oh my god
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 612.47 629.85 <o,f0,female> everything is different when you 're a sighted person because you take that for granted but when you 're blind you have the tactile memory for things the biggest change for me was looking down at my hands and seeing that i 'd lost ten years of my life
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 629.85 642.8 <o,f0,female> i thought that time had stood still for some reason and moved on for family and friends but when i looked down i realized that time marched on for me too and that i needed to get caught up so i got going on it
RamonaPierson_2011X 1 RamonaPierson_2011X 642.8 656.9 <o,f0,female> we didn 't have words like crowd sourcing and radical collaboration when i had my accident but the concept held true people working with people to rebuild me people working with people to re educate me
