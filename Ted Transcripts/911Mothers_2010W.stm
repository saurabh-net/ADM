911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 17.27 19.19 <o,f0,female> today because of
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 29.11 39.4 <o,f0,female> i first learned that my son had been in the world trade center on the morning of september eleventh two thousand and one
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 39.94 50.09 <o,f0,female> we didn 't know if he had perished yet until thirty six hours later at the time
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 50.79 53.07 <o,f0,female> we knew that it was political
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 53.8 59.69 <o,f0,female> we were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of our son my husband orlando and i
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 61.78 66.21 <o,f0,female> and our family and when i saw it and yet through the shock
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 66.92 69.3 <o,f0,female> the terrible shock and the terrible
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 69.41 73.44 <o,f0,female> explosion in our lives literally
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 73.63 75.21 <o,f0,female> we were not vengeful
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 81.63 85.49 <o,f0,female> on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 86.55 91.18 <o,f0,female> and the u s government called for a death penalty for him if convicted
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 91.82 94.22 <o,f0,female> my husband and i spoke out
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 94.49 101.04 <o,f0,female> in opposition to that publicly through that and through human rights
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 101.22 109.16 <o,f0,female> groups we were brought together with several other victims families when i saw aicha in the media
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 109.16 129.01 <o,f0,female> coming over when her son was indicted and i thought what a brave woman someday i want to meet that woman when i 'm stronger i was still in deep grief i knew i didn 't have the strength i knew i would find her someday or we would find each other because when people heard that my son
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 129.47 132.33 <o,f0,female> was a victim i got immediate sympathy
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 133.5 149.91 <o,f0,female> but when people learned what her son was accused of she didn 't get that sympathy but her suffering is equal to mine so we met in november two thousand and two and aicha will now tell you how that came about
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 185.44 195.56 <o,f0,female> introduced me to five families and i saw phyllis and i watched
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 208.99 212.39 <o,f0,female> and i saw in her eyes that she was a mother just like me
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 221.91 241.23 <o,f0,female> i was married when i was fourteen i lost a child when i was fifteen a second child when i was sixteen so the story with zacarias was too much really
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 278.64 283.95 <o,f0,female> so that 's why i decided to tell my story so that my suffering is something positive for other women
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 288.86 291.41 <o,f0,female> all the women all the mothers
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 299.25 307.6 <o,f0,female> it 's up to us women because we are women because we love our children
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 319.87 324.63 <o,f0,female> it 's not against women it 's for us for us women for
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 335.05 341.14 <o,f0,female> i talk against violence against terrorism i go to schools to talk to young muslim
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 341.67 346.63 <o,f0,female> girls so they don 't accept to be married against their will very young
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 358.89 367.95 <o,f0,female> so if i can save one of the young girls and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as i did well this is something
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 375 376.72 <o,f0,female> i have learned so much
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 397.35 403.83 <o,f0,female> family members but we were all so nervous why does she want to meet us
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 403.97 410.24 <o,f0,female> and then she was nervous why did we want to meet her what did we want from each other
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 411.26 416.58 <o,f0,female> before we knew each others names or anything we had embraced
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 416.93 420.04 <o,f0,female> and wept then we sat in a circle
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 420.62 429.31 <o,f0,female> with support with help from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation and aicha started and she said
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 430.94 441.54 <o,f0,female> i don 't know if my son is guilty or innocent but i want to tell you how sorry i am for what happened to your families
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 442.54 445.13 <o,f0,female> i know what it is to suffer
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 445.8 453.09 <o,f0,female> and i feel that if there is a crime a person should be tried fairly and punished
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 454.61 456.7 <o,f0,female> but
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 456.7 466.58 <o,f0,female> she reached out to us in that way and it was i 'd like to say it was an ice breaker and what happened then is we all told our stories
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 467.5 474.48 <o,f0,female> and we all connected as human beings by the end of the afternoon it was about three hours after lunch
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 475.01 491.46 <o,f0,female> we 'd felt as if we 'd known each other forever now what i learned from her is a woman not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then and what was being done to her son but the life she 's had i never had met
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 491.48 499.56 <o,f0,female> someone with such a hard life from such a totally different culture and environment from my own
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 510.96 514.01 <o,f0,female> being afraid of the other but making that step
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 515.21 522.96 <o,f0,female> and then realizing hey this wasn 't so hard who else can i meet that i don 't know or that i 'm so different from
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 524.46 527.12 <o,f0,female> so aicha do you have
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 527.18 532.9 <o,f0,female> a couple of words for conclusion because our time is up
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 540.08 545.19 <o,f0,female> i wanted to say that we have to try to know other people the other
911Mothers_2010W 1 911Mothers_2010W 566.85 574.31 <o,f0,female> and i hope that someday we 'll all live together in peace and respecting each other this is what i wanted to say
