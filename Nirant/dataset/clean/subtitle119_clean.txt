Has anyone ever been to Aspen, Colorado? It's not a joke yet; those aren't the jokes. Is this thing off? I went to Aspen recently and stumbled into this song. ♫ Black men go to Aspen ♫ ♫ and rent colorful chalets. ♫ ♫ Giggle at the questions ♫ ♫ their mere presence seems to raise. ♫ ♫ Get taken for men ♫ ♫ we don't resemble in the least. ♫ "Are you ... ?" "No." ♫ It's a winter wonderland ♫ ♫ in the belly of the beast. ♫ ♫ And black men ski. ♫ ♫ Black men ski. ♫ ♫ Black men send back sushi ♫ ♫ with a scorned Yakuza's flair. ♫ ♫ We make postmodern art ♫ ♫ with bacon grease ♫ ♫ and hot combed hair. ♫ ♫ We secretly play Beethoven ♫ ♫ inside our bassmobiles. ♫ ♫ We can tell you how cool looks ♫ ♫ but cannot show you how it feels ♫ ♫ when black men ski. ♫ ♫ When black men ski. ♫ ♫ Black men now are students ♫ ♫ of gay sensibility. ♫ ♫ We wear ironic T-shirts ♫ ♫ drenched in code unknown to thee. ♫ ♫ We get baptized in Walden Pond ♫ ♫ amongst a searing mob ♫ ♫ because the cleansing blood of Jesus ♫ ♫ could not do a thorough job. ♫ ♫ Black men ski. ♫ ♫ Black men ski. ♫ ♫ Chinese guys can jump real high ♫ ♫ and Germans cook soul food. ♫ ♫ White boys rap and hippies nap ♫ ♫ their dreads up to look rude. ♫ ♫ Jazz is now suburban ♫ ♫ it's Marsalisly clean. ♫ ♫ And now we've got Viagra ♫ ♫ everyone's a sex machine. ♫ ♫ So black men ski. ♫ What else can we do? ♫ Black men ski. ♫ ♫ Black men ski. ♫ ♫ Black men ski. ♫ ♫ Some kids I'll describe as friends ♫ ♫ say I am race-obsessed. ♫ ♫ The luxury of your opinion ♫ ♫ shows that you are blessed. ♫ ♫ See, I have poems about sunsets ♫ ♫ flowers and the rain. ♫ ♫ I've read them to policemen ♫ ♫ but it was all in vain. ♫ ♫ So black men ski. ♫ ♫ Black men ski ... ♫ elegantly. ♫ Black men ski. ♫ ♫ Black men ski. ♫
