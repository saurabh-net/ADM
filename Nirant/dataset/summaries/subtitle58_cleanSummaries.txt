(Applause) Chris Anderson: An amazing presentation.
Pandemic bird flu -- early detection, early response.
(Applause) I feel like Hank Aaron.
Audience: Early detection, early response.
Blindness, polio -- early detection, early response.
(Applause) Hello, Ron.
Immediate detection, immediate response.
Smallpox -- early detection, early response.
And I said, yes, I would do that, so I became the doctor in an absolutely awful movie called "Medicine Ball Caravan."
(Applause) Bird flu.
Day one, day two, day three, day four, day five, day six.
But in that year, smallpox exploded throughout India.
(Laughter) LB: Well, you know, as Ron St. John -- I hope you'll go and meet him in the dinner afterwards and talk to him -- When he started GPHIN -- In 1997, there was an outbreak of bird flu.
It initially goes quite slowly.
The polio surveillance program is four million people going door to door.
We're close.
It's the Global Public Health Information Network.
I'm going to ask you to repeat that: early detection, early response.
(Laughter) (Applause) But in all seriousness -- because this idea is birthed in TED, I would like it to be a legacy of TED, and I'd like to call it the "International System for Total Early Disease Detection."
And over the last 27 years, Seva's programs in 15 countries have given back sight to more than two million blind people.
I've probably had 50 women die.
As many as 165 million people would die.
