Richard Baraniuk: This costs 22 dollars to the student.
And my day job, as Chris said, I'm an electrical engineering professor.
We get over 500,000 unique visitors per month, just to our particular site.
They've been swept away over the last two decades by these types of world-flattening digitization technologies, right?
I teach signal processing and my challenge was to show that this math -- wow, about half of you have already fallen asleep just looking at the equation -- (Laughter) but this seemingly dry math is actually the center of this tremendously powerful web that links technology -- that links really cool applications like music synthesizers to tremendous economic opportunities, but also governed by intellectual property.

Her material is now used over 600,000 times per month.
So, the first thing I'd like you to do is a little thought experiment.
They're actually developing a lot of their science and engineering curriculum to spread widely around the world in our system and they're also trying to develop all of their software tools completely open-source.
