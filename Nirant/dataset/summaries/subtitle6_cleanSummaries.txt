I think single-cell organisms are possible within two years.
From one site, from one barrel of seawater, we discovered 1.3 million new genes and as many as 50,000 new species.
And we think in a gene-centric view -- maybe going back to Richard Dawkins' ideas -- than in a genome-centric view, which are different constructs of these gene components.
I think future engineered species could be the source of food, hopefully a source of energy, environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry.
And here's that same DNA automatically reassembled 24 hours later.
And we started the Sorcerer II Expedition, where we were, as with great oceanographic expeditions, trying to sample the ocean every 200 miles.
Haemophilus had 1,800 genes.
Some of these make logical sense, in terms of different temperature gradients.
Within a short while, I think there's going to be a new field called "Combinatorial Genomics," because with these new synthesis capabilities, these vast gene array repertoires and the homologous recombination, we think we can design a robot to make maybe a million different chromosomes a day.
And that is, I understand that optimists greatly outlive pessimists.
And there's only two countries, the U.S. and the former Soviet Union, that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents.
