I'm thinking, "Wow, that was great -- (Laughter) -- please lady, don't say another word."
500 years ago, sailing ships started getting reliable enough; we found a new continent.
Because technically I've got motors; I've got wheels -- I'm a motor vehicle.
If -- in China, in the year 1998, 417 million people used bicycles; 1.7 million people used cars.
We've been working on this, actually, as an alternative energy source, starting way back with Johnson & Johnson, to run an iBOT, because the best batteries you could get -- 10 watt-hours per kilogram in lead, 20 watt-hours per kilogram nickel-cadmium, 40 watt-hours per kilogram in nickel-metal hydride, 60 watt-hours per kilogram in lithium, 8,750 watt-hours of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline -- which is why nobody drives electric cars.
In 5,000 years, we've gone backwards in getting around cities.
150 years ago, locomotives got efficient enough, steam power, that we turned the continent into a country.
(Laughter) Yesterday, the automotive guys gave us some new insights.
And Henry Ford, just about 100 years ago, started cranking out Model Ts.
If this thing goes only three times as fast as walking -- three times -- a 30-minute walk becomes 10 minutes.
We've got to start building cities and human environments where a 150-pound person can go a couple of miles in a dense, rich, green-space environment, without being in a 4,000-pound machine to do it.
And if you just look at how technology has been applied, we've solved all the long-range, high-speed, high-volume, large-weight problems of moving things around.
They've gotten bigger; they're spread out.
And so I said, "Sure."
Cars were not meant for parallel parking; they're wonderful machines to go between cities, but just think about it: we've solved all the long-range, high-speed problems.
