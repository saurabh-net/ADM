When I see these animations, oh Jesus, I'm blown away.
They're fitted like Formula One.
My world is the world of people like Amory Lovins, Janine Benyus, James Watson.
DNA: Design, Nature, Art.
When I look into these data images, I see new things.
I walk -- I'm traveling.
This is an idea for a gas-injected, one-piece polymer chair.
A three-wheeled car: slow, feminine, transparent, so you can see the people in there.
It's like 21st-century Henry Moore.
A few years ago I reinvented my process to keep up with people like Greg Lynn, Tom Main, Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas -- all these people that I think are persevering and pioneering with fantastic new ideas of how to create form.
It takes away anything extraneous.
(Laughter) Who cares?
(Laughter) Actually, I put marijuana in everything I cooked -- (Laughter) -- and I had access to all the best girls.
Single-surface products.
It's got a vacuum-formed, carbon-nylon pan.
I would love to build this one day, and perhaps I'd like to build it also out of flour, sugar, polymer, wood chips -- I don't know, human hair.
You know, I mean.
These interrelated forms, they do inspire everything I do although I might end up making something incredibly simple.
This -- sorry -- (Laughter) -- that's a solar seed.
(Laughter) Okay.
It fits arthritic hands.
Lean, efficient things.
Took about two years, because I'm looking for fat-free design.
(Laughter) I'm delivering; they're not taking.
It's a bio-polycarbonate new chair I'm doing in Italy.
It cost 1.7 million dollars to develop.
Here is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci, 500 years ago, before photography.
It's a gas-injected polymer chair.
They said, "Give us the dream.
I'm trying to build transportation systems.
So to try and get through today, I've kind of disciplined myself with an 18-minute talk.
It felt like nothing.
A copper jelly mold.
I said, "You get into biopolymers."
