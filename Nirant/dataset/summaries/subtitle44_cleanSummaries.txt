Now, when we think about changing human nature, the first thing that comes to mind are these human modification technologies -- growth hormone therapy, cosmetic surgery, stimulants like Ritalin, Adderall, anti-depressants, anabolic steroids, artificial hearts.
Intellectual capacity -- let's take that box, which falls into a lot of different sub-categories: memory, concentration, mental energy, intelligence, empathy.

So that would be, roughly, 324 people have died since I've begun speaking.

Library of Congress holds 18 million volumes.

We have skin enhancements, clothing.
52 million people die of natural causes each year corresponds, then, to 52 million volumes destroyed.
Bodily functionality and morphology and affective self-control.
