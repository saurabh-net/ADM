Jim Axelrod, CBS News, New York.
DR: We're looking from Fulton Street, west.
So we came up with a foundation, and actually what happened was one major developer in New York -- KA: Who shall remain nameless, I guess?
DR: Yeah, surprising.
(Laughter) DR: In fact, it was as if this was going to be window-washing scaffolding.
Dan Rather: Since the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center, many people have flocked to downtown New York to see and pay respects at what amounts to the 16-acre burial ground.
The city actually approached us.
KA: Sort of like the Spinal Tap scene where you get the tiny little Stonehenge, I guess?
And I found myself the Friday after September 11th -- two days afterwards -- literally unable to motivate anyone to do anything.
This was an unprecedented, singular design problem.
David Rockwell: The first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site but as this incredibly moving burial ground.
Tourist: I've taken my step-daughter here from Indianapolis.
Your work is highly sensual, even hedonistic.
DR: Well, I think one thing that shouldn't be done is evaluate -- I think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan.
And Kevin Kennon, Rick Scofidio, Liz Diller and all the people within the city -- Norman Lear, who I spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding, offered to give us a bridge loan to help us get through it.
So this developer said, "You know what, we'll underwrite the entire expense."
KA: Well, I think that's interesting.
Tom Otterness contributed, Maira Kalman contributed and it became this cathartic experience for us.
DR: Yeah.
KA: Shocking.
DR: Yeah.
