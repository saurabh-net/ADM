And whale oil lit practically every building.
In this eight-year period, 1977 to 85, when we last paid attention, the economy grew 27 percent, oil use fell 17 percent, oil imports fell 50 percent, oil imports from the Persian Gulf fell 87 percent.
For example, a billion-dollar prize for the first U.S. automaker to sell 200,000 really advanced vehicles, like some you saw earlier.
I showed here two years ago a little bit about a design of your basic, uncompromised, quintupled-efficiency suburban-assault vehicle -- (Laughter) -- and this is a complete virtual design that is production-costed manufacturable.
The plant also gets smaller.
Well, saving that fuel, 69 percent of the fuel in light vehicles costs about 57 cents per saved gallon.
And in the upper left, a pioneering effort 14 years ago by GM -- 84 miles a gallon without even using a hybrid, in a four-seater.
I'd like to deal with the lack of affordable personal mobility in this country by making it very cheaply possible for low-income families to get efficient, reliable, warranted new cars that they could otherwise never get.
And these policies work fine without taxes, subsidies or mandates.
How long do you think it will take before you can drive home your new wally-badged Shanghai automotive super-efficient car?
(Laughter) (Applause) Moreover, three-fourths of the fuel use is caused by the weight of the car.
And protect another million jobs now at risk, mainly in auto-making.
And for each car so financed, scrap almost one clunker, preferably the dirtiest ones.
The remnant whale populations were saved by technological innovators and profit-maximizing capitalists.
Each one is formed by one fairly cheap die set, instead of four expensive ones for stamping steel.
(Laughter) We can use less oil faster than they can conveniently sell less oil.
