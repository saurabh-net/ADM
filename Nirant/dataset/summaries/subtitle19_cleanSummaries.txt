(Laughter) Which also, I think, gets into a little bit of our current idea.
And the thing that I liked is sort of this one-click, add-to-your-cart button -- (Laughter) -- for buying steam valves.
It's short, bone handle, 50 bucks.
The same drives that we see towards ubiquity, towards diversity, towards socialization, towards complexity.
And so the general, long-term trends of evolution are roughly these five: ubiquity, diversity, specialization, complexity and socialization.
Differences, freedom, choices, possibilities.
That's what technology is bringing us: choices, possibilities, freedoms.
So you've got corn shellers.
Well, this is actually what we're headed towards: world machines.
This is a solar-powered sea slug.
In fact, you can buy, for 50 bucks, a stone-age knife made exactly the same way that they were made 10,000 years ago.
We also see specialization.
But at the other hand, a couple of years ago I gave up all of my possessions, sold all my technology -- except for a bicycle -- and rode across 3,000 miles on the U.S. back roads under the power of my one body, fuelled mostly by Twinkies and junk food.
And the last thing, I bring back this nudibranch.
You see 4,000 representative species, and you can see where we are.
The selfish gene.
So I took the great big 1895 Montgomery Ward's catalog and I randomly went through it.
And in Papua New Guinea, they were making stone axes until two decades ago, just as a course of practical matters.
Before that, obviously, technology didn't exist.
Now, I took that and said, OK, what are the long-term trends in technology?
Imagine Van Gogh being born before the technologies of cheap oil paints.
Be it corn shellers -- you've got ploughs; you've got fan mills; all these things -- and these are not, again, antiques.
