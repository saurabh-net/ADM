And I stumbled across something called "cancer stem cells."
And furthermore, that nervous tissue -- brain -- gets cancer, and brain cells are also terminally differentiated.
At first -- the first thing I did was I emailed some professors who specialized in skeletal muscle physiology, and pretty much said, "Hey, it seems like cancer doesn't really go to skeletal muscle.
If every time we tore a muscle or every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way, cancer occurred -- I mean, everybody would have cancer almost.
But I mean, why would they respond to a 14-year-old, anyway?
And hardly anyone responded.
Last summer I worked at Stanford University, doing some research on cancer stem cells.
It wasn't until I entered high school that I thought, "Maybe now, you know -- being a big high school kid -- I can maybe become an active part of this big medical world."
And my mother bought this book when we were at the Grand Canyon called "The Hot Zone."
And I guess I'll keep investigating until I get the answers.
And they seemed to have cell growth-promoting properties.
We're always moving our muscles.
And being naive about the whole field, I kind of thought, "Oh, you have cell death in Alzheimer's which is causing the memory deficit, and then you have this compound -- purine derivatives -- that are promoting cell growth."
And so I thought, "Maybe if it can promote cell growth, it can inhibit cell death, too."
If those diseases where tissues are deteriorating -- for example Alzheimer's, where the brain, the brain cells, die and we need to restore new brain cells, new functional brain cells -- what if we could, in the future, use cancer?
