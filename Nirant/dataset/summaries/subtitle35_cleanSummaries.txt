And Alex Hust said, "No."
It didn't give good x-ray photographs.
And that let Marshall Nirenberg, you know, take RNA -- synthetic RNA -- put it in a system making protein.
The next five years, there were essentially something like five references to our work in "Nature" -- none.
And so Bragg said, "Build models."
We got three million dollars.
I mean, big piece at the molecular level.
You know, basically, reading is a good thing; you get facts.
And x-ray crystallography is now a subject in, you know, chemistry departments.
(Laughter) So I had a really quite happy life at Indiana.
He made polyphenylalanine, polyphenylalanine.
There's Francis up on the upper right, and Alex Rich -- the M.D.-turned-crystallographer -- is next to me.
Well, I said, Linus was wrong and that we're still in the game and that they should immediately start building models.
by the great physicist, Schrodinger.
So I first went to Copenhagen because I thought, well, maybe I could become a biochemist, but I discovered biochemistry was very boring.
And -- except read.
But Wilkins, you know, thought DNA was the best bet, and he showed this x-ray photograph.
(Laughter) And, you know, I wrote a book.
And he knew, Francis knew Wilkins.
And so I came back with that news to Cambridge, and Bragg said, "Build models."
So I'll say something -- (Laughter) -- I'll say a little about, you know, how the discovery was made, and why Francis and I found it.
And there I met Francis Crick.
