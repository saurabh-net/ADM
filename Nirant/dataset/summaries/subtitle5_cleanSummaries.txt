They would come together, compare notes.
So we went to lunch -- (Laughter) And I've got to tell you, this was one seriously quiet lunch.
I went fucking ballistic, right?
Automobiles are self-moving things, right?
It turned out it was quite clever because Deep Blue, in a company like BMW, has a hook -- "Deep Blue," wow, cool name.
(Laughter) They disappeared, quite honestly, and all I got was postcards.
We've pretty much accepted the fact, though, that we are the women in the organization at BMW -- BMW is a very manly type business, -- men, men, men; it's engineers.
And if you're full of road rage, you've got a "Chevy: Like a Rock," right?
I said, "Guys, I'm thinking about something here, this isn't right.
I'm also going to steal a little quote out of "Little Prince."
Toothbrush, cool.
And I thought about this, and I thought, "You know, I'm not showing love here.
I discovered something about love and design through a project called Deep Blue.
And one was hoping that these two teams would get together, and this collusion of incredible creativity, under these incredible surroundings, and these incredibly stressed-out engineers, would create some incredible solutions.
He said, "Love is not selfish," he said, "Love does not mean counting how many times I say, 'I love you.'
Real quickly -- Michelangelo once said he's there to "discover the figure within," OK?
Based on a dictate premise that says, 'I'm a boss, you do what I say, without trust.'"
And I'm telling myself, "This is going to be a great car, they're doing research that I've never even thought about before."
So -- sent the team off, and actually something different happened.
And so we sent them off with this team name, Deep Blue.
I mean, I'm going to see so much work, it's so intense -- I know probably Las Vegas meant a lot about it, and I'm not really sure where the Grand Canyon came in either -- but somehow all this is going to come together, and I'm going to see some really great product.
