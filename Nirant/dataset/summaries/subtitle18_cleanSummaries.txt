And we're learning from neural nets, genetic algorithms, evolutionary computing.
Janine Benyus: Oh really?
A guy named Jeff Brinker has found a way to have a self-assembling coding process.
So, farming based on how a prairie builds soil, ranching based on how a native ungulate herd actually increases the health of the range, even wastewater treatment based on how a marsh not only cleans the water, but creates incredibly sparkling productivity.
Water is going to be our big, grand challenge: quenching thirst.
You know, I've seen that island.
We're done.
(Laughter) Right.
(Applause) Chris Anderson: Talk about foreplay, I -- we need to get to 12, but really quickly.
That means, you know, net fertility farming.
3.8 billion years of field-testing.
JB: OK, put this -- OK, I'll just hold this thing.
10 to 30 -- Craig Venter will probably tell you; I think there's a lot more than 30 million -- well-adapted solutions.
And I'm also thrilled to be in the foreplay section.
That's bioprocessing, you know; that's bio-assisted technology: using an organism to do your wastewater treatment is an old, old technology called "domestication."
I'm going to try to go through 12, really quickly.
And they said, calcium carbonate.
And the reason is that the refrigeration somehow gets broken; what's called the "cold chain" gets broken.
CA: Yeah.
And, oh yes -- we get food, too.
Here's an interesting one for the IT world: bio-silicon.
This is a huge and important one, number 11.
CA: Janine, thank you so much.
