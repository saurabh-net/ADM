Using straw bale construction, creating heat walls.
(Applause) So, disaster hits home.
600 bucks, happened two days ago.
We've changed international response -- based on building things.
And I thought, you know, we thought we were real bright, you know, sparks -- we've come up with this great idea, mobile health clinics widely distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa.
We've changed FEMA guidelines.
We've changed public policy.
We've had over 1,500 volunteers rebuilding, rehabbing homes.
We did an open design competition, like I said.
Two years later we started doing a project on developing mobile health clinics in sub-Saharan Africa, responding to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.
From Brazil to India, Mexico, Alabama, China, Israel, Palestine, Vietnam.
Instigation, developing ideas with communities and NGOs doing open-source design competitions.
This is what the U.N. gave these guys for six months -- 12 plastic tarps.
(Laughter) I'm fed up of talking about making change.
A class, three classrooms and rainwater collection is 5,000 dollars.

This one I love.
With 10 million solutions.
This was a matchmaking thanks to a couple of TEDsters: [unclear] Cheryl Heller and Andrew Zolli, who connected me with this amazing African woman.
So every one of our schools have rain water collection systems, very low cost.
Look left, look right: one of you will be there.
This is a community-designed community center.
That's not because I'm a tree-hugging green person.
And the idea of integrating manufacturers -- fab labs in every country.
