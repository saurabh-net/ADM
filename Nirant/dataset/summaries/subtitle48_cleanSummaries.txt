Because there are some advantages to inorganic systems, like higher speed semiconductors, etc.
You know, high science uses air hockey tables -- (Laughter) -- and if you watch this thing long enough you get dizzy, but what you're actually seeing is copies of that original string emerging from the parts bin that you have here.
So now I'm going to show you the hands-free, autonomous self-replication.
Can we get self-replicating-type behavior?
You know, Cameron Sinclair yesterday said, "How do I get everyone to collaborate on design globally to do housing for humanity?"
You set a couple of boundary conditions, like gravity, the surface tension, density, etc., and then you press "execute," and magically, the universe produces you a perfect ball lens.
And why do you want a 3,000-square-foot kite?
Can we get complex 3D structure automatically assembling in inorganic systems?
So this is actually a 3,000-square-foot kite, which also happens to be a minimal energy surface.
And George Homsey, a great guy, said, "Oh, the future is amazing.
I work with a fabulous illustrator called Nick Dragotta.
And I recently said that to a venture capitalist casually at some Valley event, to which he replied, "How quaint."
So we've got autonomous replication of bit strings.
So, Neil Gershenfeld showed you this video on Wednesday, I believe, but I'll show you again.
These are five-state state machines.
