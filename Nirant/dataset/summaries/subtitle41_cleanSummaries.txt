A little bit more recently, I got involved personally.
We're interested in big displays, bright displays.
(Laughter) And they said, "Oh, well maybe we could become part of your strategic plan."
They're reporting five things: drop of truancy to almost zero; attending parent-teacher meetings -- which nobody did and now almost everybody does -- drop in discipline problems; increase in student participation -- teachers are now saying it's kind of fun to teach; kids are engaged -- they have laptops!
And since I visit each one of those countries within at least every three months, I'm just going around the world every three weeks.
And at some point I'll even pass around what the $100 laptop might be like.
We're interested in perfect color uniformity.
And everybody says -- I say -- it's an education project.
Now people clap, sometimes you even get standing ovations and I say, "What the hell's wrong with you?
Because laptop economics are the following: I say 50 percent here; it's more like 60, 60 percent of the cost of your laptop is sales, marketing, distribution and profit.

The games buttons are missing, but it'll also be a games machine, book machine.
