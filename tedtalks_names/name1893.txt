{"talks":[{"talk":{"id":1893,"event_id":300,"name":"Marco Annunziata: Welcome to the age of the industrial internet","description":"Everyone's talking about the \"Internet of Things,\" but what exactly does that mean for our future? In this thoughtful talk, economist Marco Annunziata looks at how technology is transforming the industrial sector, creating machines that can see, feel, sense and react -- so they can be operated far more efficiently.

It's a future with exciting implications for us all.","slug":"marco_annunziata_welcome_to_the_age_of_the_industrial_internet","native_language_code":"en","published_at":"2013-12-17 15:59:58","recorded_at":"2013-10-30 00:00:00","updated_at":"2015-01-05 20:41:40","released_at":"2014-07-17 16:17:40"}}],"counts":{"this":1,"total":1}}
