{"talks":[{"talk":{"id":1817,"event_id":265,"name":"Jake Barton: The museum of you","description":"A third of the world watched live as the World Trade Center collapsed on September 11, 2001; a third more heard about it within 24 hours. (Do you remember where you were?) So exhibits at the soon-to-open 9\/11 Memorial Museum will reflect the diversity of the world's experiences of that day. In a moving talk, designer Jake Barton gives a peek at some of those installations, as well as several other projects that aim to make the observer an active participant in the exhibit.","slug":"jake_barton_the_museum_of_you","native_language_code":"en","published_at":"2013-09-10 14:59:07","recorded_at":"2013-05-16 00:00:00","updated_at":"2014-09-02 16:41:21","released_at":"2014-09-02 16:41:21"}}],"counts":{"this":1,"total":1}}
