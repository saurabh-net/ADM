{"talks":[{"talk":{"id":1378,"event_id":122,"name":"Bryan Stevenson: We need to talk about an injustice","description":"In an engaging and personal talk -- with cameo appearances from his grandmother and Rosa Parks -- human rights lawyer Bryan Stevenson shares some hard truths about America's justice system, starting with a massive imbalance along racial lines: a third of the country's black male population has been incarcerated at some point in their lives. These issues, which are wrapped up in America's unexamined history, are rarely talked about with this level of candor, insight and persuasiveness.","slug":"bryan_stevenson_we_need_to_talk_about_an_injustice","native_language_code":"en","published_at":"2012-03-05 16:18:50","recorded_at":"2012-03-01 00:00:00","updated_at":"2015-02-24 16:54:10","released_at":"2014-12-01 15:56:14"}}],"counts":{"this":1,"total":1}}
