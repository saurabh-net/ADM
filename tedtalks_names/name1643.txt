{"talks":[{"talk":{"id":1643,"event_id":258,"name":"Sue Austin: Deep sea diving ... in a wheelchair","description":"When Sue Austin got a power chair 16 years ago, she felt a tremendous sense of freedom -- yet others looked at her as though she had lost something. In her art, she aims to convey the spirit of wonder she feels wheeling through the world. Includes thrilling footage of an underwater wheelchair that lets her explore ocean beds, drifting through schools of fish, floating free in 360 degrees.
