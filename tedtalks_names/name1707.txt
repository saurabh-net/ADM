{"talks":[{"talk":{"id":1707,"event_id":181,"name":"Skylar Tibbits: The emergence of \"4D printing\"","description":"3D printing has grown in sophistication since the late 1970s; TED Fellow Skylar Tibbits is shaping the next development, which he calls 4D printing, where the fourth dimension is time.

Think: a printed cube that folds before your eyes, or a printed pipe able to sense the need to expand or contract.
