{"talks":[{"talk":{"id":1774,"event_id":279,"name":"Peter Attia: Is the obesity crisis hiding a bigger problem?","description":"As a young surgeon, Peter Attia felt contempt for a patient with diabetes. She was overweight, he thought, and thus responsible for the fact that she needed a foot amputation.

A look at how assumptions may be leading us to wage the wrong medical war.","slug":"peter_attia_what_if_we_re_wrong_about_diabetes","native_language_code":"en","published_at":"2013-06-25 15:02:42","recorded_at":"2013-04-05 00:00:00","updated_at":"2015-02-07 17:07:10","released_at":"2014-05-25 15:51:48"}}],"counts":{"this":1,"total":1}}
