{"talks":[{"talk":{"id":145,"event_id":6,"name":"Deborah Gordon: The emergent genius of ant colonies","description":"Deborah Gordon studies ant colonies in the Arizona desert to understand their complex social system. She asks: How do these chitinous creatures get down to business -- and even multitask when they need to -- with no language, memory or visible leadership?
