{"talks":[{"talk":{"id":1137,"event_id":64,"name":"Carlo Ratti: Architecture that senses and responds","description":"With his team at SENSEable City Lab, MIT's Carlo Ratti makes cool things by sensing the data we create. He pulls from passive data sets -- like the calls we make, the garbage we throw away -- to create surprising visualizations of city life. And he and his team create dazzling interactive environments from moving water and flying light, powered by simple gestures caught through sensors.","slug":"carlo_ratti_architecture_that_senses_and_responds","native_language_code":"en","published_at":"2011-05-03 14:38:00","recorded_at":"2011-03-02 00:00:00","updated_at":"2014-07-03 20:43:20","released_at":"2014-01-14 23:26:41"}}],"counts":{"this":1,"total":1}}
