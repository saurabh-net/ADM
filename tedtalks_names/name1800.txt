{"talks":[{"talk":{"id":1800,"event_id":181,"name":"Eleanor Longden: The voices in my head","description":"To all appearances, Eleanor Longden was just like every other student, heading to college full of promise and without a care in the world. That was until the voices in her head started talking. Initially innocuous, these internal narrators became increasingly antagonistic and dictatorial, turning her life into a living nightmare. Diagnosed with schizophrenia, hospitalized, drugged, Longden was discarded by a system that didn't know how to help her. Longden tells the moving tale of her years-long journey back to mental health, and makes the case that it was through learning to listen to her voices that she was able to survive.","slug":"eleanor_longden_the_voices_in_my_head","native_language_code":"en","published_at":"2013-08-08 15:00:37","recorded_at":"2013-02-28 00:00:00","updated_at":"2015-02-16 09:57:28","released_at":"2014-07-17 15:55:04"}}],"counts":{"this":1,"total":1}}
