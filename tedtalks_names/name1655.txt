{"talks":[{"talk":{"id":1655,"event_id":318,"name":"Tyler DeWitt: Hey science teachers -- make it fun","description":"High school science teacher Tyler DeWitt was ecstatic about a lesson plan on bacteria (how cool!) -- and devastated when his students hated it.

He delivers a rousing call for science teachers to ditch the jargon and extreme precision, and instead make science sing through stories and demonstrations.
