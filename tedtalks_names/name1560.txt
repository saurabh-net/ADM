{"talks":[{"talk":{"id":1560,"event_id":40,"name":"Scott Fraser: Why eyewitnesses get it wrong","description":"Scott Fraser studies how humans remember crimes -- and bear witness to them. In this powerful talk, which focuses on a deadly shooting at sunset, he suggests that even close-up eyewitnesses to a crime can create \"memories\" they could not have seen. Why? Because the brain abhors a vacuum. Editor's note: In the original version of this talk, Scott Fraser misspoke about available footage of Two World Trade Center (Tower 2). The misstatement has been edited out for clarity.","slug":"scott_fraser_the_problem_with_eyewitness_testimony","native_language_code":"en","published_at":"2012-09-10 14:59:22","recorded_at":"2012-05-04 00:00:00","updated_at":"2015-02-23 14:40:42","released_at":"2014-07-15 20:07:49"}}],"counts":{"this":1,"total":1}}
