{"talks":[{"talk":{"id":1215,"event_id":64,"name":"Skylar Tibbits: Can we make things that make themselves?","description":"MIT researcher Skylar Tibbits works on self-assembly -- the idea that instead of building something (a chair, a skyscraper), we can create materials that build themselves, much the way a strand of DNA zips itself together. It's a big concept at early stages; Tibbits shows us three in-the-lab projects that hint at what a self-assembling future might look like.","slug":"skylar_tibbits_can_we_make_things_that_make_themselves","native_language_code":"en","published_at":"2011-09-01 15:29:02","recorded_at":"2011-02-24 00:00:00","updated_at":"2015-02-16 14:21:54","released_at":"2014-07-15 15:49:59"}}],"counts":{"this":1,"total":1}}
