{"talks":[{"talk":{"id":1854,"event_id":241,"name":"Xavier Vilalta: Architecture at home in its community","description":"When TED Fellow Xavier Vilalta was commissioned to create a multistory shopping mall in Addis Ababa, he panicked. Other centers represented everything he hated about contemporary architecture: wasteful, glass towers requiring tons of energy whose design had absolutely nothing to do with Africa. In this charming talk, Vilalta shows how he champions an alternative approach: to harness nature, reference design tradition and create beautiful, modern, iconic buildings fit for a community.","slug":"xavier_vilalta_architecture_at_home_in_its_community","native_language_code":"en","published_at":"2013-10-25 15:00:08","recorded_at":"2013-06-11 00:00:00","updated_at":"2014-10-01 12:35:51","released_at":"2014-08-07 18:16:51"}}],"counts":{"this":1,"total":1}}
