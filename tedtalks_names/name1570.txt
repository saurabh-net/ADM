{"talks":[{"talk":{"id":1570,"event_id":141,"name":"Shimon Schocken: The self-organizing computer course","description":"Shimon Schocken and Noam Nisan developed a curriculum for their students to build a computer, piece by piece. When they put the course online -- giving away the tools, simulators, chip specifications and other building blocks -- they were surprised that thousands jumped at the opportunity to learn, working independently as well as organizing their own classes in the first Massive Open Online Course (MOOC).
