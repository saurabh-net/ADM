{"talks":[{"talk":{"id":1912,"event_id":314,"name":"Joe Kowan: How I beat stage fright","description":"Humanity's fine-tuned sense of fear served us well as a young species, giving us laser focus to avoid being eaten by competing beasts. But it's less wonderful when that same visceral, body-hijacking sense of fear kicks in in front of 20 folk-music fans at a Tuesday night open-mic.
