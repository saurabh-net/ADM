{"talks":[{"talk":{"id":1642,"event_id":184,"name":"Jonathan Haidt: How common threats can make common (political) ground","description":"If an asteroid were headed for Earth, we'd all band together and figure out how to stop it, just like in the movies, right? And yet, when faced with major, data-supported, end-of-the-world problems in real life, too often we retreat into partisan shouting and stalemate. Jonathan Haidt shows us a few of the very real asteroids headed our way -- some pet causes of the left wing, some of the right -- and suggests how both wings could work together productively to benefit humanity as a whole.","slug":"jonathan_haidt_how_common_threats_can_make_common_political_ground","native_language_code":"en","published_at":"2013-01-07 16:07:12","recorded_at":"2012-12-19 00:00:00","updated_at":"2014-07-03 20:43:55","released_at":"2014-04-21 17:16:00"}}],"counts":{"this":1,"total":1}}
