{"talks":[{"talk":{"id":1816,"event_id":241,"name":"George Monbiot: For more wonder, rewild the world","description":"Wolves were once native to the US' Yellowstone National Park -- until hunting wiped them out. But when, in 1995, the wolves began to come back (thanks to an aggressive management program), something interesting happened: the rest of the park began to find a new, more healthful balance. In a bold thought experiment, George Monbiot imagines a wilder world in which humans work to restore the complex, lost natural food chains that once surrounded us.","slug":"george_monbiot_for_more_wonder_rewild_the_world","native_language_code":"en","published_at":"2013-09-09 15:14:58","recorded_at":"2013-07-08 00:00:00","updated_at":"2014-07-03 20:44:09","released_at":"2013-09-16 18:48:26"}}],"counts":{"this":1,"total":1}}
