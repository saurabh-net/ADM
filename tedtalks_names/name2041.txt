Become a \"now-ist\"","description":"\u201cRemember before the internet?\u201d asks Joi Ito. \u201cRemember when people used to try to predict the future?\u201d In this engaging talk, the head of the MIT Media Lab skips the future predictions and instead shares a new approach to creating in the moment: building quickly and improving constantly, without waiting for permission or for proof that you have the right idea. This kind of bottom-up innovation is seen in the most fascinating, futuristic projects emerging today, and it starts, he says, with being open and alert to what\u2019s going on around you right now. Don\u2019t be a futurist, he suggests: be a now-ist.
