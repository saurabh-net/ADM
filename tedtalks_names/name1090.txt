He shows the power of interactive exercises, and calls for teachers to consider flipping the traditional classroom script -- give students video lectures to watch at home, and do \"homework\" in the classroom with the teacher available to help.","slug":"salman_khan_let_s_use_video_to_reinvent_education","native_language_code":"en","published_at":"2011-03-09 14:46:00","recorded_at":"2011-03-02 00:00:00","updated_at":"2014-08-16 15:50:49","released_at":"2014-02-20 22:44:40"}}],"counts":{"this":1,"total":1}}
