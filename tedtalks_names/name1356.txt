So she asked scientist Tyrone Hayes to brief her on one he studied closely: atrazine, a herbicide used on corn. (Hayes, an expert on amphibians, is a critic of atrazine, which displays a disturbing effect on frog development.) Onstage together at TEDWomen, Hayes and Chaffer tell their story.","slug":"tyrone_hayes_penelope_jagessar_chaffer_the_toxic_baby","native_language_code":"en","published_at":"2012-02-13 16:31:48","recorded_at":"2010-12-02 00:00:00","updated_at":"2014-07-03 20:43:35","released_at":"2014-01-06 22:35:08"}}],"counts":{"this":1,"total":1}}
