{"talks":[{"talk":{"id":1152,"event_id":64,"name":"Aaron Koblin: Visualizing ourselves ... with crowd-sourced data","description":"Artist Aaron Koblin takes vast amounts of data -- and at times vast numbers of people -- and weaves them into stunning visualizations. From elegant lines tracing airline flights to landscapes of cell phone data, from a Johnny Cash video assembled from crowd-sourced drawings to the \"Wilderness Downtown\" video that customizes for the user, his works brilliantly explore how modern technology can make us more human.","slug":"aaron_koblin","native_language_code":"en","published_at":"2011-05-23 01:00:00","recorded_at":"2011-03-02 00:00:00","updated_at":"2014-07-03 20:43:21","released_at":"2013-11-08 19:54:43"}}],"counts":{"this":1,"total":1}}
