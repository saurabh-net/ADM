{"talks":[{"talk":{"id":1799,"event_id":279,"name":"Eli Beer: The fastest ambulance? A motorcycle","description":"As a young EMT on a Jerusalem ambulance, Eli Beer realized that, stuck in brutal urban traffic, they often arrived too late to help. So he organized a group of volunteer EMTs -- many on foot -- ready to drop everything and dash to save lives in their neighborhood. Today, United Hatzlah uses a smartphone app and a fleet of \u201cambucycles\u201d to help nearby patients until an ambulance arrives. With an average response time of 3 minutes, last year, they treated 207,000 people in Israel. And the idea is going global.","slug":"eli_beer_the_fastest_ambulance_a_motorcycle","native_language_code":"en","published_at":"2013-07-30 15:03:01","recorded_at":"2013-04-16 00:00:00","updated_at":"2015-02-02 23:16:06","released_at":"2013-07-30 15:03:01"}}],"counts":{"this":1,"total":1}}
