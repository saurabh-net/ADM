In a riveting demonstration, Boaz Almog shows how a phenomenon known as quantum locking allows a superconductor disk to float over a magnetic rail -- completely frictionlessly and with zero energy loss. <i>Experiment: Prof. Guy Deutscher, Mishael Azoulay, Boaz Almog, of the High Tc Superconductivity Group, School of Physics and Astronomy, Tel Aviv University.<\/i>","slug":"boaz_almog_levitates_a_superconductor","native_language_code":"en","published_at":"2012-07-02 15:25:39","recorded_at":"2012-06-30 00:00:00","updated_at":"2014-07-03 20:43:46","released_at":"2014-05-14 19:09:34"}}],"counts":{"this":1,"total":1}}
