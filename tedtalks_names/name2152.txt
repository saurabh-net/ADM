When Khalida Brohi lost a close friend to the practice, she resolved to campaign against it. Yet she met resistance from an unlikely source: the very community she hoped to protect. In this powerful, honest talk, Brohi shares how she took a hard look at her own process, and offers sharp insights for other passionate activists.","slug":"khalida_brohi_how_i_work_to_protect_women_from_honor_killings","native_language_code":"en","published_at":"2015-02-24 15:58:06","recorded_at":"2014-10-15 00:00:00","updated_at":"2015-02-27 14:15:00","released_at":"2015-02-24 15:58:06"}}],"counts":{"this":1,"total":1}}
