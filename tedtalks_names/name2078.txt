The two are developing the Lowline, an underground greenspace the size of a football field. They're building it in a trolley terminal abandoned in 1948, using technology that harvests sunlight above-ground and directs it down below. It's a park that can thrive, even in winter.","slug":"dan_barasch_a_park_underneath_the_hustle_and_bustle_of_new_york_city","native_language_code":"en","published_at":"2014-09-10 14:55:40","recorded_at":"2014-07-09 00:00:00","updated_at":"2015-02-28 23:10:57","released_at":"2014-12-16 16:42:49"}}],"counts":{"this":1,"total":1}}
