Boone Pickens points out onstage, the country has no energy policy to prepare for the inevitable. Is alternative energy our bridge to an oil-free future? After losing $150 million investing in wind energy, Pickens suggests it isn't, not yet. What might get us there? Natural gas. After the talk, watch for a lively Q&A with TED Curator Chris Anderson.","slug":"t_boone_pickens_let_s_transform_energy_with_natural_gas","native_language_code":"en","published_at":"2012-03-19 15:43:42","recorded_at":"2012-03-01 00:00:00","updated_at":"2014-07-03 20:43:38","released_at":"2014-01-14 22:23:11"}}],"counts":{"this":1,"total":1}}
